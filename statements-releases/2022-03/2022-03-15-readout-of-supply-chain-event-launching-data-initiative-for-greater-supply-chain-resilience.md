title: Readout of Supply Chain Event Launching Data Initiative for Greater Supply
  Chain Resilience
---
 
Today, Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese and
Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg met with key stakeholders in
the country’s goods movement supply chain to launch a new initiative
that will help to speed up the movement of goods, reducing delays and
costs for American consumers.  

NEC and DOT leaders discussed with port directors and business leaders
the value of the new initiative. Freight Logistics Optimization Works
(FLOW), an information sharing initiative to pilot key freight
information exchange between parts of the supply chain. This commitment
to moving the transportation logistics system to 21<sup>st</sup> century
digitization follows the commitment to move toward 24/7 operations many
made last fall.

Participants discussed the progress made to date in working
collaboratively across private sector stakeholders and with federal and
state governments to address supply chain bottlenecks at ports including
the decline in long-term dwelling containers (by 60% at the Ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach since November), a reduction in empty containers
(by more than 30% at the Port of Los Angeles since the beginning of the
year), and the creation of pop-up sites for containers around the Port
of Savannah. In particular, participants discussed the success of pop-up
sites at restoring fluidity over the past year and how they will be
needed in the future.

They underscored the value of greater data transparency across the
supply chain and how this would benefit not only their respective
companies but also the system more broadly, cutting waste and reducing
costs for consumers. Participants acknowledged the current system is
underperforming and needs greater investment and more collaboration in
creating ship to shelf visibility into the primarily private-sector
owned supply chain. A more reliable, predictable, and accurate
information exchange about goods movement is the hallmark of a globally
competitive 21<sup>st</sup> century goods movement chain and is
especially important for small- and medium-sized businesses who lack
visibility into the current system. Participants highlighted that this
type of digital infrastructure was more important than ever in the face
of supply chain disruptions caused by global events like the pandemic
and Russia’s unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.
