title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Unemployment Insurance\_Claims"
---
 
Americans are getting back to work at a historic pace, with fewer
Americans on unemployment insurance today than at any time in the last
half century. This morning, we received news that the number of
Americans on unemployment insurance fell to its lowest level since 1970
and the number of Americans filing new claims fell to its lowest
one-week level since 1969. This historic progress is no accident: it’s
the result of an economic strategy to grow the economy from the bottom
up and middle out, starting with the American Rescue Plan. And, it’s the
result of effective management of emergency pandemic resources that
resulted in 75% of adult Americans vaccinated and 99% of schools
re-opened.  We have more work to do to cut costs for families, but
today’s data are a reminder that the U.S. economy is uniquely well
positioned to deal with the global challenge of inflation. We will
continue the fight to lower costs with every tool at our disposal, from
making more here in America and rebuilding our supply chains, to
lowering costs that have held back Americans for decades, to promoting
competition to ensure markets can operate effectively and consumers are
protected.
