title: Statement by Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the Senate Vote to Move Forward the
  Bipartisan Innovation Act
---
 
The Senate took another step forward today in delivering on the
President’s vision to strengthen our supply chains, make more in
America, and outcompete China and the rest of the world for decades to
come. We look forward to the House of Representatives moving quickly to
start the formal conference process as well.

Today’s vote demonstrates there is clear bipartisan support for the
sorts of investments the President has long championed — like boosting
domestic manufacturing, supporting our innovators and helping them take
their ideas from the lab to the factory floor, as well as addressing
supply chain bottlenecks like semiconductors that are raising prices on
the middle class. The events of the last two years, including the
pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, have
underscored just how important it is to our economic and national
security to make more of these critical components here in America.

We’ve made remarkable progress over the last year in rebuilding our
industrial base, including by creating more manufacturing jobs last year
than in any year in almost three decades, and by making a historic and
long-overdue investment in our nation’s infrastructure. Competitiveness
legislation like the Bipartisan Innovation Act is our chance to build on
that success and create good-paying jobs, make more in America, and
lower prices for working families.
