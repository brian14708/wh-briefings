title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019s Calls with European Leaders"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris today had five separate calls with European
leaders from NATO’s eastern flank to discuss our collective response to
Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

The Vice President spoke individually with: Prime Minister Kaja Kallas
of Estonia; Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins of Latvia; Prime Minister
Ingrida Simonyte of Lithuania; Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of
Poland; and Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca of Romania.

Throughout each of the calls, the Vice President underscored the
strength and unity of our Alliance and welcomed each of her
counterparts’ leadership and coordination on robust response measures,
including sanctions and other economic measures through the European
Union. They also discussed the robust NATO response. Following the
February 25 extraordinary NATO summit, the Vice President and the
European leaders reviewed recent and upcoming U.S. and NATO force
posture adjustments in Europe, including the deployment of thousands of
U.S. troops and critical capabilities to reinforce our deterrence
posture and collective defense. In each call, the Vice President
reaffirmed our ironclad commitment to NATO’s Article 5.

The Vice President also reiterated our ongoing support for the people of
the Ukraine, including through economic, security, and humanitarian
assistance, and commended each Ally’s assistance to Ukraine. The Vice
President noted that we will continue to support Ukraine and Ukraine’s
neighbors as they deal with refugee flows and other humanitarian needs.
She welcomed steps already taken to offer refuge to those fleeing
violence.

Lastly, the Vice President reaffirmed U.S. support for the international
rules and norms that have brought peace and security in Europe since
World War II and that have served as the foundation of the NATO
Alliance. She noted that we will be steadfast and united with our Allies
in defense of these principles.
