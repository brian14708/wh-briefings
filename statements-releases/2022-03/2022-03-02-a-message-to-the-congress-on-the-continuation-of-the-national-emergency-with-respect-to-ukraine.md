  \ Respect to\_Ukraine"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of
March 6, 2014, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661 of
March 16, 2014, Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 2014, and Executive
Order 14065 of February 21, 2022, and under which additional steps were
taken in Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014 and Executive Order
13849 of September 20, 2018, is to continue in effect beyond March 6,
2022.   
  
The actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes
and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability,
sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the
misappropriation of its assets, as well as the actions and policies of
the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported
annexation of Crimea, its use of force in Ukraine, and its purported
recognition of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic or Luhansk
People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 with
respect to Ukraine.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    March 2, 2022.
