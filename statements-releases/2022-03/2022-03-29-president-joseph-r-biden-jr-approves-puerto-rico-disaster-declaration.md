Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and ordered Federal aid to
supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected
by a severe storm, flooding, and landslides from February 4 to February

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the municipalities of Cataño, Dorado, Toa Baja, Vega
Alta, and Vega Baja.  
   
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Federal funding also is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the entire commonwealth.  
   
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Robert Little III as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   
   
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more areas and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.  
   
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance tomorrow by registering online
