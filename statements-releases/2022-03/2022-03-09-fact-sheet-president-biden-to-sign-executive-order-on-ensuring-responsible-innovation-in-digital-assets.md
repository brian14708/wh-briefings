*Outlines First Whole-of-Government Strategy to Protect Consumers,
Financial Stability, National Security, and Address Climate Risks*

Digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, have seen explosive growth
in recent years, surpassing a [$3
trillion](https://time.com/6115300/cryptocurrency-value-3-trillion/)
market cap last November and up from $14 billion just five years prior.
Surveys suggest that around 16 percent of adult Americans –
approximately 40 million people – have invested in, traded, or used
cryptocurrencies. Over 100 countries are exploring or piloting Central
Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a digital form of a country’s sovereign
currency.  
  
The rise in digital assets creates an opportunity to reinforce American
leadership in the global financial system and at the technological
frontier, but also has substantial implications for consumer protection,
financial stability, national security, and climate risk. The United
States must maintain technological leadership in this rapidly growing
space, supporting innovation while mitigating the risks for consumers,
businesses, the broader financial system, and the climate. And, it must
play a leading role in international engagement and global governance of
digital assets consistent with democratic values and U.S. global
competitiveness.  
  
That is why today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order
outlining the first ever, whole-of-government approach to addressing the
risks and harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their
underlying technology. The Order lays out a national policy for digital
assets across six key priorities: consumer and investor protection;
financial stability; illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global
financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion; and
responsible innovation.

Specifically, the Executive Order calls for measures to:

-   **Protect U.S. Consumers, Investors, and Businesses** by directing
    the Department of the Treasury and other agency partners to assess
    and develop policy recommendations to address the implications of
    the growing digital asset sector and changes in financial markets
    for consumers, investors, businesses, and equitable economic growth.
    The Order also encourages regulators to ensure sufficient oversight
    and safeguard against any systemic financial risks posed by digital
    assets.  
-   **Protect U.S. and Global Financial Stability and Mitigate Systemic
    Risk** by encouraging the Financial Stability Oversight Council to
    identify and mitigate economy-wide (i.e., systemic) financial risks
    posed by digital assets and to develop appropriate policy
    recommendations to address any regulatory gaps.  
-   **Mitigate the Illicit Finance and National Security Risks Posed by
    the Illicit Use of Digital Assets** by directing an unprecedented
    focus of coordinated action across all relevant U.S. Government
    agencies to mitigate these risks. It also directs agencies to work
    with our allies and partners to ensure international frameworks,
    capabilities, and partnerships are aligned and responsive to
    risks.  
-   **Promote U.S. Leadership in Technology and Economic Competitiveness
    to Reinforce U.S. Leadership in the Global Financial System** by
    directing the Department of Commerce to work across the U.S.
    Government in establishing a framework to drive U.S. competitiveness
    and leadership in, and leveraging of digital asset technologies.
    This framework will serve as a foundation for agencies and integrate
    this as a priority into their policy, research and development, and
    operational approaches to digital assets.  
-   **Promote Equitable Access to Safe and Affordable Financial
    Services** by affirming the critical need for safe, affordable, and
    accessible financial services as a U.S. national interest that must
    inform our approach to digital asset innovation, including disparate
    impact risk. Such safe access is especially important for
    communities that have long had insufficient access to financial
    services.  The Secretary of the Treasury, working with all relevant
    agencies, will produce a report on the future of money and payment
    systems, to include implications for economic growth, financial
    growth and inclusion, national security, and the extent to which
    technological innovation may influence that future.  
-   **Support Technological Advances and Ensure Responsible Development
    and Use of Digital Assets** by directing the U.S. Government to take
    concrete steps to study and support technological advances in the
    responsible development, design, and implementation of digital asset
    systems while prioritizing privacy, security, combating illicit
    exploitation, and reducing negative climate impacts.  
-   **Explore a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)** by placing
    urgency on research and development of a potential United States
    CBDC, should issuance be deemed in the national interest. The Order
    directs the U.S. Government to assess the technological
    infrastructure and capacity needs for a potential U.S. CBDC in a
    manner that protects Americans’ interests. The Order also encourages
    the Federal Reserve to continue its research, development, and
    assessment efforts for a U.S. CBDC, including development of a plan
    for broader U.S. Government action in support of their work. This
    effort prioritizes U.S. participation in multi-country
    experimentation, and ensures U.S. leadership internationally to
    promote CBDC development that is consistent with U.S. priorities and
    democratic values.

The Administration will continue work across agencies and with Congress
to establish policies that guard against risks and guide responsible
innovation, with our allies and partners to develop aligned
international capabilities that respond to national security risks, and
with the private sector to study and support technological advances in
digital assets.
