Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is pleased to announce public
tours of the White House will begin on Friday, April 15, 2022.  Public
tours will initially be available from 8:00 AM to 12:30 PM on Fridays
and Saturdays, excluding Federal holidays or unless otherwise noted. All
White House tours are free of charge. The White House tour schedule is
subject to change based on inclement weather or official use.

**PUBLIC WHITE HOUSE TOUR REQUESTS**

Public tour requests are scheduled on a first come, first served basis
and must be submitted through a Member of Congress and their
Congressional Tour Coordinator. Constituents may reach your Member of
Congress and Congressional Tour Coordinator through the U.S. House of
Representative’s Switchboard at 202-225-3121, the U.S. Senate
Switchboard at 202-224-3121, or online at
[www.congress.gov/members](http://www.congress.gov/members).

Consistent with prior practices, public White House tour requests must
be submitted a minimum of 21 days in advance and no more than 90 days in
advance of the requested tour date(s). Reservations cannot be accepted
for tour dates outside this 21 – 90-day window. Congressional Tour
Coordinators will be able to submit tour requests beginning Monday,
March 21, 2022. 

The White House will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation
with guidance based on recommendations from the CDC, and other public
health officials and medical experts, and reserves the right to adjust
availability of the public tours as necessary to adhere to the latest
health guidance. Within the 10 days prior to the public tour, anyone who
has tested positive for COVID-19, has had any COVID-19 symptoms, or been
in close contact with someone confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19,
should stay home. Face masks will be available when entering the White
House complex for those who choose to wear them.

*Information regarding additional springtime events at the White House,
including the Spring Garden Tours and the White House Easter Egg Roll,
will be released in the coming days. *
