title: Message to the Congress on Prohibiting Certain Imports and New Investments
  With Respect to Continued Russian Federation Efforts to Undermine the Sovereignty
  and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine.
---
 
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et
seq*.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I report that I
have issued an Executive Order finding that the Russian Federation’s
unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and unconscionable war against
Ukraine, including its recent further invasion in violation of
international law, including the United Nations Charter, further
threatens the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity
of Ukraine, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 

As a result, I have prohibited the following:  (i) the importation into
the United States of the following products of Russian Federation
origin:  crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of
their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products; (ii)
new investment in the energy sector in the Russian Federation by a
United States person, wherever located; and (iii) any approval,
financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person,
wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the
transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this section
if performed by a United States person or within the United States.

     I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    March 8, 2022.
