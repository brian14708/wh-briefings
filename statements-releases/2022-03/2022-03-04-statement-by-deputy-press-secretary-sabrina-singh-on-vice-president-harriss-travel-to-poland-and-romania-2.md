Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Warsaw, Poland and
Bucharest, Romania March 9-11. Her visit will demonstrate the strength
and unity of the NATO Alliance and U.S. support for NATO’s eastern flank
allies in the face of Russian aggression. It will also highlight our
collective efforts to support the people of Ukraine.  
   
During her meetings with the leaders of Poland and Romania, the Vice
President will advance our close coordination in response to Russia’s
unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. They will discuss our
continuing support for the people of Ukraine through security, economic,
and humanitarian assistance and our determination to impose severe
economic consequences on Russia and those complicit in Russia’s
invasion. The Vice President’s meetings will also focus on how the
United States can further support Ukraine’s neighbors as they welcome
and care for refugees fleeing violence.  
   
More details on the Vice President’s engagements will be forthcoming in
the coming days.
