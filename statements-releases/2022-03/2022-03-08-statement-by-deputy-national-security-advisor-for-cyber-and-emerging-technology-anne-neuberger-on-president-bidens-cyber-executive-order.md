The President’s Executive Order, *[Improving the Nation’s
Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/)*,
charted a new course for nation’s cybersecurity. And, we have begun
implementation of one of the most important components of the Executive
Order. As of yesterday, every company that sells software to the
government must have a rigorous software security program in place. The
requirement covers traditional commercial on-premise software, software
provided as a service, as well as any included open source software
components.

We know Americans are concerned about cybersecurity – we’ve seen the
cost of ransomware attacks to businesses of all sizes and the disruption
it has caused to critical services in countries around the world. And we
know that a foundational part of building cyber resilience is building
in security throughout the lifecycle of a product, from the initial
design phase through deployment. We buy a car with pre-installed
seatbelts and airbags. We should be able to buy software with security
baked in. With the implementation of this component of the Executive
Order, the federal government is leveraging its procurement power to
improve the security of the software that we all use – including
software we install in some of our nation’s most critical
infrastructure. 

We thank NIST and our private sector partners for their collaboration to
develop the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) which NIST
published last month. The SSDF contains a set of practices that create
the foundation for developing secure software, which every company that
sells software to the government must now follow. We also thank OMB for
working with the private sector over the next 60 days to outline
guidance for how companies will attest their compliance with the SSDF,
as they sell software to the United States Government.
