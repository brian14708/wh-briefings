*Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Release of Plan During White
House Event with Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, White House Domestic Policy
Advisor Susan Rice, and Americans Impacted by Bias in the Appraisal
Process*

On June 1, 2021—the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre—President
Biden announced the creation of the Interagency Task Force on Property
Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) to develop a transformative set of
actions to root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations. Today,
the Task Force is releasing the [PAVE Action
Plan](https://pave.hud.gov/) which, when enacted, represents the most
wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the
home appraisal process. The Task Force is co-chaired by U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Domestic
Policy Advisor Susan Rice.

A home appraisal is a critical element of the homebuying and lending
process, intended to provide an independent, fair, and objective
estimate of the market value of a property so that lenders can
accurately evaluate risk.  Homeownership is the primary contributor to
wealth building for Black and brown households and continues to hold
promise for building multigenerational wealth and housing stability for
households of color. But, bias in home valuations limits the ability of
Black and brown families to enjoy the financial returns associated with
homeownership, thereby contributing to the already sprawling racial
wealth gap. Today, the median white family holds eight times the wealth
of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical
Latino family. According to a recent
[study](http://racialwealthaudit.org/downloads/RacialWealthGap.pdf),
eliminating racial disparities in the amount of wealth families gain
from owning a home would narrow the wealth gap by an additional 16
percent between Black and white households and by an additional 41
percent between Latino and white households.

Just since the Task Force was launched, there have been numerous reports
of Black homeowners receiving higher appraisals only after taking down
family photos and having white families represent them in their stead.
 New research shows that mis-valuation in communities of color can be
widespread. A recent report from [Freddie
Mac](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20210920-home-appraisals)
found that appraisals for home purchases in majority-Black and
majority-Latino neighborhoods were roughly twice as likely to result in
a value below the actual contract price (the amount a buyer is willing
to pay for the property), compared to appraisals in predominantly white
neighborhoods. Similarly, a recent study from [Fannie
Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/publications/appraising-the-appraisal)
examining refinance transactions found that white-owned homes are much
more likely than Black-owned homes to be appraised at values that exceed
algorithmic predictions.

**PAVE Action Plan**

The Action Plan details a set of commitments and actions, most of which
can be taken using existing federal authorities, that will help every
American to have a chance to build generational wealth through
homeownership. You can read the full action plan at PAVE.HUD.gov.

Member agencies will take the following actions: 

-   **Make the appraisal industry more accountable.** The Action Plan
    lays out steps to enhance oversight and accountability of the
    appraisal industry, which has long operated in a relatively closed
    and self-regulated framework and has not been effective at
    addressing deep-rooted inequities. Specifically, it commits federal
    agencies to create a legislative proposal to modernize the
    governance structure of the appraisal industry, and improves
    coordination and collaboration between federal enforcement agencies
    to better identify and redress discrimination in appraisals.
-   **Empower consumers with information and assistance.** The Action
    Plan includes concrete efforts to empower homeowners and homebuyers
    on effective steps they can take when they receive a valuation that
    is lower than expected. For example, federal agencies commit to
    issue guidance and implement new policies to improve the process by
    which a valuation may be reconsidered.
-   **Prevent algorithmic bias in home valuation.** Federal agencies
    that regulate mortgage financing commit to including a
    nondiscrimination quality control standard as part of a forthcoming
    proposed rule establishing quality control standards on AVMs
    (Automated Valuation Models). This will ensure AVMs do not rely upon
    biased data that could replicate past discrimination.
-   **Cultivate an appraiser profession that is well-trained and looks
    like the communities it serves.** According to the Department of
    Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the appraiser/assessor
    profession is roughly 97 percent white, making it one of the least
    diverse professions in the country. The Action Plan lays out a
    series of actions to remove unnecessary educational and experience
    requirements that make it difficult for underrepresented groups to
    access the profession and to strengthen anti-bias, fair housing, and
    fair lending training of existing appraisers.
-   **Leverage federal data and expertise to inform policy, practice,
    and research on appraisal bias.** The Action Plan proposes the
    development of an aggregated database of federal appraisal data to
    better study, understand, and address appraisal bias, complemented
    by a working group composed of subject matter experts from
    stakeholder agencies to develop a research agenda on appraisal bias.

The PAVE Task Force has already made significant progress, and its
commitment is ongoing. The Task Force identified several additional
policy initiatives that may have the potential to make a significant
difference in ensuring fair and accurate home valuations for all
communities. These policy ideas require in-depth evaluation and
research, greater input from stakeholders, and further exploration. The
Task Force is committed to doing this work. As the Task Force
transitions into the next phase of its work to advance equity in home
appraisals, it will continue seeking opportunities to collaborate with
lending institutions, philanthropy groups, academia, civil rights
groups, advocates, and industry associations to create a coordinated
approach in tackling this issue.

Force, you can visit PAVE.hud.gov.
