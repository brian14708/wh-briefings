On Monday, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and officials from
the National Security Council and State Department will be in Rome.
Sullivan will meet with Chinese Communist Party Politburo Member and
Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission Yang Jiechi as
part of our ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication
between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The
two sides will discuss ongoing efforts to manage the competition between
our two countries and discuss the impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine
on regional and global security. Sullivan will also meet with Luigi
Mattiolo, Diplomatic Advisor to the Italian Prime Minister to continue
coordinating a strong, united international response to President
Putin’s war of choice.
