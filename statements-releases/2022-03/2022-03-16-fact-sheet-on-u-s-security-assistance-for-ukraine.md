title: Fact Sheet on U.S. Security Assistance for Ukraine
---
 
President Biden today announced an additional $800 million in security
assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance
committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of
$2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration. The assistance
will take the form of direct transfers of equipment from the Department
of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them defend their country
against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.  
  
The new $800 million assistance package includes:

-   800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;
-   2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4
    anti-armor systems;
-   100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems;
-   100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine
    guns, and 400 shotguns;
-   Over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher
    and mortar rounds;
-   25,000 sets of body armor; and
-   25,000 helmets.

In addition to the weapons listed above, previous United States
assistance committed to Ukraine includes:

-   Over 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;
-   Approximately 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems;
-   Five Mi-17 helicopters;
-   Three patrol boats;
-   Four counter-artillery and counter-unmanned aerial system tracking
    radars;
-   Four counter-mortar radar systems;
-   200 grenade launchers and ammunition;
-   200 shotguns and 200 machine guns;
-   Nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and over 1 million
    grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds;
-   70 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and other
    vehicles;
-   Secure communications, electronic warfare detection systems, body
    armor, helmets, and other tactical gear;
-   Military medical equipment to support treatment and combat
    evacuation;
-   Explosive ordnance disposal and demining equipment; and
-   Satellite imagery and analysis capability.

In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the
Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also
identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional,
longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as
well as additional munitions for those systems.

The United States continues to expedite the authorization and
facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our Allies. At
least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since
the Russian invasion began. In 2022, the Department of State authorized
third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14
countries, a number that continues to grow as Allies and Partners
increase support to Ukraine.
