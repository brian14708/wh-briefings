title: Statement by President Biden on the February Jobs Report
---
 
Today’s report shows that my plan to build an economy from the bottom up
and the middle out is working to get America back to work. Since I took
office, the economy has created 7.4 million jobs. That’s 7.4 million
jobs providing families with dignity and a little more breathing room.
We are building a better America.  
  
In February, the economy created 678,000 jobs, following the greatest
year of job growth in American history and the fastest economic growth
in almost 40 years. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.8 percent.
And, at the same time, more people are rejoining the labor force and
finding jobs as we recover from the pandemic. And people went back to
work in February across a wide ranges of industries—with jobs gained in
leisure and hospitality, construction, retail, and manufacturing. In
fact, last year has been the best year for manufacturing jobs and
trucking jobs since 1994. We are making more and moving goods faster in
America.  
  
This progress is the result of the new economic approach I talked about
in the State of the Union—grow the economy from the bottom up and middle
out. And it’s a result of our success combatting COVID-19 and moving
forward safely. While we must tackle head on the challenge families are
facing with rising costs, today’s report underscores that the United
States is uniquely well positioned to deal with the challenge that
inflation has posed across the world as we recover from the pandemic.
