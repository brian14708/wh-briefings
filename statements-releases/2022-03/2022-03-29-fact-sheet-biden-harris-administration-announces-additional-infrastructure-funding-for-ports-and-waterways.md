*U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Invests $2.7 Billion from President’s
Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to Strengthen Port and Waterway
Supply Chains and Climate Resilience*  
   
*Department of the Interior Invests $1.7 billion in Rural Infrastructure
for FY 2023*

Recognizing the vital role of modern, resilient infrastructure in
reducing costs for American families and businesses, President Biden
secured unprecedented investments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law to improve the country’s ports and waterways – critical links in our
supply chains. President Biden’s infrastructure law provides the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers investments to modernize ports and waterways
after decades of neglect. The funding will not only make them more
resilient to climate change impacts, but strengthens supply chains,
keeps goods moving through the economy, and enables the U.S. to
compete.  
  
**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that it will
invest more than $2.7 billion in funding to \[300\] Army Corps projects
through the country focused on strengthening ports and waterways.** The
announcement follows the Biden Administration providing $14 billion from
President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other appropriations to
strengthen port and waterway supply chains and bolster climate
resilience earlier this year. With today’s announcement, the Biden
Administration will have invested a total of nearly $17 billion in new
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding and other supplemental
appropriations in fiscal year 2022 and 2023 for over 800 projects across
55 states and territories.  
  
These key projects will strengthen the nation’s supply chain, provide
significant new economic opportunities nationwide, and bolster our
defenses against climate change, including investments for:

-   The **Upper Ohio River, Pennsylvania** to construct new lock
    chambers at Emsworth Locks and Dams that will allow large cargo
    ships to reliably and efficiently pass through the upper Ohio River
    system, relieving landside congestion and facilitating timely
    delivery of goods.  
-   The **McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS)**
    which moves 12 million tons of agricultural commodities annually in
    commodities to American farmers and provides flood control to many
    communities in Arkansas and Oklahoma along the Mississippi River.  
-   **Adams and Denver, Colorado** for reducing flood risk and an
    aquatic ecosystem restoration project, which will serve
    disadvantaged communities surrounding the area.  
-   A project in the **City of Watsonville, Town of Pajaro, California**
    and surrounding agricultural lands which have been subject to a long
    history of flooding.

Additionally, today, the Department of the Interior announced Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funding allocations by the Bureau of Reclamation for
nearly $1.7 billion in rural infrastructure funding for FY 2023. The
plan represents a blueprint for how Reclamation is investing in
communities to address drought across the West, as well as greater water
infrastructure throughout the country. The Infrastructure Law’s second
year funding will be allocated to a number of priorities including:

-   $649 million for the Aging Infrastructure Account for major repairs
    and rehabilitation of facilities;  
-   $248 million for rural water projects that benefit various Tribal
    and non-Tribal underserved communities by increasing access to
    potable water;  
-   $95 million for construction of water storage, groundwater storage
    and conveyance project infrastructure; and  
-   $85 million for the St. Mary Canal diversion and headworks
    replacement project, which  will include a large fish bypass
    structure.

The investments announced today further advance the President’s
Justice40 Initiative commitment to ensure that 40 percent of the overall
benefits of certain Federal investments, including in the areas of
climate change and critical clean water and wastewater infrastructure,
flow to historically marginalized, underserved, and overburdened
communities to build their economies and reduce their disproportionate
environmental burden. The investments also underscore how President
Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is [delivering

to communities across America, advancing racial equity, combatting
climate change, and creating job opportunities for American workers.  
  
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will initiate projects in fiscal years
2022 and 2023 that:  
**  
STRENGTHEN DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAINS   
**  
American ports and waterways are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy.
According to the 2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure Report
issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018,
America’s ports supported more than 30 million jobs and approximately
26% of our nation’s GDP. However, decades of neglect and underinvestment
have strained their capacity and jeopardized supply chains.  
  
Building on the

this Administration has done this past year to get goods flowing from
ships to shelves faster, including $6.6 billion in funding announced
through the fiscal year 2023 Budget, today the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers is committing $321 million through the President’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to expand capacity at key ports and waterways to
allow passage of larger vessels and further enhance the country’s
ability to move goods. These waterside investments will compliment
landside investments at our ports and across the goods movement chain
such as the Port Infrastructure Development Grants announced in
December. Specific projects announced today work to:  
  
**Move More Goods Faster at One of the Nation’s Fastest Growing
Ports: **Investing in ports helps to create resilient supply chains and
create jobs. The Administration will invest more than $72 million to
widen and deepen the **Norfolk Harbor, Virginia** Federal navigation
channel to increase the resilience of our nation’s supply chain.  The
Norfolk Harbor, Virginia, project handles 67 percent more containers in
2021 than it did 10 years ago. Work will improve navigation and enable
safer access for larger commercial and naval vessels, and provide
significant new economic opportunities to the region.  
  
The Biden Administration is also investing nearly $11 million in the
**Port of Galveston in Texas** by deepening a portion of the Galveston
Harbor Channel to accommodate larger vessels throughout the Port that
will increase capacity, while also enabling improved operational
safety.  
  
Further, the $68 million investment to deepen the **Brazos Island Harbor
Channel at the Port of Brownsvillein Texas** will enable increased cargo
movements, reduced transit times and improved operational safety.   
  
**Reduce Congestion on Inland Waterways**. Investing in inland waterways
creates and sustains jobs, relieves landside congestion, and provides
more cost-effective transportation capacities. Recognizing the diverse
benefits provided by investing in inland waterways, today, the Biden
Administration is announcing it will invest an additional $77 million in
the **Upper Ohio River, Pennsylvania** project to construct new lock
chambers at Emsworth Locks and Dams that will allow large cargo ships to
reliably and efficiently pass through the upper Ohio River system,
relieving landside congestion and facilitating timely delivery of
goods.  
  
The Biden Administration is also investing $92.6 million in the
**McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System** (**MKARNS**) which
moves 12 million tons of agricultural commodities annually in
commodities to American farmers and provides flood control to many
communities in Arkansas and Oklahoma along the Mississippi River. The
investment will upgrade the locks along the system to ensure that much
needed commodities are being delivered quickly and efficiently.  
  
**BOLSTER RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is leveraging the **$17 billion**
provided by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law through fiscal
year 2024 to better protect communities from climate change, and protect
vital ecosystems and the people and businesses throughout the country
that rely on them. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing
more than $1.16 billion in invests to reduce coastal and inland flood
risk.

Funding from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law announced
today will:  
**Reduce Flood Risk and Restore Aquatic Ecosystems**. The Army Corps
will leverage funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to increase
community resilience to flooding, including nearly $\[482\] million to
reduce coastal flood risk through 12 projects and more than $\[679\]
million to reduce inland flood risk through an additional 7 projects
across the country.  Projects include:

-   $350 million to the **Adams and Denver, Colorado** for flood risk
    reduction and aquatic ecosystem restoration project, which will
    serve disadvantaged communities surrounding the area. Components of
    the project include ecosystem restoration for aquatic, wetland, and
    riparian habitat along 6.5 miles of the South Platte River,
    restoring critical habitat connectivity as well as providing
    recreational opportunities to underserved populations.   
-   $220 million for the **Howard Hanson Dam, WA** to maintain flood
    risk management, increase municipal and industrial water supply to
    Tacoma Public Utility, and ecosystem restoration. The funding will
    advance work on the fish passage facility for migrating juvenile
    salmon and maintain dam performance to support the primary water
    needs for the citizens of Tacoma.   
-   $150 million for floodwalls, storm surge barriers, levees, pump
    stations, and non-structural measures to reduce threats from
    seal-level rise and increasing storm risk to the City of **Norfolk,
    Virginia**. This project will reduce threats from ever-increasing
    storms and sea-level rise, and damages to residential, commercial,
    historic and critical infrastructure.  
-   $77 million for **Mississippi Coastal Improvement Program** (MSCIP)
    to restore the Mississippi barrier islands to increase resilience to
    future storm events prevent saltwater intrusion and shoreline
    erosion, and preserve fish and wildlife habitat. The funding will
    advance the next phase of the project.  
-   $26 million for **Hudson Raritan Estuary** to restore 381 acres of
    estuarine wetland habitat including 16 acres of tidal channels, 50
    acres of freshwater riverine wetland habitat, 27 acres of coastal
    and maritime forest habitat, 39 acres of shallow water habitat and
    53 acres of oyster habitat. 

**ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE**  
  
The investments announced today will further deliver on the President’s
Justice40 Initiative commitment to ensure that 40 percent of the overall
benefits from certain federal investments, including in the areas of
climate change and critical clean water and wastewater infrastructure,
flow to disadvantaged communities in building their local economies and
reducing their disproportionate environmental burden. In addition to the
projects mentioned above, the followings projects are examples of
projects that will provide benefits to disadvantaged communities. The
Administration will provide $115 million to the **Southwest Coastal
Louisiana Hurricane Protection project** which will construct localized
storm surge risk reduction features, including features to elevate and
flood-proof structures, to reduce hurricane storm surge damage risks in
Cameron, Calcasieu, and Vermilion Parishes, communities which are
identified as disadvantaged and have been particularly hard hit by the
effects of climate change.

In addition, the Administration will provide $67 million to the Pajaro,
CA project to reduce flood risk in the **City of Watsonville, Town of
Pajaro**, and surrounding agricultural lands which have been subject to
a long history of flooding.

The Administration is also committed to the **Espanola Valley, Rio
Grande and Tributaries, New Mexico** project by providing $2.2 million
to complete the preconstruction engineering and design to restore and
protect 958 acres of aquatic and riparian habitats. These habitats are
critical to the functioning of the third longest river in the country,
and are an integral part of constructing social identity and
transmission and retention of traditional knowledge for both the Pueblo
of Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh.

The Biden-Harris Administration [Budget for Fiscal Year
2023](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/03/28/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2023/)
will provide further opportunity to advance infrastructure needs of the
nation through the Corps Civil Works program, including through $6.6
billion commercial navigation improvements, flood and storm damage
reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration.
