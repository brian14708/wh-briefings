title: "FACT SHEET: How The American Rescue Plan Is Keeping America\u2019s Schools\
  \ Open Safely, Combating Learning Loss, And Addressing Student Mental\_Health"
---
 
On March 11, 2021 – one year ago today – President Biden signed the
American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act into law, an unprecedented $1.9 trillion
package of emergency assistance measures. The ARP provides a historic
investment in America’s preschool through twelfth grade (P-12) schools
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to keep schools safely open, tackle
learning loss and mental health. These funds include $122 billion for
P-12 schools in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP
ESSER) funds. ARP also dedicated an additional $8 billion to states and
school districts to meet the needs of certain student populations,
including over $3 billion for students with disabilities and $800
million for children and youth experiencing homelessness.  
  
ARP has already had a significant impact on schools across the country:
over the last year, states, school districts, and schools have used
these funds to safely reopen and sustain in-person instruction, combat
learning loss, and address students’ mental health needs.  
  
In his State of the Union address last week, President Biden called on
schools to hire more teachers, urged the American people to sign up to
be tutors and mentors, and – as part of his unity agenda – encouraged
the country to come together to address child mental health. ARP ESSER
funds are supporting this agenda in several ways:

-   **<u>Schools have gone from 46% open before ARP to 99% safe and open
    today</u><u>:</u>** Before ARP was signed into law, just 46 percent
    of America’s P-12 schools were open for full-time, in-person
    learning. Today, over 99 percent of P-12 schools are open for
    full-time, in-person instruction.  
-   **<u>ARP led to record growth in local education jobs that are
    critical to meeting students’ academic and mental health
    needs</u><u>:</u>** Although there is more work to do to address
    longstanding educator shortages and return to pre-pandemic levels,
    ARP has led to record jobs growth in the education sector. With the
    help of ARP ESSER funding, local governments added more than 279,000
    education jobs in 2021 – the best calendar year of jobs growth since
    records began in 1956 – and added an additional nearly 46,000 jobs
    in the first two months of 2022. Schools have already seen a 65%
    increase in social workers and a 17% increase in counselors relative
    to before the pandemic.  
-   **<u>Analysis of school district plans shows overwhelming majority
    of funds are being used for priorities like teachers, counselors,
    academic recovery, mental health, and health and safety measures
    like ventilation improvements:</u>**  FutureEd – an education think
    tank at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy –
    analyzed data on a representative sample of over 3,000 school
    districts’ plans covering 55% of ARP ESSER funds. This analysis
    showed:
    -   Nearly 60% of funds are being used to:
        -   invest in staffing – both retaining current staff and
            expanding professional development opportunities, as well as
            recruiting, hiring and training of new teachers, school
            staff and mental health professionals to increase school
            capacity and meet the academic and mental health needs of
            students;
        -   combat learning loss through student support programs such
            as evidence-based tutoring, expanded after-school and summer
            learning and enrichment programs, and the purchase of
            millions of new textbooks and learning materials; and 
        -   supporting the physical and mental health of students and
            educators.
    -   Another 24% is being invested in keeping schools operating
        safely, including providing PPE and updating school facilities
        to support health and safety. This includes investments in lead
        abatement and an estimated nearly $10 billion for improvements
        to HVAC and ventilation.  
-   **<u>ARP has fueled investments in education spending and
    accelerated the rate of spending of education relief funds by five
    to six times:</u>** Before the passage of ARP, states and school
    districts were spending a total of a little more than $500 million
    per month of federal emergency relief funds for education. Since the
    passage of the ARP and the assurance to states and school districts
    that critical funds were on their way, the monthly rate of spending
    of ESSER funds from ARP and earlier relief legislation has
    accelerated to more than $3 billion per month – an increase of five
    to six times.  
-   **<u>All 50 states submitted clear spending plans that have been
    approved by the U.S. Department of Education</u>**: On March 24,
    less than two weeks after ARP was signed, two-thirds of funds – $81
    billion – were released. To ensure funds would be used effectively,
    states had to submit and receive approval on their spending plan to
    receive their final third of funds. As of December 2021, every
    state, plus DC and Puerto Rico, submitted a plan, the U.S.
    Department of Education has approved all plans, and all $122 billion
    in ARP ESSER funds have been made available to states.  
-   **<u>Survey of 600 school superintendents shows school leaders are
    meeting the challenge of the President’s unity agenda by using funds
    for students’ mental health and other developmental
    needs</u><u>:</u>** The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected many young
    Americans to social isolation, loss of routines, and traumatic grief
    – increasing the need for mental health supports. A recent survey by
    AASA, The School Superintendents Association, found that 82% of
    districts plan to use funds to address this need by expanding
    supports for social, emotional, mental, and physical health and
    development.  
-   **<u>States and school districts have deployed funds strategically
    while engaging meaningfully with their communities – including
    parents</u><u>:</u>** In developing their spending plans, states and
    school districts were required to engage members of the community,
    including parents, educators, students, representatives of students
    with disabilities and others. The U.S. Department of Education
    continues to encourage states and school districts to consult with
    these critical partners on how to ensure these funds have the most
    impact in classrooms.

**ARP ESSER-Funded State and District Activities**  
*From the U.S. Department of Education*  
  
**Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations**  
Safely reopening schools and keeping them open safely are essential for
student learning and well-being. 

-   **Houston Independent School District (HISD)** in Texas has
    allocated ARP ESSER funds to campuses for COVID-19 mitigation
    efforts. HISD has provided COVID-19 testing at 90 percent of its
    campuses and has hosted nearly 100 vaccine clinics.  
-   The **DeKalb County School District** in Georgia upgraded air
    filters from MERV 8 to MERV 13 in every school facility that could
    accommodate that size filter and took steps to improve ventilation
    in all other schools using ARP ESSER funding.  
-   **White Plains City School District** in New York will use a
    combination of local and federal funds to replace the HVAC units
    across their district to provide a safer learning environment for
    students and staff. Upon completion, the total project will cost
    $26.3 million, with nearly one-third of the funding coming from
    relief funds, including ARP ESSER.

**Combating Learning Loss**  
States and school districts have the resources they need, and are
required to address the impacts of the pandemic on students’ learning.
States and districts nationwide are using funds to hire teachers and
other instructional staff, launch tutoring, summer and afterschool
programs (which states are required to fund), and make long-overdue
investments in instructional materials. States are specifically required
to address the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the
pandemic, including students with disabilities, English learners, and
students experiencing homelessness.  
  
***Recruiting, Retaining, and Expanding Professional Development of
Staff:***

-   **Maine School Administrative District 11** is addressing gaps in
    learning opportunities by using ARP ESSER funds to hire nine new
    teachers and implement a new math, language arts, and social studies
    program. The additional teachers permitted the district to reduce
    class sizes from 22-24 students to an average of 14-16 students. The
    district has provided external and internal coaching, ongoing
    professional learning, and additional support to educators and
    staff.  
-   **Gaston County Schools** in North Carolina is adding an additional
    teacher and a temporary employee per school to decrease class sizes,
    help manage workloads and provide classroom coverage in each of its
    54 schools using ARP ESSER funding. This supports and helps retain
    current teachers, who are less likely to have to give up planning
    time to cover another classroom, or combine classrooms, and also
    benefits students whose learning is less likely to be disrupted by
    the absence of another teacher.  
-   The **Asheville City Schools Board of Education** in North Carolina
    is using ARP ESSER funds for a bonus of $3,000 to $3,500 over the
    course of the year for full-time teachers and faculty in order to
    increase staff retention.  
-   **Providence Public School District in Rhode Island** is launching
    new incentives to recruit and retain highly-qualified educators,
    including early signing bonuses for newly-hired educators and
    support staff in hard-to-fill positions using  ARP ESSER funding.

***Summer Learning and Enrichment: ***

-   In New Mexico, the College and Career Readiness Bureau of the **New
    Mexico Public Education Department** launched the Summer Enrichment
    Internship Program in 2021 using ARP ESSER funding. The program
    covers the cost of summer internships for New Mexico high school
    students and provides high school students, particularly those most
    impacted by the pandemic, with the opportunity to participate in
    high-quality internships in government agencies, including county,
    tribal, and municipal placements. Over 300 community partners and
    1,200 student interns participated across 26 counties. Summer jobs
    programs like these that engage students are also important
    community violence intervention strategies. This program will
    continue in the summer of 2022 as well.  
-   **Cleveland Metropolitan School District** in Ohio used ARP ESSER
    funds to increase summer learning participation seven-fold. In 2021,
    8,400 students participated in summer school, compared to
    1,000-1,200 students in previous years. Focused on “Finish, Enrich,
    and Engage,” the expanded summer school offered 12 weeks of
    programming that allowed for credit accumulation and unfinished
    learning. Students engaged in problem-based learning units in the
    morning with engagement activities like clubs and sports in the
    afternoon. This inclusive programming, which included students with
    disabilities and multilingual learners, will continue in summer
    2022.  
-   **The Oklahoma State Department of Education** is using ARP ESSER
    funds to implement evidence-based summer learning and enrichment
    programs and to expand afterschool programming through partnerships
    with community organizations. They provide for social, emotional,
    and academic support and access to technology. This initial
    investment of $6 million provided services through 28 organizations,
    at 140 sites, serving an average 11,000 students a month through the
    summer of 2021.

***Tutoring:***

-   The **Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education** has
    established the Arkansas Tutoring Corps using ARP ESSER funding. The
    Arkansas Tutoring Corps program includes recruitment, preparation,
    and support for candidates to become qualified tutors to provide
    instruction or intervention to meet the academic needs of students
    most impacted by lost instructional time. A system connects prepared
    candidates with organizations seeking to support students’ academic
    needs. The program is already enhancing learning experiences of
    students due to loss of instructional time and addressing gaps in
    foundational skills in mathematics and literacy.

**Meeting Students’ Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs**  
Districts and states must use a portion of ARP ESSER funds for
evidence-based interventions that respond to students’ social, and
emotional needs – such as the ability to collaborate with others or
persist through difficult challenges – and to support students’ mental
health. Districts must specifically address the impact of the pandemic
on groups of students that were disproportionately impacted.   
  
***Hiring Counselors and Increasing Supports**:***

-   The **Kansas Department of Education** has developed a Grow Your Own
    Counselor model with ARP ESSER funding that encourages districts to
    identify candidates and employ them as student services coordinators
    while they develop their skills in an approved school counseling
    graduate program.  
-   The **Nevada Department of Education** has allocated $7.5 million to
    support districts in hiring 100 additional school based mental
    health professionals. Using ARP ESSER funding, the state is spending
    $1.7 million to hire a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support coach for
    every district.  
-   **Plymouth-Canton Community Schools** in Michigan hired three
    full-time high school counseling staff to decrease counselor
    caseloads with ARP ESSER funding. Counselors are now able to
    dedicate more time to individual student meetings, attend meetings
    with assistant principals and deans to review academic progress and
    other needs of students, and develop a wellness center at each
    campus.

***Community Schools**:***

-   **The New York City Department of Education** announced an
    investment of $10 million to expand the district’s research-based
    community schools initiative from 266 to 406 sites citywide using
    ARP ESSER funding. These schools provide integrated student support
    services to students and the surrounding community, such as mental
    health care, adult education courses, community violence
    intervention programs, and nutrition support.

**Strengthening the Educator Workforce**  
The pandemic has taken a toll on the nation’s educators as well as its
students. States and districts should support and stabilize the educator
workforce and make staffing decisions that will help address students’
social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs. 

-   The **Tennessee Department of Education** has created a “Grow Your
    Own” grant with federal funding, including ARP ESSER, that is
    designed to foster partnerships between educator preparation
    programs (EPPs) and districts to provide promising and innovative,
    no-cost pathways to the teaching profession by increasing EPP
    enrollment and growing the supply of qualified teachers. The program
    is currently comprised of 65 partnerships between 14 EPPs and 63
    districts across the state – enabling over 650 future educators to
    become a Tennessee teacher for free. $6.5 million has been allocated
    to this program thus far. Tennessee also pioneered a pathway with
    the U.S. Department of Labor by establishing the nation’s first
    registered apprenticeship program for teachers, which will help
    sustain the state’s Grow Your Own programs and partnerships
    leveraging federal apprenticeship funding.
