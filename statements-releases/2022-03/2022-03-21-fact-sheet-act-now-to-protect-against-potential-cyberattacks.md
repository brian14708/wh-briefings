title: "FACT SHEET: Act Now to Protect Against Potential\_Cyberattacks"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration has warned repeatedly about the
potential for Russia to engage in malicious cyber activity against the
United States in response to the unprecedented economic sanctions we
have imposed.  There is now evolving intelligence that Russia may be
exploring options for potential cyberattacks.

The Administration has prioritized strengthening cybersecurity defenses
to prepare our Nation for threats since day one. President Biden’s
Executive Order is modernizing the Federal Government defenses and
improving the security of widely-used technology. The President has
launched public-private action plans to shore up the cybersecurity of
the electricity, pipeline, and water sectors and has directed
Departments and Agencies to use all existing government authorities to
mandate new cybersecurity and network defense measures. Internationally,
the Administration brought together more than 30 allies and partners to
cooperate to detect and disrupt ransomware threats, rallied G7 countries
to hold accountable nations who harbor ransomware criminals, and taken
steps with partners and allies to publicly attribute malicious activity.

We accelerated our work in November of last year as Russian President
Vladimir Putin escalated his aggression ahead of his further invasion of
Ukraine with extensive briefings and advisories to U.S. businesses
regarding potential threats and cybersecurity protections. The U.S.
Government will continue our efforts to provide resources and tools to
the private sector, including via [CISA’s Shields-Up
campaign](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up) and we will do everything in
our power to defend the Nation and respond to cyberattacks. But the
reality is that much of the Nation’s critical infrastructure is owned
and operated by the private sector and the private sector must act to
protect the critical services on which all Americans rely.

We urge companies to execute the following steps with urgency:

-   Mandate the use of multi-factor authentication on your systems to
    make it harder for attackers to get onto your system;  
-   Deploy modern security tools on your computers and devices to
    continuously look for and mitigate threats;  
-   Check with your cybersecurity professionals to make sure that your
    systems are patched and protected against all known vulnerabilities,
    and change passwords across your networks so that previously stolen
    credentials are useless to malicious actors;  
-   Back up your data and ensure you have offline backups beyond the
    reach of malicious actors;  
-   Run exercises and drill your emergency plans so that you are
    prepared to respond quickly to minimize the impact of any attack;  
-   Encrypt your data so it cannot be used if it is stolen;  
-   Educate your employees to common tactics that attackers will use
    over email or through websites, and encourage them to report if
    their computers or phones have shown unusual behavior, such as
    unusual crashes or operating very slowly; and  
-   Engage proactively with your local FBI field office or CISA Regional
    Office to establish relationships in advance of any cyber incidents.
    Please encourage your IT and Security leadership to visit the
    websites of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up) and
    the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber) where they will
    find technical information and other useful resources.

We also must focus on bolstering America’s cybersecurity over the long
term. We encourage technology and software companies to: 

-   Build security into your products from the ground up — “bake it in,
    don’t bolt it on” — to protect both your intellectual property and
    your customers’ privacy.  
-   Develop software only on a system that is highly secure and
    accessible only to those actually working on a particular project. 
    This will make it much harder for an intruder to jump from system to
    system and compromise a product or steal your intellectual property.

-   Use modern tools to check for known and potential vulnerabilities.
    Developers can fix most software vulnerabilities — if they know
    about them.  There are automated tools that can review code and find
    most coding errors before software ships, and before a malicious
    actor takes advantage of them. 

<!-- -->

-   Software developers are responsible for all code used in their
    products, including open source code. Most software is built using
    many different components and libraries, much of which is open
    source.  Make sure developers know the provenance (i.e., origin) of
    components they are using and have a “software bill of materials” in
    case one of those components is later found to have a vulnerability
    so you can rapidly correct it. 

<!-- -->

-   Implement the security practices mandated in the President’s
    Executive Order, *Improving our Nation’s Cybersecurity*. Pursuant to
    that EO, all software the U.S. government purchases is now required
    to meet security standards in how it is built and deployed. We
    encourage you to follow those practices more broadly.
