Today, the European Council was joined by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
of the United States. The leaders discussed the coordinated and united
response of the European Union and the United States to Russia’s
unprovoked and unjustified military aggression in Ukraine. They reviewed
their ongoing efforts to impose economic costs on Russia and Belarus, as
well as their readiness to adopt additional measures and to stop any
attempts to circumvent sanctions. Leaders discussed the urgent needs
caused by Russia’s aggression, committed to continuing providing
humanitarian assistance, including to neighboring countries hosting
refugees, and underscored the need for Russia to guarantee humanitarian
access to those affected by or fleeing the violence. Leaders welcomed
the opening of international investigations, including by the Prosecutor
of the International Criminal Court, and ongoing efforts to gather
evidence of atrocities. In addition, leaders discussed EU-U.S.
cooperation to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels, accelerate the
transition to clean energy, as well as the need to respond to evolving
food security needs worldwide. The leaders also concurred on the
importance of strengthening democratic resilience in Ukraine, Moldova,
and the wider Eastern partnership region. Finally, leaders underscored
the importance of enhancing transatlantic security and defense,
including through robust NATO-EU cooperation as described in the EU’s
Strategic Compass.
