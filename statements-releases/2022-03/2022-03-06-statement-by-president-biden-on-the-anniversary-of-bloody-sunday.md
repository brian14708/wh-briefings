title: Statement by President Biden on the Anniversary of Bloody Sunday
---
 
On Sunday, March 7, 1965, time stopped and blood spilled as brave and
righteous Americans sought to cross a bridge named after a Klansman in
Selma, Alabama, to reach the other side of justice. Led by the late John
Lewis, they marched to secure their sacred right to vote. Their heroism
was met by batons and tear gas. They were beaten, but not defeated.
Their absolute courage forced America to look in the mirror and Congress
to act. Soon after, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of
1965.

But over time, the strength of that groundbreaking law has been weakened
not by brute force, but by insidious court decisions. Today, we’re
seeing states across the country propose or enact laws that make it
harder to vote and have that vote counted — an onslaught of deeply
dangerous efforts to suppress the vote and subvert entire elections.

In Selma, the blood of John Lewis and so many other courageous Americans
sanctified a noble struggle. We are determined to honor that legacy by
passing legislation to protect the right to vote and uphold the
integrity of our elections, including the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.

My Administration will continue implementing my [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/28/fact-sheet-biden-administration-promotes-voter-participation-with-new-agency-steps/)
to promote voter participation, increase access to the ballot, and rally
the country to protect voting rights and election integrity. Vice
President Harris, marching in Selma today, will continue to lead this
effort. The U.S. Justice Department has doubled its voting rights
enforcement staff to stop discriminatory voting laws as the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 empowered it to do. And I will continue to use every
tool at my disposal to strengthen our democracy and keep alive the
promise of America for all Americans.

The battle for the soul of America has many fronts. The right to vote is
the most fundamental.
