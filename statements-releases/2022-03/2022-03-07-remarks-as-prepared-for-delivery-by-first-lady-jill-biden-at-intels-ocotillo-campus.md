Chandler, AZ

On a cold winter morning a little over a year ago, I held our family
bible and watched my husband take the oath of office.    
  
In that moment, he was the man I fell in love with so many years ago—a
father of two boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss, who
stitched a broken family back together with grit and grace.  
  
He was the man who took the train home to Delaware every night, because
he knew that showing up for the smallest moments can sometimes mean the
most.  
  
He was the Senator who learned to get up when he got knocked down and
fight even harder for what’s right—the Vice President whose steadfast
counsel helped guide our country through many storms.  
  
That day, he was Joe—and then, suddenly, he became something else, too:
The President of the United States.   
  
It felt like Americans across the country were holding their breath in
the aftermath of four years of chaos.  
  
But as Joe stood there—shoulders back, eyes shining with fierce
optimism—I could see his determination to bring us together to lead us
forward and build a better America. And every day since, he has worked
to do just that.  
  
Millions of families have been able to send their children back to
school and find jobs, and catch up on bills. They’ve been able to
finally take a breath.   
  
We still have a long way to go. Our world faces incredible challenges.
But we’ve come so far. And we’re just getting started.   
  
So what does “building a better America” mean? What does it look like
for families like yours?  
  
It means investing in industries of the future, like we see here
today—the kind of jobs that make our supply chain stronger, lowering
prices and keeping our country safe.  
  
It means working families have the opportunity to train for great jobs,
no matter who they are or where they live, so that they can build a good
career.   
  
It means getting rid of the barriers that have kept women out of careers
in engineering and manufacturing and other STEM fields—so that they can
have the same earning opportunities as their peers.   
  
That’s what the American Rescue Plan has made possible here in
Arizona.   
  
Today, we heard about an incredible semiconductor manufacturing bootcamp
at Mesa Community College, funded in part by the ARP.  
  
It’s going to allow students to start a career in a growing sector
that’s critical to our economy—and the first class is going to be all
women. Isn’t that amazing?    
  
These investments are changing lives. And every person who benefits from
this program and others like it—who is better off today than they were a
year ago—passes that benefit along.   
  
When we invest in you, you invest in your family, in your neighborhoods,
in local businesses, in your cities and states.   
  
It’s what Joe said last week: The state of our Union is strong because
the American people are strong. And building a better America starts
with you.

That’s why we’re going to keep investing in community college
partnerships and workforce development. We’re going to make sure you can
afford child care so you can pursue your education and career. We’re
going to create jobs—even more than we already have.   
  
You were right to put your faith in Joe Biden a year ago.   
  
Because in the face of uncertainty, he is unshakeable. Despite deep
divides—at home and abroad—he knows how to bring people together and get
things done. He never loses sight of what this is all about: the people
he serves.   
  
When he goes to bed at night and when he wakes up in the morning, he
thinks about how to make life better for you and your family.   
  
It’s just who he is. It’s who he’s always been.  
  
He’s going to lead us forward to a better America—and it starts here. It
starts now. And most of all, it starts with you.   
  
Thank you.
