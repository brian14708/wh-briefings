Today’s economic data tells the tale of two recoveries.

Our jobs recovery remains strong.  New unemployment claims remain low,
as jobs are created at a record level. The rate of people on
unemployment insurance is the lowest since 1970 – more than 50 years. 
 And, private sector job growth is strong, boosted by the steps we took
in the American Rescue Plan a year ago this week.

At the same time, today’s inflation report is a reminder that Americans‘
budgets are being stretched by price increases and families are starting
to feel the impacts of Putin’s price hike. A large contributor to
inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets
reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions.  As I have said from the start,
there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response
to Putin’s unprovoked war, but Americans can know this:  the costs we
are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the
costs we are facing.   

I know that higher prices impact a family’s budget, which is why I am
fighting to bring down the everyday prices that are squeezing Americans.
Last week, in coordination with our allies, the U.S. secured a release
of 60 million barrels of oil from our strategic reserves. My
Administration is pushing for investments so we can manufacture more in
America, strengthen our supply chains, and move goods to market at lower
cost. I’m promoting competition to make sure big corporations are
offering consumers fair prices, and I’m pressing Congress to pass my
plan to lower the cost of essentials like prescription drugs and energy.

Finally, I want to be clear:  we can do all this, and reduce the huge
federal budget deficit that I inherited from my predecessor.  Earlier
this week, we learned that after reducing the deficit last year — for
the first time since 2015 – CBO reported that we are on track to cut the
deficit this year by over $1 trillion – the largest one year reduction
in the deficit in US history.
