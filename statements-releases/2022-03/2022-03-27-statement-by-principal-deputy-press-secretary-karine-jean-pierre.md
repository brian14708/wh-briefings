This afternoon, after returning from the President’s trip to Europe, I
took a PCR test. That test came back positive. 

I last saw the President during a socially distanced meeting yesterday,
and the President is not considered a close contact as defined by CDC
guidance. I am sharing the news of my positive test today out of an
abundance of transparency.   
   
Thanks to being fully vaccinated and boosted, I have only experienced
mild symptoms. In alignment with White House COVID-19 protocols, I will
work from home and plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of
a five-day isolation period and a negative test.
