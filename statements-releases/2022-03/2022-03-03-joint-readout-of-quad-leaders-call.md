---
 
Today the Quad Leaders – Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia,
Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of
Japan, and President Joe Biden of the United States – convened to
reaffirm their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, in which the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states is respected and
countries are free from military, economic, and political coercion. They
reaffirmed their dedication to the Quad as a mechanism to promote
regional stability and prosperity.   
   
The Quad leaders discussed the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis
in Ukraine and assessed its broader implications. They agreed to stand
up a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mechanism which
will enable the Quad to meet future humanitarian challenges in the
Indo-Pacific and provide a channel for communication as they each
address and respond to the crisis in Ukraine.  
   
In their continuing pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific, the Quad
Leaders agreed to meet in person in Tokyo in the coming months.
