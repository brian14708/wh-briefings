  \ with Joey and Paula\_Reed"
---
 
President Biden met today with Joey and Paula Reed, the parents of
Trevor Reed, who is wrongfully detained in Russia. During their meeting,
the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure
the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held
in Russia and elsewhere, and to provide all possible assistance until
they and others are free and returned home to their families who are
advocating so passionately for their release. This is the President’s
second interaction with the Reeds. On March 8, President Biden spoke to
the Reeds by phone while he was in Texas.

The President’s national security team will remain in regular contact
with the Reeds, the Whelan family, and other families of Americans held
hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. We are grateful for their
partnership and feedback. We will continue to work to ensure we are
communicating and sharing information in a way useful to these families.

Previously, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with the Reed
family in a virtual group meeting and then privately in December. He
expressed our commitment to bringing Trevor home. We understand the pain
felt by all of Trevor’s families and friends enduring the nightmare of
his absence, which we are committed to bringing to an end.
