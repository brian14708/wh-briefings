title: "Vice President Kamala\_Harris Announces Additional U.S. Funding to Respond\
  \ to Humanitarian Needs in Ukraine and Eastern\_Europe"

During her trip to Warsaw, Poland, today, U.S. Vice President Kamala
Harris announced nearly $53 million in new humanitarian assistance from
the United States government, through the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), to support innocent civilians affected by Russia’s
unjustified invasion of Ukraine. This additional assistance includes
support to the UN World Food Program (WFP) to provide lifesaving
emergency food assistance to meet immediate needs of hundreds of
thousands affected by the invasion, including people who are displaced
from their homes and who are crossing the border out of Ukraine. In
addition, it will support WFP’s logistics operations to move assistance
into Ukraine, including to people in Kyiv. 

This assistance builds on the United States’ announcement less than two
weeks ago of nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance to provide
critically needed health supplies, food assistance, high thermal
blankets, and other relief. 

The United States is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine and has provided $159 million in overall humanitarian assistance
to Ukraine since October 2020, including nearly $107 million in the past
two weeks in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This includes
food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, and
winterization services to communities affected by ongoing fighting. To
date, two million people have been forced to flee Ukraine due to the
conflict, and an estimated one million are displaced inside Ukraine.  At
least 12 million people are in need of humanitarian aid across
Ukraine. The United States continues to stand with the people of Ukraine
and will continue to work to meet immediate needs and save lives.
