title: "FACT SHEET: Consequences of Lack of Funding for Efforts to Combat COVID-\u2060\
  19 if Congress Does Not\_Act"
---
 
The U.S. has made tremendous progress in our fight against COVID-19.
Over the past 14 months, the Biden Administration has made vital
investments – using resources Congress provided on a bipartisan basis –
to make sure the American people have free and widely available access
to lifesaving tools: vaccines, booster shots, treatments, tests, and
high-quality masks. As we enter a new moment in the pandemic, Congress
has not provided us with the funding we need to continue the COVID-19
response and minimize the pandemic’s impact to the Nation and our
economy. With cases rising abroad, scientific and medical experts have
been clear that in the next couple of months there could be increasing
cases of COVID-19 here in the U.S as well. As the Administration has
warned, failure to fund these efforts now will have severe consequences
as we will not be equipped to deal with a future surge. Waiting to
provide funding once we’re in a surge will be too late. 

Without funding, the United States will not have enough additional
boosters or variant specific vaccines, if needed, for all Americans. The
federal government is unable to purchase additional life-saving
monoclonal antibody treatments and will run out of supply to send to
states as soon as late May. The federal government cannot purchase
sufficient quantities of treatments for immunocompromised individuals.
And, the federal government will be unable to sustain the testing
capacity we built over the last 14 months, as we head into the second
half of the year.

Earlier this month, President Biden laid out a comprehensive plan to
ensure that the country can continue to move forward safely and remain
prepared to fight new variants and future surges of the virus. And the
Administration has been clear that we need Congress to provide
additional resources, including $22.5 billion in immediate emergency
funding. Inaction will set us back in this fight, leave us less
prepared, and cost us more lives. 

Consequences of lack of critical funding include:

-   **Inability to Secure Sufficient Booster Doses and Variant Specific
    Vaccines, If Needed:** The federal government does not have adequate
    resources to purchase enough booster vaccine doses for all
    Americans, if additional doses are needed. The shortages will be
    even more acute if we need a variant-specific booster vaccine, since
    we will not have any existing supply.

-   **Providers No Longer Able to Submit Claims for Testing, Treating,
    and Vaccinating the Uninsured: ** The fund that reimburses doctors
    and other medical providers for caring for uninsured individuals
    will start to be scaled back this month and end completely in early
    April.   Specifically, one week from today – March 22 — the
    Uninsured Program will stop accepting new claims for testing and
    treatment due to lack of sufficient funds. Providers will no longer
    be able to submit claims for providing these services to uninsured
    individuals, forcing providers to either absorb the cost or turn
    away people who are uninsured, increasing the disparity in access to
    critically needed health care and putting additional burdens on
    safety net providers. Three weeks from today—April 5—the Uninsured
    Program will also stop accepting vaccination claims due to a lack of
    sufficient funds. 

<!-- -->

-   **Ending the Purchase of Monoclonal Antibody Treatments, Scaling
    Back State/Territory Allocations:** The federal government has no
    more funding f0r additional monoclonals, including a planned order
    for March 25. To date, the federal government has been able to
    provide these life-saving treatments free of charge to Americans and
    work with states to make sure they get to as many people as possible
    who need them. In order to keep these treatments free and available
    to the American people for as long as possible, the Administration
    will now have to stretch our current supply and, starting next week,
    will be forced to cut state allocations of our limited existing
    supply of life-saving monoclonal antibody treatments by more than
    30%.

<!-- -->

-   **Halting Critical Testing, Vaccine, Treatment Efforts**: The
    President’s National Preparedness Plan was clear that the federal
    government must invest in next-generation vaccines and treatments
    and maintain our testing capacity in order to fight COVID-19 in the
    future. Now, without additional funding, we do not have the ability
    to:
    -   *Purchase additional oral antiviral pills beyond the 20 million
        already secured.*

    <!-- -->

    -   *Pre-purchase promising new antivirals*. The reason why the
        Administration has been able to secure more oral antiviral pills
        than any other country is because we committed to purchasing
        them early, even prior to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
        As even more effective pills potentially become available, the
        federal government is no longer able to make advance purchase
        commitments to ensure America is one of the first countries in
        line. 

    <!-- -->

    -   *Accelerate the creation of a next-generation, pan-COVID vaccine
        that would provide broad protection against a range of
        variants*. Vaccines are the most effective tool to prevent
        COVID-19, and the Administration does not have the funding for
        necessary investments in research and to support the development
        of promising new vaccine candidates.  Such next-generation
        vaccines hold potential to broaden protection against known and
        future variants, reduce dosing through single-dose primary
        regimens with extended duration of protection (i.e., longer
        interval between boosters or possible elimination of boosters
        altogether), and reduce costs by increasing manufacturing yields
        and extending shelf life.

    <!-- -->

    -   *Maintain our domestic testing capacity beyond June.* After
        spending the last year building up our testing capacity, that
        progress will be squandered, the Administration will be unable
        to help keep domestic manufacturers online starting in June.
        That means, heading into the second half of the year, there will
        be significantly diminished domestic testing capacity and we may
        be unprepared for surges.
-   **Scaling Back Planned Purchases of Preventive Treatments for
    Immunocompromised:** The federal government has been planning to
    move forward with a purchase of preventative treatments for the
    immunocompromised as soon as March 31 that would begin delivery in
    September, once the treatments are manufactured.  However, absent
    additional funding the federal government will now be forced to
    scale back that purchase of treatments for our most vulnerable.
    Because these treatments take more than 6 months to manufacture, the
    United States will likely not have enough of these treatments by the
    end of the year.  And being unable to make additional purchase
    commitments now likely means that fewer treatments will be available
    next year as well.  

<!-- -->

-   **Reducing Ability to Rapidly Identify and Assess Emerging
    Variants. ** Robust surveillance and research are critical to
    identify, understand and monitor emerging variants.  With reduced
    capability to perform adequate surveillance, the country will be
    prone to being “blindsided” by future variants. In the absence of
    funding to immediately assess lab-based efficacy and real-world
    effectiveness of existing vaccines and treatments as new variants
    emerge, health care professionals will be forced to make
    insufficiently informed treatment decisions. The Administration will
    need to wind down some COVID surveillance investments, leaving us
    less able to detect the next variant.

<!-- -->

-   **Damage to Global Vaccination and COVID-19 Treatment Efforts: **
    Without additional funding to support getting shots into arms, USAID
    and interagency partners will have to cut short efforts to turn
    vaccines into vaccinations across the globe.  Leaving large
    unvaccinated populations worldwide will increase the risk of new
    deadly variants emerging that could evade our current vaccines and
    treatments.  Without additional funds, the Administration would be
    unable to extend Global VAX surge support to 20+
    additional under-vaccinated countries that will need intensive
    support this year to get shots in arms. This will devastate our
    ability to ensure those countries can effectively deploy safe and
    effective vaccines. USAID will also be unable to provide life-saving
    supplies, tests, therapeutics, oxygen, and humanitarian aid to
    countries still struggling to manage a continuing COVID disease
    burden. 

In addition to the immediate need for funding, in order to facilitate a
smooth transition to insurance coverage of life-savings COVID treatments
the Administration is requesting that Congress provides authority to
ensure seamless access to Medicare and insurance coverage for treatments
under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
