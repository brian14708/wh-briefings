Jill and I extend our best wishes to all who are celebrating Nowruz in
the United States and around the world today — including in Iran and
across the Middle East, in Central and South Asia, in the Caucuses, and
in Europe.

The Nowruz holiday brings family and friends together around the table
to give thanks for loved ones, count our blessings, share meals and
gifts, reflect on the year that has passed, and welcome the arrival of
spring and the possibilities of a new season. That spirit of new
beginnings and the joy of Nowruz is reflected in our own Haft-Sin table
at the White House, representing our hopes for the new year. It is a
recognition and celebration of the vibrant cultures and friendships of
our many diaspora communities in America who make extraordinary
contributions and strengthen the fabric of our nation every day. To
everyone celebrating, Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak — we wish you a Happy Nowruz.
