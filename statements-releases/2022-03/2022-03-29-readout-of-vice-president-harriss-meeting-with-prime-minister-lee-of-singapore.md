Vice President Kamala Harris today met with Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong of Singapore. Building on the Vice President’s August 2021 visit
to Singapore, the leaders reviewed progress made on initiatives launched
last year and agreed to further strengthen the U.S.-Singapore strategic
partnership. The Vice President and the Prime Minister discussed
Russia’s brutal and unjustified war against Ukraine. The Vice President
thanked the Prime Minister for Singapore’s support for Ukraine and the
rules-based international order, including imposing financial sanctions
and export controls on Russia. They discussed next steps in terms of
implementation of these economic measures as well as the importance of
support for the people of Ukraine. The Vice President underscored the
enduring commitment of the United States to the Indo-Pacific region, and
Southeast Asia in particular. They discussed the importance of
strengthening partnerships throughout the region, including through
ASEAN, to promote an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, connected,
prosperous, secure, and resilient.  The Vice President welcomed
Singapore becoming the first Southeast Asian nation to join the Artemis
Accords and discussed with the Prime Minister our continued cooperation
on space, climate, supply chains, and cybersecurity.
