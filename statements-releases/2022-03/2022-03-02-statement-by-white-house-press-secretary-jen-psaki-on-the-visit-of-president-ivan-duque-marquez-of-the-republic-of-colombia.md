President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Iván Duque Márquez
of the Republic of Colombia to the White House on March 10, 2022. The
visit provides an opportunity for the Presidents to celebrate 200 years
of positive diplomatic relations and consult on a range of regional and
global issues of mutual interest, including Russia’s unprovoked and
unjustified military invasion of Ukraine, and the promotion of
democracy, security, and prosperity in the hemisphere. During the
meeting, the leaders plan to reaffirm the bilateral relationship and
discuss COVID-19 response and future pandemic preparedness, economic
recovery, and regional responses to migration. The President looks
forward to this important meeting to deepen the strategic partnership
between the United States and Colombia.
