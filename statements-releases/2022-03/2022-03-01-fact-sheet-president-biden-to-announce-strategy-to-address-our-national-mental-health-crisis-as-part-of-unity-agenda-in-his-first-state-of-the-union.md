title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Announce Strategy to Address Our National\
  \ Mental Health Crisis, As Part of Unity Agenda in his First State of the\_Union"
---
 
In his first State of the Union, the President will outline a unity
agenda consisting of policy where there has historically been support
from both Republicans and Democrats, and call on Congress to send bills
to his desk to deliver progress for the American people.  As part of
this unity agenda, he will announce a strategy to address our national
mental health crisis.  
   
Our country faces an unprecedented mental health crisis among people of
all ages. Two out of five adults
[report](https://www.kff.org/report-section/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use-issue-brief/)
symptoms of anxiety or depression. And, Black and Brown communities are
[disproportionately](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767308)
[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767308)
undertreated – even as their burden of mental illness has continued to
rise. Even before the pandemic, rates of depression and anxiety were
inching
[higher](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/abn-abn0000410.pdf).
But the grief, trauma, and physical isolation of the last two years have
driven Americans to a [breaking
point](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/12/24/collective-trauma-public-outbursts/).  
   
Our youth have been particularly impacted as losses from COVID and
disruptions in routines and relationships have led to increased social
isolation, anxiety, and learning loss.  More than half of parents
[express](https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/news-releases/new-apa-poll-shows-sustained-anxiety-among-americans-more-than-half-of-parents-are-concerned-about-the-mental-well-being-of-their-children)
concern over their children’s mental well-being. An [early
study](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning)
has found that students are about five months behind in math and four
months behind in reading, compared with students prior to the pandemic.
In 2019, one in three high school students and half of female students
[reported](https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/dear_colleague/2020/dcl-102320-YRBS-2009-2019-report.html)
persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, an overall increase of
40 percent from 2009. Emergency department
[visits](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/science/pandemic-adolescents-depression-anxiety.html)
for attempted suicide have risen 51 percent among adolescent girls.  
   
This youth mental health crisis has been accentuated by large social
media platforms, which for years have been conducting a national
experiment on our children and using their data to keep them
clicking—with enormous consequences. While technology platforms have
improved our lives in some ways, there is [mounting
evidence](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-youth-mental-health-advisory.pdf)
that social media is harmful to many kids’ and teens’ mental health,
well-being, and development. As the Surgeon-General has
[said](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-youth-mental-health-advisory.pdf),
“when not deployed responsibly and safely, these tools can pit us
against each other, reinforce negative behaviors like bullying and
exclusion, and undermine the safe and supportive environments young
people need and deserve.” In the State of the Union, the President will
call on Congress to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted
advertising to children, and demand technology companies stop collecting
personal data on our children.  
   
President Biden is laying out a vision to transform how mental health is
understood, perceived, accessed, treated, and integrated – in and out of
health care settings. The American Rescue Plan laid the groundwork,
providing critical investments to expand access to mental health
services. Now, far more is needed to ensure that everyone who needs help
can access care when and where they seek it.  
   
The President is announcing a national mental health strategy to
strengthen system capacity, connect more Americans to care, and create a
continuum of support –transforming our health and social services
infrastructure to address mental health holistically and equitably.  
   
**<u>Strengthen System Capacity</u>**  
At the center of our national mental health crisis is a severe
[shortage](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2021-06-10/northeastern-states-have-fewest-mental-health-provider-shortages)
of behavioral health providers. More than one-third of Americans live in
designated [Mental Health Professional Shortage
Areas](https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas),
communities that have fewer mental health providers than the minimum
their level of population would need. Even outside of these shortage
areas, the fragmentation of the current system makes it hard for mental
health providers to meet people where they are. We must dramatically
expand the supply, diversity, and cultural competency of our mental
health and substance use disorder workforce – from psychiatrists to
psychologists, peers to paraprofessionals – and increase both
opportunity and incentive for them to practice in areas of highest
need.  Our crisis response infrastructure must also be strengthened to
ensure that those facing acute behavioral health challenges can be
seamlessly connected to necessary services.  We will: 

-   **Invest in proven programs that bring providers into behavioral
    health.**  The President’s FY23 budget will invest $700 million in
    programs – like the National Health Service Corps, Behavioral Health
    Workforce Education and Training Program, and the Minority
    Fellowship Program – that provide training, access to scholarships
    and loan repayment to mental health and substance use disorder
    clinicians committed to practicing in rural and other underserved
    communities. These major new investments will both expand the
    pipeline of behavioral health providers and improve their geographic
    distribution to target areas with the greatest unmet need.
-   **Pilot new approaches to train a diverse group of
    paraprofessionals**.  Doctors, nurses, and other clinicians cannot
    do this work alone.  In the fall of 2022, HHS expects to award over
    $225 million in training programs to increase the number of
    community health workers and other health support workers providing
    services, including behavioral health support, in underserved
    communities. The President’s FY23 budget will also propose major new
    multi-year funding to develop provider capacity and support mental
    health transformation. 

<!-- -->

-   **Build a national certification program for peer specialists. **
    The Biden-Harris Administration will convene stakeholders, launch
    development, and support implementation of a national certified peer
    specialist certification program, which will accelerate universal
    adoption, recognition, and integration of the peer mental health
    workforce across all elements of the health care system.  
-   **Promote the mental well-being of our frontline health workforce.**
    Three-quarters of frontline health care workers
    [report](http://https:/mhanational.org/pandemic-taking-dangerous-toll-mental-health-frontline-healthcare-workers)
    burnout, while more than half say they lack adequate supports to
    cope. The Administration has already
    [dedicated](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/07/16/hhs-announces-103-million-arp-funding-to-address-health-workforce-burnout.html)
    $103 million in American Rescue Plan funding to address burnout and
    strengthen resiliency among health care workers. The President will
    strengthen this commitment by signing the bipartisan Dr. Lorna Breen
    Health Care Provider Protection Act into law, which will invest $135
    million over three years into training health care providers on
    suicide prevention and behavioral health while launching an
    awareness campaign to address stigmatization, promote help-seeking
    and self-care among this workforce. In addition, HHS will continue
    grant programs to support health systems and provider groups to
    prevent burnout, relieve workplace stressors, administer stress
    first aid, and increase access to high-quality mental health care
    for the frontline health care workforce.  
-   **Launch the “988” crisis response line and strengthen
    community-based crisis response.**  This summer, HHS will launch the
    [988](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/current-events/the-lifeline-and-988/)
    mental health crisis service hotline, which will create a national
    network of local crisis centers fortified by national back up
    centers to answer calls and texts. Through the American Rescue Plan,
    the Administration has provided $180 million to support local
    capacity to answer crisis calls, and establish more community-based
    mobile crisis response and crisis stabilizing facilities to minimize
    unnecessary emergency department visits. The President’s FY23 budget
    will build on this investment with an additional nearly $700 million
    to staff up and shore up local crisis centers while also building
    out the broader crisis care continuum: someone to call, someone to
    respond, and somewhere for every American in crisis to go.  
-   **Expand the availability of evidence-based community mental health
    services.** The American Rescue Plan invested millions of dollars to
    expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), a
    proven model of care that has been
    [shown](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/preliminary-cost-quality-findings-national-evaluation-certified-community-behavioral-health-clinic-0)
    to improve health outcomes while lowering costs, by delivering 24/7
    mental health and substance use care to millions of Americans, no
    matter who they are or whether they’re able to pay. The President’s
    FY23 budget will build on this down payment, by proposing to make
    this program permanent while granting states funding to expand
    CCBHCs for the communities that need them most. The President’s
    budget will also permanently extend funding for Community Mental
    Health Centers, which provide essential mental health services to
    vulnerable communities that would otherwise lack access.  
-   **Invest in research on new practice models**.   New scientific and
    technological innovation has the opportunity to expand our capacity
    to meet American’s mental health needs, but there is a pressing need
    for research to validate what works and build a robust evidence
    base. The President’s FY23 budget will call for investing $5 million
    in research into promising models for treating mental health
    conditions.

**Connect Americans to Care**  
Less than half of Americans with mental health conditions
[receive](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/cost-and-accessibility-of-mental-health-care-in-america.htm)
treatment. The average delay from the onset of mental health symptoms to
treatment is [11 years](https://www.nami.org/mhstats).  Too often,
[costs](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/07/datapoint-care) prevent
people from accessing care far. At the same time, those with mental
illness are
[often](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination)
misunderstood, mistreated, mislabeled, and misdirected to services. It
is imperative that we promote better pathways to care and make it as
easy as possible for all Americans with behavioral health needs –
including common and pervasive conditions like anxiety and depression –
to access the resources that will improve their well-being. We must
fight to ensure that every American can access mental health and
substance use disorder care through their insurance coverage, while
integrating mental health services and supports into a variety of other
settings, online and in the community. The Biden-Harris Administration
will:  

-   **Expand and strengthen parity**. The [2008 Mental Health Parity and
    Addiction Equity
    Act](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Other-Insurance-Protections/mhpaea_factsheet)
    called for mental health care benefits to be covered at the same
    level as physical health care benefits. The President’s fiscal year
    2023 (FY23) budget will propose that all health plans cover robust
    behavioral health services with an adequate network of providers,
    including three behavioral health visits each year without
    cost-sharing.
-   **Integrate mental health and substance use treatment into primary
    care settings**. Equipping primary care providers with the tools to
    identify, treat, and manage behavioral health conditions is a
    [proven](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BPC_Behavioral-Health-Integration-report_R03.pdf)
    approach for delivering quality mental health and substance use
    care, particularly for individuals with depression. To facilitate
    adoption of these models, the President’s FY23 budget will double
    funding for primary and behavioral health integration programs. In
    addition, using existing authority, the Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS) will test payment models that support the
    delivery of whole-person care through behavioral health integration
    and authorize Medicaid reimbursement of inter-professional
    consultations so that primary care providers can consult with a
    specialist and provide needed care for patients. 

<!-- -->

-   **Improve veterans’ access to same-day mental health care.**
    Veterans are at
    [higher](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB10087.html)
    risk for mental health and substance use challenges than the general
    population. Increasing their access to quality mental health care is
    the first step to closing this disparity. The Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) will reduce barriers to mental health access by fully
    implementing their Primary Care Mental Health Integration and
    Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program, which connect veterans
    to same-day mental health care and improve the integration of these
    services into primary care settings.  
-   **Expand access to tele- and virtual mental health care options.**
     The use of telehealth to address mental health and substance use
    needs
    [rose](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/12/03/new-hhs-study-shows-63-fold-increase-in-medicare-telehealth-utilization-during-pandemic.html)
    dramatically during the height of the pandemic and has remained
    above pre-pandemic levels even where COVID has waned. These
    tele-mental health services have proven both [safe and
    effective](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2020/using-telehealth-meet-mental-health-needs-during-covid-19-crisis),
    while reducing barriers to care. To maintain continuity of access,
    the Administration will work with Congress to ensure coverage of
    tele-behavioral health across health plans, and support appropriate
    delivery of telemedicine across state lines. At the same time, the
    HHS will create a learning collaborative with state insurance
    departments to identify and address state-based barriers, like
    telehealth limitations, to behavioral health access. And the United
    States Office of Personnel Management will facilitate widespread,
    confidential, and easy access to telehealth services, in part by
    strongly encouraging Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
    carriers to sufficiently reimburse providers for telehealth
    services, and to eliminate or reduce co-payments for consumers
    seeking tele-mental service.  
-   **Expand access to mental health support in schools and colleges and
    universities.**  The President has committed to doubling the number
    of school-based mental health professionals. The Department of
    Education (ED) will continue to support states, school districts,
    colleges and universities, in using relief funds – including the
    more than $160 billion invested by the American Rescue Plan in the
    Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) and Higher
    Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) – to address the mental
    health needs of students, including by training, recruiting, and
    retaining more school- and college and university-based mental
    health professionals. With the help of ESSER funds, schools have
    already seen a 65% increase in social workers, and a 17% increase in
    counselors. To help schools sustain these roles, the Department of
    Health and Human Services will make it easier for school-based
    mental health professionals to seek reimbursement from Medicaid, and
    the President’s FY23 budget will propose $1 billion to help schools
    hire additional counselors and school psychologists and other health
    professionals.  
-   **Embed and co-locate mental health and substance use providers into
    community-based settings**. Expanding pathways to care also means
    creating new, low-barrier access points, in settings where Americans
    already live, work, and play. To that end, the President’s FY23
    budget will include $50 million to pilot models that embed and
    co-locate mental health services into non-traditional settings like
    libraries, community centers, schools, and homeless shelters.  
-   **Increase behavioral health navigation resources.** Finding the
    right care or an available provider can be a frustrating experience.
    We need to make it easier for Americans both to find help, and to
    receive it. To meet this need, the Administration will build new
    easy-to-access, user-friendly online treatment locator tools –
    starting with a redesigned and refurbished mentalhealth.gov – so
    Americans can find care when they need it, where they need it, with
    the click of a button. The Department of Defense will also create a
    one-stop online resources for service members and their families to
    access mental health information and locate mental health providers.

**Support Americans by Creating Healthy Environments**

We cannot transform mental health solely through the health care system.
We must also address the determinants of behavioral health, invest in
community services, and foster a culture and environment that broadly
promotes mental wellness and recovery. This crisis is not a medical one,
but a societal one. In December 2021, the Surgeon-General released an
[Advisory on Protecting Youth Mental
Health](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-youth-mental-health-advisory.pdf)
that outlined a wide range of causes for the national youth mental
health crisis and underscored growing concern about the harms of digital
technologies, particularly social media, to the mental health and
well-being of young people, as well as calling for practical action from
technology companies to address these concerns.

We need a whole-of-society effort to address these concerns: to expand
prevention programs and actions that improve mental health at every age
and across settings; and to enhance programs that support recovery,
especially for populations at increased risk during vulnerable
transition periods. The Biden-Harris Administration will: 

-   **Strengthen children’s privacy and ban targeted advertising for
    children online.**  
    The online platforms have
    [billions](https://wearesocial-cn.s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/common/digital2021/digital-2021-global.pdf)
    of users worldwide, many of whom use the platforms for [hours a
    day](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-united-states-of-america).
    These companies know everything from [where users are physically
    located](https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-file-new-suits-against-google-over-location-tracking-11643037890)
    at any moment, to how many seconds they spend reading a particular
    post, to intimate personal data like what medical symptoms they have
    been researching. Children are also subject to the platforms’
    intensive and excessive data collection vacuum, which they use to
    deliver sensational and harmful content and troves of paid
    advertising to our kids. [By one
    estimate](https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/i-Spy__NEF.pdf),
    online advertising firms hold 72 million data points on the average
    child by the time they reach the age of 13. The President is calling
    on Congress to ban excessive data collection on and targeted
    advertising online for children and young people.  
-   **Institute stronger online protections for young people, including
    prioritizing safety by design standards and practices for online
    platforms, products, and services.** Social media platforms are
    designed to be addictive, too often deliver age-inappropriate
    content, promote unhealthy social comparisons, and enable
    harassment, child sexual exploitation, stalking, and cyber-bullying.
    Children, adolescents and teens are uniquely vulnerable to harmful
    and dangerous content online. Other democratic countries have been
    acting to prevent and reduce the online harms to their children. The
    President believes not only that we should have far stronger
    protections for children’s data and privacy, but that the platforms
    and other interactive digital service providers should be required
    to prioritize and ensure the health, safety and well-being of
    children and young people above profit and revenue in the design of
    their products and services.  
-   **Stop discriminatory algorithmic decision-making that limits
    opportunities for young Americans.** When a girl searches for jobs
    online, platforms will too often push her away from fields like
    engineering that historically have excluded women. Searches for
    “Black girls,” “Asian girls,” or “Latina girls” too often return
    harmful content, including pornography rather than role models,
    toys, or activities. Platforms shape how our kids understand what is
    possible and access opportunities. When young people are treated
    unfairly, it can have mental health impacts including anxiety and
    depression. We must ensure that platforms and other
    algorithmically-enhanced systems do not discriminatorily target our
    kids.  
-   **Invest in research on social media’s mental harms.** Ample
    research has now emerged that social media is
    [associated](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-07-20/social-media-is-a-public-health-crisis)
    with negative mental health outcomes, particularly among [young
    people](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/social-media-linked-rise-mental-health-disorders-teens-survey-finds-n982526),
    and that children under 18 are disproportionately
    [vulnerable](https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2022/social-media-children-teens)
    to the dangerous and harmful content that they might encounter
    online. More research, however, is needed to understand why and how
    these harms occur – and how they can be prevented and treated. To
    meet this need, the President’s FY23 budget will dedicate at least
    $5 million toward advancing research on social media’s harms, as
    well as the clinical and societal interventions we might deploy to
    address them. Over the next year, the Department of Health and Human
    Services will also launch a national Center of Excellence on Social
    Media and Mental Wellness, which will develop and disseminate
    information, guidance, and training on the full impact of adolescent
    social media use, especially the risks these services pose to their
    mental health.        
-   **Expand early childhood and school-based intervention services and
    supports**. Half of all mental disorders begin
    [before](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/report_1973/ShortReport-1973.html)
    the age of 14. And when systems act to promote well-being at early
    developmental stages, youth reap the mental and emotional benefits
    for
    [years](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2766307)
    to come. The American Rescue Plan dedicated millions of dollars to
    youth mental health. The President’s FY23 budget builds on this
    investment and proposes to make historic investments in youth mental
    health services, including more than $70 million in infant and early
    childhood mental health programs. For example, Project LAUNCH works
    to ensure that the systems that serve young children have the
    resources and knowledge to foster their social, emotional,
    cognitive, and behavioral development. The FY23 budget will also
    continue funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home
    Visiting Program of the Department of Health and Human Services,
    which supports new families by teaching positive parenting skills,
    conducting developmental and mental health screenings, promoting
    school readiness, and linking to community resources and supports.
    Additionally, the President’s FY23 budget will propose to
    dramatically expand funding for community schools by increasing
    funding for the Full-Service Community School program by over $400
    million dollars relative to current levels – a more than ten-fold
    increase. Community schools provide a range of wraparound supports
    to students and their families, including mental health services and
    other integrated student supports.  
-   **Set students up for success.** When students struggle in school,
    it impacts their well-being. A comprehensive strategy to support
    student wellness must also include efforts to address the impact of
    the pandemic on student learning, particularly on students most
    impacted by the pandemic, and create supportive learning
    environments. ED will continue to help states and school districts
    use the $122 billion in ARP ESSER funds for this purpose.
    Specifically, the Department will help states and districts use the
    funds to provide more individual and small group instruction, hire
    instructional and other critical staff, launch high-impact tutoring
    programs, provide high-quality afterschool and summer learning and
    enrichment programs, and invest in other evidence-based strategies
    that will help our students recover from the pandemic. Districts
    nationwide are already using ARP ESSER funds to invest in these
    strategies. To support this work, we need more caring adults taking
    on roles supporting students. The President is calling on Americans
    nationwide to take on roles as tutors and mentors to help our
    students recover. Those looking to return to the workforce, who are
    just out of school, or changing careers, should consider the rich,
    rewarding job opportunities in our schools and with our young
    people. The investments the President will propose in his FY23
    budget will support and sustain efforts that set up students for
    success. This includes more than doubling funding for Title I, a
    ten-fold increase for the Full-Service Community School program, and
    an historic $3.3 billion increase for Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act grants that support PK-12 children with disabilities
    and $450 million for IDEA PART C, which supports early intervention
    services for infants and toddlers.  
-   **Increase mental health resources for justice-involved
    populations**. In too many communities, jails and other correctional
    facilities have become the
    [largest](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/04/25/605666107/insane-americas-3-largest-psychiatric-facilities-are-jails)
    provider of mental health care. Approximately [40
    percent](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/research/mental_health/) of
    incarcerated individuals have a mental illness, yet merely
    [one-third](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/imhprpji1112.pdf)
    receive treatment. The President believes that we have both a moral
    and a public health obligation to increase access to comprehensive
    mental health care for the justice-involved. To this end, the
    Department of Justice will expand funding and technical assistance
    to local communities and corrections systems to provide behavioral
    health care, case management services, family services, and other
    transitional programming for adults returning from incarceration
    into the community.   
-   **Train social and human services professionals in basic mental
    health skills.** It’s not enough to train health care providers to
    deliver mental health care; social and human services providers must
    also be equipped to identify, understand, and respond to signs of
    mental illness and addiction among those they serve. To this end,
    the Department of Housing and Urban Development will launch a
    national effort to train housing counselors, housing-based services
    coordinators, and Fair Housing grantee staff to recognize the signs
    of emotional distress and to connect residents with mental health
    resources. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will provide training
    on mental health resources and communication strategies to Farm
    Production and Conservation Mission Area field employees, who serve
    farmers and ranchers, as well as incorporate updated mental health
    information into its online resource center for State, local and
    clinic staff administering the Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). ED will continue to
    highlight the effectiveness of Mental Health First Aid training for
    educators, so that they can better support their students and one
    another. And the Department of Health & Human Services will provide
    additional training support to Head Start, Early Head Start, and
    home visiting grantees to spot and address mental health challenges
    among children.
