title: "FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Launches Effort to Improve Ventilation and\
  \ Reduce the Spread of COVID- \u2060 19 in Buildings"
---
 
Earlier this month, the Biden-Harris Administration released the
[National COVID-19 Preparedness
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/), a roadmap to move the
country forward safely and continue to fight COVID-19 as Americans get
back to their more normal routines.  Today the Administration is
launching the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, a key component of the
President’s Plan, that calls on all building owners and operators,
schools, colleges and universities, and organizations of all kinds to
adopt key strategies to improve indoor air quality in their buildings
and reduce the spread of COVID-19.   
  
The Clean Air in Buildings Challenge is a call to action for leaders and
building owners and operators of all types to assess their indoor air
quality and make ventilation and air filtration improvements to help
keep occupants safe. As part of the Challenge, today, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) published a best practices guide for improving
indoor air quality and reducing the risk of spreading dangerous airborne
particles. [This
guide](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/clean-air-buildings-challenge) –
developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal agencies – contains a
set of clear recommendations organized into four groups:

1.  *Create a clean indoor air action plan* that assesses indoor air
    quality, plans for upgrades and improvements, and includes HVAC
    inspections and maintenance.
2.  *Optimize fresh air ventilation* by bringing in and circulating
    clean outdoor air indoors.
3.  *Enhance air filtration and cleaning* using the central HVAC system
    and in-room air cleaning devices.
4.  *Engage the building community* by communicating with building
    occupants to increase awareness, commitment, and participation.

Under each of these recommendation areas, EPA’s best practices guide
lays out clear-cut actions building owners and operators can implement.
The best practices guide is designed to serve as a menu of improvements
to choose from. The guide includes quick steps that all organizations
can take right away as a starting place, as well as resources to help
plan for longer-term investments and improvements.   
  
The Biden Administration and Congress have provided hundreds of billions
of dollars in federal funds that can be used in schools, public
buildings, and other settings to improve indoor air quality. The
American Rescue Plan provided [$350 billion for state and local
governments](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds),
as well as [$122 billion for
schools](https://www.ed.gov/improving-ventilation-schools-colleges-and-universities-prevent-covid-19),
that can be used to support making ventilation and filtration upgrades.
These American Rescue Plan dollars are being put to work in communities
around the country in improving Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Funding within the State and Local Fiscal
Recovery Fund program and the Elementary and Secondary School Education
Relief program can be spent on inspection, testing, and maintenance of
current ventilation systems; purchasing portable air filtration units,
with HEPA air filters; purchasing MERV-13 (or higher) filters for HVAC
system and air conditioners; purchasing fans; repairing windows and/or
doors; servicing, upgrading, or replacing HVAC systems consistent with
industry standards; and more.  
  
As detailed in the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, the
Administration will continue to advance indoor air quality in buildings
in additional ways, including:

-   Supporting state, local, and Tribal governments as well as school
    districts to make ventilation improvements and upgrades using
    American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds. 
    The Administration will work closely with public sector partners
    like schools to provide guidance and technical assistance to make
    these improvements and connect them to agency resources on indoor
    air quality.  
-   Building public awareness around ventilation and filtration
    improvements to reduce disease spread in buildings. The
    Administration will build public awareness and communicate with the
    public on how ventilation and good indoor air quality are key
    factors in keeping Americans safe while inside buildings. The
    Administration will launch efforts to explain what good ventilation
    and air filtration look like as an important component of helping to
    reduce disease spread, and how buildings of any kind can pursue
    improvements to their ventilation and air filtration strategies.  
-   Highlighting actions taken by buildings to achieve clean, healthy
    air quality through a recognition program. While the Administration
    invites all buildings to take actions from the Clean Air in
    Buildings Challenge, the Administration will also foster ways to
    recognize steps taken by buildings to improve indoor air quality and
    protect their communities. Similar to how programs like LEED,
    Fitwel, and WELL recognize buildings for their environmental and
    health impacts, this new effort between the federal government and
    external experts will develop ways to recognize steps taken by
    building owners for the health and safety of their communities and
    their achievements in improving air filtration and ventilation
    systems to protect and promote public health.  
-   Catalyzing science and technology innovation to reduce indoor
    disease transmission. The Office of Science and Technology Policy
    (OSTP), in coordination with other partners through the Pandemic
    Innovation Task Force, is identifying opportunities to drive
    innovation and implementation of technologies to support clean
    indoor air in buildings and reduce disease transmission. OSTP will
    also host a series of public engagements to provide the latest
    science, tools, and best practices on improving indoor air quality.
