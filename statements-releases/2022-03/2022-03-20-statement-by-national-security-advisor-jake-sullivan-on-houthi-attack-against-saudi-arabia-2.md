title: Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Houthi Attack Against
  Saudi Arabia
---
 
We condemn the Houthi attacks over the last 48 hours against civilian
infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. These attacks reportedly targeted water
treatment facilities as well as oil and natural gas infrastructure. The
Houthis launch these terrorist attacks with enabling by Iran, which
supplies them with missile and UAV components, training, and expertise.
This is done in violation of UN Security Council resolutions prohibiting
the import of weapons into Yemen. Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni Government
have endorsed multiple UN calls for ceasefires and de-escalation over
the last year. The Houthis have rejected these calls, responding instead
with new offensives in Yemen and terrorist acts, such as those launched
against Saudi Arabia last night. It is time to bring this war to a
close, but that can only happen if the Houthis agree to cooperate with
the United Nations and its envoy working on a step-by-step a process to
de-escalate the conflict. The United States stands fully behind those
efforts, and we will continue to fully support our partners in the
defense of their territory from Houthi attacks. We call on the
international community to do the same.
