title: Statement by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne on Russian Disinformation and Efforts
  to Undermine Free Press
---
 
We applaud the steps taken by governments, U.S. and global companies,
and other institutions around the world to condemn Putin’s war of choice
in Ukraine, including those that call out and contest the Russian
Government’s further efforts to undermine the free press and spread
disinformation.

The Russian government’s efforts to propagate lies and obscure the truth
have been rejected by the international community:  governments, the
private sector, and civil society have taken independent action in an
unprecedented manner to reject efforts to sell Putin’s war as justified.
For our part, the United States has leveraged new sanctions on
individuals based in Russia and Ukraine, as well as Russian entities
tied to Russian intelligence services, that promulgate destabilizing
disinformation, and has provided critical assistance to increase digital
safety measures for civil society and media. With our partners, we will
continue to condemn Russia’s shuttering of independent media and
technology platforms that refuse to allow Putin to run his
disinformation campaigns unchecked.

To hide the truth from its own citizens, Russia’s censorship agency has
shuttered independent Russian media outlets, blocked social media, and
restricted access in Russia to international news outlets. We condemn
the move by the Russian Federation Council to approve a law threatening
prison sentences of up to 15 years for journalists and ordinary citizens
that would spread so-called “false” information about Putin’s
unconscionable war in Ukraine.

We urge continued action across all sectors of society to promote human
rights and fundamental freedoms online and offline.  This includes
disinformation that seeks to divide the global community and conceal the
Kremlin’s responsibility for this crisis. The United States firmly
believes that the best way to accomplish this goal is to hold
accountable the propaganda media and disinformation proxies that
disseminate Putin’s lies. Through their principled actions, like-minded
governments, private companies, and non-governmental organizations are
demonstrating leadership in this moment.  We will continue to work with
and support all like-minded partners, and stand with the sovereign
nation and people of Ukraine, and with the citizens of Russia speaking
out against Putin’s war by the thousands.
