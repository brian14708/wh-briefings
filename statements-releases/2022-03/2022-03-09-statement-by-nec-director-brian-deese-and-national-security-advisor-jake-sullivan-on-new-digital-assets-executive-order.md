title: Statement by NEC Director Brian Deese and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
  on New Digital Assets Executive Order
---
 
Today President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to establish the
first-ever comprehensive federal digital assets strategy for the United
States. The E.O. will help position the U.S. to keep playing a leading
role in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem at
home and abroad, in a way that protects consumers, is consistent with
our democratic values and advances U.S. global competitiveness.

This E.O. marks an intensification of our efforts to promote responsible
innovation in the digital assets space – innovation that works for all
Americans, protects our national security interests, and contributes to
our economic competitiveness and growth. Fundamentally, an American
approach to digital assets is one that encourages innovation but
mitigates the risks to consumers, investors, and businesses, broader
financial stability, and the environment. We are clear-eyed that
“financial innovation” of the past has too often not benefited working
families, while exacerbating inequality and increasing systemic
financial risk. This history underscores the need to build robust
consumer and economic protections into digital asset development.

The approach outlined in the E.O. will reinforce U.S. leadership in the
global financial system and safeguard the long-term efficacy of critical
national security tools like sanctions and anti-money laundering
frameworks. To these ends, the Order identifies the Administration’s
policy priorities, both for cryptocurrencies and any future U.S. central
bank digital currency, to help guide the evolution of the digital asset
ecosystem in a way that is consistent with our values. Governments alone
cannot solve these problems, and definitely not a government that
operates in siloes. This E.O. is the product of months of work with
stakeholders across government, industry, advocacy, academia, and
international allies and partners – to identify actions we can take to
foster responsible innovation in the digital asset ecosystem. Its
implementation will leverage the knowledge and distinct expertise of a
broad range of stakeholders across the White House and Executive
departments and agencies, and regulatory agencies. We remain committed
to working with allies, partners, and the broader digital asset
community to shape the future of digital asset systems in a manner that
is safe, inclusive, and consistent with our democratic values. As this
ecosystem evolves, so too will our approach.
