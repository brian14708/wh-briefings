title: "Wide Range of Constituencies Applaud President\_Biden\u2019s State of the\
  \ Union\_Address"
---
 
In his first State of the Union, the President spoke directly to the
American people about his vision to build a better America. He reminded
the country that our best days lie ahead, and that his Presidency is
about giving everyone a fair shot ‚Äì because when given half a shot,
ordinary people can do extraordinary things. The Biden-Harris
Administration‚Äôs domestic agenda represents an historic shift from the
old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that puts workers, families,
and small businesses first.

The President also announced his unity agenda, consisting of four areas
where we have historically been able to come together and find agreement
regardless of party. He has called on Congress to send bills to his desk
to deliver progress for the American people: to beat the opioid crisis,
address mental health, support our veterans, and end cancer as we know
it.

Over the next year, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue
working to make communities safer, combat COVID, and create good-paying
jobs through revitalized domestic manufacturing.

A wide range of constituencies and community leaders championed the
President‚Äôs remarks.

*Here‚Äôs what they are saying:*

### Asian Americans and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders

**Sung Yeon Choimorrow, Executive Director, National Asian Pacific
American Women‚Äôs Forum (NAPAWF):** ‚ÄúWe applaud President Biden for
bringing visibility and support to the Asian American and Pacific
Islander community during a time of heightened anti-Asian violence and
rhetoric. We have been advocating for the President and other elected
officials to acknowledge hate crimes against the AAPI community and it‚Äôs
disproportionate impact on Asian American and Pacific Islander women.
The recent tragic deaths in New York City and Albuquerque, nearly one
year after the Atlanta Spa shootings, is yet another sobering reminder
of the current state of safety for AAPI women.‚Äù
\[[Statement](https://www.napawf.org/press-releases/030122), 3/1/22\]

**Christine Chen, Executive Director, Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote (APIA Vote):** ‚ÄúTonight, President Biden made two things
clear: ending violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander
communities, and fighting for voting rights remain high priorities for
this administration. Despite the several challenges presented to the
United States since he took office, we are pleased that our communities‚Äô
livelihood and our freedom to vote are at the forefront of his agenda.
Anti-Asian hate has existed long before COVID-19, but the ongoing
pandemic has exacerbated discrimination and violence towards AAPIs to
dangerous levels. We were pleased when President Biden signed the
COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law last year, and reauthorized the White
House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific
Islanders. We look forward to continuing to work with the White House on
the issues that impact AAPIs‚Äô everyday lives.‚Äù
\[[Statement](https://www.apiavote.org/press/SOTU2022), 3/1/22\]

**Juliet K. Choi, President and CEO, Asian & Pacific Islander American
Health Forum (APIAHF):** ‚ÄúPresident Biden‚Äôs State of the Union
highlighted historic firsts that his Administration has achieved,
including the enactment of the bipartisan law to address anti-Asian
hate. We applaud and echo the President‚Äôs calls on Congress to reform
our country, making it affordable, safe and healthy for all Americans.
This includes permanently reducing the cost of health insurance
premiums, prescription drug prices and investing in mental health. The
Biden-Harris administration has continuously put racial equity at the
forefront of its policies, and we are encouraged to see the investments
to ensure every community has access to the resources and tools to
address our collective challenges, from COVID-19 to hate incidents to
the cancer moonshot. We are inspired by President Biden‚Äôs vision for a
better, healthier America, and look forward to continuing progress
toward equity and justice.‚Äù

**Southeast Asia Resource Center (SEARAC):** ‚ÄúPresident Biden‚Äôs vision
for America is in stark contrast to the previous Administration, which
actively undermined the health and wellbeing of Southeast Asian
Americans. In particular, the President‚Äôs emphasis on parity between
physical and mental health would help Southeast Asians who continue to
struggle with trauma from the war, the ensuing generational trauma that
lingers in our communities, and mental harm from increased anti-Asian
violence. Holistic, well-funded health resources for Southeast Asian
Americans that address the concerns of all community members ‚Äì from
increased access to mental health services for students, to support for
older adults and those who are care for them ‚Äì are essential to our
community‚Äôs success in society, especially as we navigate the twin
pandemics of COVID-19 and anti-Asian hate.‚Äù
\[[Statement](https://www.searac.org/national/searac-responds-to-state-of-the-union/),
3/2/22\]

**Japanese American Citizens League (JACL):** ‚ÄúYesterday, President Joe
Biden delivered his first State of the Union address, in which he called
for bipartisanship and support for Ukraine. We applaud President Biden
and his team for signing 80 bipartisan bills into law last year,
including the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act introduced by Representative
Grace Meng and Senator Mazie Hirono.¬† We extend our appreciation for his
commitment to ‚Äúprotecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate
crimes,‚Äù and we look forward to continuing our work to monitor and
ensure that elements of the Hate Crimes Act are implemented to best
support and protect our Asian Pacific American communities. Japanese
Americans have a long tradition of service to our country, most notably
during WWII when Japanese American men served while their families
remained incarcerated in American concentration camps. We praise
President Biden‚Äôs pledge to provide comprehensive health care and
benefits to veterans. Every veteran deserves the highest quality care,
and we as a nation have too long neglected fulfilling this promise. Just
as so many veterans struggle with mental health, so too have many more
Americans due to the COVID pandemic, particularly children. We join the
Biden Administration in their efforts to address the mental health
pandemic that has accompanied COVID and affected our most vulnerable
populations disproportionately.‚Äù
\[[Statement](https://jacl.org/statements/jacl-responds-to-the-state-of-the-union),
3/2/22\]

**Seema Agnani, Executive Director, National CAPACD:** ‚ÄúThere has been a
seismic shift in our country, which has presented the opportunity for
real change and strong leadership; we have witnessed the Administration
step into this role through unprecedented appointments to key agencies
and boards, bold action against hate and racism, and advocacy on climate
change. We commend the President for the spirit of hope and promise in
the State of the Union, and we will continue to work closely with the
Administration to deliver on the promise of opportunity, access, and
inclusion for all Americans, as well as the commitment to advance racial
justice.‚Äù \[Statement, 3/2/22\]

**OCA ‚Äì Asian Pacific American Advocates:** ‚ÄúSince day one, the
Biden-Harris administration has worked to earn the trust of Asian
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander families, and their
support is especially meaningful as our communities continue to combat
tragic violence and pandemic health disparities. In less than a year,
the president appointed a senior White House AANHPI community liaison,
expanded the White House Initiative on AANHPIs, and signed the COVID-19
Hate Crimes Act into law. Tonight‚Äôs brief but historic nod to our
communities is important, and we look forward to engaging with the
administration on the racial profiling of scholars of Asian descent and
the work that lays ahead to truly protect AANHPI women, elders, and
children.‚Äù

**Billy Mitchell, President, National Black Caucus of State
Legislators:** ‚ÄúPresident‚Äôs Biden speech last night regarding the state
of our union offered hope, stability, and a plan we can count on to help
all Americans now and in the future. His vision for rebuilding our
economy so that it helps our middle and low-income families aligns with
the goals of NBCSL. As state legislators, we work every day in our state
houses to ensure affordability for African American families and other
minority families across this nation.¬† We applaud President Biden for
the promises he has kept in his first year of office, such as providing
critical COVID-19 relief to Americans. We support the President fully in
getting Americans vaccinated to combat COVID-19 and end this pandemic.¬†
Furthermore, we look forward to the continued work on our nation‚Äôs
infrastructure. We support the bipartisan effort to invest in our roads,
bridges, affordable broadband, and clean water in all our
communities‚Äîincluding rural communities. We must rebuild America‚Äîa task
that NBCSL has been committed to over the years and will remain
committed.¬† Many of our constituents are suffering from high drug prices
and cannot afford their medication that is essential to them living a
healthy life. We applaud President Biden‚Äôs efforts to lower the drug
prices and encourage permanent savings through the American Rescue Plan
and Affordable Care Act. NBCSL stands with this nation and stand up for
democracy across the world. We are against Russian aggression and stand
with Ukraine.¬† Lastly, after the failed attempt to pass the John Lewis
Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, NBCSL is still committed
to ensuring everyone has the right to vote. We continue to put the
pressure on President Biden and his administration to make sure that
these two pieces of legislation pass the Senate or some form of voter
protection legislation will pass and put into law. We look forward to
President Biden‚Äôs continued leadership in this nation and NBCSL looks
forward to continuing to work with this administration to help our
constituents and achieve the mission and goals of NBCSL.‚Äù

**Dr. Michael Lomax, President & CEO, United Negro College Fund**: ‚ÄúThe
Biden administration will push for a $2,000 increase to the maximum for
a Pell Grant, which is the nation‚Äôs effort to assist students coming
from lower socio-economic backgrounds to fund their higher education
pursuits.¬† Increasing HBCU funding is a priority on which the
Biden-Harris White House and UNCF have long collaborated.¬†This is a
continuation of our shared goals. We have worked with this White House,
even before they moved in, to formulate these asks. I applaud the
president for including both HBCUs and a Pell Grant increase in his
State of the Union address, and I hope both items will be championed by
both sides of the aisle.‚Äù¬†\[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**Lodriguez V. Murray, Senior Vice President for Public Policy and
Government Affairs, United Negro College Fund:** ‚ÄúThis is historic. For
the president of the United States to not only mention HBCUs in his
State of the Union address, but to call for increased funding along with
joining our effort to increase, and hopefully soon double the Pell
Grant, is something we cannot help but be excited about. ‚ÄúIt is rare in
Washington for a leader to stand by priorities. It is rarer for HBCUs to
be that priority. President Biden is really showing that he stands with
students from vulnerable backgrounds and the institutions that best
serve their needs, and those are HBCUs. UNCF hopes Congress will pass
the FY 2022 appropriations bills at the highest levels for HBCUs and the
Pell Grant, and then let‚Äôs do even better in FY 2023.‚Äù \[Statement,

**Liz Fairchild, Executive Director, Business Forward:** ‚ÄúSince
President Biden took office last year, America‚Äôs 32.5 million small
businesses have made it clear what issues matter to their business,
their employees, and their communities. Last night, the President spoke
directly to these key issues, including rising costs, attacks on our
democracy, and upholding America‚Äôs rule of law. President Biden
highlighted the urgent need to confirm his nominees to the Federal
Reserve, which he emphasized would play a ‚Äúcritical role‚Äù in fighting
inflation and explained how a timely confirmation process will advance
his plan to bring costs down for working families and lower the deficit.
Local business leaders know that a responsive government is essential to
a strong economy, and amid a critical moment for democracies around the
world, the President reiterated the importance of prioritizing
transparency in democracy. He called on the Senate to pass both the
Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Less than a
week since Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme
Court, small businesses have already vocalized widespread support,
including within our network. President Biden used last night‚Äôs address
to describe Judge Jackson as a ‚Äúconsensus builder‚Äù who has immediately
received broad support from across the aisle. I urge our elected
officials to take these critical measures in support of the small
business community, the backbone of our nation‚Äôs economy.‚Äù

**Rhett¬†Buttle, Founder, Public Private Strategies: ‚Äú**In tonight‚Äôs
State of the Union address, the President laid out a plan to build upon
the economic progress made over the last year and continue America‚Äôs
leadership for democracy, at home and abroad. The American Rescue Plan
and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal have contributed to the fastest
economic growth our country has experienced in 40 years, including the
creation of nearly 6 million jobs, the lowest rate of unemployment
claims since 1969, and a $90 billion increase in retail sales. This is
crucial progress we‚Äôve made in overcoming the economic challenges
presented by the pandemic, but there is more work to do. Small
businesses across the country need policies that will continue to give
them a fighting chance, like lowering the cost of healthcare and
prescription drugs, increasing access to capital, and modernizing our
economy to support small business employees. This includes delivering
paid leave programs and affordable childcare for owners and employees,
which will help build a stronger, more resilient workforce.‚Äù
\[Statement, 3/1/22\]¬†

**Cristina Morales Heaney, Board Chair, National Association of Women
Business Owners:**¬†‚ÄúNAWBO is pleased to see the President putting the
need for workforce training in the forefront of his economic policy
agenda,‚Äù said ‚ÄúIn a recent survey of NAWBO‚Äôs women business owners, 40%
of NAWBO‚Äôs women business owners reported difficulty hiring last fall.
We truly believe our nation must provide training to close the skills
gap or reskill our workforce to ensure that women business owners have
access to talent and can compete to build sustainable businesses. We

**Anne Zimmerman, C0-Chair, Small Business for America‚Äôs Future:**
‚ÄúDuring his first State of the Union address, President Biden rightfully
highlighted the strong economic progress we have been made, but we were
most heartened that he did not shrink from the need to do more to help
Main Street small businesses recover from the biggest shock they‚Äôve
experienced in a century ‚Ä¶ We also support President Biden‚Äôs call on
Congress to provide the resources needed to expand prosecutions of
egregious pandemic fraud. PPP loans were meant for small businesses
facing layoffs and closures due to the pandemic‚Äîindividuals who
fraudulently obtained loans meant for struggling entrepreneurs should be
held accountable. As we look ahead, we are optimistic about the work the
Biden-Harris Administration is doing to help entrepreneurs and urge
Congress to take up the policies the president proposed to help our
small business community. To maximize our economic recovery, we must
seize opportunities to enact policies that help our small business
community, which creates two-thirds of all new jobs and employs half of
all workers, succeed. With the proper policies‚Äîaddressing the cost of
childcare, creating paid leave programs and bringing down healthcare and
drug costs chief among them‚Äî in place, America‚Äôs small businesses will
flourish and lead our economy to prosperity.‚Äù

**Elizabeth Gore, Senior Vice President for Political Affairs,
Environmental Defense Fund:** ‚ÄúPresident Biden sent a clear signal
tonight that he will continue to deliver on his promise to prioritize
America‚Äôs clean energy economy. We join him in his call for Congress to
pass his bold and transformative climate and energy agenda that will
deliver good-paying jobs, lower costs for families, provide cleaner air
and water, and fight climate change. The Biden Administration has
already demonstrated its commitment to a ‚Äòwhole of government‚Äô approach
to climate action. Under the president‚Äôs leadership, America has
rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, federal agencies are implementing
ambitious climate strategies, and the federal government is implementing
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including investments that will help
drive meaningful climate progress. Now Congress needs to act. Congress
has the power to enact the bold, transformative legislation laid out by

**Nat¬†Kreamer, CEO, Advanced Energy Economy:**¬†‚ÄúI returned from a tour
of duty in Afghanistan in 2006 determined to help the United States free
itself from fossil fuels. Now, with Russia‚Äôs brutal invasion of Ukraine,
we have even more reason to accelerate our country‚Äôs transition to clean
energy. Our national security is linked directly to our energy security.
The more we wean ourselves off oil as well as gas and use more advanced
energy, the safer we will be. Global conflict in recent decades has
revolved around fossil fuels. The way to put an end to the power of
those who use these fuels as a weapon is to stop buying their products.¬†
We need a transition to clean energy for our economy too. Continued
dependence on oil and gas puts our households and businesses at risk of
energy price spikes like the ones now hitting Americans in their heating
bills and at the gas pump right now. That‚Äôs because these fuels are
commodities traded in global markets, making them volatile by nature.‚Äù

**Gene Karpinski, President, League of Conservation Voters:** ‚ÄúAs we
heard from President Biden tonight, we can strengthen the state of our
union by making transformative investments in clean energy, climate,
justice and jobs at home in the United States. We couldn‚Äôt agree more
with the President that Congress needs to meet the moment on climate by
enacting the House-passed $555 billion investments in climate, clean
energy and environmental justice into law. These investments will save
families $500 a year on energy bills, provide greater economic
stability, and protect our national and climate security. We must break
our dependence on dirty, dangerous and unreliable fossil fuels.

‚ÄúEqually important is President Biden‚Äôs commitment to rallying the
nation and world to protect democracy. We condemn Vladimir Putin‚Äôs
unlawful, unprovoked assault on Ukrainians trying to live in peace as a
sovereign nation with a democratically elected government. Whether
abroad or here at home, we cannot have a just, equitable society without

**Lori Lodes, Executive Director, Climate Power:** ‚ÄúTonight, President
Biden laid out his plan to provide relief for American families that
have been living in a world in flux ‚Äì a plan that will grow the economy,
lower household costs, create jobs and address environmental injustices
by investing in clean energy and tackling the climate crisis. Clean
energy is the future of our economy.

‚ÄúWe can and must take these steps now to lower energy costs, provide
energy independence and secure our nation. Instead of keeping the
American economy tethered to fossil fuels that makes us dependent on the
ambitions of authoritarian leaders and the greed of oil and gas CEOs,
let‚Äôs invest in a clean energy economy built right here in America.

‚ÄúTackling climate action is a huge opportunity for our nation ‚Äì cutting
household energy costs by $500 and saving families another $80 a month
at the pump. We can speed up the production of cheap, clean and reliable
energy that‚Äôs made in America. We‚Äôll create millions of new good-paying
jobs by investing in wind, solar and other clean energy sources that
won‚Äôt run out.

President Biden has taken significant steps this year, but now it‚Äôs time
Congress does its job by passing a historic suite of investments in
communities and families struggling with the interlocking crises of
climate change, health, and racial, economic, and environmental
injustice. Investing in clean energy, in clean air and water, and in a
safe, livable climate will create millions of jobs, help address
inflation, and build a better America. The House of Representatives has
taken action; it‚Äôs past time the Senate passes legislation investing in
climate, jobs, and justice too. But the work cannot end there ‚Äì
Washington must invest in our democracy. The John Lewis Voting Rights
Act and the Freedom to Vote Act are more important than ever. And the
Senate must confirm President Biden‚Äôs nominee to the Supreme Court:
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. It‚Äôs time Washington addresses the
interlocking crises we face and invests in the people, our democracy,

### Gun Violence Prevention Advocates:

**John Feinblatt, President, Everytown for Gun Safety: ‚Äú**During his
first year in office, President Biden has led the strongest gun safety
administration we‚Äôve seen, and this speech is further proof that he
remains fully committed to keeping Americans safe from gun violence.
Going forward, there are more critical steps the administration and
Congress can take to save lives ‚Äî including revitalizing ATF, using
executive powers to crack down on unlicensed gun sellers, and
strengthening background checks ‚Äî and we look forward to working with
them every step of the way.‚Äù

the leadership we need to unify our country and save lives. As a

words tonight, but we need continued and increased action and attention

taken extensive and historic action, but he cannot let up. He also
cannot solve this problem alone. His calls for legislative fixes such as
universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity
magazines, and repealing PLCAA, the liability shield for gun
manufacturers, are common-sense and will save lives. Congress must also
pass the $200 million for community violence interventions the President
has asked for in Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations, and the proposed
investment of $5 billion over eight years that was included in the Build
Back Better Act, arguably the largest investment in gun violence
prevention ever. Over 81 million Americans voted for President Biden
because of his ability to handle the many problems facing our nation. He
and Congress must not let the crisis that kills over 100 Americans every
day fall to the wayside. His speech tonight reiterated his commitment to
this issue tonight. We need him to remain steadfast and to make gun
violence an even greater priority in the year ahead.‚Äù

**Jo Ann Jenkins, CEO, AARP:** ‚ÄúAARP is encouraged that President Biden
continues to urge Congress to act on our nation‚Äôs skyrocketing
prescription drug prices. If the prices for household goods grew as fast
as drug prices over the last 15 years, gas would now cost $12.20 a
gallon and milk would be $13 a gallon. For all those years, politicians
made promises to lower drug prices, but they just kept going up.
Allowing Medicare to negotiate the price it pays for prescription drugs
will help protect seniors from inflation by lowering their drug prices
and putting money back in their pockets. This policy proposal is
strongly supported by vast majorities of Democratic, Independent and
Republican voters.

¬†‚ÄúHow much longer will older Americans be forced to wait for the Senate
to lower drug prices? Now is the time to get the job done. We urge the
Senate to keep their promises to voters and lower drug prices, reduce
seniors‚Äô drug costs, and save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.

‚ÄúWe were also encouraged to hear the President describe new actions to
ensure that residents in nursing homes will receive the safe,
high-quality care they deserve. For years, AARP and AARP Foundation have
sounded the alarm about problems in America‚Äôs nursing homes. The
COVID-19 pandemic exposed the chronic, ongoing issues with our long-term
care system and emphasized the need for reform. It is a national
disgrace that more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes and
other long-term care facilities died. AARP urges the federal government
to act swiftly to ensure minimum staffing standards, increase
transparency, and hold nursing homes accountable when they do not
provide quality care.‚Äù

**David Mitchell, Founder, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now:**
‚ÄúTonight, President Biden once again called for legislation to lower
prescription drug prices, including Medicare negotiation. For two
decades, Americans have been targeted by drug companies that established
a system that prevents our government from negotiating on our behalf. It
is imperative that the Senate pass a package of reforms that will couple
copay and out-of-pocket caps with provisions that drive down prices by
empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prices and limiting year-to-year
price increases to truly lower costs ‚Äî not just shift them around.
Otherwise, Americans will wind up paying more through higher premiums
and taxes.

‚ÄúWith inflation at record levels and Americans facing rising costs, Big
Pharma‚Äôs price gouging forces Americans to pay almost four times what
people in other nations pay for the same brand-name drugs. The drug
price reforms from the House-passed Build Back Better package allow
Medicare to negotiate lower prices, curb Big Pharma‚Äôs price gouging, cap
out-of-pocket costs, and deliver long overdue relief to millions of
Americans. The reforms have the support of all 50 Democratic senators,
offering a clear path to passage through reconciliation. The provisions
are the most popular element of the original package, and more than 90
percent of voters list drug pricing reform as a top issue for the
midterms.

‚ÄúIt is time for the Senate to advance a reconciliation package with
these drug price reforms. Americans need help now.‚Äù \[Statement,

### Labor Leaders

**Ray Curry, President, United Auto Workers:** **‚Äú**Under President

and there is more work to do. Congress must act on the President‚Äôs
priorities. For starters, the Senate should pass the PRO Act and Confirm
Ketanji Brown Jackson to the highest court in the land. Together with
the Biden Administration, we are working to ensure that the transition
to electric vehicles supports good union jobs by passing the
Stabenow/Kildee electric vehicle tax credit and complementary policies

no longer face a crippling chip shortage that has hurt our
members¬†who¬†build¬†consumer vehicles, Heavy Truck¬†vehicles and
Agricultural and Construction Equipment. By laying out this agenda,
President Biden offers a clear path forward that builds America back
better than ever. UAW and working families need lower prescription drug
costs and more affordable quality healthcare, so no one is forced to
choose between putting food on the table and affording life-saving drugs
or going to the doctor. We must make childcare affordable, so parents
can work knowing their children are safe. Equally important to UAW
members and working families are the attacks on our democracy occurring
across our country as falsehoods about the 2020 election continue to
spread, and dozens of states enact restrictive voting laws that threaten
to disenfranchise lawful citizens from the ballot. It is troubling that
legislation to protect our most fundamental democratic rights as voters
was filibustered in the Senate. Make no mistake ‚Äì these attacks do more
than threaten an idea of democracy; they cripple the foundation that
grants our members their right to organize and secure higher standards
of living for themselves and their families. Finally, President Biden
addressed the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which is an affront to all
democratic forms of government and all people of goodwill. We stand with
President Biden and our allies in defending the hardworking families of
Ukraine and their democracy. It is long past time we unite to address
these issues as a country. The UAW is prepared to work with Congress and
the Biden Administration to meet this moment as we have throughout our

**Jimmy Williams, President, IUPAT:** ‚ÄúPresident Biden continued his
strong advocacy for the working class tonight during his State of the
Union Address. The President‚Äôs focus on bread and butter issues for the
IUPAT member, such as passing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act
(PRO Act), expanding registered apprenticeship programs, and creating a
comprehensive paid family and medical leave program are a breath of
fresh air. And our union stands ready from coast to coast to work on
projects which are funded by the historic infrastructure package
recently signed into law by President Biden, the largest infrastructure
bill passed in our nation‚Äôs history. His determination to lower
inflation, raise working standards, and give every worker the
opportunity to join or form a union shows his strong commitment to
creating an economy that works for all. Now is the time for the US
Congress to do their job and get these bills to his desk. The President
is echoing what IUPAT members have known for a long time: when we have
an economy that works for working people, our nation thrives.‚Äù

**Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers:**
‚ÄúTonight, Joe Biden proved why Americans were right to elect him as
president. He met a moment in history with gravity and empathy. He urged
unity to recover from the immense economic challenges of the pandemic,
with a laser focus on boosting wages and cutting costs to help American
families recover and thrive. And he made the case against the threat
posed by autocrats and those who excuse them, both here and abroad.
Democracy and freedom are worth fighting for‚Äîas the Ukrainian people are
showing us every day.The president laid out just how far we‚Äôve come in a
year‚Äîfrom closed schools, millions of COVID-19 cases and soaring
unemployment, to record growth, jobs, vaccines and the return of
reliable and safe in-person learning. But we are still dealing with the
pandemic‚Äôs terrible effects, and the president outlined a plan to curb
prices, increase pay and create a better economy that puts American
workmanship and creativity front and center and American workers first.
We commend his specific, practical measures that would reduce costs for
families right now, including child care, pre-K and prescription drugs.
And we echo the need to take rapid action on climate change after
yesterday‚Äôs U.N. warning that the world is at a tipping point. Our
members are on the frontlines of the pandemic, and we were honored to
have progressive care unit nurse Refynd Duro of Ohio in the audience
with the first lady tonight. Our healthcare heroes know what it will
take to emerge stronger and healthier. The health, well-being and
academic recovery of students is every teacher‚Äôs priority, and the
pandemic has multiplied the stresses and strains on us all. We share the
president‚Äôs concerns over the mental health crisis facing our young
people, including the negative effects of unbridled social media because
we live with the fallout every day. Our journey will be difficult, but
our direction is clear. And with the president‚Äôs leadership, now is the
time to broaden the tent‚Äîto unify and organize for a better life for all
Americans and to fight for and defend democracy, at home and around the
world.‚Äù

**Chris Shelton, President, CWA:** In his first State of the Union
address, President Biden made it clear that creating jobs through
investment in our country‚Äôs infrastructure and empowering workers has
been the foundation of his agenda to strengthen our country. CWA
commends President Biden for presenting a clear plan to improve the
lives of working families, boost our economy and address rising costs.
We agree that Congress must pass legislation to reduce prescription
drug, health care and child care costs and to make higher education more
affordable and that this can be done by making sure that corporations
and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. As union
members, we know that overcoming the relentless and coordinated
corporate attack on workers‚Äô rights is a difficult task and there is
much left to be done. President Biden left no doubt that he believes
that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to
organize or join a union, and the right to bargain collectively with
their employer, without fear of intimidation, coercion, threats, and
anti-union propaganda. He also pointed out the insufficiency of our
current labor laws, calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right
to Organize (PRO) Act. CWA applauds President Biden‚Äôs focus on worker
empowerment and we will continue to support the Administration in its
effort to create more good union jobs, support workers‚Äô organizing for
better pay and working conditions and reform weak and outdated labor
laws.

comes to accessing good-paying jobs that can support a family. As the

Biden‚Äôs initiatives to increase access to apprenticeships and training,
support paycheck fairness, provide paid family and medical leave, and
protect workers‚Äô rights to join a union. We believe this ‚Äì along with

they have earned and deserve. UFCW calls on Congress to take immediate
action to move these crucial initiatives forward.‚Äù

**Lee Saunders, President, AFSCME:** ‚ÄúWhen President Joe Biden took
office, COVID cases were soaring. Millions of Americans had lost their
jobs. The unemployment rate was well above 6%, and states and local
governing bodies were on the brink of budget crises. America has seen a
dramatic reversal. Today, we are diminishing COVID‚Äôs impact on our lives
through science. America is hiring again. And best of all, working
people have more power than ever, bolstered by an administration that
supports their right to organize and strike to demand better pay,
benefits and working conditions. How did President Biden get America
back on track? He listened to working people and then he delivered. When
public service workers ‚Äî the everyday heroes who have kept our
communities running throughout the pandemic ‚Äî had their jobs threatened
by budget cuts, President Biden showed leadership. By signing the
American Rescue Plan, he brought our public services back from the
brink, saving jobs and preventing waves of layoffs. He signed an
infrastructure bill that is making historic investments in our roads,
bridges, water systems and broadband. He has chosen Judge Ketanji Brown
Jackson, a jurist with an indisputable record of standing with working
people, as the first African American woman ever nominated to the
Supreme Court. He has rebuilt the federal judiciary with a diversity
never seen before, whether measured by professional background or by
race and gender. And with a revamped and empowered National Labor
Relations Board, workers can finally be confident that their rights will
be safeguarded, following four years in which they were gutted or just
ignored. But the State of the Union can‚Äôt just be about achievements so
far; tonight‚Äôs speech must answer the question of what comes next. We
must advance the rights and freedoms of both public and private sector
workers by passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and
the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. We must finally allow
Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, invest in child
care to support working families and providers alike, curb climate
change before it‚Äôs too late and ensure that the ultra-wealthy and large
corporations pay their fair share in taxes so we can make investments in
strong communities. And finally, our democracy is under attack. We must
respond in kind by protecting the right of every citizen to cast a
ballot and make it easier to vote. The foundation of our nation depends
on it. Working people want this administration to level the playing
field and deliver more fundamental change. Now is the time to get it
done.‚Äù

**Tom Conway, President, USW: ‚Äú**‚ÄúTonight, President Joe Biden
articulated a vision for the United States that puts working families at
the forefront of our nation‚Äôs economic future.¬†After two years of a
global pandemic and economic crisis in which we have seen the rich get
richer and too many workers continue to fall behind, the USW supports
President Biden‚Äôs agenda and looks forward to working with him and
others in Washington to put pro-worker, pro-family policies into action.
The president‚Äôs first year in office has already resulted in major
victories, including the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act and the creation of the White House Task Force on Worker
Organizing and Empowerment. These initiatives will help ensure
good-paying union jobs for millions of American workers in the years to
come. While the recent events in Ukraine clearly highlight our need to
focus on foreign as well as domestic priorities, we must remember that
to be strong around the world, we must first be strong at home. That
means bolstering domestic supply chains for vital goods, providing
education and job training to ensure that manufacturers have the skilled
workers they need, building up our health care system, passing labor
protections like the PRO Act and extending benefits like paid family and
medical leave to all workers. The president today laid out an ambitious
agenda that will make our nation more secure, provide good-paying jobs
to millions of workers, support struggling families, keep rising prices
under control and ensure that communities will continue to thrive for
generations to come. We are eager to do everything we can to help him
achieve these goals.‚Äù

many ways that his administration has addressed the needs of working

loopholes in existing Made in America requirements. Funds from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will facilitate economic development by
improving our transportation capacity and bringing high-speed internet
connections to communities across the country while creating good jobs
in the industry.

bipartisan majorities that passed the law in both houses of Congress are
proof that we can still work together. President Biden emphasized his

important tool to create jobs, secure supply chains and lower costs.
Since Biden entered office, the Iron Workers have seen an explosion of

citizenship for Dreamers, farmworkers, TPS holders, essential workers
and many other immigrants who have stood up for America during the
pandemic, which will only make America stronger. The vast majority of
Americans agree. These workers play a key role in fueling our economic
recovery, and legalizing immigrant workers with deep family and economic
ties to the United States will reduce labor shortages and supply chain
bottlenecks. The proof of the president‚Äôs commitment, though, will be in

**Rainbows for All Children:** ‚ÄúThe state of youth mental health is in
crisis. There is a shortage of mental health professionals in the United
States and financial barriers for families seeking mental health
services for their children. This is especially prevelant in minority
and vulnerable communities. Intervention is needed now in order to
mitigate the potential for another public health emergency if we ignore
the mental health needs of an entire generation of children. Rainbows
for All Children supports President Biden‚Äôs strategy to:‚Äúbuild system
capacity, connect more people to care, and provide support to
Americans.‚Äù The President‚Äôs plan specifically outlines support in
regards to our nation‚Äôs youth, which are in desperate need of increased
mental health care. All children deserve access to high-quality,
affordable, and culturally competent mental health care. Approximately
68% of children living in the United States (or 50 million children)
will experience a life-altering event triggering profound grief before
they turn 18 (known as an Adverse Childhood Experience). This including
death in the family, divorce, abandonment, military deployment of a
loved one, incarceration, or diagnosis of a life-threatening illness.
These children are at an increased risk for learning, emotional, and
behavioral issues; physical health problems; aggression; and substance
and alcohol abuse. These statistics have not been updated to recognize
the over 203,649 children who have experienced the loss of a parent or
caregiver to the COVID-19 pandemic, and time will only tell how our
children will respond to the shared trauma of the pandemic. Children
often do not have the ability to cope with their feelings and
experiences around a traumatic event or a loss. A child‚Äôs reactions to
Adverse Childhood Experiences can interfere with their daily life and
ability to function and interact with others. Symptoms can include
nightmares, depression, physical symptoms such as stomachaches and
headaches, self-harm, insomnia, fatigue, appetite disturbances, abrupt
changes in personality, poor emotional control, lack of motivation,
substance abuse, truancy, academic problems, peer problems, anxiety, and
more. Other children may hide their emotions, acting as though nothing
has happened. Long-term effects can continue to surface for decades to
come. Research has shown that Adverse Childhood Experiences are strongly
related to the development and prevalence of a wide range of behavioral
and health problems throughout a person‚Äôs lifespan, including substance
abuse, mental health issues, depression, obesity, learning and
behavioral issues, aggression, and more.However, the negative effects of
Adverse Childhood Experiences are preventable, and children can learn
coping skills to help them develop greater resiliency, which President
Biden‚Äôs addresses in his unity agenda. Assuring the healthy development
of all children is essential for societies seeking to achieve their full
health and potential. Finding early remedies to shared trauma and loss
is critical to the flourishing of our communities. We all need to work
harder to promote conditions that reduce or eliminate risky behavior and
develop healthy children. The founder of Rainbows, Suzy Yehl Marta, said
that she, ‚Äúwould never stop until every grieving child had a voice.‚Äù We
are committed to ensuring her mission lives on with the same compassion
and commitment, providing guided peer support to youth throughout 38
states and 12 countries at no cost to the children or families we
serve.‚Äù \[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**Schroeder Stribling, President and CEO, Mental Health America:**
‚ÄúMental Health America applauds President Biden for highlighting mental
health in tonight‚Äôs State of the Union and calling for all Americans to
have access to the mental health services they need. We had a
pre-existing mental health crisis in America before COVID-19 which the
pandemic has dramatically amplified. After two years of grief, loss, and
isolation, Americans are in desperate need of more mental health
supports and services. The strategy the White House has laid out in its
fact sheet is a necessary beginning ‚Äì and it will save lives. Their
approach will meet people where they are and will reduce disparities and
promote equity across the mental health landscape. Advancing equity in
mental health requires that everyone ‚Äì regardless of race, socioeconomic
status, gender identity or sexual orientation, geography, or any other
demographic ‚Äì has equal access to affordable, effective, and culturally
responsive mental health care. Through peer support, workforce
expansion, and social and human services provider training, we are
excited to see the Biden administration empowering community members to
take an active role in providing mental health support. The overwhelming
need for mental health support in this country cannot be met by the
current workforce alone. More than 50% of people will be diagnosed with
a mental health condition at some point in their lifetime, and many will
not receive any services until many years after first experiencing
symptoms. To that end, we appreciate the administration‚Äôs focus on
prevention and early intervention, including a commitment to early
childhood and school services and a more proactive approach to social
media.As more of the plan unfolds, we hope to see a fierce dedication to
mental health reforms in our public and private insurance programs. We
look forward to working with the administration on this new mental
health agenda.‚Äù

**Daniel H. Gillison, Jr., President, National Alliance on Mental
Illness (NAMI)**: ‚ÄúNAMI applauds President Biden for his unprecedented
focus on mental health in the State of the Union address, providing the
national attention that our ongoing mental health crisis deserves. From
expanding our mental health workforce and reimagining our response to
mental health crises to increasing access to care and supporting the
mental health of our youth and young adults, the President is proposing
bold investments in our mental health infrastructure. These investments
and policy solutions could not come at a more critical time. As our
mental health crisis continues to intensify at an alarming rate, we must
put bipartisan, common-sense solutions into practice. We thank the
President for his leadership in advancing this effort and we call upon
Congress to pass legislation meeting the nation‚Äôs mental health needs.‚Äù

**National Association of Peer Supporters (NAPS):** ‚ÄúThe National
Association of Peer Supporters, representing the nation‚Äôs Peer Support
Specialists, applauds President Biden and his Administration for
bringing attention and solutions to the mental health of our
nation‚Ä¶Presidential Administrations have played a critical role in
elevating the value that people with lived and living experience of
mental health and substance conditions and their families have in the
design, delivery, and evaluation of services. We celebrate the inclusion

profession.‚Äù \[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**American Association of Suicidology (AAS)**: ‚ÄúThe American Association
of Suicidology (AAS) expresses its gratitude to the Biden Administration
for taking action to address a number of critical mental health
initiatives and specifically addressing suicide in this bold, inclusive,
and comprehensive agenda. In 2018, we called on legislators and
lawmakers to fully fund suicide prevention at $1 billion annually ‚Äì this
public health-oriented agenda is finally on par with that request and
makes huge strides in meeting the scope of the problem head on. AAS has
consistently advocated for youth mental health programs and progressive
initiatives that allow young people in the US to access life-saving
care. Additionally, it‚Äôs promising to see this Administration directly
tackle the difficult issue of the intersection of social media with the
behavioral health of youth. While social media also carries many
advantages in allowing youth to connect with their peers and to provide
support, we‚Äôre happy to see the Administration target data collection
and other examples of users‚Äô digital shadows that can lead to potential
harm to this vulnerable population. At the beginning of the pandemic,
AAS highlighted the importance of behavioral health for our frontline
and healthcare workers and we praise the President for signing the
bipartisan Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act into law
‚Äúwhich will invest $135 million over three years into training health
care providers on suicide prevention and behavioral health while
launching an awareness campaign to address stigmatization, promote
help-seeking and self-care among this workforce.‚Äù Again, we applaud the
Administration in directly addressing the crisis infrastructure in this
country and for fully appreciating the scope of the problem, including
prevention, intervention, and outreach across the full continuum of
care. Over the last few years, AAS has consistently played a role in
developing legislation to further advance the creation and
implementation of 988. AAS is the home of many members in the crisis
services industry as well as providing accreditation for over a hundred
crisis centers taking part in the 988 and National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline network. As such, we‚Äôve strongly advocated for funding crisis
centers to fully provide the capacity to meet the demand of the
impending volume of contacts through 988. This Administration‚Äôs agenda
takes another major step in the direction of ensuring this will take
place and we could not be more grateful. We look forward to continuing
to collaborate with this Administration and other suicide prevention and
mental health organizations to reduce suicides in this country.‚Äù
\[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**Eating Disorders Coalition:**¬†‚ÄúSocial media has fueled the pediatric
mental health crisis and has been conducting a ‚Äúnational experiment‚Äù on
our children for years. Platform algorithms knowingly promote harmful
eating disorders and other mental health content to youth in return for
boosted engagement and profits. Sadly, social media platforms have
increasingly taken advantage of youth during the pandemic as isolation
has spawned increased social media usage. In particular, social media
algorithms have placed extreme eating disorder, depression, and
self-harm content next to youth-targeted advertising and served these
messages to vulnerable users to maximize engagement and spending.
Frequent and prolonged social media use has been correlated with
depressed mood and negative appearance comparison in youth, leading to
increased risk of disordered eating. These impacts have been reflected
in eating disorder emergency room hospitalizations for teen girls
increasing by 50% since 2019.1 While sharing steps to address the
effects of social media platform predation, President Biden will also
focus on preventive action to create accountability for social media
platforms under the administration‚Äôs existing authority.‚Äù

**Jim Steyer, Founder and CEO, Common Sense:** ‚ÄúThe significance of the
President‚Äôs State of the Union message about our national mental health
crisis cannot be overstated. Kids and teens are suffering from mental
health issues at alarming rates, exacerbated by the pandemic and also by
social media platforms that have seized the opportunity to keep kids
addicted to screens at all costs. The American people want to see the
government act to protect them and their children. If Congress and the
President work together now to, as the president called for, strengthen
children‚Äôs privacy and ban targeted advertising for children online,
stop discriminatory algorithmic decision-making that limits
opportunities for young Americans, and invest in research on social
media‚Äôs mental harms, it would be a game-changer for creating a better
and safer online world for kids, teens, and all consumers.‚Äù \[Statement,

new era of health equity‚Äîone that will save countless lives. By

### Progressives

**Danielle Melfi, Executive Director, Building Back Together:**
‚ÄúTonight, President Biden made clear that even as we faced unprecedented
crises in the last year, America is stronger and more resilient today
than we were when he took office. In his speech, the President
emphasized America‚Äôs leadership in rallying our allies to stand up for
democracy and with the Ukrainian people by enacting swift and severe
costs on Russia in the face of Putin‚Äôs premeditated war. President Biden
also highlighted the significant steps the Biden-Harris Administration
has taken to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and build our economy from the
bottom up and the middle out ‚Äî not the top down. Under President Biden‚Äôs
leadership, we have the tools to keep Americans safe and fight COVID-19,
have laid the groundwork for a historic economic recovery that has
already created millions of jobs, and have leaders in the White House
who are using every tool at their disposal to bring down costs for
working families. Through the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris
Administration secured relief funding to get shots in arms, safely
reopen schools, and get Americans back to work. The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, which President Biden signed into law in November,
is already delivering much-needed investments to create good-paying jobs
rebuilding America with goods that are made in America. And the
President is just getting started. Along with these historic
accomplishments, President Biden underscored the importance of unity as
we turn to the work that lies ahead. He knows, as we do, that there is
more that unites us than divides us, and that there is nothing Americans
can‚Äôt do when we do it together. As the President said tonight, ‚ÄòIt is
never a good bet to bet against the American people.‚Äô In the coming
months, working and middle class Americans can trust that the
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to build on the progress made
so far and rebuild a stronger America for all of us.‚Äù \[Statement,

**Margarida Jorge, Executive Director, Health Care for America Now:**
‚ÄúPresident Biden‚Äôs proposals in his State of the Union address would
significantly lower the cost of prescription drugs and insurance
premiums, crucial steps to rein in out-of-pocket costs for families
dealing with inflationary price increases for everyday necessities. The
President also recognizes that corporations and the wealthiest
Americans, who have seen their gains skyrocket during the pandemic, can
do more to pay their fair share of taxes and support expanded access to
health care and other services that help average families make ends
meet.President Biden has delivered on his promises to increase access to
affordable health care, create jobs and update basic infrastructure like
roads, broadband and water systems in his first year as president. As
many as 5 million more Americans have gained access to health care,
COVID-19 tests and vaccines have been distributed widely, and families
around the country have received much-needed financial relief payments.
What‚Äôs more, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act he
signed will further boost our economy and provide long-overdue
improvements in transportation, clean air and water and the expansion of
telehealth services that make doctor‚Äôs appointments and treatments more
convenient and accessible. Congress should finish the job by passing the
rest of President Biden‚Äôs broadly popular proposals to negotiate lower
prescription drug prices, close the Medicaid coverage gap and make
affordable health care premiums permanent.‚Äù

unjustified attack on Ukraine. He unified Republicans and Democrats in
Washington to make long overdue repairs and improvements in American
roads, bridges, airports, broadband and other infrastructure. And he
unified the scientific and business communities to bring us through the
most devastating public health crisis in a century, with explosive job
growth and a gradual but safe return to our normal routines. And he has
done it despite the pollsters, pundits and performers who have tried
their darndest to bully him and make him fail. So I congratulate the

COVID-19 pandemic, these issues are of critical importance, impacting

**US Dairy Export Council President and CEO Krysta Harden:** ‚ÄúWe are
grateful to President Biden and his administration for bringing the

**National Milk Producers Federation President and CEO:** ‚ÄúThroughout
2020 and 2021, American dairy producers and cooperatives have faced
unprecedented challenges in moving dairy exports from plants to ships
due in key part to the actions of the ocean carrier industry. The last
year has clearly shown that changes are needed to tackle the
unreasonable power shipping vessel owners have over America‚Äôs
agricultural exporters working hard to get their goods to foreign
markets. U.S. dairy exporters have been forced to endure unfair
practices, including last minute changes, increased costs, and other
unwarranted charges and penalties. Effective enforcement of the Shipping
Act is long overdue particularly as ocean carriers enjoy record
profits.‚Äù

commitment, but if we continue to communicate productively and with

the nation and rural communities.¬† Our elected leaders must build upon
the progress that has been made this past year in combatting Covid-19,
improving our infrastructure, creating jobs, and fighting global threats
to democracy. We must work together to fight inflation, get our kids

opioid epidemic and mental health crisis, put in place the support
working families need‚Äîlike affordable prescription drugs and
childcare‚Äîand ensure we are creating the necessary pathways for our
future workforce to drive our economy and keep American jobs here at
home. As the President stated in his address and we witnessed by the
bipartisan applause tonight, ‚ÄúWe agree on a lot more things than we
acknowledge.‚Äù Congress must move forward with this in mind and pass
meaningful legislation that addresses the key issues facing our nation.

**National Rural Health Association:** ‚ÄúNRHA has been pleased to see a
focus on rural communities in activities early in the President‚Äôs term,
recognizing that for too long rural communities have faced
underinvestment and persistent poverty. Significant investments in rural
through the American Rescue plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure plan
include addressing rural health coverage gaps, keeping rural hospitals
open, rural healthcare workforce shortages, as well as maintaining and
expanding telehealth. These are in line with NRHA‚Äôs advocacy focus since
the onset of the Biden Presidency, and we‚Äôre excited to hear additional
details about future proposals. Tonight, President Biden is expected to
discuss his new strategy to address the national mental health crisis.
Rural America suffers from the effects of long-standing rural shortages
of specialty mental health services, long travel distances to obtain
treatment, and stigma and cultural/ societal attitudes about efforts to
ensure access to the full range of behavioral health services. This
fall, NRHA provided comments to the Senate Finance Committee‚Äôs request
for information on mental health care. Upon initial review of the
President‚Äôs proposed mental health strategy, NRHA is pleased to see many
of our recommendations reflected in this new initiative especially
around investing in a strong behavioral health workforce, integration of
behavioral health and primary care, and addressing the opioid crisis.‚Äù

### Women and Families Advocates

**Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director and CEO, MomsRising:** ‚ÄúAt
this time when the country‚Äôs moms and families are struggling with the
pandemic, fast-rising prices, and our need to create the kind of care
infrastructure every country needs, we are very pleased to learn
President Biden will take time during his State of the Union address
tomorrow night to discuss the importance of lowering families‚Äô costs ‚Äì
including child care, pre-K, and prescription drugs ‚Äì and adopting a
comprehensive national paid leave program, as well as ensuring paycheck
fairness, raising the minimum wage, and providing direct tax relief to
struggling families. These are the policies that matter most to
America‚Äôs moms because they support economic security and stability for
families, strengthen businesses, and help our economy thrive. President
Biden and Vice President Harris are delivering the leadership America‚Äôs
moms want and need. The U.S. Senate must step up now. For America‚Äôs
moms, care simply can‚Äôt wait any longer.‚Äù

**Alexis McGill Johnson, President, Planned Parenthood:** ‚ÄúAs state
legislatures across the country escalate relentless attacks on abortion
rights and the Supreme Court gearing up to rule on a case this spring
that could overturn Roe v. Wade, we need President Biden and all our
leaders to step up and fight back. We thank the president for making
important calls tonight to protect reproductive, LGBTQ+ and voting
rights, advance maternal health, expand health care access, and to
confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Now is the time to
be as bold and strong as possible. We are at a breaking point for
reproductive freedom, and we need lawmakers at all levels of government
to act. There is no more time to waste.‚Äù \[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**Sarah Rittling, Executive Director, First Five Years Fund (FFYF):**
‚ÄúThe president‚Äôs message tonight was clear: child care and early
learning should be included in whatever reconciliation package Congress
sends to his desk for signature. President Biden understands that the
high cost and limited supply of child care and pre-K has held working
families back for too long. We have an opportunity to provide relief to
parents and build an early learning system that meets the needs of
families, providers, and our economy. So as we think about addressing
today‚Äôs challenges and building a stronger economic future for this
country, there‚Äôs no question that early care and education must be
central to the conversation. It‚Äôs time we address America‚Äôs early
learning crisis head on to ensure children have the opportunity to start
kindergarten ready to learn, and parents know that they can contribute
to our economic recovery without the added worry of whether they find
quality, affordable care for their children. The good news is that we
have never been closer to passing strong, federal legislation to fortify
America‚Äôs child care and early learning sector. We F look forward to
continuing to work with Congress and heed the President‚Äôs call this
evening to enact these desperately-needed reforms and investments.‚Äù
\[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**Jordan Brooks, Executive Director, United State of Women:** ‚ÄúToday,
the United State of Women feels heard. During the State of the Union
address, the President showcased the progress we‚Äôve made to emerge from
this pandemic, and his deep commitment to continuing to build an economy
and a country where women can succeed. In a time of crisis, he offered a
message of unity and hope.¬† Tonight, the President laid out a vision for
our nation where childcare doesn‚Äôt break the bank, where everyone has
paid family leave to take care of a child or loved one, and where we
finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. In the face of unprecedented
attacks on abortion access, the President reaffirmed his commitment to
protecting and advancing reproductive justice and maternal health care.
He urged Congress to pass critical legislation to extend the child tax
credit, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, protect voting
rights, and raise the minimum wage. As we said in our letter to Congress
this week, women don‚Äôt live our lives in silos ‚Äì we need all of these
policies to build a country where women and families can thrive. We
stand ready to work with the President and with Congress to get this
agenda passed. The women, girls and families of our country are counting
on us.‚Äù \[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**Miriam Calder√≥n, Chief Policy¬†Officer, ZERO TO THREE:** ‚ÄúTonight,
before the nation, President Biden spoke directly to the importance of
investing in our families and the care economy. For too long, parents
have been burdened with painfully high child care costs while providers
struggle to stay in business or care for their own families, have not
had the paid leave they need to bond with their new baby or heal from
childbirth, and have lacked access to the resources they need for their
families to thrive. Families are consistently forced to make impossible
choices between caring for young children or a loved one and putting
food on the table. But as the President made clear tonight, we can and
will fight to ensure that we are giving all families what they need to
help their children thrive. We made great strides last year to support
parents with young children through historic investments in child care
and the expansion of the Child Tax Credit, but there is too much at
stake to let up now. It is past time for Congress to reengage on these
critical issues for our infants and toddlers, and we echo President
Biden‚Äôs call for them to do so at once. Additionally, we were heartened
to hear the President highlight the importance of mental health for all
ages during tonight‚Äôs address. Our systems were not built with the
mental health needs of babies and toddlers in mind. We look forward to
working with the Administration and Congress to make certain that young
children and their caregivers are at the center of this new plan.‚Äù

**Marcela Howell, In Our Voice, National Black Women‚Äôs Reproductive
Justice Agenda:** ‚ÄúWe were overjoyed on January 20, 2021, as we watched
a new administration being sworn in. We voted for change and cheered
when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, a Black and Asian woman, were sworn in
as president and vice president of the United States. We were looking
forward to the changes that would help families thrive whether they
lived in cities, suburbs, or rural areas. We applauded as President
Biden took steps to restore civil and human rights that were weakened or
destroyed by the last administration. But the president is not an
island, he needs the support and partnership of Congress to effect
deep-rooted and sustainable change. Instead, conservatives in Congress,
especially in the U.S. Senate, have shamefully obstructed the president
and his administration, particularly on civil and human rights
initiatives.\[[Statement,](https://blackrj.org/black-women-applaud-biden-harris-administrations-leadership-on-civil-and-human-rights-demand-congress-defend-the-constitution/)

**National Domestic Workers Alliance, Caring Across Generations, and
Care in Action:** ‚ÄúPresident Biden‚Äôs first State of the Union Address
outlined in stark detail the challenges facing our country and concrete
steps we can take towards a brighter future for working people. Now, it
is critical that Congress do its part. The President‚Äôs plan to make a
historic investment in the future of our care infrastructure has now
been stalled in Congress for several months. Family caregivers and care
workers are beyond exhausted physically, emotionally and financially and
have had to duct-tape together care for their children, older family
members and loved ones with disabilities. This investment will provide
much-needed relief for home care workers who have sacrificed so much
throughout the pandemic and the families who depend on their care. There
are common sense steps Congress can take to lessen the economic pain
that our country will face in the coming months. As President Biden
outlined in his address, investing in workers and their families,
lowering costs for families by investing in home and community based
services, cutting childcare costs for families, and passing a federal
paid leave policy are critical to an economy that works for all of us,
not just the wealthy. It‚Äôs time for Congress to stand behind the
President and realize the potential of an economy that centers care and
allows all workers to provide for their families without the worry of
making impossible choices.‚Äù \[[Joint

**Mini Timmarju, President, NARAL:** ‚ÄúPresident Biden‚Äôs State of the
Union comes at a moment when the stakes for reproductive freedom could
not be higher. The constitutional right to abortion is hanging on by a
thread and state lawmakers across the country are determined to
eviscerate abortion access through a barrage of bans and restrictions.
It‚Äôs clear that the Biden-Harris administration recognizes that
reproductive freedom is under attack and this moment requires bold
action. We‚Äôre grateful that President Biden noted this pivotal moment
for our movement during his address.‚Äù

**Amanda Brown Lierman, Executive Director, Supermajority:** ‚ÄúWomen are
the backbone of our democracy. We came together across age, race, and
background to vote President Biden into office with a mandate to
prioritize the issues that we care about. We‚Äôve raised our voices to
demand paid leave, affordable child care, reproductive freedom, and
voting rights. Tonight, President Biden made it clear that he will
continue working to answer our call to build a better country for our
daughters than the one we inherited. With the historic nomination of
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court of the United States,
President Biden took a giant step towards ensuring that our government
represents us at every level. He fulfilled a crucial campaign promise to
nominate a Black woman to our country‚Äôs highest court, and Judge Jackson
will be a vital advocate for our rights on the bench. We are also
heartened by his successful appointment of more than 40 federal judges,
including numerous brilliant women, who represent the diversity of our
country. We are encouraged by President Biden‚Äôs commitment to helping
working families, which will provide women‚Äîespecially women of
color‚Äîrelief we need to recover from the pandemic. We look forward to
President Biden delivering for the millions of women who voted him into
office by fulfilling his promise to work with Congress to lower costs
for all Americans. We still have work to do. We will continue to push
for paid leave, because no woman should have to choose between caring
for herself or a loved one and earning a paycheck. We will continue to
advocate for legislation protecting the freedom to vote, which is
critical for the health of our democracy, our representation, and our
progress. And we will keep fighting for our reproductive freedom, which
has never been in greater danger. We will continue to demand a world
where our lives, bodies, work, and families are valued and our
government represents us. Women are the supermajority of voters in
America, and we are powerful. We will not rest until our voices are
heard and progress is made.‚Äù \[Statement, 3/1/22\]

**Kristin McGuire, Executive Director, Young Invicibles:** ‚ÄúThe
President addressed the nation tonight with a backdrop of global crisis,

**Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD):¬†**‚ÄúPresident Biden

request to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by more than $2,000 to

**United Negro College Fund (UNCF):** ‚ÄúIn Tuesday‚Äôs State of the Union
message, President Biden will call on Congress to increase funding for
Pell Grants for students and funding specifically for historically Black
colleges and universities (HBCUs). The Biden administration will push
for a $2,000 increase to the maximum for a Pell Grant, which is the
nation‚Äôs effort to assist students coming from lower socio-economic
backgrounds to fund their higher education pursuits. Increasing HBCU
funding is a priority on which the Biden-Harris White House and UNCF
have long collaborated. ‚ÄúThis is a continuation of our shared goals,‚Äù
said Dr. Michael L. Lomax, president and CEO of UNCF. ‚ÄúWe have worked
with this White House, even before they moved in, to formulate these
asks. I applaud the president for including both HBCUs and a Pell Grant
increase in his State of the Union address, and I hope both items will
be championed by both sides of the aisle.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is historic,‚Äù said Lodriguez V. Murray, senior vice president for
public policy and government affairs at UNCF. ‚ÄúFor the president of the
United States to not only mention HBCUs in his State of the Union
address, but to call for increased funding along with joining our effort
to increase, and hopefully soon double the Pell Grant, is something we
cannot help but be excited about. ‚ÄúIt is rare in Washington for a leader
to stand by priorities. It is rarer for HBCUs to be that priority.
President Biden is really showing that he stands with students from
vulnerable backgrounds and the institutions that best serve their needs,
and those are HBCUs.¬† UNCF hopes Congress will pass the FY 2022
appropriations bills at the highest levels for HBCUs and the Pell Grant,
and then let‚Äôs do even better in FY 2023.‚Äù
