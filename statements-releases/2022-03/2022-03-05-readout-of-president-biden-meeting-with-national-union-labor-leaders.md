Today, President Biden and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh met with 39
national union labor leaders. The President and Secretary Walsh met with
labor leaders to discuss issues impacting union members and how the
administration can help support working Americans. 

The President thanked the labor presidents for their support and
outlined the steps the administration has taken to help union members in
the first year of the administration. Secretary Walsh spoke of the need
to work collaboratively to empower American workers and underscored the
President’s support for strong unions as key to the middle class. The
group further discussed the unprecedented economic growth and jobs
numbers which announced 678,000 jobs added in February and a 3.8% drop
in the unemployment rate, a total of 7.4 millions jobs added since the
start of the administration. 

The group discussed the wide range of accomplishments of the
administration thus far creating union jobs and protecting Davis-Bacon
provisions, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American
Rescue Plan. The group echoed their thanks to the President, the
Secretary and the Administration officials for the historic investment
the administration has made in American workers.
