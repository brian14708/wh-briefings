title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Justice Department Naming a Chief\
  \ Pandemic\_Prosecutor"
---
 
In my State of the Union address, I made clear that we must conduct
strong oversight and robust criminal enforcement of pandemic fraud. And
I announced that the Department of Justice commitment would name a chief
prosecutor for pandemic fraud — a watchdog to go after the criminals who
stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and working
Americans.  Today, I applaud the Justice Department for moving forward
so swiftly to fill that role.   
   
In the early days of the pandemic, the previous Administration
consistently undermined the watchdogs whose job it was to keep relief
funds from being wasted or abused.  Emergency loans that were supposed
to help small businesses keep the lights on and keep employees on the
payroll were siphoned off by wealthy scammers.  Foreign and domestic
criminal syndicates intercepted benefits meant for Americans in dire
need of relief.  Reports of identity theft spiked by 3,000 percent from
2019 to 2020 — and far too many working families bore the brunt of this
unchecked fraud.  
   
The watchdogs are back.  The COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force has
already initiated more than 1,000 criminal cases, aiming to recover
billions of dollars for the American people.  We are taking the same
meticulous approach that I employed when President Obama put me in
charge of overseeing the Recovery Act in 2009. My administration is
working with the oversight community to help put in place tools to
prevent fraud in areas like small business loans and unemployment
insurance.  With a Chief Pandemic Prosecutor now in place, the
Department of Justice will escalate our efforts to crack down on bad
actors — and take all efforts to seize relief money stolen from American
families, businesses, and schools during the last Administration and
deliver it back to the American people.
