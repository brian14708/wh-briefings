title: The American Rescue Plan People Difference
---
 
*ARP powered historic jobs recovery – with the largest calendar increase
in jobs on record, unemployment down to 3.8%, and record drops in
Hispanic Unemployment and Youth Unemployment – and ensured less scarring
than any recovery in memory.  
*  
**<u>Lowering Health Care Costs and Increasing Health Coverage</u>**

-   **<u>14.5 million Americans</u>** – **the most ever** – signed up
    for ACA marketplace plans due to, on average, **<u>50% lower costs
    in premiums</u>** for returning consumers.
    -   Nationwide, existing consumers with a new or updated plan
        selection after ARP saved an average of $67 (or 50%) per
        consumer per month on premiums, totaling $537 million per month
        in savings. **<u>In twenty states and the District of Columbia,
        existing consumers saved over $75 per month</u>**, on average,
        due to the ARP.  
-   **<u>5.8 million more Americans have health insurance today than a
    year ago.</u>** Between 2016 and 2019, 3.6 million Americans
    **<u>lost</u>** coverage.  
-   **<u>A family of four is saving an average of $2,400 on their annual
    premiums.</u>** Four out of five consumers could find quality
    coverage for under $10 a month.  

**<u>Investing in Mental Health:</u>**

-   **<u>$3 billion invested in expanding access to mental health</u>**
    and substance use services at the state level – **<u>largest
    one-time investment in history</u>** for mental health and substance
    use programs.  
-   **<u>Billions more in American Rescue Plan funding are being used to
    address mental health challenges affecting our children</u>**,
    including through hiring school social workers and counselors. With
    the help of American Rescue Plan K-12 funding, schools have already
    seen a 65% increase in social workers, and a 17% increase in
    counselors. 

**<u>Fighting COVID</u>**

-   Distributed **<u>200 million vaccines,</u>** and millions of
    therapeutics using ARP dollars.  
-   **<u>375 million at-home tests per month</u>** now available; before
    ARP, no at-home tests.  
-   **<u>$14.5 billion</u>** to address COVID for America’s veterans,
    including support for 37,000 homeless veterans.

**<u>Getting Kids Back in School</u>**

    46% of schools were open</u>** **<u>in-person.  
    </u>**
-   **Major Investments in Keeping Schools Open, Combatting Learning
    Loss & Addressing Mental Health Challenges:** Independent experts
    estimate based on school district plans that 59% of school districts
    are using ARP funds to hire/retain teachers and counselors, 35% are
    using ARP funds to hire/retain psychologists and mental health
    staff, and 52% are using ARP funds for HVAC and ventilation.

    **<u>82% of superintendents plan to use funds to expand social,
    emotional, mental and physical health</u>** and development.

    -   Expanded $3,000 credit for kids age 6-17 and $3,600 for kids
        under 6
    -   Experts estimate that the **Child Tax Credit was the main driver

        poverty.  
-   **<u>Economic Impact Payments for Vast Majority of Americans</u>**
    -   **Over 170 million Economic Impact Payments to 85% of all**

        payments to Social Security beneficiaries, 3 million payments to
        SSI beneficiaries, and 320,000 payments to Veterans**</u>* who
        would not have received these benefits under normal tax filing
        requirements.

-   **<u>Unprecedented Emergency Rental Relief and Eviction
    Prevention</u>**
    -   **<u>Over 4 million</u>** **<u>Emergency Rental Assistance
        payments to tenants in a single year</u>** – by orders of
        magnitude the largest eviction prevention effort in history.
