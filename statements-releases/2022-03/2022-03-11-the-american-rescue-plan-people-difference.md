*ARP powered historic jobs recovery – with the largest calendar increase
in jobs on record, unemployment down to 3.8%, and record drops in
Hispanic Unemployment and Youth Unemployment – and ensured less scarring
than any recovery in memory.  
*  
**<u>Lowering Health Care Costs and Increasing Health Coverage</u>**

-   **<u>14.5 million Americans</u>** – **the most ever** – signed up
    for ACA marketplace plans due to, on average, **<u>50% lower costs
    in premiums</u>** for returning consumers.
    -   Nationwide, existing consumers with a new or updated plan
        selection after ARP saved an average of $67 (or 50%) per
        consumer per month on premiums, totaling $537 million per month
        in savings. **<u>In twenty states and the District of Columbia,
        existing consumers saved over $75 per month</u>**, on average,
        due to the ARP.  
-   **<u>5.8 million more Americans have health insurance today than a
    year ago.</u>** Between 2016 and 2019, 3.6 million Americans
    **<u>lost</u>** coverage.  
-   **<u>A family of four is saving an average of $2,400 on their annual
    premiums.</u>** Four out of five consumers could find quality
    coverage for under $10 a month.  

**<u>Investing in Mental Health:</u>**

-   **<u>$3 billion invested in expanding access to mental health</u>**
    and substance use services at the state level – **<u>largest
    one-time investment in history</u>** for mental health and substance
    use programs.  
-   **<u>Billions more in American Rescue Plan funding are being used to
    address mental health challenges affecting our children</u>**,
    including through hiring school social workers and counselors. With

    seen a 65% increase in social workers, and a 17% increase in
    counselors. 

**<u>Fighting COVID</u>**

-   Distributed **<u>200 million vaccines,</u>** and millions of
    therapeutics using ARP dollars.

    including support for 37,000 homeless veterans.

**<u>Getting Kids Back in School</u>**

    Loss & Addressing Mental Health Challenges:** Independent experts
    estimate based on school district plans that 59% of school districts
    are using ARP funds to hire/retain teachers and counselors, 35% are
    using ARP funds to hire/retain psychologists and mental health
    staff, and 52% are using ARP funds for HVAC and ventilation.

    Prevention</u>**

        magnitude the largest eviction prevention effort in history.
