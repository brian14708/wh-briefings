Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, Julie
Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, and
Danielle Conley, Deputy White House Counsel, hosted a roundtable
discussion with Florida reproductive rights advocates and elected
leaders to discuss Florida’s House Bill 5, which severely restricts
access to abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The bill is expected to
pass soon and become law.  

During the meeting, Florida leaders shared their efforts opposing HB 5
and the steps they are taking to support women’s access to reproductive
health care. Senior Administration Officials emphasized the
Administration’s support of Floridians’ reproductive rights and thanked
the leaders for their efforts. They also discussed the larger trend of
state laws restricting access to critical reproductive health care in
states across the country. To date, over 265 bills restricting access to
abortion have been filed during the 2022 legislative session. This week
marked six months since Texas law SB 8 went into effect, a law that
violates Texans’ constitutional rights under *Roe v. Wade*. In the face
of these challenges, Administration Officials reiterated the
Administration’s commitment to exploring every option to protect
reproductive health care.

In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Biden declared
that the constitutional right affirmed by *Roe v. Wade* is under attack
as never before and reiterated his commitment to protecting women’s
access to health care.
