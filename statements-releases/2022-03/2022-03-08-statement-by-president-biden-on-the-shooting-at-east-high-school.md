title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Shooting at East High\_School"
---
 
Yesterday afternoon, as the school day was coming to a close, three
students were shot in a drive-by shooting outside East High School in
Des Moines, Iowa. One young man—just 15 years old—was tragically killed.
Jill and I pray for his family and for everyone impacted by yet another
senseless act of gun violence.

A half dozen suspects have been arrested for their alleged involvement
in the shooting, and we are grateful to Des Moines law enforcement and
first responders for their quick work and professionalism.

But these swift arrests cannot obscure the reality that too many
families have had to bury a piece of their soul after yet another tragic
shooting. It comes less than a month after we marked four years since
the shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,
Florida, and three months after the shooting at Oxford High School in
Oakland County, Michigan. Between these tragedies are shootings that
happen every day without making headlines.

Enough. Our young people should be safe in and around school, in their
neighborhoods, and in their homes. Every American should be able to
visit a house of worship, a grocery store, a night club, or any other
place without fear of being gunned down. That too many cannot is a stain
on our national character and an urgent call to action.

Last June, I put forward a comprehensive national strategy to reduce gun
violence. In carrying out this strategy, I have taken more executive
action to reduce gun violence than any other president in their first
year in office—more than a dozen necessary actions, from cracking down
on gun trafficking and rogue gun dealers, to promoting safe firearm
storage, to reining in the proliferation of hard-to-trace “ghost guns”
that can be bought online and made at home.  Now, Congress must do its
job. As I reiterated in my State of the Union address last week, it is
up to Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence—including
universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity
magazines, and a repeal of the liability shield protecting gun
manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets. These
laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment, but they will save lives.  
May God bless the lives that have been lost or forever altered.
