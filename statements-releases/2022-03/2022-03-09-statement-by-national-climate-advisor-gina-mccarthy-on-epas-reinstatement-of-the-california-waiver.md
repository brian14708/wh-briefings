title: "Statement by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy on EPA\u2019s Reinstatement\
  \ of the California Waiver"
---
 
For more than 30 years, the Clean Air Act has provided California with
an ability to set standards that control of emissions from new motor
vehicles or new motor vehicle engines. And since that time, California
has worked hand-in-hand with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) to drive life-saving air pollution reductions, while spurring
invention and investment in technologies and materials that enable the
next generation of motor vehicles.  
  
Building on the momentum from California’s 2020 Framework Agreement on
Clean Cars, the EPA set the most ambitious motor vehicle emissions
standards in history and today, reinstated the California Waiver.
Together, these steps provide the opportunity for the Biden-Harris
Administration and the State of California under Governor Newsom’s
leadership, to once again move forward in the direction of a harmonized
national program that will benefit families all across America.
