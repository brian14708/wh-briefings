***United States sanctions over 400 Russian elites, Duma members, and
defense companies in coordination with the European Union and G7; U.S.
has now sanctioned over 600 targets***  
   
***G7 and EU announce sanctions evasion initiative to prevent
circumvention and backfilling of our unprecedented sanctions; continue
to blunt Central Bank of the Russian Federation’s ability to deploy
international reserves including gold***

President Biden is in Europe to continue our historic coordination with
allies and partners on all aspects of our response to Russia’s war
against Ukraine, including imposing further severe costs on those
enabling President Putin’s war of choice. Today, the United States is
sanctioning over 400 individuals and entities comprised of Russian
elites, the Duma and more than 300 of its members, and defense
companies, aligning and strengthening our sanctions in close
coordination and partnership with the EU and G7.   
   
Our sanctions on Russia are unprecedented — in no other circumstance
have we moved so swiftly and in such a coordinated fashion to impose
devastating costs on any other country. The ruble has depreciated
substantially, and is expected by markets to weaken further. The Moscow
Stock Exchange closed for weeks. The Central Bank of the Russian
Federation has doubled interest rates to 20 percent and companies are
being forced to turn over foreign exchange for rubles to provide the
Russian Government hard currency. The economy is forecast to contract as
much as 15 percent or more in 2022. This economic collapse of Russia’s
GDP will wipe out the past 15 years of economic gains in Russia,
according to the Institute for International Finance. Inflation in
Russia is already spiking, with analysts projecting it to rise up to 15
percent on a year-over-year basis, and the Russian Government has been
downgraded to “junk” status by major credit rating agencies. More than
400 multinational companies have left Russia in a mass exodus by the
private sector.   
   
As long as President Putin continues this war, the United States and
allies and partners are committed to ensuring the Russian government
feels the compounding effects of our current and future economic
actions.   
   
Today’s actions include:   
  
**Full blocking sanctions on more than 400 individuals and entities,
including the Duma and its members, additional Russian elites, and
Russian defense companies that fuel Putin’s war machine.** This
includes: 

-   328 Duma members and sanctioning the Duma as an entity.
-   Herman Gref, the head of Russia’s largest financial institution
    Sberbank and a Putin advisor since the 1990s. 
-   Russian elite Gennady Timchenko, his companies and his family
    members.
-   17 board members of Russian financial institution Sovcombank.
-   48 Large Russian defense state-owned enterprises that are part of
    Russia’s defense-industrial base and produce weapons that have been
    used in Russia’s assault against Ukraine’s people, infrastructure,
    and territory, including Russian Helicopters, Tactical Missiles
    Corporation, High Precision Systems, NPK Tekhmash OAO, Kronshtadt.
    We are targeting, and will continue to target, the suppliers of
    Russia’s war effort and, in turn, their supply chain.

**Establishment of an initiative focused on sanctions evasions. **G7
leaders and the European Union today announced an initiative to share
information about and coordinate responses related to evasive measures
intended to undercut the effectiveness and impact of our joint sanctions
actions. Together, we will not allow sanctions evasion or backfilling.
As part of this effort, we will also engage other governments on
adopting sanctions similar to those already imposed by the G7 and other
partners.   
   
**Continuing to blunt the Central Bank’s ability to deploy international
reserves, including gold, to prop up the Russian economy and fund
Putin’s brutal war. **G7 leaders and the European Union will continue to
work jointly to blunt Russia’s ability to deploy its international
reserves to prop up Russia’s economy and fund Putin’s war, including by
making clear that any transaction involving gold related to the Central
Bank of the Russian Federation is covered by existing sanctions.
