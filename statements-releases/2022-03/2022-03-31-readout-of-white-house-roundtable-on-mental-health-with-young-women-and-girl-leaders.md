On the last day of Women’s History Month, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan
Rice and Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein hosted a
roundtable at the White House with young women leading their
communities in improving mental health. Participants were joined by
the leadership of national girl’s advocacy organizations, each of which
have prioritized mental health policy and supported young women
leaders tackling this issue.

With studies continuing to highlight the toll that the COVID-19 pandemic
has taken on youth mental health, participants shared their experiences
and insight into the unique mental health challenges that women and
girls face. The young women leaders also shared policy recommendations
for strengthening mental health for girls, including the need to meet
girls where they areand the importance of reducing stigma and
other barriers that make it difficult for young women and girls to
access mental health services. 

Senior White House officials reinforced the Administration’s commitment
to addressing our mental health crisis, a core pillar of the Unity
Agenda that President Biden outlined in his State of the Union Address.
This commitment includes: increasing the size and diversity of the
mental health workforce; expandingcoverage and reducing costs for mental
health services; and integrating mental health care and services across
settings, from schools to community centers.  Senior White House
officials emphasized that the President’s FY23 budget proposes a
historic$829 million to strengthen and advance youth mental
health. They also discussed the Administration’s work to address the
mental health impacts of social media, including addressing the
intersection of online harassment and abuse and gender-based violence, a
commitment that is part of the first-ever U.S. government National
Gender Strategy released by the Biden-Harris Administration last fall.
