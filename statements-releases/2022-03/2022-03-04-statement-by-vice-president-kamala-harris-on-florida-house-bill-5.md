title: Statement by Vice President Kamala Harris on Florida House Bill 5
---
 
Last night, the Florida Senate passed House Bill 5, which effectively
bans access to abortions after 15 weeks. This bill is extreme by any
standard.    
  
The right of women to make decisions about their own bodies is
non-negotiable. If signed into law, Florida’s bill would violate the
constitutional right to abortion that the Supreme Court has recognized
for nearly 50 years. It will block access to crucial reproductive health
care for Floridians, with a particular impact on low-income communities,
communities of color, and rural communities.  
  
Unconstitutional abortion bans and other bills that will dramatically
reduce access to reproductive care are pending in state legislatures
across the country. These efforts only strengthen our resolve: The
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to do everything in our power
to protect access to healthcare and defend a woman’s right to make
decisions about her body and determine her future.
