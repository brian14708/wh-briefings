President Biden spoke today with President Zelenskyy of
Ukraine about the ongoing work by the United States and its allies and
partners to deliver military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine and to impose severe costs on Russia for its brutal aggression
against Ukraine. The leaders discussed how the United States is working
around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by
Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict,
and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to
identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend
its country. In addition, President Biden informed President Zelenskyy
that the United States intends to provide the Ukrainian government
with $500 million in direct budgetary aid. He also reviewed the
additional sanctions and humanitarian assistance announced last week.
President Zelenskyy updated President Biden on the status of Ukraine’s
negotiations with Russia.
