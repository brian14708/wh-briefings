  Venezuela"

Tonight—two Americans who were wrongfully detained in Venezuela will be
able to hug their families once more.

We are bringing Gustavo Cardenas and Jorge Fernandez home.

Cardenas was arrested in 2017 as part of the so-called CITGO-6, and he
has endured five years of hardship and imprisonment at the hands of an
unjust system. Fernandez was arrested last year on spurious charges.
These men are fathers who lost precious time with their children and
everyone they love, and their families have suffered every day of their
absence. I am grateful to Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage
Affairs Roger Carstens and our entire diplomatic team for their tireless
efforts to secure their release and reunite these families.

Unjustly holding Americans captive is always unacceptable. And even as
we celebrate the return of Cardenas and Fernandez, we also remember the
names and the stories of every American who is being unjustly held
against their will—in Venezuela, in Russia, in Afghanistan, Syria,
China, Iran, and elsewhere around the world. My Administration will keep
fighting to bring them all home.
