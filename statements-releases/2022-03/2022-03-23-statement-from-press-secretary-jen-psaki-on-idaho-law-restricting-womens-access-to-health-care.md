title: "Statement from Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Idaho Law Restricting Women\u2019\
  s Access to Health Care"
---
 
We knew that when Texas passed SB8, its extreme law that blatantly
violates the constitutional right reaffirmed by *Roe v. Wade*, it would
invite other states to follow.  Today, Idaho became the first state to
adopt a similar law – a six-week restriction relying on private citizens
to enforce the law.  This development is devastating for women in Idaho,
as it will further impede women’s access to health care, especially
those on low incomes and living in rural communities.   
  
Over the last six months, Texas’s SB8 has had profoundly negative
effects–with women forced to travel hundreds of miles to access care,
and clinics in neighboring states seeing a significant increase in
demand since the law went into effect.  This is unacceptable, which is
why President Biden directed a whole of government response to protect
women’s rights that are currently under attack.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand with women and
support their right to make their own health care decisions, a
constitutional right that *Roe v. Wade* reaffirmed nearly five decades
ago. And the President again calls on Congress to act and send a bill to
his desk to shut down these radical steps.
