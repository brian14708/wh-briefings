title: "FACT SHEET: The United\_States Continues to Impose Costs on Russia and Belarus\
  \ for Putin\u2019s War of\_Choice"
---
 
Today, the United States, in coordination with Allies and partners, is
imposing additional economic costs on Russia and Belarus in response to
President Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. The United States will
take actions to hold Belarus accountable for enabling Putin’s invasion
of Ukraine, weaken the Russian defense sector and its military power for
years to come, target Russia’s most important sources of wealth, and ban
Russian airlines from U.S. airspace.

As a result of our historic, multilateral coordination, Russia has
become a global economic and financial pariah. Over 30 countries
representing well over half the world’s economy have announced sanctions
and export controls targeting Russia. Russia is further isolated from
the international financial and trade system. We are preventing Putin
from accessing his war chest to soften the blow of our actions and
support his invasion of Ukraine. The United States and governments all
over the world are going after Putin’s cronies and their families by
identifying and freezing the assets they hold in our respective
jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other
ill-gotten gains. And the United States and our Allies are acting in
concert to minimize the impact of these measures on our economies,
including through a coordinated release of 60 million barrels of oil
from strategic reserves. We will continue to impose costs with Allies
and partners so long as Putin continues to escalate.

Today’s actions include:

-   **Sweeping restrictions on Belarus to choke off its import of
    technological goods in response to its support of Putin’s war of
    choice.** The Department of Commerce will extend the stringent
    export control policies put in place for Russia to Belarus. This
    action will help prevent diversion of items, technologies, and
    software through Belarus to Russia and will significantly degrade
    both countries’ ability to sustain their military aggression and
    project power. This will severely limit the ability of Russia and
    Belarus to obtain the materials they need to support their military
    aggression against Ukraine, project power in ways that threaten
    regional stability and undermine global peace and security.  
-   **Full blocking sanctions on Russian defense entities.** The
    Department of State will impose sweeping sanctions that target
    Russia’s defense sector to further restrict Putin’s war machine.
    This action will impose significant costs on Russian weapon
    development and production companies. In total, 22 Russian
    defense-related entities will be designated, including firms that
    make combat aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare
    systems, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia’s
    military.

-   **Export Controls Targeting Oil Refining, a Key Revenue Source that
    Supports Russian Military.** Through export controls on oil and gas
    extraction equipment, the Commerce Department will impose
    restrictions on technology exports that would support Russia’s
    refining capacity over the long term. The United States and our
    Allies and partners do not have a strategic interest in reducing the
    global supply of energy – which is why we have carved out energy
    payments from our financial sanctions. But we and our Allies and
    partners share a strong interest in degrading Russia’s status as a
    leading energy supplier over time. These actions will help further
    that goal, while protecting American consumers.  
-   **Targeting Entities Supporting the Russian and Belarusian
    Military.** The Commerce Department, in coordination with its
    interagency partners, will add entities that have been involved in,
    contributed to, or otherwise supported the Russian and Belarusian
    security services, military and defense sectors, and/or military and
    defense research and development efforts to the Entity List. These
    actions will ensure that the military as well as the aerospace,
    maritime and high-technology sectors do not obtain U.S. technology
    goods and technology that can be used to support Russian technical
    maintenance and innovation.   
-   **Banning Russian aircraft from entering and using domestic U.S.
    airspace.** As the President announced, the United States will close
    off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating
    Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on its economy. This
    includes aircraft certified, operated, registered or controlled by
    any person connected with Russia. This includes revoking all Russian
    airlines’ – both passenger and cargo – ability to operate to and
    from U.S. destinations, as well as refusing entry of any
    Russian-operated aircraft into U.S. airspace. With this action, the
    United States stands with over 30 of the world’s most important
    aviation markets in denying Russian carriers the ability to conduct
    business.
