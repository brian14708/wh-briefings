title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on the Women\u2019s Health Protection\_\
  Act"
---
 
At a time when women’s access to reproductive health care is under
increased assault in states across the country, it is extremely
disappointing that Senate Republicans blocked passage of the Women’s
Health Protection Act, which would strengthen health care access and
codify constitutional rights affirmed half a century ago by *Roe v.
Wade* and in subsequent Supreme Court precedent.

Today, we mark six months since Texas law SB8 went into
effect, brazenly violating Texans’ constitutional rights and empowering
private citizens to act as bounty hunters against their neighbors. Now,
a number of other states are also considering passing laws in open
defiance of the U.S. Constitution, threatening the reproductive
freedom of all Americans. These restrictions are particularly
devastating for communities of color, rural Americans, and all those
faced with fewer options and fewer resources. 

As dangerous new laws proliferate in states across the country, the
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to explore the measures and
tools at our disposal to stand up for women’s equality. This is a moment
for us to recommit to strengthening access to women’s health care,
defend the constitutional right affirmed by *Roe*, and protect the
freedom of all people to build their own future.
