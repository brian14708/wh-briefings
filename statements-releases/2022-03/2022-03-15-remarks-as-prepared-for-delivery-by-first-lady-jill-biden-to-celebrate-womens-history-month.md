The White House

Looking around this room, at so many women who have blazed trails and
shattered glass ceilings, I’m so grateful that you’ve joined us.   
   
Yet I can’t help but think of a woman whose name isn’t in our history
books: my mother.    
   
She was a stay-at-home mom of five girls in a suburb of Philadelphia.
She spent her days trying to complete a to-do list that was never quite
done.  
   
She was a terrible cook—we ate frozen fish sticks and boiled hotdogs—but
she dressed the dinner table with fresh flowers and china each night to
make it feel special.  
   
She was witty, and quick to laugh, and kind and she knew exactly what to
say when my world was falling apart.  
   
That’s what I miss the most—how I could call her when I was hurt or
angry, when I felt like I’d never live up to the person I wanted to
be—and just the sound of her voice let me know that everything would be
OK.                      
   
She never asked me to follow in her footsteps—only made sure I knew I
could find my own way and she’d be there to root for me.  
   
And though she left before I was done needing her, I feel her strength
inside me. I see her fire in my daughter, Ashley. I know that she never
stopped cheering me on.  
   
We are all here today because someone believed in us. Our mothers. Our
nanas, and teachers, and mentors. Because someone taught us to be
brave.  
   
And we are here to be those women for someone else. In big, historic
ways—becoming, as the Vice President says, those “firsts, but not
lasts”—and in small ways, too.  
   
Helping our daughters believe in a world we haven’t won yet, showing our
sons that it’s their work too.  
   
Taking risks—even when we might fail—because we know that there is a
young girl who needs to see us try.     
   
Today, we honor the women who made us and the women we make.  
   
We know that there is still far to travel, but we keep moving, guided by
the strong hands of the women who came before us, continuing the path
they forged with sweat and pain and love.  
   
So thank you for being here. Thank you for celebrating this moment with
us.  
   
May you never forget the women who are cheering you on. And may your
voice be that ovation for the girls who come next.   
   
Thank you.
