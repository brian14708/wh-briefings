*Vice President Harris Announces Additional Steps in Response to the to
the President’s Executive Order to Promote Access to Voting *

Since their first days in office, President Biden and Vice President
Harris have prioritized strengthening our democracy and taken steps to
protect voters from the current efforts to suppress the vote and subvert
our electoral process.  The unprecedented nature and scale of the
present attacks on voting rights must be met with federal legislation,
which is why the President and Vice President have repeatedly called for
the Senate to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting
Rights Advancement Act. The President and Vice President have also
forcefully called for changing Senate rules to prevent a minority of
Senators from blocking action on this fundamental right from which all
other rights flow.  

Congress still has the responsibility to act, but the President is
committed to using every tool at his disposal to protect the sacred
right to vote.  On March 7, 2021, the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday,
he signed an Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting, directing an
all-of-government effort to promote information about the voting process
and to further the ability of all eligible Americans to participate in
our democracy.  That work is ongoing, and agencies will continue to
develop ways to deliver non-partisan election information and enable
eligible Americans to register and to vote.  

A key provision of the Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting
highlighted the unique trust responsibility that the Federal government
has for Tribal Nations and Native communities.  In light of this
responsibility, President Biden directed the creation of an Interagency
Steering Group on Native American Voting Rights, whose mission is to
study the barriers Native voters face in casting their ballot and having
those votes counted, and to recommend steps to mitigate or eliminate
these barriers.  For far too long, members of Tribal Nations and Native
communities have faced unnecessary burdens when they attempt to exercise
their sacred right to vote.  Native voters often have to overcome
language barriers, a lack of accessibility for voters with disabilities,
cultural disrespect and outright hostility, geographically remote
residences, and persistent poverty — conditions that have only been
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  State laws and local practices
also present too many Native voters with undue impediments to full and
fair exercise of the franchise, including barriers in receiving
information about the voting process, discriminatory redistricting, and
burdens in voter registration, voter identification, voting in person,
and voting by mail.

The Steering Group held consultations with Tribal leaders and Native
Americans across the country, and engaged in listening sessions with
Native Hawaiians, organizations advocating for improved Tribal voting
rights, and state and local election officials in jurisdictions with
sizable Native populations.  These sessions revealed recurring,
unnecessary, and unacceptable impediments to the franchise. [The report
released
today ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tribal-Voting-Report-FINAL.pdf)chronicles
the barriers Native voters face and recommends actions for policymakers
at every level to help break these barriers down.  To live up to the
recommendations of the report, the Department of the Interior is taking
the unique step of translating it into six Native languages that reflect
the regional consultation structure: Navajo, Yup’ik, Ojibwe, Cherokee,
Lakota, and Native Hawaiian.  The translations will be available in
writing and by audio.  

A few key recommendations from the report include: 

-   Congress should pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis
    Voting Rights Advancement Act, which includes the Native American
    Voting Rights Act.  States do not need to wait for Congress to take
    this action— they can and should pass legislation incorporating and
    building upon the protections in the Native American Voting Rights
    Act, as several states since 2017 have already done.
-   Federal, state, and local policymakers should institutionalize
    engagement of Tribal leaders and Native communities, including in
    ensuring that county and municipal election officials locate offices
    and polling places serving Native communities for convenience to
    Native voters, and staff those sites with well-trained, bilingual
    members of those communities.
-   The U.S. Postal Service should evaluate whether it can add routes,
    offices, and staff hours or personnel in areas serving Native
    communities, and should prioritize assigning postal addresses to
    homes on Tribal lands.
-   Government offices with significant presence serving Native
    communities should expeditiously offer their programs for state
    designation under the National Voter Registration Act, and state
    officials should accept those requests for designation.
-   Jurisdictions serving Native voters should ensure that they offer
    effective language assistance through adequate translation of
    materials in appropriate media, even when no statutory mandate
    compels them to do so.

This important report is the product of an extensive effort across the
Administration — and it is also just a beginning.  There will be more to
come in the weeks and months ahead, as agencies work with partners and
allies to implement the report’s recommendations.  

Agencies have also been working to implement other provisions of the
President’s Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting, offering
nonpartisan information and opportunities to help eligible Americans
participate.  Those efforts will continue across the whole of
government, with new actions rolling out as they are ready for
release.  A selection of recent developments from individual agencies
follows: 

-   The **U.S.** **Small Business Administration** formally requested
    designation by Michigan as a voter registration agency under the
    National Voter Registration Act, becoming the first federal agency
    to request designation in any state.  Designation would ensure that
    Americans seeking service from a designated District Office are
    offered convenient one-stop opportunities to register to vote at the
    same time.
-   The **Department of Veterans Affairs **launched a survey to over 12
    million Veterans in a first-of-its-kind effort to better understand
    Veterans’ experience with the voter registration process, and to
    better assist Veterans in addressing and overcoming any
    challenges.  The Department also developed a website for Veterans
    with nonpartisan information about voter registration and elections
    at va.gov/vote: [How Veterans Can Register To Vote | Veterans
    Affairs
    (va.gov)](https://www.va.gov/initiatives/vote/?msclkid=4ee33ffaa97111ecaf6453e6663908f9).  And
    the Department announced that, by summer, it would launch a pilot
    program for VA Medical Centers and other offices in six states, with
    an eye to the geographic and demographic diversity of the Veteran
    population, seeking designation as a voter registration agency under
    the National Voter Registration Act.
-   The **Department of the Interior** announced that it is working with
    states to formally designate the Department-operated post-secondary
    Tribal institutions — Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas
    and the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in New
    Mexico — as voter registration agencies under the National Voter
    Registration Act, facilitating voter registration opportunities for
    enrolled students and members of the community.  
-   With **Treasury Department** and IRS support, Volunteer Income Tax
    Assistance (VITA) sites throughout the country are assisting
    taxpayers with access to voting opportunities.  The VITA centers
    provide assistance to low-income taxpayers with their returns.  This
    year, over 450 VITA centers in 40 states have reported that they
    will provide information about voting opportunities.  The IRS has
    also placed voter registration information referring taxpayers to
    vote.gov in the Form 1040 Instructions both online and in print.
-   The **National Institute of Standards and Technology** at the
    Department of Commerce released
    a [report](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1273.pdf)examining
    barriers across the voting process for people with
    disabilities.  The report offers recommendations for state and local
    election officials, the federal government, and other
    non-governmental organizations to eliminate or mitigate those
    barriers.
-   The **Office of Personnel
    Management** issued [guidance](https://chcoc.gov/content/executive-order-promoting-access-voting) to
    agencies to offer paid time off that will ensure that the thousands
    of federal employees in every state have time to vote and to serve
    in nonpartisan election-related capacities, including as volunteer
    poll workers.  The guidance amounts to a significant step in
    fulfilling the directive in the President’s Executive Order that the
    federal government should serve as a model employer in facilitating
    employees’ civic participation.
-   The **Department of Justice** is offering information and resources
    to individuals in federal custody to promote access to voting for
    those who remain eligible to vote while incarcerated or who will
    regain eligibility to vote upon their release. The Department also
    created an online resource for the public that connects them with
    state-specific information about registering and voting, details the
    Department’s enforcement of federal voting rights laws, and explains
    how to report potential violations.
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services **Health Resources and
    Services Administration
    issued [guidance](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/programrequirements/scope/voter-requirements)for
    nearly 1,400 federally funded community health centers, with more
    than 14,000 service delivery sites providing primary care to nearly
    29 million patients in underserved areas in every state across the
    country, clarifying the ways in which those health centers may
    support voter registration efforts.
-   At the **Department of Housing and Urban Development**, the Office
    of Public and Indian
    Housing [wrote](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/PIH_announcement020922.pdf) to
    more than 3,000 public housing authorities managing approximately
    1.2 million public housing units, explaining the ways in which
    grantees may support voter registration and information about the
    electoral process. The Office of Multifamily
    Housing [reminded](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/AllVotingCommunications.pdf) multifamily
    owners and agents of HUD-assisted properties about residents’ voting
    rights and opportunities to support their exercise of the franchise.
    And the Office of Field Policy and Management connected with local
    election officers and placed voter registration materials in all 10
    HUD Regional Offices across the country. 
-   The **U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness** released best
    practices election checklists—in five different languages—to be
    distributed
    to [](https://www.usich.gov/tools-for-action/step-by-step-voting-guide-for-people-experiencing-homelessness)[voters
    experiencing
    homelessness](https://www.usich.gov/tools-for-action/step-by-step-voting-guide-for-people-experiencing-homelessness) and
    to [service
    providers](https://www.usich.gov/tools-for-action/step-by-step-guide-for-homeless-service-providers-to-help-people-vote) who
    can help them register and vote.

-   The **Department of Labor** is providing guidance to state and local
    workforce officials on how they can work with state elections
    officials to designate American Job Centers, which provide
    employment, training, and career services to workers in every state,
    as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration
    Act. The Department’s guidance also clarifies which programs
    receiving federal workforce development funds could support
    nonpartisan voter registration efforts.
-   The **Department of Agriculture** Food and Nutrition Service issued
    letters to state agencies administering nutrition assistance
    programs to encourage the promotion of voter registration and
    non-partisan voting information.  For state SNAP and WIC agencies,
    the letters remind states of their responsibilities under the
    National Voter Registration Act.
-   The **Department of Education** will send a letter next week to
    institutions of higher education highlighting their responsibilities
    under the Higher Education Act to make a good faith effort to
    distribute voter registration forms to the more than 19 million
    students enrolled in these institutions.  The Department last
    reminded institutions of this requirement in 2013.  The letter will
    also explain the conditions under which work-study funds may be used
    to support nonpartisan community service activity related to the
    electoral process.
