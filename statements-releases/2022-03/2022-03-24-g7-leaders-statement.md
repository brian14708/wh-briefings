title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement"
---
 
1.  We, the Leaders of the G7, met today in Brussels at the invitation
    of the German G7 Presidency, to further strengthen our cooperation
    in light of Russia’s unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal
    aggression and President Putin’s war of choice against independent
    and sovereign Ukraine. We will stand with the government and people
    of Ukraine.  
2.  We are united in our resolve to restore peace and stability and
    uphold international law. Following the United Nations General
    Assembly resolution on  
    2 March 2022, we will continue to stand with the overwhelming
    majority of the international community, in condemning Russia’s
    military aggression and the suffering and loss of life it continues
    to cause.  
3.  We remain appalled by and condemn the devastating attacks on the
    Ukrainian population and civilian infrastructure, including
    hospitals and schools. We welcome the investigations of
    international mechanisms, including by the Prosecutor of the
    International Criminal Court. We will work together to support the
    gathering of evidence of war crimes. The siege of Mariupol and other
    Ukrainian cities, and the denial of humanitarian access by Russian
    military forces are unacceptable. Russian forces must immediately
    provide for safe pathways to other parts of Ukraine, as well as
    humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged
    cities.  
4.  The Russian leadership is obligated to immediately comply with the
    order of the International Court of Justice to suspend the military
    operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of
    Ukraine, without any further delay. We also urge Russia to withdraw
    its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of
    Ukraine.  
5.  We further call upon the Belarusian authorities to avoid further
    escalation and to refrain from using their military forces against
    Ukraine. Moreover, we urge all countries not to give military or
    other assistance to Russia to help continue its aggression in
    Ukraine. We will be vigilant regarding any such assistance.  
     
6.  We will spare no efforts to hold President Putin and the architects
    and supporters of this aggression, including the Lukashenko regime
    in Belarus, accountable for their actions. To this end, we will
    continue to work together, along with our allies and partners around
    the world.  
7.  We underline our resolve to impose severe consequences on Russia,
    including by fully implementing the economic and financial measures
    we already imposed. We will continue to cooperate closely, including
    by engaging other governments on adopting similar restrictive
    measures to those already imposed by G7 members and on refraining
    from evasion, circumvention and backfilling that seek to undercut or
    mitigate the effects of our sanctions. We task the relevant
    Ministers in a focused initiative to monitor the full implementation
    of sanctions and to coordinate responses related to evasive
    measures, including regarding gold transactions by the Central Bank
    of Russia. We stand ready to apply additional measures as required,
    continuing to act in unity as we do so. We commend those partners
    who have aligned with us in these efforts.  
8.  Russia’s attack has already risked the safety and security of
    nuclear sites in Ukraine. Russian military activities are creating
    extreme risks for the population and the environment, with the
    potential for catastrophic result. Russia must comply with its
    international obligations and refrain from any activity that
    imperils nuclear sites, allowing unhindered control by the Ukrainian
    authorities, as well as full access by and cooperation with the
    International Atomic Energy Agency.  
9.  We warn against any threat of the use of chemical, biological and
    nuclear weapons or related materials. We recall Russia’s obligations
    under the international treaties to which it is a signatory, and
    which protect us all. In this regard, we categorically denounce
    Russia’s malicious and completely unfounded disinformation campaign
    against Ukraine, a state in full compliance with international
    non-proliferation agreements. We express concern about other
    countries and actors that have amplified Russia’s disinformation
    campaign.  
     
10. We are resolved in our support to the Ukrainian people in their
    heroic resistance to Russia’s unjustifiable and illegal aggression.
    We will step up our support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries.
    We thank all those who are already providing humanitarian aid to
    Ukraine and ask others to join. We will furthermore collaborate in
    our efforts to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights
    in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  
11. We will continue efforts to support Ukraine in defending its
    networks against cyber incidents. In preparation for any Russian
    malicious cyber response to the actions we have taken, we are taking
    steps to increase the resilience of the infrastructure in our
    respective nations by strengthening our coordinated cyber defences
    and improving our shared awareness of cyber threats. We will also
    work to hold accountable those actors that engage in destructive,
    disruptive, or destabilising activities in cyberspace.  
12. We further commend neighbouring states for their solidarity and
    humanity in welcoming Ukrainian refugees and third country nationals
    from Ukraine. We highlight the need to further increase
    international assistance to countries neighbouring Ukraine, and, as
    a concrete contribution to this end, underline our commitment to
    receiving, protecting, and supporting refugees and displaced persons
    as a consequence of the conflict. We thus all stand ready to welcome
    them on our territories. We will take further steps to broaden our
    support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  
13. We are concerned by the escalating and reinforced repression against
    the Russian people and the increasingly hostile rhetoric of the
    Russian leadership, including against ordinary citizens. We deplore
    the Russian leadership’s attempt to deprive Russian citizens of
    access to unbiased information through censorship, and denounce its
    malicious disinformation campaigns, which we will not leave
    unaddressed. We express our support to those Russian and Belarusian
    citizens standing up against the unjustified war of aggression
    against their close neighbour Ukraine. The world sees them.  
14. The people of Russia must know that we hold no grievances against
    them. It is President Putin, his government and supporters,
    including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, who are imposing this
    war and its consequences on Russians and it is their decision that
    besmirches the history of the Russian people.  
15. We are taking further steps to reduce our reliance on Russian
    energy, and will work together to this end. At the same time, we
    will ensure secure alternative and sustainable supplies, and act in
    solidarity and close coordination in the case of possible supply
    disruptions. We commit to actively support countries willing to
    phase out their dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports. We
    call on oil and gas producing countries to act in a responsible
    manner and to increase deliveries to international markets, noting
    that OPEC has a key role to play. We will work with them and all
    partners to ensure stable and sustainable global energy supplies.
    This crisis reinforces our determination to meet the goals of the
    Paris agreement and of the Glasgow climate pact and limit the rise
    in global temperatures to 1.5°C, by accelerating reduction of our
    reliance on fossil fuels and our transition to clean energy.   
16. We stand in solidarity with our partners who have to bear the rising
    price of President Putin’s unilateral choice to wage war in Europe.
    His decision is putting the global economic recovery at risk,
    undermines the resilience of global value chains and will have
    severe impacts on the most fragile countries. We call on the
    international community to take action by fully recognising Russia’s
    responsibility and protecting the most vulnerable countries, with
    the support of international and regional institutions.  
17. More immediately, President Putin’s war places global food security
    under increased pressure. We recall that the implementation of our
    sanctions against Russia takes into account the need to avoid impact
    on global agricultural trade. We remain determined to monitor the
    situation closely and do what is necessary to prevent and respond to
    the evolving global food security crisis. We will make coherent use
    of all instruments and funding mechanisms to address food security,
    and build resilience in the agriculture sector in line with climate
    and environment goals. We will address potential agricultural
    production and trade disruptions, in particular in vulnerable
    countries. We commit to provide a sustainable food supply in Ukraine
    and support continued Ukrainian production efforts.  
18. We will work with and step up our collective contribution to
    relevant international institutions including the World Food
    Programme (WFP), in parallel with Multilateral Development Banks and
    International Financial Institutions, to provide support to
    countries with acute food insecurity. We call for an extraordinary
    session of the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) to address the consequences on world food security and
    agriculture arising from the Russian aggression against Ukraine. We
    call on all participants of the Agriculture Markets Information
    System (AMIS) to continue to share information and explore options
    to keep prices under control, including making stocks available, in
    particular to the WFP. We will avoid export bans and other
    trade-restrictive measures, maintain open and transparent markets,
    and call on others to do likewise, consistent with World Trade
    Organization (WTO) rules, including WTO notification requirements.  
19. International organisations and multilateral fora should no longer
    conduct their activities with Russia in a business as usual manner.
    We will work closely with our partners to act as appropriate, based
    on shared interests, as well as rules and regulations of respective
    institutions.
