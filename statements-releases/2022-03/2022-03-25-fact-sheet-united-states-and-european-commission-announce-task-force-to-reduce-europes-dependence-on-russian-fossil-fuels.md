title: "FACT SHEET: United States and European Commission Announce Task Force to Reduce\
  \ Europe\u2019s Dependence on Russian Fossil Fuels"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von
der Leyen announced a joint Task Force to reduce Europe’s dependence on
Russian fossil fuels and strengthen European energy security as
President Putin wages his war of choice against Ukraine.  
  
This Task Force for Energy Security will be chaired by a representative
from the White House and a representative of the President of the
European Commission. It will work to ensure energy security for Ukraine
and the EU in preparation for next winter and the following one while
supporting the EU’s goal to end its dependence on Russian fossil
fuels.  
  
The Task Force will organize its efforts around two primary goals: (1)
Diversifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies in alignment with
climate objectives; (2) Reducing demand for natural gas.  
  
**Diversifying LNG Supplies in Alignment with Climate Objectives**

-   The United States will work with international partners and strive
    to ensure additional LNG volumes for the EU market of at least 15
    bcm in 2022, with expected increases going forward.  
-   The United States and the European Commission will undertake efforts
    to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of all new LNG infrastructure
    and associated pipelines, including through using clean energy to
    power onsite operations, reducing methane leakage, and building
    clean and renewable hydrogen-ready infrastructure.  
-   The European Commission will prepare an upgraded regulatory
    framework for energy security of supply and storage, as well as
    working with EU Member States to accelerate regulatory procedures to
    review and determine approvals for LNG import infrastructure. The
    United States will maintain its regulatory environment with an
    emphasis on supporting this emergency energy security objective and
    the REPowerEU goals.  
-   The European Commission will work with EU Member States toward the
    goal of ensuring, until at least 2030, demand for approximately 50
    bcm/year of additional U.S. LNG that is consistent with our shared
    net-zero goals. This also will be done on the understanding that
    prices should reflect long-term market fundamentals and stability of
    supply and demand.

**Reducing Demand for Natural Gas**

-   The United States and the European Commission will engage key
    stakeholders, including the private sector, and deploy immediate
    recommendations to reduce overall gas demand by accelerating market
    deployment of clean energy measures.  
-   Immediate reductions in gas demand can be achieved through energy
    efficiency solutions such as ramping up demand response devices,
    including smart thermostats, and deployment of heat pumps. The
    REPowerEU plan estimates that reductions through energy savings in
    homes can replace 15.5 bcm this year and that accelerating wind and
    solar deployment can replace 20 bcm this year, and through EU’s
    existing plans such as “Fit for 55” contribute to the EU goal of
    saving 170 bcm/year by 2030.  
-   As global leaders in renewable energy, the United States and the
    European Commission will work to expedite planning and approval for
    renewable energy projects and strategic energy cooperation,
    including on technologies where we both excel such as offshore
    wind.  
-   We will continue to collaborate to advance the production and use of
    clean and renewable hydrogen to displace unabated fossil fuels and
    cut greenhouse gas emissions, which will include both technology and
    supporting infrastructure.
