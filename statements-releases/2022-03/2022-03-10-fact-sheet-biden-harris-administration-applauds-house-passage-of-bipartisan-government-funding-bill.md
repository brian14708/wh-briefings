title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Applauds House Passage of\
  \ Bipartisan Government Funding Bill"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration applauded House passage of the
bipartisan funding bill, which delivers for the American people through
critical investments in a range of bipartisan priorities—from securing
historic support for the Ukrainian people, to launching the Advanced
Research Projects Agency for Health, to investing in education, to
tackling crime. The legislation will reduce costs for American families
and business, support our historic economic recovery, advance equity,
and further restore U.S. leadership abroad. The bipartisan funding bill
would also end a damaging series of short-term continuing resolutions
that for months have undermined the government’s ability to meet
pressing challenges. 

We are making these historic and necessary investments in a fiscally
responsible manner. The deficit dropped last year for the first time
since 2015 and is currently on track to drop by more than $1 trillion
compared to last year—the largest-ever one-year reduction.

The Senate should send the bipartisan funding bill to the President’s
desk for signature without delay. Critical investments in the important
legislation include:

-   **Delivering Historic Assistance to the Ukrainian People. **As
    President Biden and bipartisan members of Congress have made clear,
    the United States is committed to supporting the Ukrainian people as
    they defend their country and democracy. The bipartisan funding bill
    includes $13.6 billion in humanitarian, security, and economic
    assistance for Ukraine and neighboring countries – augmenting the
    $1.4 billion in assistance the United States has provided to Ukraine
    since 2021. These resources will mean additional defense equipment
    for Ukraine, lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Ukrainian
    people, and additional support for U.S troop deployments to
    neighboring countries.   
-   **Launching the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.** The
    bipartisan funding bill includes $1 billion to help launch the
    President’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health—a bold
    initiative to help speed transformational research to improve the
    health of all Americans, with an initial focus on cancer and other
    diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s.

-   **Tackling Gun Crime and Other Violent Crime. **President Biden has
    been clear that we need to fund the police with the resources and
    training they need to protect our communities. The bipartisan
    funding bill bolsters Federal law enforcement capacity with an
    increase of $554 million over 2021 for Department of Justice law
    enforcement. This includes $1.5 billion for the Bureau of Alcohol,
    Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to expand its capacity to
    tackle gun crime. The funding bill also increases the budget for the
    COPS Office by $126 million for a total of $512 million, and
    provides $50 million for a new Community Violence Intervention
    program at DOJ.

-   **Making Education More Affordable.** The bipartisan funding bill
    includes $17.5 billion for the Title I program – a $1 billion
    increase over 2021, the largest increase in over a decade — to
    ensure that schools with a high percentage of students from
    low-income families have the resources they need to deliver a
    high-quality education to all of their students. The bill also makes
    college more affordable by increasing the maximum Pell Grant by $400
    above 2021 – the largest increase in the maximum award in over a
    decade – for millions of low- and middle-income students.

-   **Tackling Climate Change and Advancing Environmental Justice. **The
    bipartisan funding bill will provide a record $3.2 billion, an
    increase of $338 million over 2021, for the Department of Energy to
    build clean energy projects and boost clean energy manufacturing. It
    also includes $100 million in resources dedicated to advancing
    environmental justice at the Environmental Protection Agency, and
    provides an increase of $776 million for the Department of Interior
    and increases funding at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
    prevent wildfires.
