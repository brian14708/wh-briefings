  \ Respect to\_Venezuela"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 of
March 8, 2015, with respect to the situation in Venezuela is to continue
in effect beyond March 8, 2022.

The situation in Venezuela continues to pose an unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of
the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 with
respect to the situation in Venezuela. 

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    March 3, 2022.
