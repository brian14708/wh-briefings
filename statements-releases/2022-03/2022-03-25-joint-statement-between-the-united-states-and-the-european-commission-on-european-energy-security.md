title: "Joint Statement between the United\_States and the European Commission on\
  \ European Energy\_Security"
---
 
**Preamble  
**  
The United States and the European Commission are committed to reducing
Europe’s dependency on Russian energy. We reaffirm our joint commitment
to Europe’s energy security and sustainability and to accelerating the
global transition to clean energy. In condemning in the strongest terms
Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine, we express our solidarity and
support for Ukraine. We share the objective of addressing the energy
security emergency – to ensure energy supply for the EU and Ukraine. We
welcome the continued progress toward the physical integration of
Ukraine with the EU energy markets. The energy security and
sustainability of the EU and Ukraine are essential for peace, freedom
and democracy in Europe.

Through the Joint European action for more affordable, secure and
sustainable energy (REPowerEU), the EU confirmed its objective to reach
independence from Russian fossil fuels well before the end of the
decade, replacing them with stable, affordable, reliable, and clean
energy supplies for EU citizens and businesses.

The United States and the EU are committed to meeting the goals of the
Paris Agreement, achieving the objective of net zero emissions by 2050,
and keeping a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on temperature rise within
reach, including through a rapid clean energy transition, renewable
energy, and energy efficiency. These policies and technologies will also
contribute to making the EU independent from Russian fossil fuels.
Natural gas remains an important part of the EU energy system in the
green transition, including by ensuring its carbon intensity decreases
over time.

The United States and European Commission confirm our strategic energy
cooperation for security of energy supply and reducing dependence on
fossil fuels. We share efforts to make available stable, affordable,
reliable and clean energy supplies to citizens and businesses in the EU
and its neighbouring partner nations. In this framework, we establish an
immediate cooperation to address the emergency energy security objective
of ensuring appropriate levels of gas storage ahead of next winter and
the following one. We will continue our close cooperation on other
measures to accelerate the green energy transition, lower energy
consumption and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

**Task Force on Energy Security  
**  
The United States and the European Commission will immediately establish
a joint Task Force on Energy Security to set out the parameters of this
cooperation and execute its implementation. The Task Force will be
chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of
the President of the European Commission.

This Task Force will focus on the following urgent issues:  

-   The United States will strive to ensure, including working with
    international partners, additional liquified natural gas (LNG)
    volumes for the EU market of at least 15 bcm in 2022 with expected
    increases going forward.  
-   The United States and European Commission will undertake efforts to
    reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of all new LNG infrastructure
    and associated pipelines, including through the use of clean energy
    to power onsite operations, the reduction of methane leakage, and
    the construction of clean and renewable hydrogen ready
    infrastructure.  
-   The United States commits to maintaining an enabling regulatory
    environment with procedures to review and expeditiously act upon
    applications to permit any additional export LNG capacities that
    would be needed to meet this emergency energy security objective and
    support the RePowerEU goals, affirming the joint resolve to
    terminate EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027.  
-   The European Commission will work with the governments of EU Member
    States to accelerate their regulatory procedures to review and
    determine approvals for LNG import infrastructure, to include
    onshore facilities and related pipelines to support imports using
    floating storage regasification unit vessels, and fixed LNG import
    terminals.  
-   The European Commission will work with EU Member States and market
    operators to pool demand through a newly established EU Energy
    platform for additional volumes between April and October 2022. The
    European Commission will also support long-term contracting
    mechanisms and partner with the U.S. to encourage relevant
    contracting to support final investment decisions on both LNG export
    and import infrastructure.  
-   The European Commission will work with EU Member States toward
    ensuring stable demand for additional U.S. LNG until at least 2030
    of approximately 50 bcm/annum, on the understanding that the price
    formula of LNG supplies to the EU should reflect long-term market
    fundamentals, and stability of the cooperation of the demand and
    supply side, and that this growth be consistent with our shared net
    zero goals. In particular, price formula should include
    consideration of Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price and other
    stabilising factors.  
-   The EU is preparing an upgraded regulatory framework for energy
    security of supply and storage. This will enhance certainty and
    predictability regarding security of supply and storage needs and
    ensure closer cooperation within the EU and its neighbouring partner
    nations. The European Commission has proposed regulation on energy
    storage to ensure that the existing storage infrastructure is filled
    up to 90% of its capacity by 1 November each year, with specific
    phase-in provisions for 2022. The European Commission will
    coordinate with the Member States and provide transparency with
    respect to available LNG capacity in EU terminals.  
-   The United States and the European Commission will engage key
    stakeholders, including the private sector, to formulate immediate
    recommendations that will reduce overall gas demand through
    accelerating market deployment and utilization of clean energy
    technologies and measures in Europe and the United States such as:

<!-- -->

-   Partnering on technologies and energy efficiency solutions such as
    ramping up demand response devices (such as smart thermostats) and
    heat pump deployment and installations, scaling procurement for
    clean energy equipment, investing in innovative technologies and
    fuel-switching away from fossil fuels.  
-   Expediting planning and approval for renewable energy projects and
    strategic energy cooperation including in offshore wind
    technologies.  
-   Developing a strategy to accelerate workforce development to support
    the rapidly deployment of clean energy technologies, including an
    expansion of solar and wind.  
-   Collaborating to advance the production and use of clean and
    renewable hydrogen to displace unabated fossil fuels and cut
    greenhouse gas emissions, including by investing in technology
    development and supporting infrastructure.

<!-- -->

-   The European Commission is working to advance measures that reduce
    gas consumption by maximizing renewable energy generation and
    utilization, including by reducing curtailment rates.  
-   The United States and the European Commission are resolved to
    negotiate and then implement an ambitious emissions-based Global
    Arrangement on Steel and Aluminum Trade that incentives industrial
    decarbonization and lowers energy demand.
