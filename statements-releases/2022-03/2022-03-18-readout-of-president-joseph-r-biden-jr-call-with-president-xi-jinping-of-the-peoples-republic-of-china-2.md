President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Xi Jinping of
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The conversation focused on
Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. President Biden outlined the
views of the United States and our Allies and partners on this crisis.
President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the
invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia. He described the
implications and consequences if China provides material support to
Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and
civilians. The President underscored his support for a diplomatic
resolution to the crisis. The two leaders also agreed on the importance
of maintaining open lines of communication, to manage the competition
between our two countries. The President reiterated that U.S. policy on
Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that the United States continues
to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo. The two leaders
tasked their teams to follow up on today’s conversation in the critical
period ahead.
