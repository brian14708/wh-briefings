title: "FACT SHEET: New Data Show Progress on Biden-\u2060Harris Commitment to Equity\
  \ in Emergency Small Business\_Relief"
---
 
From its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration has made
delivering equitable relief to hard-hit small businesses a top priority.
The latest data show that the Administration’s focus has resulted in a
stunning turnaround from the previous Administration.

The pandemic was devastating to America’s small businesses and by
January 2021, thousands of small businesses had closed, the unemployment
rate was at 6.4 percent, and millions of Americans remained out of the
workforce. While Congress had appropriated billions in small business
relief in 2020, mom and pop businesses and those owned by women and
entrepreneurs of color too often had been shut out of earlier relief
efforts in the prior Administration. An [October 2020
report](https://coronavirus.house.gov/sites/democrats.coronavirus.house.gov/files/PPP%20Report%20Final%20%283%29.pdf) issued
by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis found that
the prior Administration encouraged banks to limit their Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP) lending to existing customers, which ultimately
excluded many minority and women-owned businesses across the country.
The subcommittee also noted that, under the prior Administration, the
Small Business Administration (SBA) and Treasury Department failed to
issue guidance prioritizing underserved markets.

This Administration has put equity at the heart of the delivery of [more
than $450 billion in small business
relief](https://www.sba.gov/article/2022/jan/20/one-year-later-biden-harris-administration-sba-have-prioritized-equitable-recovery-centered) since
taking office. Within weeks of Inauguration, the
Administration announced a number of [policy
changes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-increases-lending-to-small-businesses-in-need-announces-changes-to-ppp-to-further-promote-equitable-access-to-relief/) to
target the PPP to the smallest businesses and companies that have been
left behind in previous relief efforts. Recent reports by
the [independent Government Accountability
Office](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-601.pdf) and academics [Robert
Fairlie and Frank
Fossen](http://www.nber.org/papers/w29732?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg11) found
that **Biden-Harris reforms to PPP helped result in a substantially
higher share of loans going to small businesses in underserved
communities, including communities of color.**

Specifically, the reforms helped:

-   **Increase loans to small businesses in low to moderate income (LMI)
    communities by 62 percent.**  In 2021, the PPP made 2 million loans
    to businesses located in LMI communities, a 62 percent increase from
    the 1.2 million loans made to businesses in these communities in
    2020.
-   **Expand lending to the smallest businesses by 35 percent.**  6
    million businesses with less than 20 employees received PPP loans in
    2021, a 35 percent increase from the 4.5 million loans made to these
    businesses in 2020. More than 95 percent of 2021 PPP loans went to
    these businesses.  
-   **Triple lending to microbusinesses.  **Nearly two-thirds of 2021
    PPP loans went to Schedule C businesses, providing roughly 4 million
    of the smallest businesses – 35 percent in LMI areas – with $60
    billion in forgivable loans. This tripled the amount of funding from
    the roughly $20 billion that went to Schedule C businesses in
    2020.   
-   **Reduce the average loan size by more than half**.  Thanks to the
    SBA’s success in reaching smaller businesses than under the previous
    Administration, the average PPP loan size under the Biden-Harris
    Administration was $42.5K. This was down more than 50 percent from
    the $101.5K average in the 2020 round of PPP. This reduction in
    average loan demonstrates that PPP reached more of the smallest
    businesses under the Biden-Harris Administration.
-   **Increase loans to rural small businesses by 40 percent.**  The
    number of PPP loans made to rural small businesses was up 40 percent
    from 2020, from 1 million in 2020 to 1.4 million loans made in 2021.
-   **Expand the number loans made by community financial institutions
    by a factor of 6.**  The number of PPP loans made by community
    financial institutions and minority depository institutions
    increased from more than 240,000 loans in 2020 to nearly 1.4 million
    loans in 2021.  The loan volume nearly doubled, from $17.5 billion
    in 2020 to $29.9 billion in 2021 even as the overall size of the PPP
    program ($271 billion) decreased by nearly 50 percent from the $521
    billion in loans made in 2020.  

Overall, these changes ensured that the 2021 round of the PPP – which
consisted of more than $271 billion in forgivable loans to nearly 6.4
million businesses – reached more of the smallest businesses and those
located in low and moderate income (LMI) communities.

These efforts build upon the Biden-Administration’s overall efforts to
help small businesses navigate the ups and downs of the COVID-19
pandemic. In 2021, the Administration distributed more than $450 billion
in critical relief to more than 6 million small businesses through the
Small Business Administration. In addition to PPP, this relief
included: 

-   $28.5 billion to 100,000 restaurants, food trucks, street food
    vendors, breweries, and other food service businesses through the
    Restaurant Revitalization Fund. 27 percent of these businesses were
    located in LMI areas and 15 percent were from rural communities.
-   Providing $14.2 billion in grants to nearly 13,000 theaters, live
    venues and other entertainment and cultural hubs.  More than 90
    percent of these grantees, or roughly 11,600, have 50 employees or
    less. These smallest of businesses received a total of $8.5 billion
    in awards.  
-   Providing more than 600,000 of the small business hardest hit by the
    pandemic with more than $7.5 billion in small grants through the
    Targeted Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Advance program. All
    of these businesses are located in LMI areas.  
-   Providing more than $125 billion in low interest, long-term loans
    through the COVID EIDL program to more than 650,000 small
    businesses. Overall, 95 percent of COVID EIDL borrowers have less
    than 20 employees, nearly one-fourth were located in LMI areas, and
    14 percent were in rural communities.
