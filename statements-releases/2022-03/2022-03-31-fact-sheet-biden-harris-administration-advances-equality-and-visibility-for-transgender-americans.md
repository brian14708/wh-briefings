title: "FACT SHEET: Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Advances Equality and Visibility\
  \ for Transgender Americans"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration recognizes Transgender Day of
Visibility, an annual celebration of the resilience, achievements, and
joy of transgender people in the United States and around the world.
Every American deserves the freedom to be themselves. But far too many
transgender Americans still face systemic barriers, discrimination, and
acts of violence. Today, the Administration once again condemns the
proliferation of dangerous anti-transgender legislative attacks that
have been introduced and passed in state legislatures around the
country. The evidence is clear that these types of bills stigmatize and
worsen the well-being and mental health of transgender kids, and they
put loving and supportive families across the country at risk of
discrimination and harassment. As the President has said, these bills
are government overreach at its worst, they are un-American, and they
must stop.  
  
Transgender people are some of the bravest people in our nation. But
nobody should have to be brave just to be themselves. Today, the Biden
Administration announced new actions to support the mental health of
transgender children, remove barriers that transgender people face
accessing critical government services, and improve the visibility of
transgender people in our nation’s data.

**Reinforcing federal protections for transgender kids.** The Justice
Department announced today that it has [issued a
letter](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reinforces-federal-nondiscrimination-obligations-letter-state-officials)
to all state attorneys general reminding them of federal constitutional
and statutory provisions that protect transgender youth against
discrimination, including when those youth seek gender-affirming care.  
  
**Advancing dignity, respect, and self-determination for transgender
people by improving the traveler experience.** For far too long,
transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming Americans have faced
significant barriers to travelling safely and many have not had their
gender identity respected as they travel within the United States and
around the world. To create a safer and more dignified travel
experience, the Biden Administration is announcing the following
changes.

-   **The Department of State** is
    [announcing](https://www.state.gov/press-releases/) that beginning
    on April 11, 2022, all U.S. citizens will be able select an “X” as
    their gender marker on their U.S. passport application. This is a
    major step in delivering on the President’s commitment to expand
    access to accurate identification documents for transgender and
    non-binary Americans. Information on how to apply will be available
    at
    [travel.state.gov/gender](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/selecting-your-gender-marker.html).  
-   **The Department of Homeland Security** is
    [announcing](https://dhs.gov/news/2022/03/31/dhs-announces-new-measures-better-serve-transgender-non-binary-and-gender-non)
    several important reforms to improve the traveler experience for all
    Americans, particularly for transgender Americans:  
    -   **Implementing enhanced screening technology.** The
        Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will soon begin
        updating its Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) body scanners
        with new technology that will increase security and efficiency
        by reducing false alarm rates and pat-downs for the traveling
        public. By replacing the current, gender-based system with this
        more accurate technology, TSA will improve the customer
        experience of transgender travelers who have previously been
        required to undergo additional screening due to alarms in
        sensitive areas.  This new technology will help to improve the
        experience of travelers, particularly those who are transgender
        and non-binary travelers. TSA will begin deploying this new
        technology in airports throughout the country later this year.  
    -   **Expanding airline partnerships to enhance the overall travel
        experience.**  TSA is working closely with air carriers across
        the nation to promote the use and acceptance of the “X” gender
        marker to ensure more efficient and accurate passenger
        processing. As of March 31st, two major domestic air carriers
        already offer a third gender marker option in their
        travel-reservation systems, with a third air carrier planning to
        offer this option in the Fall of 2022.  
    -   **Streamlining identity validation.** TSA has updated its
        Standard Operating Procedures to remove gender considerations
        when validating a traveler’s identification at airport security
        checkpoints. This ensures that TSOs can accurately and
        efficiently validate each traveler’s identity while avoiding
        unnecessary delays.  
    -   **Updating TSA PreCheck and CBP Trusted Traveler Programs
        enrollment to include “X” gender markers.** The Department of
        Homeland Security is beginning the process of adding “X” gender
        markers options in Trusted Traveler programs and the TSA
        PreCheck program to enhance access for transgender, non-binary,
        and gender non-conforming travelers to these programs.

**Providing resources for transgender kids and their families.**
Transgender children are put at higher risk of attempted suicide or
mental health challenges when they face bullying, rejection, or denial
of health care. The Biden Administration is releasing several new
resources to help transgender children and their parents thrive:

-   **Providing mental health resources for transgender youth. **In
    recent months, multiple states have removed critical information
    about mental health resources for LGBTQI+ youth from official state
    websites. Transgender youth often face significant barriers in
    accessing supportive resources, and are at greater risk of attempted
    suicide. In response, the Department of Health and Human Services
    released a [new website](http://www.hhs.gov/lgbtqi) that offers
    resources for transgender and LGBTQI+ youth, their parents, and
    providers. These resources include best practices for affirming an
    LGBTQI+ child, and information about suicide prevention services.  
-   **Expanding trainings to support transgender and nonbinary students
    in schools.** The Office of Safe and Supportive Schools in the
    Department of Education will offer new training for schools with
    experts and school leaders who will discuss the challenges faced by
    many transgender and nonbinary students and strategies and actions
    for providing support.  
-   **Confirming the positive impact of gender affirming care on youth
    mental health.** The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA) has posted [LGBTQI+ Youth – Like All
    Americans, They Deserve Evidence-Based
    Care](https://www.samhsa.gov/blog/lgbtqi-youth-all-americans-deserve-evidence-based-care),
    in which Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for
    Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA, shares how
    to engage LGBTQI+ youth, the evidence behind the positive effects of
    gender affirming care, and available resources for LGBTQI+ youth,
    their families, providers, community organizations, and government
    agencies.  
-   **Confirming that gender-affirming care is trauma-informed care.**
    The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), which is
    administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration, is releasing new [information for
    providers](https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources/fact-sheet/gender-affirming-care-is-trauma-informed-care.pdf)
    confirming that providing gender-affirming care is neither child
    maltreatment nor malpractice.  
-   **Providing resources on the importance of gender affirming care for
    children and adolescents.** The Office of the Assistant Secretary
    for Health has developed a
    [resource](https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf)
    to inform parents and guardians, educators, and other persons
    supporting children and adolescents with information on what is
    gender-affirming care and why it is important to transgender,
    nonbinary, and other gender expansive young people’s well-being.

**Improving access to federal services and benefits for transgender
Americans.** With support and coordination from the U.S. Digital
Service, federal agencies are removing barriers to access government
services by improving the customer experience of transgender,
non-binary, and gender non-conforming Americans:

-   **Accessing retirement savings.** The Social Security
    Administration is
    [announcing](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/) that it is
    removing the requirement that transgender people show proof of
    identity such as doctor’s notes in order to update their gender
    information in their social security record by the fall of 2022.
    This will significantly improve transgender individuals’ experience
    in accessing their retirement benefits, obtaining health care, and
    applying for jobs.  
-   **Filing an employment discrimination complaint**. The U.S. Equal
    Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is
    [announcing](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-add-non-binary-gender-option-discrimination-charge-intake-process)
    that it will promote greater equity and inclusion for members of the
    transgender community by giving individuals the option to select an
    “X” gender marker during the voluntary self-identification questions
    that are part of the intake process for filing a charge of
    discrimination.  
-   **Applying for federal student aid.** The Department of Education
    plans to propose next month that the 2023-24 FAFSA (Free Application
    for Federal Student Aid) will include an opportunity for applicants
    to indicate their gender identity as well as their race/ethnicity
    when applying for federal financial aid. The questions, which will
    be posted for public comment, will be in a survey that accompanies
    the application. This privacy-protected information would help to
    inform the Department about possible barriers students, including
    transgender and nonbinary students, face in the financial aid
    process.  
-   **Visiting the White House. **The White House Office of Management
    and Administration is announcing that it is beginning the process of
    implementing updates that will improve the White House campus entry
    process for transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary
    visitors by adding an “X” gender marker option to the White House
    Worker and Visitor Entry System (WAVES) system. This change will
    ensure that transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people
    can visit the People’s House in a manner that respects and affirms
    their gender identity.

**Advancing inclusion and visibility in federal data.** In too many
critical federal surveys and data systems, transgender, non-binary, and
gender non-conforming people are not fully reflected. To improve
visibility for transgender Americans, agencies are announcing new
actions to expand the collection and use of sexual orientation and
gender identity (SOGI) data.

-   **The White House** announced that the President’s proposed Fiscal
    Year 23 budget includes $10 million in funding for additional
    critical research on how to best add questions about sexual
    orientation and gender identity to the Census Bureau’s American
    Community Survey, one of our nation’s largest and most important
    surveys of American households. This data collection will help the
    federal government better serve the LGBTQI+ community by providing
    valuable information on their jobs, educational attainment, home
    ownership, and more.  
-   **The Department of Health and Human Services** has
    [released](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/QBank/Report.aspx?1225) the findings
    of the federal government’s first-ever user research testing
    conducted with transgender Americans on how they want to see
    themselves reflected on Federal IDs. This groundbreaking user
    research by the Collaborating Center for Question Design and
    Evaluation Research (CCQDER) at the National Center for Health
    Statistics (NCHS) directly informed the State Department’s adopted
    definition of the “X” gender marker.  
-   **The Department of Health and Human Services **[has
    released](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-funded-nasem-report-highlights-critical-need-sgm-related-data-collection)
    a comprehensive new consensus study on Measuring Sex, Gender
    Identity, and Sexual Orientation. This work, commissioned by the
    National Institutes of Health and carried out by the National
    Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, will inform
    additional data collections and future research in how to best serve
    LGBTQI+ Americans.

**These announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s
historic work to advance equality for transgender Americans since taking
office, including:**  
  
**Combatting legislative attacks on transgender kids at the state
level.**

-   **Condemning anti-transgender bills.** The President has
    consistently made clear that legislative attacks against transgender
    youth are un-American, and are bullying disguised as legislation. In
    his March, 2022 State of the Union Address, the President said, “The
    onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their
    families is wrong. As I said last year, especially to our younger
    transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your
    President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given
    potential.” The White House has also hosted listening sessions with
    transgender youth and advocates in states across the country that
    are impacted by anti-transgender legislative attacks.  
-   **Reaffirming that transgender children have the right to access
    gender-affirming health care.** In March, following state actions
    that aim to target parents and doctors who provide gender-affirming
    care to transgender children with child abuse investigations, the
    Department of Health and Human Services [took multiple
    actions](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/03/02/statement-hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-reaffirming-hhs-support-and-protection-for-lgbtqi-children-and-youth.html)
    to support transgender children in receiving the care they need and
    promised to use every tool available to protect LGTBQI+ children and
    support their families.  
-   **Department of Justice statements of interest and amicus briefs.**
    The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division has filed
    Statements of Interest and amicus briefs in several matters to
    protect the constitutional rights of transgender individuals,
    including in *Brandt v. Rutledge*, a lawsuit challenging legislation
    restricting access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth;
    *B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education*, a lawsuit
    challenging legislation restricting participation of transgender
    students in school sports; *Corbitt v. Taylor*, a lawsuit
    challenging legislation restricting the ability to change gender
    markers on state driver’s licenses; and *Adams v. School Board of
    St. John’s County*, which involves the right of a transgender boy to
    use the boys’ restroom at his school.

**Advancing civil rights protections for transgender Americans**

-   **Fighting for passage of the Equality Act. **President
    Biden [continues to
    call](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/) on
    the Senate to pass the Equality Act, legislation which will provide
    long overdue federal civil rights protections to transgender and
    LGBTQI+ Americans and their families. As the White House
    has [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/),
    passing the Equality Act is key to addressing the epidemic levels of
    violence and discrimination that transgender people face. The
    Administration’s [first Statement of Administration
    Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SAP_HR-5.pdf)
    was in support of the Equality Act, and the White House has
    [convened national
    leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/21/readout-of-white-house-roundtable-with-lgbtq-advocates-on-the-equality-act-and-achieving-full-equality-for-lgbtq-americans/)
    to discuss the importance of the legislation.  
-   **Signing one of the most comprehensive Executive Orders on LGBTQI+
    rights in history.** Within hours of taking office, President Biden
    signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/) which
    established that it is the official policy of the Biden-Harris
    Administration to prevent and combat discrimination against LGBTQI+
    individuals, and to fully enforce civil rights laws to prevent
    discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual
    orientation. This Executive Order is one of the most consequential
    policies for LGBTQI+ Americans ever signed by a U.S. President. As a
    result of that Order, the Departments of [Health and Human
    Services](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/05/10/hhs-announces-prohibition-sex-discrimination-includes-discrimination-basis-sexual-orientation-gender-identity.html),
    [Housing and Urban
    Development](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_21_021),
    [Education](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity),

    Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-clarifies-discrimination-by-lenders-on-basis-of-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-is-illegal/),
    and
    [Justice](https://www.justice.gov/crt/page/file/1383026/download)
    have announced that they are expanding non-discrimination
    protections for transgender people in health care, housing,
    education, credit and lending services, and community safety
    programs.

**Supporting transgender service members and veterans**

-   **Reversing the discriminatory ban on transgender
    servicemembers.** In his first week in office, President
    Biden [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/) an
    Executive Order reversing the ban on openly transgender
    servicemembers serving in the Armed Forces, enabling all qualified
    Americans to serve their country in uniform. President Biden
    believes that an inclusive military strengthens our national
    security As a result of his Executive Order, the Department of
    Defense issued
    new [policies](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2557220/dod-announces-policy-updates-for-transgender-military-service/) which
    prohibit discrimination against transgender servicemembers, provide
    a path for transgender servicemembers to access gender-affirming
    medical care, and require that all transgender servicemembers are
    treated with dignity and respect.  
-   **Supporting transgender veterans.** To ensure that transgender
    veterans are treated with dignity and respect, the Department of
    Veterans Affairs (VA) launched an [agency-wide
    review](https://blogs.va.gov/VAntage/85152/secretary-orders-review-vas-transgender-policies/) of
    its policies and practices to ensure that transgender veterans and
    employees do not face discrimination on the basis of gender identity
    or expression. In June, VA also announced that it is beginning the
    regulatory process to remove restrictions that prevent transgender
    veterans from accessing the gender-affirming care they need and
    deserve.

**Responding to the crisis of anti-transgender violence and advancing
safety**

-   **Establishing a White House-led interagency working group on
    anti-transgender violence.** To address the crisis of
    anti-transgender stigma and violence, during Pride Month in 2021 the
    White House established the first Interagency Working Group on
    Safety, Opportunity, and Inclusion for Transgender and Gender
    Diverse Individuals. The Working Group is co-led by the White House
    Domestic Policy Council and Gender Policy Council. To inform the
    priorities of the Working Group, throughout the fall of 2021 the
    White House convened 15 historic listening sessions with transgender
    and gender diverse people, advocates, and civil rights leaders from
    across the country and around the world, including a [White House
    roundtable with transgender women of
    color](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/23/readout-of-white-house-roundtable-with-transgender-women-of-color-advocates/)**.  
    **
-   **Releasing a White House report uplifting the voices of transgender
    people on gender-based violence and discrimination.** On Transgender
    Day of Remembrance, the White House released
    a [report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Report_Memorializing-Transgender-Day-of-Remembrance_FINAL-002.pdf) sharing
    the perspectives from White House listening sessions, uplifting the
    voices and advocacy of transgender people throughout the country,
    and highlighting over 45 key, early actions the Biden-Harris
    Administration is taking to address the root causes of
    anti-transgender violence, discrimination, and denial of economic
    opportunity.  
-   **Department of Justice civil rights enforcement actions.** On
    September 14, 2021, the Department of Justice announced that it was
    launching a statewide civil investigation into Georgia’s prisons,
    which includes a focus on sexual abuse of transgender prisoners by
    other prisoners and staff. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights
    Division and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Puerto Rico
    also obtained a federal indictment charging three men with hate
    crimes for assaulting a transgender woman because of her gender
    identity.  
-   **Ensuring non-discrimination protections in community safety
    programs.** The Department of Justice issued a Memorandum from the
    Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights regarding the
    application of *Bostock v. Clayton County* to the nondiscrimination
    provisions of the Safe Streets Act, the Juvenile Justice and
    Delinquency Prevention Act, the Victims of Crime Act, and the
    Violence Against Women Act to strengthen non-discrimination
    protections for transgender and LGBTQI+ individuals in key community
    safety programs.  
-   **Strengthening protections for transgender individuals who are
    incarcerated.** In January 2022 the Bureau of Prisons revised its
    [manual on serving transgender
    offenders](https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5200-08-cn-1.pdf),
    improving access to gender-affirming care and access to facility
    placements that align with an inmate’s gender identity.  
-   **Honoring those lost to violence.** The White House and the Second
    Gentleman of the United States [hosted a first of its kind
    vigil](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/20/biden-harris-administration-memorializes-transgender-day-of-remembrance/)
    in the Diplomatic Room of the White House to honor the lives of
    transgender and gender diverse people killed in 2021, and the
    countless transgender and gender diverse people who face brutal
    violence, harassment, and discrimination in the United States and
    around the world. The President also [released a
    statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/20/statement-by-president-biden-on-transgender-day-of-remembrance/)
    honoring the transgender people who lost their lives to violence.  
-   **Advancing safety and justice for transgender and Two-Spirit
    Indigenous people.** LGBTQI+ Native Americans and people who
    identify as transgender or “Two-Spirit” are often the targets of
    violent crimes. On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed an
    [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/15/executive-order-on-improving-public-safety-and-criminal-justice-for-native-americans-and-addressing-the-crisis-of-missing-or-murdered-indigenous-people/)
    on Improving Public Safety and Criminal Justice for Native Americans
    and Addressing the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People.
    The Executive Order directs federal agencies to work hand in hand
    with Tribal Nations and Tribal partners to build safe and healthy
    Tribal communities to address the crisis of Missing and Murdered
    Indigenous People, including LGBTQI+ and “Two-Spirit” Native
    Americans.

**Advancing health equity and expanding access to gender-affirming
health care to support transgender patients**

-   **Protecting transgender patients from health care discrimination.**
    The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it
    would interpret and enforce section 1557 of the Affordable Care
    Act’s prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex in certain
    health programs to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender
    identity and sexual orientation.  
-   **Advancing gender-affirming care as an essential health
    benefit.** In 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    (CMS) [approved the first ever
    application](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/12/biden-harris-administration-greenlights-coverage-of-lgbtqplus-care-as-an-essential-health-benefit-in-colorado.html)
    from a state to add additional gender-affirming care benefits to a
    state’s essential health benefit benchmark plan.  
-   **Advancing health equity research on gender-affirming care.** The
    National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that it will increase
    funding for research on gender-affirming procedures to further
    develop the evidence base for improved standards of care. Research
    priorities include a more thorough investigation and
    characterization of the short- and long-term outcomes on physical
    and mental health associated with gender-affirming care.  
-   **Ending the HIV crisis among transgender and gender diverse
    communities.** In December, 2021, in recognition of World AIDS Day,
    the White House Office of National AIDS Policy released a revised
    [National HIV/AIDS
    Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/National-HIV-AIDS-Strategy.pdf)
    which now identifies transgender and gender diverse communities as a
    priority population in the federal government’s strategy to end the
    HIV epidemic.  
-   **Advancing access to gender-affirming care through Ryan White
    HIV/AIDS Program.** The Health Resources and Services Administration
    announced that it has [released a
    letter](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/03/25/icymi-hrsa-promotes-access-gender-affirming-care-and-treatment-in-ryan-white-hiv-aids-program.html)
    encouraging Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program service providers to provide
    access to gender affirming care and treatment services to
    transgender and gender diverse individuals with HIV. The letter
    reaffirms the importance of providing culturally-affirming health
    care and social services as a key component to improving the lives
    of transgender people with HIV.  
-   **Ensuring transgender patients can access birth control.** In 2021
    HHS issued a final rule to strengthen the Title X family planning
    program, fulfilling the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to
    restore access to equitable, affordable, client-centered, quality
    family planning services. The rule requires family planning projects
    to provide inclusive care to LGBTQI+ persons. Additionally, the rule
    prohibits discrimination against any client based on sex, sexual
    orientation, gender identity, sex characteristics, or marital
    status.

**Supporting transgender students and their families**

-   **Ensuring educational environments are free from sex discrimination
    and protecting LGBTQI+ students from sexual harassment. **President
    Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-guaranteeing-an-educational-environment-free-from-discrimination-on-the-basis-of-sex-including-sexual-orientation-or-gender-identity/) recommitting
    the Federal Government to guarantee educational environments free
    from sex discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of
    sexual orientation or gender identity. The Executive Order charged
    the Department of Education with reviewing the significant rates at
    which students who identify as LGBTQ+ are subject to sexual
    harassment, including sexual violence. The Department of Education
    has announced that it intends to propose amendments to its Title IX
    regulations this year.  
-   **Protecting the rights of transgender and gender diverse
    students.** The Department of Education has affirmed that federal
    civil rights laws protect all students, including transgender and
    other LGBTQI+ students, from discrimination. The Department
    published a
    [notice](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-06-22/pdf/2021-13058.pdf)
    in the Federal Register announcing that it interprets Title IX’s
    statutory prohibition on sex discrimination as encompassing
    discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

-   **Department of Justice memorandum on Title IX.** The Department of
    Justice issued a
    [memorandum](/%3ewww.justice.gov/crt/page/file/1383026/download%3c%3c)
    regarding the application of *Bostock* to Title IX.  
-   **Speaking directly to transgender students.** The Department of
    Justice, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human
    Services issued a joint back to school
    [message](/www.justice.gov/opa/video/back-school-message-transgender-students-us-department-justice-us-department-education-and%3c)
    for transgender youth.

-   **Outreach and education to transgender and gender diverse students
    and their families.** The Department of Education has published
    [fact sheets and other resources](http://www.ed.gov/ocr/lgbt.html)
    showing the federal government’s support for transgender students,
    highlighting the ways schools can support students, reminding
    schools of their duty to investigate and address harassment based on
    sexual orientation or gender identity, and informing students how
    they can assert their rights and file complaints.  
-   **Advancing research to address the harms of so-called conversion
    therapy. **The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA) announced that it will update its 2015
    publication *Ending Conversion Therapy: Supporting and Affirming
    LGBTQ Youth* to reflect the latest research and state of the field. 

**Promoting fair housing and ending homelessness for transgender
Americans**

-   **Advancing fair housing protections on the basis of gender
    identity.** In February 2021 the Department of Housing and Urban
    Development (HUD) announced that it would administer and enforce the
    Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender
    identity and sexual orientation.  
-   **Ensuring safety and access to services for transgender people
    experiencing homelessness.** In April, HUD withdrew the previous
    administration’s proposed “Shelter Rule,” which would have allowed
    for federally funded discrimination against transgender people who
    seek shelter housing. By withdrawing the previous administration’s
    proposed rule, the agency has restored protections for transgender
    people to access shelter in line with their gender identity. HUD has
    also released new tools for recipients to ensure compliance with
    these requirements in shelters and other facility settings.

**Advancing economic opportunity and protections for transgender
workers**

-   **Ensuring nondiscrimination protections for transgender and gender
    diverse workers.** In November 2021, the Department of Labor’s
    Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs proposed to rescind
    the agency’s 2020 rule “Implementing Legal Requirements Regarding
    the Equal Opportunity Clause’s Religious Exemption,” an important
    step toward protecting workers from discrimination while
    safeguarding principles of religious freedom.  
-   **Ensuring equal access to the workforce development system.** The
    Department of Labor is enforcing discrimination prohibitions in
    workforce development programs funded by the Workforce Innovation
    and Opportunity Act, protecting workers from discrimination based on
    their gender identity or transgender status.

**Advancing gender equity and transgender equality at home and around
the world**

-   **Advancing transgender equality in U.S. foreign policy and foreign
    assistance.** In line with the [Presidential Memorandum on Advancing
    the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the
    World](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-advancing-the-human-rights-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-persons-around-the-world/),
    the United States is making significant investments to uphold
    dignity, equality and respect for transgender persons globally.  For
    example, USAID supports the [Global Barometer for Transgender
    Rights](/www.fandmglobalbarometers.org/%3c) and the [LGBT Global
    Acceptance Index](/williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/projects/gai/%3c)
    which track progress and setbacks to protecting transgender lives
    around the world.  The Department of Health and Human Services
    through the [United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
    Relief](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/) supports inclusive health
    care services for transgender individuals, enabling health clinics
    to provide care to the transgender community. And through the
    Department of State’s [Global Equality
    Fund](https://www.state.gov/global-equality-fund/), local
    transgender rights organizations receive support to document human
    rights violations and provide critical legal assistance to community
    members.    
-   **Establishing the White House Gender Policy Council to Advance
    Gender Equity and Equality. **President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/) establishing
    the White House Gender Policy Council to advance gender equity and
    equality across the whole of the government, including by addressing
    barriers faced by LGBTQ+ people, in particular transgender women and
    girls, across our country.  

**Supporting transgender leaders and public servants**

-   **Making the Federal government a model employer for transgender
    public servants.** President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/) which
    takes historic new steps to ensure the Federal government is a model
    employer for all employees – including transgender, gender
    non-conforming, and non-binary employees. The Executive Order
    charges agencies with building inclusive cultures for transgender
    employees by: expanding the availability of gender-neutral
    facilities in Federal buildings; ensuring that employee services
    support transgender employees who wish to legally, medically or
    socially transition; advancing the use of non-binary gender markers
    and pronouns in Federal employment processes; and expanding access
    to gender-affirming care and inclusive health benefits.  
-   **Appointing historic transgender leaders.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration includes barrier-breaking LGBTQI+ leaders, including
    Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine, who is the first
    openly transgender person ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In
    October, she was also [named a four-star
    admiral](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/19/statements-officials-us-department-health-and-human-services-commemorating-first-openly-transgender-four-star-officer-first-female-four-star-admiral.html)
    in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, becoming the
    first openly transgender person to hold that rank in any of the
    country’s uniformed services. Over 14 percent of Biden-Harris
    Administration appointees identify as LGBTQI+.

**Advancing visibility for transgender Americans**

-   **Issuing the First White House Proclamation for Transgender Day of
    Visibility. **On March 31, 2021 President Biden became the first
    U.S. President to issue
    a [proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/31/a-proclamation-on-transgender-day-of-visibility-2021/) commemorating
    Transgender Day of Visibility.  
     
-   **Hosting a White House Virtual Convening on Transgender
    Equality. **In June, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki hosted a
    first-of-its-kind [national
    conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WsnZUAXJLA) on
    equality for transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary
    Americans.  
-   **Releasing a toolkit on equality and inclusion for transgender
    Americans. **The White House released a
    new [toolkit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Trans-Equality-Toolkit_REFORMAT-2_WHCO-fix.pdf) with
    best practices for advancing inclusion, opportunity, and safety for
    transgender Americans.  
-   **Establishing a National Pulse Memorial. On June 25, 2021,
    President Biden** [signed H.R. 49 into
    law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/25/remarks-by-president-biden-in-bill-signing-of-h-r-49-to-designate-the-national-pulse-memorial-into-law/)
    to designate the National Pulse Memorial. As the President
    acknowledged in his [statement on the fifth
    anniversary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-5th-anniversary-of-the-pulse-nightclub-shooting/)
    of the Pulse nightclub shooting, we must acknowledge gun violence’s
    particular impact on LGBTQ+ communities across our nation, and we
    must drive out hate and inequities that contribute to the epidemic
    of violence and murder against transgender women – especially
    transgender women of color. As the President has said, Pulse
    Nightclub is hallowed ground.
