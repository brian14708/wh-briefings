National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Dr. Thanos Dokos,
National Security Advisor of Greece.  Mr. Sullivan underscored the
strength of our bilateral cooperation and welcomed ongoing efforts to
expand and deepen our diplomatic, economic, and defense partnerships. 
Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Dokos discussed Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified
aggression against Ukraine, including the ethnic Greek community based
in Mariupol.  They reiterated their commitment to international efforts
to hold Moscow to account for its actions and to ensure Ukraine has the
ability to defend itself.
