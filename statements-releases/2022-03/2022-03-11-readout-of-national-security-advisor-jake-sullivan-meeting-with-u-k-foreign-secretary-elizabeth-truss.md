National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Foreign Secretary
Elizabeth Truss of the United Kingdom. They discussed Russia’s
unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine. They also reviewed the
ongoing coordination with Allies and partners to impose severe costs on
Moscow for its aggression and to provide security, economic, and
humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  In addition, they talked about a
range of shared priorities in Asia and the Middle East. They welcomed
the launch earlier this week of a new U.S.-U.K. dialogue on the
Indo-Pacific.
