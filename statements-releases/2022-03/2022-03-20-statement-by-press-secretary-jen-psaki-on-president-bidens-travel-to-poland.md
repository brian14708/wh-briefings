This week, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to Poland
following his meetings in Brussels, Belgium with our NATO Allies, G7
Leaders, and European Union Leaders to discuss international efforts to
support Ukraine and impose severe and unprecedented costs on Russia for
its invasion. On Friday, March 25, President Biden will travel to
Warsaw, Poland, where he will hold a bilateral meeting with President
Andrzej Duda. The President will discuss how the United
States, alongside our Allies and partners, is responding to the
humanitarian and human rights crisis that Russia’s unjustified and
unprovoked war on Ukraine has created.
