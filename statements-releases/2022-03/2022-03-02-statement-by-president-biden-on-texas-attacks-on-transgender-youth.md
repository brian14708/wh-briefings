title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Texas\u2019 Attacks on Transgender\_Youth"
---
 
In recent days, elected leaders in Texas have launched a cynical and
dangerous campaign targeting transgender children and their parents. The
Governor of Texas has directed state officials to open child abuse
investigations into families simply because they have provided access to
affirming care for their children. This is government overreach at its
worst. Like so many anti-transgender attacks proliferating in states
across the country, the Governor’s actions callously threaten to harm
children and their families just to score political points. These
actions are terrifying many families in Texas and beyond. And they must
stop.

Today, the Department of Health and Human Services has [announced
several
actions](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/03/02/statement-hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-reaffirming-hhs-support-and-protection-for-lgbtqi-children-and-youth.html)
to keep transgender children in Texas and their families safe—putting
the state of Texas on notice that their discriminatory actions put
children’s lives at risk. These announcements make clear that rather
than weaponizing child protective services against loving families,
child welfare agencies should instead expand access to gender-affirming
care for transgender children. Respected medical organizations have said
that access to gender-affirming care for transgender children can
benefit mental health, lower suicide rates, and improve other health
outcomes. Children, their parents, and their doctors should have the
freedom to make the medical decisions that are best for each young
person—without politicians getting in the way.

In the United States of America, we respect the rights and dignity of
all families. Transgender children bring fulfillment to their parents,
joy to their friends, and are made in the image of God. Affirming a
transgender child’s identity is one of the best things a parent,
teacher, or doctor can do to help keep children from harm, and parents
who love and affirm their children should be applauded and supported,
not threatened, investigated, or stigmatized. As I told transgender
Americans in my State of the Union Address yesterday evening, “I’ll
always have your back as your President so you can be yourself and reach
your God-given potential.” Jill and I are standing with the incredibly
brave transgender children, their parents, and families throughout Texas
and around the country, and we will continue to fight for a future where
all children can thrive.
