title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Iran Missile Attack\
  \ on Kurdistan Region of\_Iraq"

The United States condemns in the strongest terms Iran’s missile attack
on the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. This attack targeted a civilian
residence in Erbil, the Kurdistan Region’s capital city, without any
justification. The United States stands with Prime Minister Kadhimi and
the leaders of the Kurdistan Region, President Nechirvan Barzani, and
Prime Minister Masrour Barzani, in condemning this assault on the
sovereignty of Iraq and its Kurdistan region. We will support the
Government of Iraq in holding Iran accountable, and we will support our
partners throughout the Middle East in confronting similar threats from
Iran. The United States of America stands behind the full sovereignty,
independence, and territorial integrity of Iraq.
