title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Roundtable with CEOs and Bipartisan\
  \ Governors in Support of the Bipartisan Innovation\_Act"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. joined by Secretary of Commerce
Gina Raimondo and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese,
met with business leaders and a bipartisan pair of governors to call on
Congress to take swift action and deliver competitiveness legislation
like the Bipartisan Innovation Act to the President’s desk.  
   
The governors and business leaders—which included some of the world’s
leading manufacturing and semiconductor firms—discussed how the bill
will foster domestic semiconductor manufacturing, create more resilient
supply chains, invest in basic research and set a course for America’s
innovation agenda while lowering costs for the middle class. Business
leaders discussed their plans to reshore manufacturing and make more in
America, building on the momentum of 423,000 manufacturing jobs created
since President Biden took office. They discussed how their companies
are trying to build more resilient supply chains, leading them to
re-locate production in America, and how the bill would result in
quicker innovation in American manufacturing and more investments in
worker training. They also discussed how domestic production can help
Americans by addressing bottlenecks that are raising the costs of
household goods like appliances, air conditioners, and washing machines.
 And the group discussed how, as we’ve seen over the past years, global
events like the pandemic or Russia’s unprovoked aggression in Ukraine
can result in higher prices for American consumers, which further
underscores the importance of strengthening our economy and making it
more resilient to these types of shocks.  
   
Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer,
spoke to the economic imperative of passing this bipartisan legislation
for the economies of their states. Governor Holcomb said “Slow speed
kills—we need to get this done and get it to your desk” and Governor
Whitmer explained “Chip shortages have impacted more than 575,000
American jobs…These shortages are driving up costs, are jeopardizing
families, and increasing the manufacturing here at home will reduce
supply chain delays in transportation as well as lowering the costs of
consumer electronics.”
