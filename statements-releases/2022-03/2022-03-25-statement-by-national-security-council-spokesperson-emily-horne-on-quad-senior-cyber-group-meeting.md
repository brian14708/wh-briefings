  \ Cyber Group\_Meeting"

Australia, India, Japan and the United States recognize the need for
improving cybersecurity in an increasingly digital world with
sophisticated cyber threats. Improvements are particularly important in
delivering the essential services of life, health and livelihood that
are provided by critical infrastructure.

To deliver on the Prime Ministers’ of Australia, India and Japan and the
President of the United States’ vision for a free, open and resilient
Indo-Pacific, this week the Quad Senior Cyber Group met in Sydney for
two productive days of discussions on opportunities to extend our
cybersecurity cooperation and uplift cyber resilience and critical
infrastructure protection in our region. This meeting resulted in a work
plan to further collaboration between the members, and with partners and
industry in the region to address our common challenges. The group will
report back to Leaders through the established Quad processes.
