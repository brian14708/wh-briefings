title: "Statement by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Coordinated IEA Release to Support\
  \ Global Energy\_Security"
---
 
Today’s announcement is another example of partners around the world
condemning Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and
working together to address the impact of President Putin’s war of
choice. President Biden was clear from the beginning that all tools are
on the table to protect American businesses and consumers, including
from rising prices at the pump.  
   
After intensive around-the-clock coordination and consultation by
President Biden, the Administration and our Allies and partners, the
International Energy Agency (IEA) Member countries, supported by the
European Commission, agreed to a collective release of an initial 60
million barrels of crude oil from our strategic petroleum reserves. As
part of this agreement, President Biden will authorize the Department of
Energy to release 30 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum
Reserve.  
   
IEA Member countries also agreed to continue monitoring markets and
consider further releases as necessary. We are prepared to use every
tool available to us to limit disruption to global energy supply as a
result of President Putin’s actions. We will also continue our efforts
to accelerate diversification of energy supplies away from Russia and to
secure the world from Moscow’s weaponization of oil and gas.
