title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki on Senate Passage of\
  \ the Bipartisan Funding\_Bill"

The bipartisan funding bill proves once more that members of both
parties can come together to deliver results for the American people. It
will reduce costs for families and businesses, support our economic
recovery, and advance American leadership abroad. With these resources,
we will be able to deliver historic support for the Ukrainian people as
they defend their country and democracy, launch a bold new initiative to
drive unprecedented progress in curing cancer and other diseases, and
provide additional support to our law enforcement so they can protect
our communities.

The bill also ends a damaging series of short-term continuing
resolutions that have undermined the government’s ability to meet
pressing challenges.  We thank leaders in the House and Senate for their
partnership in getting this bill done, and the President looks forward
to signing it into law. At the same time, we continue to call on
Congress to provide the funds urgently needed to prevent severe
disruptions to our COVID response.
