*National Task Force discussed ways to lower prices at the pump and
secure true energy independence*

Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the tenth
meeting of the National Climate Task Force with Cabinet members and
senior leadership from across the Biden-Harris Administration. The Task
Force focused on how agencies can continue supporting the President’s
commitment to addressing Putin’s Price Hike from his unprovoked war
against Ukraine, minimizing pain at the pump here at home, continue
rapidly deploying clean energy, and keep reducing emissions that cause
climate change.

The Task Force echoed the President’s belief that this moment
underscores the need to accelerate – not slow down – our transition to a
clean energy future that will strengthen U.S. energy independence. They
noted when electric cars are powered by clean energy, homes run on clean
electricity, and our grid is more resilient and reliable, autocrats like
Putin won’t be able to weaponize fossil fuels against other nations.
Officials discussed building a clean energy future by furthering the
Task Force’s work every day and advancing the President’s legislative
agenda that provides tax credits to save families money, lower energy
bills, boost U.S. manufacturing jobs, and promote competition.

Task Force members also discussed progress across government to achieve
the President’s ambitious climate goals. A new Climate-Smart
Infrastructure Working Group outlined efforts to ensure Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law investments are resilient to future climate impacts
and utilize low-carbon and carbon-free materials. Energy Secretary
Granholm previewed upcoming work to make schools more energy efficient
and cleaner for our children. Interior Secretary Haaland discussed how
the Department of the Interior is leveraging Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law investments to reclaim abandoned mines and plug orphan oil and gas
wells across the country. Lastly, the Council on Environmental Quality
highlighted the Administration’s continued commitment to environmental
justice and their progress deploying the Climate and Economic Justice
Screening Tool.

As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 [Executive Order on Tackling
the Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/),
