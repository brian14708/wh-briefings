title: Statement from Press Secretary Jen Psaki
---
 
Today, in preparation for travel to Europe, I took a PCR test this
morning. That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to
CDC guidance and no longer be traveling on the Presidentâ€™s trip to
Europe.

I had two socially-distanced meetings with the President yesterday, and
the President is not considered a close contact as defined by CDC
guidance. I am sharing the news of my positive test today out of an
abundance of transparency.

The President tested negative today via PCR test.

Thanks to the vaccine, I have only experienced mild symptoms. In
alignment with White House COVID-19 protocols, I will work from home and
plan to return to work in person at the conclusion of a five-day
isolation period and a negative test.
