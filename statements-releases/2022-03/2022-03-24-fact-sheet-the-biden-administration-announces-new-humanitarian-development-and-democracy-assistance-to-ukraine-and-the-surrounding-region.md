title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Announces New Humanitarian, Development,\
  \ and Democracy Assistance to Ukraine and the Surrounding\_Region"
---
 
The United States is proud to be the largest single donor of
humanitarian, democracy, and human rights assistance to Ukraine, working
closely with our European partners. We remain committed to ensuring
those affected by President Putin’s war of aggression, especially
vulnerable populations such as women, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons, and persons with
disabilities, are able to access food, clean water, shelter, and medical
care. In addition to assisting people in need within Ukraine, we are
supporting the efforts of Ukraine’s neighbors and the European Union to
welcome and host millions of refugees. And we will do our part to
welcome Ukrainians to the United States.  
   
**Today, the United States is announcing that we are prepared to
provide more than $1 billion in new funding towards humanitarian
assistance for those affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine and its severe
impacts around the world, including a marked rise in food
insecurity, over the coming months. This funding will provide food,
shelter, clean water, medical supplies and other forms of assistance. We
are also announcing an additional $320 million in democracy and human
rights funding to Ukraine and its neighbors.** Since 2021, the United
States has provided over $1.1 billion in economic, health, democracy and
human rights, and humanitarian assistance to the Europe and Eurasia
region.  
   
In addition to our humanitarian assistance, the United States continues
to support public health initiatives in Ukraine and the region to tamp
down the spread of communicable diseases like polio, tuberculosis, and
COVID, and to help ensure patients continue to have access to medical
care. And we remain committed to defending and strengthening democratic
governance, human rights, and the fight against corruption in Ukraine
and its neighbors, as together we reject autocracy and aggression.

-   **Providing refuge to Displaced Ukrainians.** While we expect many
    Ukrainians will choose to remain in Europe close to family and their
    homes in Ukraine, today, the United States is announcing plans to
    welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and others fleeing Russia’s
    aggression through the full range of legal pathways, including the
    U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. In particular, we are working to
    expand and develop new programs with a focus on welcoming Ukrainians
    who have family members in the United States. The United States and
    the European Union are also coordinating closely to ensure that
    these efforts, and other forms of humanitarian admission or
    transfers, are complementary and provide much-needed support to
    Ukraine’s neighbors.  
-   **Supporting humanitarian assistance in Ukraine.** Today, the Biden
    Administration is announcing that we are prepared to provide more
    than $1 billion in new funding towards humanitarian assistance to
    support people within Ukraine and assist those affected by the
    global impacts of Russia’s war. This support builds on the 25-person
    humanitarian response team the United States has deployed to the
    region to assess needs, provide assistance, and coordinate closely
    with the United Nations, NGOs, and the Government of Ukraine,
    including the State Emergency Services of Ukraine. With the support
    of the United States and Allies and partners, the World Food
    Programme is working to reach 3.1 million people in Ukraine with
    ready-to-eat rations, canned goods, bread, wheat, flour, and
    oil. U.S.-funded humanitarian organizations in Ukraine are operating
    mobile medical teams and delivering emergency health supplies and
    medicine to public health care centers, enabling continued primary
    health services, trauma care, and vaccinations. In collective
    shelters in places like Mariupol or Lviv, humanitarian organizations
    are distributing blankets, water containers, and hygiene kits
    containing soap, toothpaste, diapers, and toilet paper to help
    thousands of internally displaced persons and mitigate the spread of
    disease. Mobile teams are also providing psychological support,
    ensuring especially vulnerable populations have access to services
    and are protected from risks, including gender-based violence,
    child-trafficking, and landmines.  
-   **Helping those who have fled in the region.** Since February 24,
    the United States has already provided more than $123 million to
    complement the work of neighboring countries and the European Union
    to receive and host millions of refugees, including $48 million in
    Poland, $30 million in Moldova, $10 million in Romania, $9 million
    in Hungary, and $4 million in the Slovak Republic. U.S.-funded
    humanitarian organizations are working in partnership with host
    governments to launch cash programs that provide refugees with
    temporary assistance for food, accommodations, and medical care
    until they can work or receive social support. In addition to
    counselling, legal aid, and mental health and psychological support,
    U.S. partners are providing health support for refugees including
    infection prevention and control, and sexual and reproductive health
    assistance, as well as providing safe drinking water, strengthening
    sanitation infrastructure, and providing refugees with basic
    household items and shelter materials. The U.S. has deployed refugee
    coordinators to the region to work with the governments of
    neighboring countries, the UN, and other humanitarian organizations,
    and donors. Additionally, the U.S. has allocated $5.5 million to
    facilitate the safe and orderly return of up to 20,000 third-country
    nationals to return home from Ukraine.  
-   **Bolstering democracy and human rights in Ukraine and neighboring
    states.** In line with President Biden’s commitment to support
    democracy and human rights globally, the United States is launching
    the European Democratic Resilience Initiative (EDRI), which is
    intended to provide at least $320 million in new funding to support
    societal resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and
    neighboring countries. The EDRI is expected to support media freedom
    and counter disinformation, increase the safety and security of
    activists and vulnerable groups including LGBTQI+ persons, build
    resilience to strategic corruption and kleptocracy, strengthen
    democratic and anti-corruption institutions and the region’s rule of
    law, and support accountability for human rights abuses and
    violations of international law. Implementation of the EDRI will be
    closely coordinated with the European Union and other partners.  
-   **Advancing accountability for Russian war crimes in Ukraine.** An
    important component of EDRI will be support for efforts to document
    and preserve evidence of potential war crimes being committed in
    Ukraine. The United States is already supporting several such
    initiatives. New lines of effort, including the establishment of a
    conflict observatory, will gather information that can be shared
    with a range of accountability efforts at the national and
    international level designed to hold Russia accountable for its
    actions.  
-   **Protecting children and other vulnerable populations.** Russia’s
    unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine poses an immediate and
    growing threat to the lives and well-being of the country’s 7.5
    million children who face attacks on schools, injuries from mines
    and explosives, and child trafficking. In response, in both Ukraine
    and surrounding countries, the United States has been supporting
    Children and Family Protection Support Hubs where professional case
    workers, mental health professionals, and legal aid providers are
    available to assist children, female heads of household, those with
    disabilities, older persons and other vulnerable populations. These
    centers offer safe spaces for psychosocial support, hygiene, health
    and nutrition; provide family tracing for unaccompanied children; as
    well as protection from sexual exploitation and abuse. With support
    to nine different organizations, the United States is also
    supporting 55 mobile protection teams to prevent family separation,
    mitigate gender-based violence, communicate the risks of mines and
    war remnants, and address the psychological effects of war.  
-   **Strengthening public health.** Since February 24, the U.S.
    government has rapidly accelerated support to the Ukrainian health
    system and systems in the region, on top of previously funded
    programs. Inside Ukraine, U.S. government partners are providing
    critical medical commodities, expanded immunization support to areas
    experiencing an influx of internally displaced persons, and
    supporting continuity of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS treatment
    services to ensure patients do not lose access to lifesaving
    treatments – including through procuring $6.1 million worth of
    antiretroviral drugs, re-purposing of mobile HIV testing vans, and
    expanded support to patients and home delivery of medicines. The
    U.S. government is also supporting the Ministry of Health and World
    Health Organization with technical assistance on issues such as
    immunization, outbreak response, blood safety, and overall emergency
    response coordination. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention is also supporting the Ministry of Health to consolidate
    medicine needs from over 5,000 public, private, and academic
    institutions in order to guide and prioritize humanitarian
    assistance efforts, while helping the Ministry of Health to shift
    and expand warehousing and medicines delivery capacity. The U.S.
    government is also working with the Public Health Center of Ukraine
    to roster all CDC-trained graduates of the Field Epidemiology
    Training Program (FETP) in-country and support relocation of
    critical public health equipment and personnel within Ukraine, to
    mitigate the impacts of the Russian invasion on public health
    infrastructure. These teams are augmenting the humanitarian response
    by monitoring the health conditions of the Ukraine population,
    including refugees and internally displaced persons with focus on
    COVID-19, HIV, TB, measles, polio, mental health, non-communicable
    diseases, and maternal and child health.  
-   **Defending global food security.** Russia’s war of aggression
    threatens to disrupt the supply of critical agricultural commodities
    from the Black Sea region, jeopardizing global food security,
    particularly for vulnerable populations in the Middle East and
    Africa. The United States, through the Feed the Future initiative
    and our nutrition commitments, will be providing over $11 billion
    over the next five years to address food security threats and
    malnutrition across the globe – with programming in many of the
    countries vulnerable to increases in food and fertilizer prices.
    Ongoing activities within the initiative that help buffer food
    systems against macroeconomic shocks like the Russian invasion of
    Ukraine include: increasing the productivity of smallholder farmers,
    including women, through access to improved agricultural
    technologies and inputs, financing, and markets; strengthening
    agricultural market systems by building a vibrant local private
    sector; and improving people’s access to higher quality diets and
    safer food for improved nutrition. Additionally, the United States
    will remain one of the top providers of humanitarian food and
    nutrition assistance globally, having contributed approximately $4.6
    billion in humanitarian food and nutrition assistance in 2021.
