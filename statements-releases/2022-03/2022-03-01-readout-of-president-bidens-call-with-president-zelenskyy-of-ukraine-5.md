President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr

Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression.  President
Biden underscored the United States’ sustained help for Ukraine,
including ongoing deliveries of security assistance, economic support,
and humanitarian aid.  The leaders discussed how the United States,
along with Allies and partners, is working to hold Russia accountable,
including by imposing sanctions that are already having an impact on the
Russian economy.  The leaders discussed Russia’s escalation of attacks
on sites used by civilians in Ukraine, including today’s bombing near
Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial.
