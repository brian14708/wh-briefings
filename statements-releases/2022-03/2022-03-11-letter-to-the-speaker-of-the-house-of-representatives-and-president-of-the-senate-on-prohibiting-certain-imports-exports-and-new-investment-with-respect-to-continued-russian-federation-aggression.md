Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et
seq*.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby report
that I have issued an Executive Order in order to take additional steps
with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024
of April 15, 2021, with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States posed by specified harmful foreign activities of the Government
of the Russian Federation. 

The order prohibits the following:  (i) the importation into the United
States of the following products of Russian Federation origin: fish,
seafood, and preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; non-industrial
diamonds; and any other products of Russian Federation origin as may be
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce; (ii) the exportation,
reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United
States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of luxury goods,
and any other items as may be determined by the Secretary of Commerce,
in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the
Treasury, to any person located in the Russian Federation; (iii) new
investment in any sector of the Russian Federation economy as may be
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, by a United States person, wherever located; (iv)
the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly,
from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located,
of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes to the Government of the Russian
Federation or any person located in the Russian Federation; and (v) any
approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States
person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the
transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this section
if performed by a United States person or within the United States.

I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

                               Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
