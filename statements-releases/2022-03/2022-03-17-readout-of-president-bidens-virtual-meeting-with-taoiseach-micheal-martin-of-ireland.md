President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met virtually today with Taoiseach
Micheál Martin of Ireland, upholding a longstanding White House
tradition on St. Patrick’s Day that symbolizes the deep ties and
historic partnership between our countries. The President expressed
regret that he and the Taoiseach were unable to meet in person and
wished him a speedy recovery. The leaders discussed the coordinated
international response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in
Ukraine, including the imposition of significant economic costs on
Russia and the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of
Ukraine who are displaced by the conflict. They welcomed the growing
trade and investment ties between our countries, as well as our close
cooperation on shared global challenges, including through the United
Nations Security Council.  The leaders also underscored their enduring
commitment to the Good Friday Agreement (also known as the Belfast
Agreement) and the importance of preserving political and economic
stability in Northern Ireland.

After the bilateral meeting, the President attended the traditional St.
Patrick’s Day Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill, hosted by Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi. In the evening, the President and the First Lady
will host at the White House the presentation of the shamrocks, a
gesture of friendship and goodwill between the United States and Ireland
that dates back to 1952.
