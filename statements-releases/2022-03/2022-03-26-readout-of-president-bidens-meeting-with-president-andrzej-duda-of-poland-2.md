President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., met today with President Andrzej Duda of

continue supporting the government and people of Ukraine. President
Biden thanked President Duda and the people of Poland for opening their
homes and hearts to their neighbors in need, and he pledged continued
U.S. support to these humanitarian assistance efforts. President Biden
underscored the United States’ unwavering commitment to Article 5 and to
the security of all our NATO allies. In addition, the leaders discussed
our robust bilateral defense cooperation, US support for Europe’s
efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian energy and to meet our climate
goals, and the democratic values on which the transatlantic relationship
is based.
