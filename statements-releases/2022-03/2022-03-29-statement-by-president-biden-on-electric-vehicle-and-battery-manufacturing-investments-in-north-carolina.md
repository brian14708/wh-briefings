title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Electric Vehicle and Battery Manufacturing\
  \ Investments in North\_Carolina"
---
 
Today’s announcement that the electric vehicle maker VinFast will build
an electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facility in North Carolina
– $4 billion to create more than 7,000 jobs and hundreds of thousands of
electric vehicles and batteries – is the latest example of my economic
strategy at work. It builds on recent announcements from companies like
GM, Ford, and Siemens to invest in America again and create jobs.  Our
efforts to build a clean energy economy are driving companies to make
more in America rebuild our supply chains here at home, and ultimately
bring down costs for the American people.  
  
Since taking office, we have implemented an industrial strategy to
revitalize domestic manufacturing with create good-paying American jobs,
strengthen American supply chains, and supercharge the industries of the
future like electric vehicles – and we see that strategy paying off day
after day. Last year, I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
build out EV charging infrastructure and brought together the United
Autoworkers and automakers at the White House to sign an executive order
to get 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030.  
  
Congress has an opportunity with competitiveness legislation like the
Bipartisan Innovation Act to double down on the progress we’ve made
rebuilding our industrial base to create more good-paying jobs, make
more in America – including semiconductors needed by our auto industry –
and lower prices for working families.
