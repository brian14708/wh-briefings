To the Dedicated Members of the Federal Workforce:

Tonight, I will deliver my State of the Union address to the Congress
and the American people. Before I do, I want to thank each of you for
your dedication in service to our Nation.

Thanks to your tireless work this past year, America is on the move
again. Together, we have made significant progress confronting the
pandemic, fueling our economy’s historic recovery, tackling the climate
crisis, advancing racial equity, and protecting our national security.
While our work is not finished, and deep challenges remain, this
progress would not have been possible without you.

The strength of any organization rests in its people. Your capabilities
and dedication are what make the Federal Government strong and ensure we
deliver the basic needs for everyday Americans. As we look to the year
ahead, we must build on the innovations and technologies that we put to
work serving the American people throughout the pandemic, making our
government more efficient, resilient, and effective. And because of our
progress combatting the pandemic, we can safely increase in-person work,
while continuing to protect your health and safety. Together, we can
lead by example and show our country a way forward—not only by what we
do, but by how we do it.

Thank you for your service and sacrifices, and that of your family. Your
talents could have taken you many places, but you chose to serve our
country. I am forever grateful, and with your continued dedication and
leadership, I have never been more optimistic for the future of America.

Joe Biden
