title: "FACT SHEET: The United\_States Continues to Target Russian Oligarchs Enabling\
  \ Putin\u2019s War of\_Choice"
---
 
Today, the United States, in coordination with Allies and partners, is
targeting additional Russian elites and family members who continue
supporting President Putin despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine. These
individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian
people, and some have elevated their family members into high-ranking
positions. Others sit atop Russia’s largest companies and are
responsible for providing the resources necessary to support Putin’s
invasion of Ukraine. These individuals and their family members will be
cut off from the U.S. financial system, their assets in the United
States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use. The
Department of Treasury will share financial intelligence and other
evidence where appropriate with the Department of Justice to support
criminal prosecutions and seizure of assets.  
  
Today, the United States will sanction an expansive list of Putin’s
cronies and their family members. One of the elites is Alisher
Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close
ally of Putin. His property will be blocked from use in the United
States and by U.S. persons – including his superyacht, one of the
world’s largest, and just seized by our ally Germany, and his private
jet, one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft. The United States
will also sanction Dmitry Peskov, who as Putin’s spokesman is a top
purveyor of Putin’s propaganda. The United States will also impose visa
restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close
associates. As President Biden said, we, we will continue to work with
our Allies and partners to hold accountable the Russian oligarchs and
corrupt leaders who are profiting from this violent regime.     
  
The United States and governments all over the world will work to
identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members
hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments,
money, and other ill-gotten gains:  
  
**Full blocking sanctions on an expansive new list of Russian elites and
their family members who enable Putin: **

-   Nikolai Tokarev (his wife Galina, daughter Mayya, and his two luxury
    real estate companies)
-   Boris Rotenberg (his wife Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris)
-   Arkady Rotenberg (His sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya)
-   Sergei Chemezov (His wife Yekaterina, his son Stanislav, and
    stepdaughter Anastasiya)
-   Igor Shuvalov (His five companies, his wife Olga, his son Evgeny and
    his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company)
-   Yevgeniy Prigozhin (His three companies, his wife, Polina, his
    daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel),
-   Dmitry Peskov, President Putin’s press secretary
-   Alisher Usmanov (His superyacht, one of the world’s largest and just
    seized by our ally Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s
    largest privately-owned aircraft)

**Imposing Visa Restrictions on 19 Russian Oligarchs, their 47 Family
Members and Close Associates**: Today the Department of State is
announcing a new visa restriction policy to restrict the issuance of
visas to certain Russian oligarchs, their family members, and close
associates. These oligarchs are known to direct, authorize, fund,
significantly support, or carry out malign activities in support of
Russia’s destabilizing foreign policy. In an initial action under this
policy, we have taken steps to place visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs
and 47 family members and close associates.  
  
**Full blocking sanctions on disinformation targets: **Treasury will
designate seven Russian entities, SDN Strategic Culture Foundation and
associated outlets Odna Rodyna, Rhythm of Eurasia, and Journal Kamerton;
SouthFront; SDN InfoRos; New Eastern Outlook; Oriental Review; United
World International; and Geopolitical. In addition, Treasury will
designate 26 Russia and Ukraine-based individuals who play central roles
in these organizations, enabling the Government of the Russian
Federation’s efforts to spread disinformation and influence perceptions
as a part of their invasion of Ukraine. These entities have spread false
narratives that advance Russian strategic objectives and falsely justify
the Kremlin’s activities.
