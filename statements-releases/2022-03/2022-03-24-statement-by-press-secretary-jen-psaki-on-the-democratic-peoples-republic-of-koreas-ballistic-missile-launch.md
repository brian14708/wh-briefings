The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK)  for its test of a long-range ballistic missile. On March
10<sup>th</sup>, the United States Government publicly released
information that the DPRK’s tests on February 26 and March 4, 2022 EST
involved an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system. We noted
that there would likely be further tests in the future. The President
and his national security team are assessing the situation in close
coordination with our allies and partners.  This launch is a brazen
violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly
raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the
region. This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize
its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the
well-being of its people.  We urge all countries to hold the DPRK
accountable for such violations and call on the DPRK to come to the
table for serious negotiations.  The door has not closed on diplomacy,
but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions. The
United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of
the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
