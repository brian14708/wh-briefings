title: "Fact Sheet:  Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act\_(VAWA)"
---
 
This week, President Biden signed into law the Violence Against Women
Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation passed by
Congress as part of the Omnibus appropriations package.

One of the driving forces of President Biden’s career has been fighting
back against abuses of power.  That force led him to write and champion
the groundbreaking Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) as a U.S. Senator,
landmark legislation that first passed in 1994.  In the nearly three
decades since, he has worked with Members of Congress from both parties
to pass legislation to renew and strengthen VAWA three times: in 2000,
2005, and 2013.  Each time, he worked to expand access to safety and
support for all survivors and increase prevention efforts.  Preventing
and responding to gender-based violence wherever it occurs, and in all
of its forms, has remained a cornerstone of the President’s career in
public service—from VAWA reauthorization to a national campaign to
combat campus sexual assault to reforms to address sexual assault and
harassment in the military.  

While incidents of domestic violence and sexual assault have declined
significantly since VAWA first took effect—and efforts to increase
access to services, healing, and justice for survivors have improved
with each iteration of VAWA—much work remains. 

**The 2022 reauthorization of VAWA strengthens this landmark law,
including by:**

-   Reauthorizing all current VAWA grant programs until 2027 and, in
    many cases, increasing authorization levels. 
-   Expanding special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts to cover
    non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, stalking,
    sex trafficking, and assaults on tribal law enforcement officers on
    tribal lands; and supporting the development of a pilot project to
    enhance access to safety for survivors in Alaska Native villages.
-   Increasing services and support for survivors from underserved and
    marginalized communities—including for LGBTQ+ survivors of domestic
    violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking; funding
    survivor-centered, community-based restorative practice services;
    and increasing support for culturally specific services and services
    in rural communities.
-   Establishing a federal civil cause of action for individuals whose
    intimate visual images are disclosed without their consent, allowing
    a victim to recover damages and legal fees; creating a new National
    Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals; and supporting
    State, Tribal, and local government efforts to prevent and prosecute
    cybercrimes, including cyberstalking and the nonconsensual
    distribution of intimate images.
-   Improving prevention and response to sexual violence, including
    through increased support for the Rape Prevention and Education
    Program and Sexual Assault Services Program; expansion of prevention
    education for students in institutions of higher education; and
    enactment of the Fairness for Rape Kit Backlog Survivors Act, which
    requires state victim compensation programs to allow sexual assault
    survivors to file for compensation without being unfairly penalized
    due to rape kit backlogs.
-   Strengthening the application of evidence-based practices by law
    enforcement in responding to gender-based violence, including by
    promoting the use of trauma-informed, victim-centered training and
    improving homicide reduction initiatives.
-   Improving the healthcare system’s response to domestic violence and
    sexual assault, including through enhanced training for sexual
    assault forensic examiners.
-   Updating the SMART Prevention Program and the CHOOSE Youth Program
    to reduce dating violence, help children who have been exposed to
    domestic violence, and engage men in preventing violence.
-   Enacting the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
    (NICS) Denial Notification Act to help state law enforcement
    investigate and prosecute cases against individuals legally
    prohibited from purchasing firearms who try to do so.

**Over the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken
significant steps to prevent and respond to gender-based violence at
home and abroad:**

-   **Increased funding for domestic violence and sexual assault
    services. ** Directed [$1 billion in supplemental
    funding](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/25/hhs-announces-nearly-800-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-domestic-violence-sexual-assault-survivors-their-children.html) for domestic
    violence and sexual assault services through the American Rescue
    Plan (ARP) in response to the pandemic, including [$49.5 million for
    culturally-specific community-based
    organizations](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grant-funding/2021-fvpsa-american-rescue-plan-culturally-specific-program-instruction-guidance) that
    help survivors from historically marginalized communities access the
    services and support they need. The ARP also provided approximately
    70,000 housing choice vouchers to local Public Housing Authorities
    in order to assist individuals and families, including those who are
    fleeing, or attempting to flee, from domestic violence, dating
    violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking. 
-   **Reformed the military justice system to address sexual assault,
    harassment, and related crimes.** Signed into law the [National
    Defense Authorization
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/27/statement-by-the-president-on-s-1605-the-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2022/),
    which included sweeping reforms to the military justice system—the
    most significant since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was
    established more than seventy years ago—and implemented the
    President’s campaign promise to address the scourge of sexual
    assault in our armed forces. In conjunction with the
    President’s [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/01/26/executive-order-on-2022-amendments-to-the-manual-for-courts-martial-united-states/) on
    military justice reform, this bipartisan, historic law adopts core
    recommendations of the [Independent Review Commission on Sexual
    Assault](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/02/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-results-of-the-independent-review-commission-on-military-sexual-assault/),
    as called for by President Biden, and fundamentally shifts how the
    military prosecutes and investigates sexual assault, domestic
    violence, sexual harassment, and other serious crimes, and increases
    prevention initiatives and support for survivors. 
-   **Ended forced arbitration for sexual assault and harassment. **
    Signed into law the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and
    Sexual Harassment Act of 2021—bipartisan legislation that empowers
    survivors of sexual assault and harassment by giving them a choice
    to go to court instead of being forced into arbitration.
-   **Directed action to protect students from campus sexual assault. **
    Directed the Department of Education to review Title IX
    regulations and other agency actions to ensure that all students
    have an educational environment that is free from discrimination on
    the basis of sex.  The Department is developing a Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking currently under review that will address the need for
    protection for students who experience campus sexual assault while
    treating all students fairly.
-   **Increased resources for survivors of crime, including gender-based
    violence. ** Signed into law the Amendments to the Victims of Crime
    Act (VOCA), which passed Congress with strong bipartisan support and
    expands the allocation of resources for the Crime Victims Fund. This
    has already resulted in an increase of hundreds of millions of
    dollars of non-taxpayer funding for essential and lifesaving
    services to crime victims around the country, including survivors of
    gender-based violence.
-   **Led multinational effort to address online harassment and
    abuse. ** Launched the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based
    Online Harassment and Abuse during the 2022 meeting of the United
    Nations Commission on the Status of Women, together with the
    governments of Denmark, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.
    This multinational initiative will align countries, international
    organizations, and civil society to better prioritize, understand,
    and address the growing scourge of technology-facilitated
    gender-based violence.
-   **Prioritized the crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People,
    including gender-based violence.**  Issued an executive order
    directing the Departments of Justice, Interior, Homeland Security
    and Health and Human Services to create a strategy to improve public
    safety and justice for Native Americans and to address the epidemic
    of missing or murdered Indigenous peoples, which disproportionately
    affect Native women, girls, and LGBTQI+ individuals; the Department
    of the Interior established the Missing and Murdered Unit to pursue
    justice for missing or murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives.
-   **Strengthened regional leadership on violence against Indigenous
    women and girls. ** Re-launched the United States’ leadership and
    participation in the Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against
    Indigenous Women and Girls with the Governments of Mexico and
    Canada. The White House will host the Fourth Convening of the
    Trilateral Working Group this summer to improve and reaffirm our
    respective national and regional commitments to prevent and respond
    to violence against Indigenous women and girls through increased
    access to justice and prevention services.

On International Women’s Day in 2021, President Biden signed an
[Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/)
creating the White House Gender Policy Council and calling for the
development of the first-ever government-wide National Action Plan to
End Gender-Based Violence, as well as an update to the 2016 United
States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence
Globally. These strategies will provide a roadmap to guide the
Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government effort to end
gender-based violence—and in so doing, create a society where survivors
are supported and all people can live free from abuse.
