Today, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen, Secretary of Commerce Gina
Raimondo, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Senior Advisor Cedric
Richmond, and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese met with 16
CEOs of major companies across several industries including energy,
food, and manufacturing to provide a briefing on the latest developments
on Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.  The
President joined for part of the discussion. They conveyed the
Administration’s commitment to continue imposing heavy costs on Putin to
degrade Russia’s war machine and support the people of Ukraine, while
taking concrete actions to mitigate the price increases on American
consumers caused by Putin’s action. Participants also discussed the need
to work together to address Putin’s disruptions to global markets and
supply chains, especially for energy and agricultural commodities, and
identify alternative sources of supply for key goods. The private sector
and the Administration committed to close communication and coordination
going forward.
