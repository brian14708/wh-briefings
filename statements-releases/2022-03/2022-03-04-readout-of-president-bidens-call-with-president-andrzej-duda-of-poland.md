President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Andrzej Duda
of Poland to discuss our countries’ response, in close coordination with
our Allies and partners, to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion
of Ukraine, including ongoing efforts to impose severe consequences on
Russia.  President Biden underscored the United States’ commitment to
the security of Poland and all of our NATO Allies.  He welcomed Poland’s
partnership in hosting 9,000 U.S. forces, including 4,700 additional
servicemembers deployed there in recent weeks, to reassure eastern flank
Allies, deter Russian aggression against NATO, and stand shoulder to
shoulder with their Polish counterparts to maintain security and
stability in Europe.  The two leaders affirmed their commitment to the
people of Ukraine, including the importance of providing urgent
humanitarian assistance. President Biden thanked President Duda and the
people of Poland for their hospitality in hosting and assisting nearly
700,000 Ukrainians and others who have fled the war so far.
