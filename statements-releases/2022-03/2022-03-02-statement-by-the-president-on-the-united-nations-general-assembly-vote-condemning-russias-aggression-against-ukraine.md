title: "Statement by the President on the United Nations General Assembly Vote Condemning\
  \ Russia\u2019s Aggression Against\_Ukraine"
---
 
Today, for the first time in 40 years, the United Nations Security
Council convened an Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly
under the Uniting for Peace mechanism in response to Russia’s
unprovoked, unjustified, and unconscionable war on Ukraine. This
extraordinary move by the United Nations demonstrates the extent of
global outrage at Russia’s horrific assault on a sovereign neighbor and
showcased unprecedented global unity.

An overwhelming majority of nations around the world condemn Putin’s
war. An overwhelming majority of nations recognize that Putin is not
only attacking Ukraine, he is attacking the very foundations of global
peace and security—and everything the United Nations stands for. And an
overwhelming majority of the world recognizes that if we do not stand up
to Putin’s Russia, it will only inflict further chaos and aggression on
the world. Russia stood isolated, with the support of only four brutal,
authoritarian states.

I commend the Member States of the United Nations for holding this
historic session.Today’s vote lays bare Putin’s isolation. It also holds
Belarus accountable for its unacceptable involvement in this war.

The world is rejecting Russia’s lies. We can all see what is happening
in Ukraine with our own eyes. Russia is responsible for the devastating
abuses of human rights and the international humanitarian crisis that we
are watching unfold in Ukraine in real time. There is no room for
excuses or equivocation. Russia is to blame. 

The United Nations was founded to “save succeeding generations from the
scourge of war.”  As Secretary-General António Guterres said, enough is
enough. Together, we must—and we will—hold Russia accountable for its
actions.  We will demonstrate that freedom always triumphs over tyranny.
