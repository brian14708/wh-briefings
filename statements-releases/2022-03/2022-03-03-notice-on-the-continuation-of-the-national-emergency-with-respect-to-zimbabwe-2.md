title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe
---
 
On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a
national emergency and blocked the property of certain persons, pursuant
to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the
foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and
policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other
persons to undermine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes or institutions.
 These actions and policies had contributed to the deliberate breakdown
in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and
intimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability
in the southern African region. 

On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to take
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 13288 by ordering the blocking of the property of
additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in
Zimbabwe.

On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13288 and authorized the blocking of the property of additional persons
undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.

The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of
Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes
or institutions continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national
emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the measures adopted on that
date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 2008, to deal with that
emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2022.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13288.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    March 3, 2022.
