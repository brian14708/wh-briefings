On March 17, President Joe Biden will host Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of
Ireland, for a bilateral meeting and Shamrock presentation at the White
House, continuing a longstanding St. Patrick’s Day tradition. The
leaders will reaffirm the close and historic partnership between the
United States and Ireland and the extraordinary bonds between our
people. They will discuss their countries’ contributions to the
international effort to support the people of Ukraine and to impose
costs on Russia for its unprovoked and unjustified war. They will
also talk about a range of global issues and shared priorities,
including combatting the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, strengthening
global health security, tackling the climate crisis, and working
together on the United Nations Security Council. In addition, they will
discuss their continued support for the Good Friday Agreement (also
known as the Belfast Agreement). Vice President Kamala Harris will host
the Taoiseach for a breakfast at the Naval Observatory on March 17.
