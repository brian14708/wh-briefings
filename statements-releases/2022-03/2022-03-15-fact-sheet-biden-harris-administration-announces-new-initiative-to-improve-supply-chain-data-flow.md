*Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) Will Speed Up Delivery
Times and Reduce Consumer Costs*  
  
*White House to Host Launch Event Today with Key Industry Stakeholders*

Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has been focused on
addressing supply chain vulnerabilities and congestion, working to speed
up the movement of goods, and lower costs for families. Last year, the
ports and the private sector moved a historic amount of goods with
record holiday sales and delivery times below pre-pandemic levels.
Currently, real retail inventories excluding autos are six percent
higher than at the end of 2019 and products at grocery and drug stores
are 90 percent in stock, just 1 percentage point below pre-pandemic
levels.

The Administration is also focused on addressing the longer-term
weaknesses in our nation’s supply chains, the result of decades of
underinvestment, outsourcing, and offshoring instead of investment in
long-term security, sustainability, and resilience. The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law (BIL) is now making a generational investment in our
ports, highways, and other parts of our physical infrastructure, which
will help speed up the movement of goods and lower costs. But we can
further strengthen our goods movement supply chains by making a
similarly bold improvement in a *digital* infrastructure to connect the
supply chain.

**To take the first step toward addressing this challenge, the
Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the launch of Freight
Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), an information sharing initiative
to pilot key freight information exchange between parts of the goods
movement supply chain.** FLOW includes eighteen initial participants
that represent diverse perspectives across the supply chain, including
private businesses, warehousing, and logistics companies, ports, and
more.  These key stakeholders will work together with the Administration
to develop a proof-of-concept information exchange to ease supply chain
congestion, speed up the movement of goods, and ultimately cut costs for
American consumers. DOT will lead this effort, playing the role of an
honest broker and convener to bring supply chain stakeholders together
to problem solve and overcome coordination challenges. This initial
phase aims to produce a proof-of-concept freight information exchange by
the end of the summer.  
**  
A Novel Data Sharing Partnership  
**  
Recent supply chain disruptions have raised national awareness of the
need for improved information exchange. Supply chain stakeholders
deserve reliable, predictable, and accurate information about goods
movement and FLOW will test the idea that cooperation on foundational
freight digital infrastructure is in the interest of both public and
private parties. FLOW is designed to support businesses throughout the
supply chain and improve accuracy of information from end-to-end for a
more resilient supply chain.

Resiliency—the ability to recover from an unexpected shock—requires
visibility, agility, and redundancy. The lack of digital infrastructure
and transparency makes our supply chains brittle and unable to adapt
when faced with a shock. The goods movement chain is almost entirely
privately operated and spans shipping lines, ports, terminal operators,
truckers, railroads, warehouses, and cargo owners such as retailers.
These different actors have made great strides in digitizing their own
internal operations, but they do not always exchange information with
each other. This lack of information exchange can cause delays as cargo
moves from one part of the supply chain to another, driving up costs and
increasing goods movement fragility.

This effort shows a strong and deliberate response by the Administration
to tackle this challenge head-on and set the country on the right
trajectory for a resilient and globally competitive 21st century goods
movement chain. The Biden-Harris Administration is laser focused and
creative in identifying ways to speed up the movement of goods from
ships to shelves and cut costs for American consumers. With FLOW, the
Biden Administration will play a leadership role in bringing companies
together to problem solve for the American people. Initial partners in
FLOW include:

**Port Authorities:**

-   Port of Long Beach
-   Port of Los Angeles
-   Georgia Ports Authority

**Ocean Carriers:**

-   CMA CGM
-   MSC

**Terminal Operators:**

-   Fenix Marine Terminal
-   Global Container Terminals

**Business: **

-   Albertsons
-   Gemini Shippers
-   Land O’ Lakes
-   Target
-   True Value

**Chassis:**

-   DCLI
-   FlexiVan

**Logistics and Warehousing:**

-   FedEx
-   Prologis
-   UPS
-    CH Robinson

These first partners are committed to working with the Biden-Harris
Administration to identify and operationalize a first information
exchange that will support a more resilient and fluid supply chain. They
represent stakeholders throughout the supply chain including large BCOs
(beneficial cargo owners) like Target, small and medium size businesses
represented by True Value and Gemini Shippers, as well as agricultural
producers such as Land O’Lakes. FLOW will be able to address issues such
as ensuring early return dates are consistent across partners, measuring
more accurate chassis availability and understanding aggregate dwell
time throughout the supply chain. The principles of the pilot include
the following: it is a voluntary, secure national exchange for freight
information, it is available to participants who share data, and it is
sustained by supply chain operational improvement.  
  
**<u>For additional interested parties, the Biden-Harris Administration
is launching a webpage to gauge additional stakeholder interest in
supporting foundational freight infrastructure:  
</u>**  
While starting with a limited pilot, DOT wants to hear from others who
are interested in engaging as part of FLOW as a participant as the
initiative grows. Within one month of the FLOW launch, DOT will launch a
web page to gauge industry interest in participation and data sharing
for a potential long-term FLOW effort.

**Building on Ongoing Supply Chain Achievements  
**  
The FLOW initiative builds on previous successes of the Biden-Harris
Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to ensure cargo is getting from ship
to shelf, including:

-   **Reduced Dwell Time in Los Angeles and Long Beach.** At the
    beginning of November, with support from the Administration, the
    Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach proposed charging the ocean
    carriers for cargo that dwelled on the docks for nine days or more,
    which led to about a 60 percent reduction in the number of
    long-dwelling import containers on the docks to date.  
-   **Alleviated congestion at the Port of Savannah** by funding the
    Georgia Port Authority pop-up container yards project. With this
    policy change, the Georgia Port Authority was able to reallocate
    more than $8 million to convert existing inland facilities into five
    pop-up container yards in both Georgia and North Carolina.  Since
    the temporary container yards opened in late November, the container
    yards have provided relief to about 5,000 containers over eight
    weeks and freed up more dock space, speeding goods flow in and out
    of the Port of Savannah.  
-   **Secured commitments to move towards 24/7 operations** via a
    Presidential call to action to encourage every link in the goods
    movement chain to move towards a 24/7 pace to increase the volume
    and pace of products flowing through the system. The Ports of Los
    Angeles and Long Beach and International Longshore and Warehouse
    Union (ILWU) workers joined together to make the first commitment.
    Some of the countries’ largest companies joined in as well—including
    Walmart, Target, FedEx, UPS, Home Depot, Best Buy, The Gap, and
    Samsung—committing to try a new solution.
