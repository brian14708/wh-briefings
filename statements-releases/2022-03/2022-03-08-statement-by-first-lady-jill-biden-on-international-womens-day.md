title: "Statement by First Lady Jill\_Biden on International Women\u2019s\_Day"
---
 
From soft lullabies to battle cries for justice, women nurse and
nurture, teach and build, lead and dream our world forward each and
every day.

Women have never been silent, but women have been silenced. That’s
because our voices are powerful. When we raise them, we can tear down
injustice, topple tyrants and demagogues and shatter the shields of
oppression.

This International Women’s Day, we honor women throughout the world who
courageously use their voice, no matter the cost.

To our sisters from Ukraine who are fighting to keep their country free
and their families alive: We stand with you in solidarity.

To our sisters in Russia who are protesting and speaking out against the
invasion at great personal risk: We see your courage.

To women warriors around the world, those fighting for justice and
working for change: Thank you for building a better future for all of
us.
