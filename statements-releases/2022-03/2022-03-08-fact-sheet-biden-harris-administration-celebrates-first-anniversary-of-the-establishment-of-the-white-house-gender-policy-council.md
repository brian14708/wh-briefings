title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Celebrates First Anniversary\
  \ of the Establishment of the White\_House Gender Policy\_Council"
---
 
One year ago today, on International Women’s Day, President Biden issued
an [Executive
Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/)
establishing the White House Gender Policy Council and charged it with
leading a government-wide effort to advance gender equity and equality
both at home and abroad.    
  
In the year since, the Biden-Harris Administration laid out an ambitious
agenda in the first-ever [National Strategy on Gender Equity and
Equality](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf)
and has taken significant steps to advance equal rights and opportunity:
   
  
**Expanded Economic Opportunity and Supported Women in the Workforce**

-   Provided immediate relief through the **American Rescue Plan
    (ARP)** to millions of women who have borne the brunt of the
    pandemic, including by: standing up a historic vaccination program
    that has resulted in more than 215 million people in the United
    States being fully vaccinated; reopening schools; providing direct
    payments to individuals; expanding nutrition programs for families;
    helping child care providers keep their doors open; providing paid
    leave tax credits for small and midsize employers; distributing the
    majority of emergency rental assistance to female-headed households;
    and expanding the [Child Tax
    Credit](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-whole-of-government-effort-to-ensure-child-tax-credit-reaches-all-eligible-families/),
    which last year contributed to the largest drop in child poverty in
    American history.  
-   Passed the **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)**, which will
    increase access to good-paying jobs, including for women, people of
    color, and members of other communities who are currently
    underrepresented in the sectors where these jobs will be created,
    such as transportation, clean energy, and broadband. It will also
    replace lead pipes, and expand affordable high-speed internet,
    reliable public transit, and clean drinking water. BIL also
    established a task force, soon to be launched by the Department of
    Transportation and the Department of Labor, dedicated to promoting
    the recruitment, inclusion, and advancement of women in trucking.  
-   Issued an [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/27/executive-order-on-increasing-the-minimum-wage-for-federal-contractors/)
    to **increase the minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage for
    federal contractors**, which went into effect in January 2022 and
    ensures that Federal contractors pay their workers an hourly wage of
    at least $15.00. This significantly benefits women, who are
    disproportionately minimum wage workers.  
-   Issued an [Executive Order on Protecting the Federal
    Workforce](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/22/executive-order-protecting-the-federal-workforce/),
    which directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management
    (OPM) to provide a report to the President with recommendations to
    **promote a $15 per hour minimum wage for federal employees.**
    [OPM](https://chcoc.gov/content/achieving-15-hour-minimum-pay-rate-federal-employees)
    then issued a memorandum implementing guidance for agencies to do
    so.  
-   Issued an [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/)
     to promote **diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility**
    across the federal government – the nation’s largest employer –
    including by prioritizing efforts to close gender and racial wage
    gaps, address workplace safety and harassment, including in our
    national security workforce, and advance equity for LGBTQI+ public
    servants.

**Prevented and Responded to Gender-Based Violence**

-   Directed [$1 billion in supplemental
    funding](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/25/hhs-announces-nearly-800-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-domestic-violence-sexual-assault-survivors-their-children.html) for
    **domestic violence and sexual assault services** through the
    American Rescue Plan, including [$49.5 million for
    culturally-specific community-based
    organizations](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grant-funding/2021-fvpsa-american-rescue-plan-culturally-specific-program-instruction-guidance) that
    help survivors from historically marginalized communities access the
    services and support they need. The ARP also provided approximately
    70,000 housing choice vouchers to local Public Housing Authorities
    in order to assist individuals and families, including those who are
    fleeing, or attempting to flee, from domestic violence, dating
    violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking.   
-   Working with Congress to reauthorize and strengthen the bipartisan
    **Violence Against Women Act (**VAWA), which passed the House in
    March 2021 and has been introduced in the Senate. The President has
    continued to champion this legislation, an expanded version of the
    bill he first wrote and passed as a United States Senator in 1994.
    In addition, the President’s discretionary budget request for FY22
    doubles funding for Department of Justice VAWA programs, with a
    historic $1 billion investment in total funding.  
-   Signed into law the [National Defense Authorization
    Act](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/27/statement-by-the-president-on-s-1605-the-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2022/),
    which included **sweeping reforms to the military justice system** –
    the most significant since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was
    established more than seventy years ago. In conjunction with the
    President’s [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/01/26/executive-order-on-2022-amendments-to-the-manual-for-courts-martial-united-states/)
    on military justice reform, this bipartisan, historic law adopts
    core recommendations of the [Independent Review Commission on Sexual
    Assault](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/02/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-results-of-the-independent-review-commission-on-military-sexual-assault/),
    as called for by President Biden. These reforms will fundamentally
    shift how the military prosecutes and investigates sexual assault,
    domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other serious crimes, and
    will increase prevention initiatives and support for survivors. All
    of these actions carry forward the President’s campaign promise to
    address the scourge of sexual assault in our armed forces.  
-   Signed into law the **Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault
    and Sexual Harassment Act** of 2021 – bipartisan legislation that
    empowers survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment by giving
    them a choice to go to court instead of being forced into
    arbitration.  
-   Directed the Department of Education to **review Title IX
    regulations** and other agency actions to ensure that all students
    have an educational environment that is free from discrimination on
    the basis of sex.  The Department is developing a Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking currently under review that will address the need for
    protection for students who experience campus sexual assault while
    treating all students fairly and addressing the issue of
    discrimination for LGBTQI+ students.  
-   Signed into law the **Amendments to the Victims of Crime Act**
    (VOCA), which passed Congress with strong bipartisan support and
    expands the allocation of resources for the Crime Victims Fund. This
    has already resulted in an increase of hundreds of millions of
    dollars of non-taxpayer funding for essential and lifesaving
    services to crime victims around the country.  
-   Announced the development of the first-ever government-wide
    **National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence**, as well as
    committed to reviewing and updating the 2016 United States Strategy
    to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally.  
-   Issued an [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/15/executive-order-on-improving-public-safety-and-criminal-justice-for-native-americans-and-addressing-the-crisis-of-missing-or-murdered-indigenous-people/)
    to improve public safety and criminal justice for Native Americans
    and **address the crisis of missing or murdered Indigenous people**,
    directing federal agencies to develop a coordinated strategy to
    prevent and respond to violence against Native Americans, which
    disproportionately affects Native women, girls, LGBTQI+ Native
    Americans and people who identify as “Two-Spirit.”  
-   Re-launched the United States’ leadership and participation in the
    **Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and
    Girls** with the Governments of Mexico and Canada. The White House
    will host the Fourth Convening of the Trilateral Working Group this
    summer to improve and reaffirm our respective national and regional
    commitments to prevent and respond to violence against Indigenous
    women and girls through increased access to justice and prevention
    services.

**Expanded Access to Health Care, including Reproductive Health Care**

-   The American Rescue Plan expanded premium tax credits, reduced net
    premiums, increased individuals’ savings, and **provided women with
    access to quality, affordable health care coverage** through the
    Marketplaces. Fifty-four percent of those newly signing up for
    coverage during 2021 special enrollment were women.  
-   Issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/28/memorandum-on-protecting-womens-health-at-home-and-abroad/)
    to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health
    care and to **revoke the Mexico City policy** – the “global gag”
    rule – that prohibited federal funding for foreign nongovernmental
    organizations providing abortion counseling or referrals, and
    restored funding to the UN Population Fund, which supports the
    provision of sexual and reproductive health services in fragile
    contexts.  
-   Charged the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with
    reviewing the Title X Rule to ensure that low-income people can
    access family planning and other preventive health care. HHS has
    since issued [a final
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/04/hhs-issues-final-regulation-aimed-at-ensuring-access-to-equitable-affordable-client-centered-quality-family-planning-services.html)
    to **strengthen the Title X family planning program**, carrying
    forward the Administration’s commitment to restore access to
    affordable, quality family planning services.  
-   Took steps to **improve maternal health and eliminate racial
    disparities** that persist through efforts to reduce complications
    and mortality, which disproportionately impact Black and Indigenous
    women.  Through the ARP, the Administration gives states an easier
    pathway to extend coverage for pregnant women from 60 days to 12
    months postpartum; the Administration is working to encourage all
    states to take up this option so women can get the care they need to
    stay healthy and has approved Medicaid demonstration projects in
    several states to expand postpartum coverage. The Vice President
    hosted the first-ever [White House Maternal Health Day of
    Action](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/07/fact-sheet-vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-call-to-action-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/),
    while the President issued the first-ever proclamation on Black
    Maternal Health Week, highlighting the specific disparities that
    Black women face in pregnancy and childbirth.  As part of this call
    to action, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued new
    guidance to help states provide 12 months (up from 60 days
    currently) of continuous postpartum coverage through their Medicaid
    programs. HHS also announced plans to create a new “Birthing
    Friendly” hospital designation, which would be the first-ever
    hospital quality designation by HHS specifically focused on
    maternity care.  
-   Launched **a whole-of-government effort to protect women’s
    reproductive rights** in the wake of the passage of an extreme and
    unconstitutional Texas law that severely impairs access to abortion
    after six weeks. In response, HHS issued Title X grant support for
    health service providers and announced additional funding to a
    current Title X family planning grantee in Texas, along with other
    actions.  
-   In addition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has vigorously pursued
    a legal challenge to the Texas law, and the Attorney General
    reaffirmed DOJ’s commitment to continuing to protect those seeking
    to obtain or provide reproductive health services, including
    abortion, pursuant to its enforcement of the Freedom of Access to
    Clinic Entrances Act. DOJ also filed an amicus brief before the
    Supreme Court in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health,* arguing that
    Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban violates the Constitution.

**Advanced Gender Equality Around the World**

-   Announced [bold
    commitments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/30/fact-sheet-united-states-to-announce-commitments-to-the-generation-equality-forum/)
    to advance women’s economic security, gender-based violence
    prevention and response, and sexual and reproductive health and
    rights at home and abroad at the United Nations’ Generation Equality
    Forum, including a new **Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund**
    focused on women’s economic security.   
-   **Proposed a record $2.6 billion to advance gender equity and
    equality through foreign assistance in FY 2023**, more than doubling
    the commitment proposed in the FY 2022 Budget and furthering our
    work to promote prosperity, stability, and security around the
    world.  
-   Issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-advancing-the-human-rights-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-persons-around-the-world/)
    to **advance the human rights of LGBTQI+ people around the world**,
    which directs all federal agencies engaged abroad to ensure that
    U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human
    rights of LGBTQI+ people.  
-   Emphasized the importance of gender equality and women’s political
    participation to democratic progress by launching the **Advancing
    Women’s and Girls’ Civic and Political Leadership Initiative** at
    the [Summit for
    Democracy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-is-taking-action-to-restore-and-strengthen-american-democracy/).   
-   Committed to lead the **Global Partnership for Action on
    Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse** to improve the response
    to technology-facilitated gender-based violence, which undermines
    women’s health and economic security, as well as their participation
    in public life. This commitment was made at the Summit for Democracy
    and will be formally launched at the United Nations Commission on
    the Status of Women.  
-   Launched the **Build Back Better World Partnership** with G7
    partners to meet infrastructure needs in low- and middle-income
    countries, with a focus on gender equity and equality as one of the
    initiative’s four central pillars, alongside climate, health and
    health security, and digital technology.  
-   Submitted to Congress the 2021 **Women, Peace, and Security Report**
    from the Departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security and the
    U.S. Agency for International Development and continued
    implementation efforts, including through a new and strengthened
    strategy to ensure women’s participation in conflict prevention and
    resolution, stability and security. The Administration is also
    integrating a focus on gender in preventing conflict, supporting
    peace-building, and promoting regional stability and security in
    partnership with countries facing a variety of stressors, such as
    climate change and backsliding democracy.

**Promoted Diverse Leadership and Full Participation**

-   Reached **gender parity in the Cabinet** for the first time ever,
    thanks to President Biden’s commitment to making diversity, equity,
    inclusion, and accessibility a priority in appointments to the
    Cabinet and across the federal government.  The President has
    appointed a record number of women and people of color – including
    the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary, the first woman to
    serve as Director of National Intelligence, the first Native
    American woman to serve in the Cabinet, and the first openly
    transgender, Senate-confirmed federal official.   
-   Nominated the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court and
    nominated more Black women to the Courts of Appeals than any
    previous President. And in his first year in office, President Biden
    has had more lower-court judicial nominees confirmed than any
    president since Kennedy.  
-   Expressed [steadfast
    support](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/statement-from-president-biden-on-the-equal-rights-amendment/)
    for the **Equal Rights Amendment** and called on Congress to
    enshrine the principle of gender equality in the Constitution.
    President Biden also continues to [call on
    Congress](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/)
    to pass the **Equality Act,** which would provide long overdue civil
    rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender
    identity.

**Advanced equality for transgender Americans** by signing an Executive
Order to restore open service for transgender service members, expanding
access to comprehensive gender-affirming medical care for transgender
veterans, delivering more inclusive federal IDs like passports for
transgender and non-binary people, and addressing anti-transgender
violence, which continues to disproportionately impact trans women and
girls of color. 

-   Built the architecture to ensure **a government-wide, intersectional
    approach** to advancing equal rights and opportunities by:
    -   Issuing the first-ever [National Strategy on Gender Equity and
        Equality](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf),
        which addresses ten priorities – including economic security,
        education, health, human rights, democracy and leadership. It
        also reflects the Administration’s broader commitment to
        advancing equity, including through racial equity and LGBTQI+
        equality.
    -   Issuing an [Executive
        Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/)
        on advancing racial equity and support for underserved
        communities and an [Executive
        Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/)
        on preventing and combatting discrimination on the basis of
        gender identity or sexual orientation. 

In the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has produced historic
results. As the President said in his State of the Union address, “We
are stronger today than we were a year ago…and we will be stronger a
year from now than we are today.”  
  
Going forward, the Administration remains committed to helping women get
back to work; creating good jobs; closing gender and racial wage gaps;
lowering costs for families; ensuring that care is accessible and
affordable – including child care, home health care and paid leave;
expanding access to health care, including reproductive health care;
advancing LGBTQI+ equality and civil rights; and preventing and
responding to gender-based violence, wherever it occurs.  
  
In doing so, we will continuing our extensive engagement with domestic
and international partners, which in the last year has included
collaborating with nonprofit and community-based organizations, civil
society groups, faith-based organizations, unions, worker organizations
and academics; engaging over 270 girls, young women and gender
nonconforming youth leaders from across the United States and more than
dozen countries to provide input into the development of the National
Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality; and hosting a historic White
House roundtable with intersex advocates. We look forward to continuing
this collaboration in the years ahead, in service of our vision of a
world where people of all genders are guaranteed the equity, equality,
and dignity they deserve.
