National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with African Union
Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat to reinforce President
Biden’s commitment to Africa. Chairperson Faki and Mr. Sullivan
discussed working together and through multilateral institutions like
the African Union and the United Nations to face today’s global
challenges. Mr. Sullivan reiterated the United States’ commitment to
working with Africa to achieve our goals around the world – combatting
the COVID-19 pandemic, advancing global health security, building a
strong and inclusive global economy, combating the climate crisis, and
revitalizing democracy and defending human rights.  Mr. Sullivan also
welcomed the strong statement from the Chairperson and African Union
chair President of Senegal Macky Sall calling on the Russian Federation
to respect international law and the national sovereignty of Ukraine. 
Mr. Sullivan also raised areas where the United States and the African
Union have an interest in working together to restore democracy in Mali,
Burkina Faso, and Guinea, support fragile transitions in Sudan and Chad,
and work toward peaceful and stable futures for Ethiopia and Somalia.
Both agreed to maintain close coordination as President Biden plans to
convene leaders from across the African continent for a U.S. – Africa
Leaders Summit and host the Global COVID-19 Summit this year.
