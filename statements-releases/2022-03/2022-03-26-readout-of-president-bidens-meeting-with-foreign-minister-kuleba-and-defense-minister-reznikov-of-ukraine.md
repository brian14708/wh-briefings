President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister
Dmytro Kuleba and Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov for an update on
Ukraine’s military, diplomatic, and humanitarian situation. The
President updated the Ministers on U.S. efforts to rally the world in
support of Ukraine’s fight against Russian aggression, including through
the President’s meetings this week in Belgium, and the significant
military and humanitarian assistance the United States is providing to
Ukraine. They discussed further efforts to help Ukraine defend its
territory. They also discussed the United States’ ongoing actions to
hold President Putin accountable for Russia’s brutal aggression, in
coordination with our allies and partners, including through the new
sanctions actions announced by the President in Brussels on March 24.
