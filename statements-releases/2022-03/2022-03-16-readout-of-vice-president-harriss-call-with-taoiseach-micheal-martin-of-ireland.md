Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with Taoiseach Micheál Martin
of Ireland and wished him a happy St. Patrick’s Day. The Vice President
expressed her regret that she will be unable to host the St. Patrick’s
Day Breakfast in honor of the Taoiseach and Mrs. Mary Martin. The
breakfast at the Naval Observatory was cancelled out of an abundance of
caution following the Second Gentleman testing positive for COVID-19. 
The Vice President and the Taoiseach discussed the strong ties between
the United States and Ireland and between the American and Irish people.
The Vice President underscored the importance of continuing to work
together to strengthen our bilateral relationship as we take on global
and regional challenges together.  They discussed Russia’s unprovoked,
unjustified invasion of Ukraine, and the Vice President welcomed
Ireland’s voice on the UN Security Council and in the EU to impose
severe costs on Russia and provide assistance to Ukraine. The Vice
President thanked the Taoiseach for Ireland’s leadership in providing
humanitarian assistance and support for refugees. They agreed to
continue to stand with the people of Ukraine. The Vice President and the
Taoiseach also discussed their continued support for the Good Friday
Agreement.
