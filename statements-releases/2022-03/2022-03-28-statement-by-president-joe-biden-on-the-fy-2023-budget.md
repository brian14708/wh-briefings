title: Statement by President Joe Biden on the FY 2023 Budget
---
 
Budgets are statements of values, and the budget I am releasing today
sends a clear message that we value fiscal responsibility, safety and
security at home and around the world, and the investments needed
to continue our equitable growth and build a better America.

My Administration is on track to reduce the federal deficit by more than
$1.3 trillion this year, cutting in half the deficit from the last year
of the previous Administration and delivering the
largest one-year reduction in the deficit in U.S. history. That’s the
direct result of my Administration’s strategy to get the pandemic under
control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. We
spent less money than the last Administration and got better
results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues
and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending. My budget
will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing
to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring
that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.

At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation
and building a better America. We will secure our communities by
putting more police on the street to engage in accountable community
policing, hiring the agents needed to help fight gun crime, and
investing in crime prevention and community violence intervention.

I’m calling for one of the largest investments in our national security
in history, with the funds needed to ensure that our military remains
the best-prepared, best-trained, best-equipped military in the world.
 In addition, I’m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond
to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine with US support for
Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs. 

My budget also makes the investments needed to reduce costs for
families and make progress on my Unity Agenda – including investments
to cut the costs of child care and health care; help families pay for
other essentials; end cancer as we know it; support our
veterans; and get all Americans the mental health services they need.

All told, it is a budget that includes historic deficit reduction,
historic investments in our security at home and abroad, and an
unprecedented commitment to building an economy where everyone has a
chance to succeed.
