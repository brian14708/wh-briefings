  \ and Identity Theft in Pandemic Relief\_Programs"

As part of an ongoing Administration-wide effort to prevent, deter, and
punish identity theft and other forms of pandemic fraud by serious
criminal syndicates, the President will announce in the State of the
Union tonight:

-   **<u>The DOJ Will Appoint a Chief Prosecutor to Focus on the Most
    Egregious Forms of Pandemic Fraud Including Identity Theft by
    Criminal Syndicates:</u>** The Department of Justice’s (DOJ)
    COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force will expand its already robust
    efforts by appointing a Chief Prosecutor to lead teams of
    specialized prosecutors and agents focusing on major targets of
    pandemic fraud, such as those committing large-scale identity theft,
    including foreign-based actors. These strike force teams will also
    use state-of-the-art data analytics tools to connect the dots on
    identity theft and other complex fraud schemes committed across
    state lines or transnationally, as well as investigate major cases
    of criminal fraud in programs like the Paycheck Protection Program
    (PPP) and Unemployment Insurance (UI).
-   **<u>Heightened Resources and Enhanced Penalties for Egregious
    Pandemic Fraud in Areas Like PPP Loans and UI:</u> **The President
    will call on Congress to provide the resources needed for the DOJ
    Task Force to expand prosecutions of egregious pandemic fraud,
    including in support of the strike force teams. The DOJ has already
    successfully prosecuted scores of cases where individuals
    fraudulently obtained loans from PPP meant for small businesses
    facing threats of layoffs and closure due to the pandemic, and where
    identity thieves stole unemployment insurance benefits meant for
    those who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. These
    criminal abuses took place at the same time that front-line
    essential workers were risking their lives to help us all get
    through the crisis. The Administration will call on Congress to
    heighten the penalties for criminals who commit egregious pandemic
    fraud. 
-   **<u>Executive Order on Preventing Identity Theft in Public Benefits
    Programs:</u>** In the coming weeks, the President will announce a
    new Executive Order with broad government-wide directives, building
    on steps taken in 2021, to prevent and detect identity theft
    involving public benefits, while protecting privacy and civil
    liberties and preventing bias that results in disparate
    outcomes.  The EO will also direct new actions to support the
    victims of identity fraud.

**<u>Building on Existing Efforts to Crack Down on COVID-19 Fraud and
Serious Identity Theft of Public Benefits:</u> **The dramatic outpouring
of pandemic relief in 2020 saw an expansion of foreign and domestic
criminal syndicates defrauding unemployment insurance and other benefits
programs to rob American taxpayers of billions of dollars that should
have gone to support deserving small businesses and workers who had lost
their jobs. The Federal Trade Commission reported a 3000% increase in
reports of identity theft involving public benefits from 2019 to 2020.
The Administration has taken significant actions already to respond to
this inherited fraud.

-   **<u>Interagency COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force:</u> **In May
    2021,** **the President welcomed the Attorney General Merrick B.
    Garland’s announcement that the DOJ had launched the COVID-19 Fraud
    Enforcement Task Force to prosecute and recover stolen funds from
    domestic and international criminals exploiting pandemic relief
    programs. The Task Force, which is organized and led by the Deputy
    Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco, includes nearly 30 agencies that
    administer and oversee pandemic relief funding, such as the
    Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of
    the Treasury, the Small Business Administration, the U.S. Postal
    Inspection Service, and the Pandemic Response Accountability
    Committee (PRAC). So far, members of the Task Force have charged
    over* *1,000 criminal cases and opened over 200 civil investigations
    across 1800 individuals and entities, together involving billions of
    dollars in suspected fraud. The Task Force will appoint a Chief
    Prosecutor to lead investigations and prosecutions on identity theft
    and other egregious patterns of pandemic fraud.  
-   **<u>Initiative on Identity Theft Prevention and Public
    Benefits:</u>** On May 17, 2021, President Biden called for the ARP
    Coordinator and Office of Management and Budget, in consultation
    with the National Security Council (NSC), PRAC, Inspectors General,
    and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to take
    government-wide steps to prevent individuals from defrauding public
    benefits programs. This Initiative, working together with the
    cybersecurity team of the NSC, will be making government-wide
    recommendations as part of the President’s forthcoming Executive
    Order on preventing and detecting identity theft involving public
    benefits, while protecting privacy and civil liberties and
    preventing bias that results in disparate outcomes.  The Executive
    Order will also direct new actions to support victims of identity
    fraud. 
-   **<u>Re-established Respect for and Transparency with Oversight
    Community</u>**: This Administration has sought to re-establish
    respect and cooperation with the oversight community. The White
    House American Rescue Plan Coordinator meets weekly with the PRAC,
    bi-weekly with leadership at the GAO, and has held over 20 “Gold
    Standard” meetings across federal agencies, where agency officials
    discuss integrity controls with their Inspector General and PRAC
    leadership before programs are launched. This Administration has
    worked collaboratively to implement many recommendations from the
    oversight community, including strengthening controls for small
    business loan programs and directing multi-state data sharing to
    detect and fight UI fraud, while also screening a record number of
    benefits payments in programs across the government for potential
    fraud. The White House Infrastructure Coordinator has also met with
    all the relevant Inspectors General impacted by the Infrastructure
    Investment and Jobs Act and committed to working closely together on
    fraud prevention efforts.
