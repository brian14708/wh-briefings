  \ Data Privacy\_Framework"

The United States and the European Commission have committed to a new
Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, which will foster trans-Atlantic
data flows and address the concerns raised by the Court of Justice of
the European Union when it struck down in 2020 the Commission’s adequacy
decision underlying the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework.  

This Framework will reestablish an important legal mechanism for
transfers of EU personal data to the United States. The United States
has committed to implement new safeguards to ensure that signals
intelligence activities are necessary and proportionate in the pursuit
of defined national security objectives, which will ensure the privacy
of EU personal data and to create a new mechanism for EU individuals to
seek redress if they believe they are unlawfully targeted by signals
intelligence activities. This deal in principle reflects the strength of
the enduring U.S.-EU relationship, as we continue to deepen our
partnership based on our shared democratic values.

This Framework will provide vital benefits to citizens on both sides of
the Atlantic. For EU individuals, the deal includes new, high-standard
commitments regarding the protection of personal data. For citizens and
companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the deal will enable the
continued flow of data that underpins more than $1 trillion in
cross-border commerce every year, and will enable businesses of all
sizes to compete in each other’s markets. It is the culmination of more
than a year of detailed negotiations between the EU and the U.S.
following the 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European
Union ruling that the prior EU-U.S. framework , known as Privacy Shield,
 did not satisfy EU legal requirements.

The new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework underscores our shared
commitment to privacy, data protection, the rule of law, and our
collective security as well as our mutual recognition of the importance
of trans-Atlantic data flows to our respective citizens, economies, and
societies.  Data flows are critical to the trans-Atlantic economic
relationship and for all companies large and small across all sectors of
the economy. In fact, more data flows between the United States and
Europe than anywhere else in the world, enabling the $7.1 trillion
U.S.-EU economic relationship.

By ensuring a durable and reliable legal basis for data flows, the new
Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework will underpin an inclusive and
competitive digital economy and lay the foundation for further economic
cooperation. It addresses the Court of Justice of the European Union’s
*Schrems II* decision concerning U.S, law governing signals intelligence
activities. Under the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, the United
States has made unprecedented commitments to:

-   Strengthen the privacy and civil liberties safeguards governing U.S.
    signals intelligence activities;
-   Establish a new redress mechanism with independent and binding
    authority; and
-   Enhance its existing rigorous and layered oversight of signals
    intelligence activities.

For example, the new Framework ensures that:

-   Signals intelligence collection may be undertaken only where
    necessary to advance legitimate national security objectives, and
    must not disproportionately impact the protection of individual
    privacy and civil liberties;  
-   EU individuals may seek redress from a new multi-layer redress
    mechanism that includes an independent Data Protection Review Court
    that would consist of individuals chosen from outside the U.S.
    Government who would have full authority to adjudicate claims and
    direct remedial measures as needed; and  
-   U.S. intelligence agencies will adopt procedures to ensure effective
    oversight of new privacy and civil liberties standards. 

Participating companies and organizations that take advantage of the
Framework to legally protect data flows will continue to be required to
adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the requirement to
self-certify their adherence to the Principles through the U.S.
Department of Commerce. EU individuals will continue to have access to
multiple avenues of recourse to resolve complaints about participating
organizations, including through alternative dispute resolution and
binding arbitration.

These new policies will be implemented by the U.S. intelligence
community in a way to effectively protect its citizens, and those of its
allies and partners, consistent with the high-standard protections
offered under this Framework. 

The teams of the U.S. government and the European Commission will now
continue their cooperation with a view to translate this arrangement
into legal documents that will need to be adopted on both sides to put
in place this new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. For that
purpose, these U.S. commitments will be included in an Executive Order
that will form the basis of the Commission’s assessment in its future
adequacy decision.
