President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Emmanuel
Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister
Mario Draghi of Italy, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United
Kingdom.  The leaders affirmed their determination to continue raising
costs on Russia for its brutal attacks in Ukraine, as well as to
continue supplying Ukraine with security assistance to defend itself
against this unjustified and unprovoked assault.  They reviewed their
efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the millions affected by
the violence, both inside Ukraine and seeking refuge in other countries,
and underscored the need for humanitarian access to civilians in
Mariupol. They also discussed the importance of supporting stable energy
markets in light of current disruptions due to sanctions.
