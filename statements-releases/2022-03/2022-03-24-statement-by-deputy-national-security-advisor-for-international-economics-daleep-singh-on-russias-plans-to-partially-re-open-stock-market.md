title: "Statement by Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics\
  \ Daleep Singh on Russia\u2019s Plans to Partially Re-Open Stock Market"

What we’re seeing is a charade: a Potemkin market opening. After keeping
its markets closed for nearly a month, Russia announced it will only
allow 15% of listed shares to trade, foreigners are prohibited from
selling their shares, and short selling in general has been banned.
Meanwhile, Russia has made clear they are going to pour government
resources into artificially propping up the shares of companies that are
trading. This is not a real market and not a sustainable model—which
only underscores Russia’s isolation from the global financial system.
The United States and our allies and partners will continue taking
action to further isolate Russia from the international economic order
as long it continues its brutal war against Ukraine.
