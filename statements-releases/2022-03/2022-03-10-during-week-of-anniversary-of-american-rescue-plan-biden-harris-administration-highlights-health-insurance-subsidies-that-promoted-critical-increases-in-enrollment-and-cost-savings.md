title: "During Week of Anniversary of American Rescue Plan, Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\
  \ Highlights Health Insurance Subsidies That Promoted Critical Increases in Enrollment\
  \ and Cost\_Savings"
---
 
**<u>The American Rescue Plan (ARP) made essential investments to expand
health care coverage and reduce costs for millions of Americans.</u>** 
The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare critical shortcomings in our health care
and health insurance systems, and the ARP shored up vital gaps by
providing more affordable coverage to millions of American, including
many who lost their jobs over the last two years.  Today, the Biden
Administration is announcing a state-by-state breakdown of health
insurance enrollment changes during this year’s Open Enrollment Period
(OEP). 

**<u>Total Enrollment in this year’s OEP was 14.5 million:</u>** During
the 2022 OEP,14.5 million Americans enrolled in a Marketplace plan
through HealthCare.Gov or a State-Based Marketplace. ****

**<u>Coverage increased by 21% due to the American Rescue Plan:</u>**
The increase to 14.5 million people represented a 21% increase over 2021
due to the expansions of cost-saving subsidies in the American Rescue
Plan.

**<u>Americans saved $800 per person last year, and thousands per family
because of American Rescue Plan affordability measures.</u>** As a
result of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), families were able to keep
more money in their pockets, with actual savings of $67 per month per
person in premiums – that’s more than $800 each year per person for
groceries, child care, or other essentials.  

**<u>5.8 million *new* consumers enrolled during the 2021 Special
Enrollment and Open Enrollment periods</u>**, according to data from
HHS. Between 2016 and 2019, 3.6 million Americans lost coverage.

**The ARP reduced the cost of health care coverage by:**

-   **Ensuring that consumers eligible for financial assistance through
    premium tax credits had at least a couple plans to choose from**
    that won’t cost more than 8.5% of their household income on their
    Marketplace plan premium per year.
-   **Expanding the number of people eligible to save money on health
    care coverage** by temporarily expanding eligibility for premium tax
    credits for those previously excluded from financial assistance.
-   **Increasing affordability for low- and middle-income Americans** by
    increasing the size of tax credits.
-   **Addressing racial health inequities by expanding coverage and
    reducing costs. ** Increased affordability and health insurance
    coverage expansion allowed historically uninsured communities –
    especially those who have faced significant health disparities – to
    access coverage, thereby improving opportunities for health care
    during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
