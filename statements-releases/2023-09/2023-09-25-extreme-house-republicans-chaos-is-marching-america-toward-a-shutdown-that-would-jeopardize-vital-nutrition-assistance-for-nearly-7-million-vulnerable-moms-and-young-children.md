title: "Extreme House Republicans\u2019 Chaos Is Marching America Toward a Shutdown\
  \ That Would Jeopardize Vital Nutrition Assistance for Nearly 7 Million Vulnerable\
  \ Moms and Young\_Children"
---
 
With less than one week before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House
Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples’ lives and marching
our country toward a government shutdown that would have damaging
impacts across the country—including putting vital nutrition assistance
at risk for nearly 7 million women and children who rely on the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)—a
program that serves nearly half of babies born in this country.  
   
During an Extreme Republican Shutdown, women and children who count on
WIC would soon start being turned away at grocery store counters, with a
federal contingency fund drying up after just a few days and many states
left with limited WIC funds to operate the program.  
   
And the reason food assistance for these families is at risk is extreme
House Republicans’ continued efforts to slash funding for vital
programs, including WIC, rather than work in a bipartisan manner to keep
the government open and address emergency needs for the American people.
House Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal
that a large majority of them voted for just a few months ago and
proposed a continuing resolution (CR) that makes [devastating
cuts](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/19/by-the-numbers-impacts-of-house-republicans-extreme-cr-8-cuts/) to
programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on. While House
Republicans continue to debate what CR to advance, they have
consistently refused to include the Administration’s request for
additional WIC funding that’s needed to ensure the program can serve
every eligible pregnant woman, new mother, and infant and young child.
Without the Administration’s funding request, states could soon be
forced to institute waiting lists for WIC, causing mothers and children
to lose access to the vital nutrition assistance.  
   
**Below is a state-by-state breakdown of the number of women and
children at risk of losing critical nutrition assistance under an
Extreme Republican Shutdown:**
