title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Reduce\
  \ Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Combat the Climate\_Crisis"
---
 
*New steps will catalyze action across the federal government to account
for climate change impacts in budgeting, procurement, and other agency
decisions, and save hardworking families money*

From unprecedented wildfires, to extreme flooding, to record breaking
hurricanes, Americans across the country are feeling the devastating
impacts of the climate crisis. In just the first eight months of 2023,
the U.S. experienced [23 separate billion-dollar weather and climate
disasters](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/national-climate-202308) — the
highest number on record. That’s why since taking office, President
Biden has delivered on the most ambitious climate, conservation, and
environmental justice agenda in history, including signing into law the
largest climate investment ever. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration
is announcing another key step to catalyze further action across the
federal government and protect people from the growing impacts of the
climate crisis by accounting for climate change impacts in certain key
agency decisions.  
  
The President’s [Day One Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/)
on *Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science
to Tackle the Climate Crisis* re-established an Interagency Working
Group (IWG) and tasked it with identifying areas of budgeting,
purchasing, and other key decisions where agencies should consider the
Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (SC-GHG) — a well-established metric for
the known damages that greenhouse gas emissions cause across society.
For over a decade, federal agencies have routinely applied SC-GHG values
when estimating the benefits and costs of regulations. Today, the
Administration is announcing that the President has approved
recommendations from the IWG on the expanded use of the SC-GHG for
budgeting, procurement, and other agency decisions, including
reaffirming its use for environmental reviews where appropriate.  
  
By calculating the costs of climate change impacts on sectors like
agriculture, public health, labor productivity, and more, the SC-GHG
allows better comparisons to other costs and benefits of agency
decisions that may also be presented in dollar figures. And because the
SC-GHG estimates the societal cost of the effects of various greenhouse
gas pollutants emitted at distinct points in time, its use facilitates
the comparison of alternative policies with different emissions
profiles. The actions announced today will help protect people from the
growing impacts of the climate crisis and save hardworking families
money. They will build on existing work and best practices to guide
agencies as they continue to make clear-eyed decisions to combat the
climate crisis and protect the health and wellbeing of communities
across the country in the following areas, as appropriate and consistent
with applicable law:  
  
**<u>The President is directing agencies to consider the SC-GHG in the
development and implementation of their budgets.</u>**  
  
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently
[estimated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/03/14/the-importance-of-measuring-the-fiscal-and-economic-costs-of-climate-change/)
that climate-related disasters could increase annual federal spending by
over $100 billion and decrease annual federal revenue by up to $2
trillion by the end of the century. Today’s announcement will further
advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to incorporate
climate considerations into the President’s budget formulation and
implementation and save hardworking Americans money. Key examples of how
agencies can, as appropriate, incorporate the SC-GHG into budgeting
include:

-   Measuring Programmatic Emissions: To value the benefits of
    investments that reduce emissions, first agencies must measure
    programmatic emissions. OMB will work with federal agencies to begin
    measuring baseline greenhouse gas emissions and use the SC-GHG to
    calculate the benefits and impacts of federal programs, starting
    with programs that already monitor emissions. As programmatic
    emission measurement practices are adopted, agencies can begin to
    incorporate the SC-GHG among the other considerations that inform
    and justify their budget proposals.  
-   Assessing Discretionary Grants: The Department of Transportation
    already
    [recommends](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2022-03/Benefit%20Cost%20Analysis%20Guidance%202022%20%28Revised%29.pdf)
    that applicants for discretionary infrastructure grants use the
    SC-GHG in the benefit-cost analyses of their project proposals.
    Agencies should, as appropriate, expand the application of SC-GHG
    estimates to assess the potential climate benefits and costs of
    discretionary grants.  
-   Considering Harm-Based Penalty Calculation Methodologies: Some
    administrative penalties for violations of statutory or regulatory
    requirements are set at monetary levels that reflect the harm to
    society caused by the unlawful conduct. Agencies should explore
    their processes for setting administrative penalties and, if found
    appropriate and consistent with their authorities, consider
    incorporating the SC-GHG into particular penalties.  
-   Evaluating International Assistance: Agencies that assess
    international assistance and financing are encouraged to work with
    partner countries and international financial institutions to expand
    use of the SC-GHG metrics as appropriate, and help ensure that such
    investments support the Administration’s climate goals.

**<u>The President is directing agencies to consider the SC-GHG in
federal procurement processes.  </u>**  
  
As the world’s single largest purchaser—spending over $630 billion per
year on goods and services—the federal government has the ability to
move markets, invest in new ideas, and act as a model contracting
partner. By integrating the SC-GHG into procurement, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law, the federal government can reduce
emissions while saving taxpayer dollars, both in the short term through
reduced energy consumption, and in the long term by helping to reduce
the most catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. Key examples of how
to incorporate the SC-GHG into procurement include:

-   Focusing on High-Impact Procurements: Agencies should consider
    procurements of large, durable, energy-consuming products and
    systems that could serve as pilots for incorporating the SC-GHG.
    Such pilots will help agencies build the capacity and repeatable
    methods needed to replicate successes as they more broadly integrate
    the SC-GHG into federal procurement decisions over time. Some
    agencies have already started considering the SC-GHG in select
    procurements, such as through related environmental impact reviews.
    Notably, the U.S. Postal Service took steps to
    [assess](https://uspsngdveis.com/) the climate benefits of various
    procurement options, which demonstrated the benefits of its
    transition to next-generation, low-emission delivery vehicles.  
-   Minimizing Climate Risk in Acquisitions: The Federal Acquisition
    Regulatory (FAR) Council agencies are considering a number of
    potential changes around the
    [disclosure](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/10/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-proposes-plan-to-protect-federal-supply-chain-from-climate-related-risks/)
    of greenhouse gas emissions and moving toward more
    [sustainable](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/08/01/biden-harris-administration-announces-plan-to-maximize-purchases-of-sustainable-products-and-services-as-part-of-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
    federal purchasing. The FAR Council agencies have also
    [sought](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/15/fact-sheet-biden-administration-roadmap-to-build-an-economy-resilient-to-climate-change-impacts/)
    early public input on incorporating the SC-GHG into both domestic
    and overseas procurement decisions. Consistent with the President’s
    Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk, [EO
    14030](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/),
    OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy will continue working
    with the FAR Council to develop regulatory updates, as appropriate.

**<u>The President is directing agencies to consider the SC-GHG in
environmental reviews conducted pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) as appropriate.</u>**  
  
This is consistent with the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ)
January 2023 guidance on how agencies should consider greenhouse gas
emissions in their NEPA analysis. Under NEPA, before agencies take major
federal actions, such as permits, approvals, financial assistance, and
resource planning, they must identify, disclose, and consider in their
decision making the reasonably foreseeable effects of those proposals.
Agencies already often quantify greenhouse gas emissions in their
environmental reviews and when they do so, it is a relatively simple —
yet tremendously informative — step to also apply the SC-GHG estimates
to those emissions to provide context about their climate change
impacts.

-   Finalizing NEPA Guidance: CEQ
    [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/01/06/biden-harris-administration-releases-new-guidance-to-disclose-climate-impacts-in-environmental-reviews/)
    interim guidance in January 2023 on how agencies should consider
    greenhouse gas emissions in their NEPA reviews where applicable,
    including through appropriate use of the SC‑GHG, to help
    decisionmakers and the public evaluate climate change impacts and
    inform trade-offs between action alternatives. The period for public
    comment on the interim guidance closed in April 2023, and CEQ is
    working to finalize the guidance.  
-   Using the SC-GHG to Compare Climate Change Impacts: Agencies have
    increasingly begun to use the SC-GHG in their environmental reviews
    to compare the climate change impacts of proposed actions and their
    alternatives. For example, in its recent draft environmental impact
    statement to
    [assess](https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/2020343/200528424/20083507/250089689/Volume1_Dear%20Reader_Abstract_ES_TOC_Ch1-4_GSENM-DraftRMPEIS.pdf)
    four alternatives for managing resources at the Grand
    Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the Department of the
    Interior showed how specific approaches to vegetation management,
    livestock grazing, and forestry management could result in tens of
    millions of dollars’ worth of climate-related benefits.

By facilitating comparison of the climate consequences of alternative
options in budgeting, procurement, and other agency decisions,
appropriate use of the SC-GHG metrics can help agencies bolster the
federal government’s efforts to combat the climate crisis, further
protect communities, and save hardworking families money.
