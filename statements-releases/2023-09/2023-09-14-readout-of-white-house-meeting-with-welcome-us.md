title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with\_Welcome.US"
---
 
Today, White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and senior White House
officials met with the Welcome.US CEO Council, a group of nearly
40 CEOs from a range of industries, including its co-chairs Accenture
Chair and CEO Julie Sweet and Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has launched an historic expansion of
lawful pathways for people seeking safety and refuge in the United
States, while surging resources to the border for humane enforcement.   
   
The Welcome.US CEO Council is a nonpartisan, public-private partnership
that has worked to enable communities to welcome many more newcomers
arriving through these pathways – beginning with Afghan and Ukrainian
newcomers, and now expanded to global populations eligible for
humanitarian sponsorship and refugee resettlement. By leveraging private
sector resources and innovations and amplifying them with the
contributions of millions of Americans donating their time, resources,
and expertise, the CEO Council has helped scale the provision of
essential goods, technology, and services; quality jobs and legal aid;
and opportunities for communities to sponsor newcomers in need of
safety.  
   
Today, meeting participants affirmed the importance of this partnership
and discussed ways to support newcomers arriving through these pathways.
Participants discussed ways to scale innovations in employment,
mentorship, delivery of goods and services, and engaging communities as
sponsors and welcomers.   
   
While the work of Welcome.US is focused on longer term systemic change
to modernize our system to successfully integrate newcomers, meeting
participants also discussed the immediate needs of refugees and asylum
seekers, and the work that members of the CEO Council are engaging in to
meet these immediate needs. Some of the companies that were present at
today’s meeting will be taking a number of actions to help address the
immediate needs of newcomers. These include:

-   **Addressing transportation needs **by offering credits for
    ride-share services and providing funding for public
    transportation.  
-   Amplifying the U.S government’s** work authorization awareness
    campaign.**  
-   **Increasing pro bono legal services** to help newcomers submit work
    authorization applications and address other legal needs.   
-   **Connecting work eligible individuals** with good jobs by scaling
    outreach, training, and recruitment for newcomers, in partnership
    with the Tent Partnership for Refugees. 

Today’s meeting highlights the importance of public-private
partnerships in building durable and scalable capacity to better respond
to the global displacement crisis. Participants committed to
strengthening this partnership, in service of sustaining and expanding
whole-of-society approaches to welcoming newcomers and ensuring they
thrive together with their new communities.
