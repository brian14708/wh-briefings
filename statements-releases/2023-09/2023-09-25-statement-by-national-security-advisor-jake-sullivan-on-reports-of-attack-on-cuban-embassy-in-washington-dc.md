The United States strongly condemns Sunday’s reported attack on the
Cuban embassy in Washington, DC. Attacks against diplomatic facilities
are unacceptable. We are in contact with Cuban embassy officials and law
enforcement authorities to ensure an appropriate and timely
investigation as well as to offer our support for future protective
efforts.
