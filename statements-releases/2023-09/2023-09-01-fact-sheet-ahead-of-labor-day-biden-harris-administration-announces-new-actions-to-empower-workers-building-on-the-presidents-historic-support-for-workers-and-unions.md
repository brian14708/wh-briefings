*New actions announced this week empower workers to grow the economy
from the middle out and the bottom up—a core pillar of Bidenomics*

President Biden promised to be the most pro-worker and pro-union
President in American history, and he has kept that promise. Support for
unions is at its highest level in more than half a century,
inflation-adjusted income is up 3.5% since the President took office,
and the largest wage gains over the last two years have gone to the
lowest-paid workers. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and a
greater share of working-age people have a job today than at any other
time in more than two decades. Under the leadership of the Biden-Harris
Administration, all workers—including those who are often left behind in
recoveries—are experiencing record-low unemployment rates. 

Under Bidenomics, America is seeing a historic level of public and
private investment in manufacturing and new industries that will create
good-paying jobs that Americans can raise a family on and build a
community around. The President continues to fight to ensure all
Americans get fair pay for a hard day’s work and have a free and fair
choice to join a union.

In advance of Labor Day, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing
new actions this week to empower workers by investing in America’s clean
energy workforce, establishing pathways into high-paying and union jobs,
demonstrating the benefits of unions, and extending critical wage
protections.  These actions include:

**<u>Ensuring Clean Energy Investments Support High-Quality and Union
Jobs</u>**

-   Creating good-paying jobs in clean energy.  The Department of the
    Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service
    [published](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1708) a
    historic proposed rule to support good-paying jobs and workforce
    development made possible by incentives in the Inflation Reduction
    Act (IRA).  Many of the IRA’s clean energy deployment tax incentives
    are increased by five times if taxpayers pay workers prevailing
    wages and use Registered Apprentices. The Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking (NPRM) provides clarity about how these incentives work,
    including penalty and correction provisions for those who fail to
    meet the requirements, and promotes worker-centric practices.  The
    NPRM also encourages the use of qualifying Project Labor Agreements,
    which guarantee workers good-paying jobs, help construction
    contractors finish complex projects on time and on budget, and can
    establish equitable pathways into construction careers.  
-   Supporting a fair and just electric vehicle transition.  The
    Department of Energy opened applications for the $2 billion Domestic
    Manufacturing Conversion Grants program, created by the IRA. The
    program will provide funding for auto manufacturers transitioning
    from internal combustion engine vehicles and components to electric
    vehicles and components. In line with the President’s call for a
    transition that protects workers, this program will prioritize
    applications from facilities that are at risk of closing or recently
    closed and reward applicants that retain existing workers, have
    strong labor partnerships, pay high wages, and convert facilities
    while remaining in the same community.  The Department of Energy
    Loan Programs Office is also facilitating access to $10 billion in
    capital for auto factory conversions.  The Office plans to
    prioritize the review of applications for projects in locations with
    a long history of auto manufacturing and demonstrate strong
    workforce practices and labor standards.
-   Strengthening electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chains and
    supporting high-quality jobs, including for auto workers.  The
    Department of Energy is releasing a second-round Notice of Intent
    for $3.5 billion for the Battery Manufacturing grant programs under
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  The program will help expand
    domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and the
    nation’s grid, as well as for battery materials and components
    currently imported from other countries.  This Notice of Intent
    outlines the direction for the next phase of the program, which will
    support communities with experienced auto workers and a history of
    producing vehicles, applicants with strong workforce practices, and
    applicants who plan to create high-quality jobs.

**<u>Demonstrating the Union Advantage</u>**

-   Conducting analysis on how unions benefit the economy.  The
    Department of the Treasury [released a first-of-its-kind
    report](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1706) that
    finds that unions help grow the economy by reducing inequality,
    raising incomes, increasing savings (including retirement savings),
    and broadening homeownership.  According to the report, which was
    released as part of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing
    and Empowerment chaired by Vice President Kamala Harris, union
    members make higher wages and are more likely to earn critical
    benefits like retirement, health care, child care, life insurance,
    and sick leave.  The report also finds that *all* workers—even
    non-union workers and workers who have been laid off—experience
    gains from greater unionization.

**<u>Extending Overtime Protections</u>**

-   Proposing new rules that would provide millions of workers with
    overtime protections.  The Department of Labor [released a proposed
    rule](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtime/rulemaking) to
    increase the overtime salary threshold from under $36,000 per year
    to roughly $55,000 per year.  Under this proposal, more salaried
    employees making less than $55,000 per year and working more than 40
    hours a week would receive at least one and one-half times their
    regular rates of pay for the overtime hours they work.  The proposed
    rule would extend overtime pay to as many as 3.6 million hardworking
    Americans.

These actions build on historic support for workers and unions since Day
One of the Biden-Harris Administration, including:

**<u>Increasing Wages</u>**

-   Raising wages for construction workers. In August, the Department of
    Labor (DOL) published a final rule updating the Davis-Bacon Act
    prevailing wage standards for the first time in nearly 40 years. 
    The rule affects more than one million workers constructing $200
    billion in federally funded or assisted projects, who will receive
    higher wages over time.  Nearly all of the significant construction
    programs contained in President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act require or
    provide strong incentives for the use of Davis-Bacon prevailing
    wages—which ensures even more workers will benefit from DOL’s new
    rule.  
-   Protecting workers’ pay.  The Biden-Harris Administration has
    recovered more than $690 million for more than 440,000 low-paid
    workers across the nation.  The Administration enforces laws that
    protect these workers from being victims of wage theft and
    exploitation when they were not paid minimum wages or hard-earned
    overtime wages, were denied their tips, or were misclassified as
    independent contractors.

**<u>Supporting Workers’ Right to Organize</u>**

-   Empowering workers through education.  Recently, the Department of
    Labor relaunched the [Worker Organizing Resource and Knowledge
    (WORK)
    Center](https://www.dol.gov/general/workcenter/welcome-to-the-work-center).
     The WORK Center is the federal government’s premiere online
    resource center providing information about labor unions and their
    importance to workers and communities.  While more than half of
    non-union workers say they want a union, only about 10 percent of
    these workers say they know how to form one.  The WORK Center meets
    the needs of workers who are seeking more information about their
    labor rights and lack experience in organizing.  
-   Disclosing when federal contractors hire union avoidance advisors.
     In July, the Department of Labor published a final regulation
    updating the LM-10 form, a form that employers must file disclosing
    whether they pay consultants to persuade workers concerning their
    organizing and collective bargaining rights or to surveil activities
    of employees and unions involved in labor disputes. The rule newly
    requires private-sector employers to indicate whether they are
    federal contractors or subcontractors, promoting transparency for
    workers and the federal government into whether contractors hire
    anti-union consultants. 

**<u>Expanding Workforce Development</u>**

-   Making historic investment in Registered Apprenticeships.  All
    Americans should have a pathway to good-paying jobs, which is why
    the Biden-Harris Administration invested a historic $285 million in
    Registered Apprenticeships in fiscal year (FY) 2023 and, in July,
    awarded [more than $65
    million](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20230719) in
    grants to 45 states to expand and diversify Registered
    Apprenticeships in high-demand industries.  The Administration also
    [launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-apprenticeship-ambassador-initiative-to-create-equitable-debt-free-pathways-to-high-paying-jobs/)
    the Apprenticeship Ambassadors Initiative to amplify the Registered
    Apprenticeship model with private- and public-sector employers.  
-   Launching Investing in America Workforce Hubs.In May, the
    Biden-Harris Administration
    [launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
    new initiatives to train and connect more workers to the good-paying
    jobs—including union jobs—created by the President’s Investing in
    America investments. Through the Workforce Hubs Initiative, the
    Administration is partnering with local officials, employers,
    unions, community colleges, and other stakeholders to ensure a
    diverse and skilled workforce is ready to meet the demand for labor
    driven by historic public and private investments in five
    Hubs—Phoenix, Columbus, Baltimore, Augusta, and Pittsburgh.

**<u>Fostering Equal Employment Opportunities</u>**

-   Increasing access to good construction jobs for underrepresented
    workers.  In March, the Department of Labor
    [launched](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20230314)
    the Mega Construction Project (Megaproject) Program, initially
    designating as Megaprojects 12 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded
    projects across the country. The Megaprojects Program provides free,
    continuous, on-the-ground assistance to help construction project
    owners, contractors, and unions ensure equal employment
    opportunities for underrepresented workers. Also in March, the
    Department of Labor announced a $20 million cooperative agreement
    with TradesFutures for the Scaling Apprenticeship Readiness Across
    the Building Trades Initiative, in partnership with the National
    Urban League.  This first-of-its-kind initiative aims to
    substantially increase the number of participants from
    underrepresented populations and underserved communities in
    Registered Apprenticeship programs in the construction industry.  
-   Expanding access to child care and long-term care. In April,
    President Biden issued an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/)
    with more than 50 actions to increase access to high-quality care
    and better support caregivers. The Executive Order directs all
    cabinet-level agencies with federal job-creation funds—including
    from his Investing in America agenda—to consider requiring or
    encouraging grantees to use funds for supportive services, including
    child care and long-term care, to the maximum extent allowable. This
    action will help ensure underserved workers can enroll in, remain
    in, and complete training, and transition to good jobs, including
    union jobs. This builds on the first-of-its-kind requirement that
    employers seeking significant federal funds under the CHIPS and
    Science Act provide a concrete plan to help their employees access
    affordable child care, enabling more parents from local communities
    to access good-paying jobs.
