title: "Vice President Harris Launches Nationwide \u201CFight for Our Freedoms College\
  \ Tour\u201D to Mobilize Students and Young People in the Fight for Their\_Rights"

*At around a dozen schools across at least seven states, the Vice
President will bring thousands of students together around the fight for
reproductive freedom, common sense gun safety laws, climate action,
voting rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and teaching America’s full history. *  
 

As students across the nation return to school, Vice President Kamala
Harris will embark on a month-long college tour throughout America to
mobilize young people in the ongoing fight for fundamental freedoms and
rights. She is set to visit around a dozen campuses in at least seven
states as she brings together thousands of students for high-energy,
large-scale events. The Vice President’s flurry of “Fight for Our
Freedoms College Tour” stops will focus on key issues that
disproportionately impact young people across the country – from
reproductive freedom and gun safety to climate action, voting rights,
LGBTQ+ equality, and book bans.  
   
“This generation is critical to the urgent issues that are at stake
right now for our future,” **said Vice President Harris.** “It is young
leaders throughout America who know what the solutions look like and are
organizing in their communities to make them a reality. My message to
students is clear: We are counting on you, we need you, you are
everything.”  
   
Vice President Harris’s “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour” will
include visits to historically Black colleges and universities,
Hispanic-serving institutions, community colleges, apprenticeship
programs, and state schools. The Vice President will highlight how the
Biden-Harris Administration has delivered for young people, outline the
work ahead to protect fundamental freedoms, and hear directly from
students who are organizing on the frontlines of these fights. She will
also urge attendees to register to vote, use their voice, and stay
engaged.  
   
This series of college tour events is a continuation of the Vice
President’s recent travel, and comes on the heels of her Summer of
Action that included visits to 17 states. Vice President Harris has
already been to 11 college campuses this year after traveling to 14
schools in 2022.

**includes the following stops:**

-   Hampton University in Hampton, VA on 9/14
-   North Carolina A&T in Greensboro, NC on 9/15
