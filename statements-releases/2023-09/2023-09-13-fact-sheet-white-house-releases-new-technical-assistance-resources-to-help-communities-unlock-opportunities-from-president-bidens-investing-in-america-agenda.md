title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Releases New Technical Assistance Resources to Help\
  \ Communities Unlock Opportunities from President\_Biden\u2019s Investing in America\_\
  Agenda"
---
 
President Biden is growing the economy from the middle out and bottom
up, and his Investing in America agenda unlocks billions of dollars in
opportunity for states, territories, Tribes, and local governments to
make a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, clean energy
and climate resilience.

Over 90% of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)’s historic funding
is being deployed by non-Federal partners. And the Inflation Reduction
Act (IRA) provides state, local, Tribal, territorial and
non-governmental partners significant new funding for clean energy,
climate mitigation and resilience, agriculture, and conservation-related
investments through both grant funding and tax credits.  
  
In the past, too many communities have lacked the resources to apply for
and deploy transformative Federal funding opportunities. The
Biden-Harris Administration has made it a major goal to help state,
local, Tribal and territorial governments and other nongovernmental
partners navigate, access, and deploy these record resources to build a
better America.  
  
From creating state infrastructure coordinators in partnership with
governors to releasing guidebooks and toolkits to better navigate the
infrastructure and clean energy laws; to standing up new programs to
provide or fund technical advisors for lower-capacity communities, the
Administration is ensuring all communities can access Federal funding.  
  
Today, the White House released an [updated technical assistance
guide ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/resources/technical-assistance-guide/)that
focuses on federal and state technical assistance programs aimed at
accessing and deploying Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation
Reduction Act funding. The updated technical assistance guide builds on
the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s
Guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BUILDING-A-BETTER-AMERICA_FINAL.pdf),
[Rural Playbook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/rural/), and [Tribal
Playbook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/resources/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-tribal-playbook/),
and the Inflation Reduction Act’s
[Guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/)
and [Tribal Playbook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/tribes/).
This new guide highlights programs that help communities navigate
programs and resources that can help them deliver infrastructure, clean
energy and climate resilience projects. The White House also maintains a
[webpage](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/directpay/) with
resources on the Inflation Reduction Act’s “elective pay” (often called
“direct pay”) provisions, through which tax-exempt and governmental
entities can, for the first time, take advantage of tax credits for
building clean energy projects.

While some of these programs offer hands-on and intensive planning and
delivery support for communities, others are more self-directed
resources and tools such as webinars and websites, or funding that can
support project planning.  The guide covers more than 150 technical
assistance and capacity building programs encompassing well over $1
billion in Federal support. In addition to federal programs, the guide
is also highlighting over a dozen new commitments from states to support
local government applicants. 

“The President’s commitment is to leave no community behind as we invest
in America,” said Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor to the President and
White House Infrastructure Coordinator. “That’s why we have put
unprecedented focus on providing technical assistance to local
communities. This guide is just one more way we’re working to ensure
state, local, Tribal and territorial governments have the tools and
resources they need to unlock the historic investments in President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda.”

“President Biden’s Investing in America agenda takes historic action to
rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, lead the clean energy industries of
the future, and create good-paying, union jobs. But those investments
are only as good as our ability to get them into the hands of the
communities who need them the most,” said John Podesta, Senior Advisor
to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation.
“Today’s new technical assistance guide is an important step to help
those communities access funding, leverage multiple federal
opportunities, and bring the benefits of these investments to Americans
in every corner of the country.”  
  
**THRIVING COMMUNITIES NETWORK TO HELP UNLOCK HISTORIC FUNDING  
**  
While technical assistance has many forms, the most intensive technical
assistance and capacity building is being delivered through the
interagency Thriving Communities Network (TCN). Created in 2022, the TCN
is a federal interagency effort to coordinate place-based technical
assistance and capacity-building resources for urban, rural, and Tribal
communities experiencing a history of economic distress and systemic
disinvestment. These federal resources include grant and financial
management support, pre-development assistance, community engagement,
planning, and project delivery support. Through TCN, federal partners at
the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban
Development, Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency,
Federal Emergency Management Agency and General Services Administration
are coordinating and collaborating across a set of specific assistance
programs and engaging their regional and field staff who often serve as
key points of contact for communities.

At a time of historic federal infrastructure and climate investment
through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act,
the Biden-Harris Administration has made its Justice40 pledge a
priority, ensuring that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain
federal investments, such as climate, clean energy, and other areas,
flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened
by pollution and underinvestment. This place-based technical assistance
network is one way the Administration is committed to delivering on the
Justice40 Initiative and advancing President Biden’s commitment to
environmental justice.

Among key areas of technical assistance progress in the network:

-   Launched in April 2022 and expanded in November 2022, the Rural
    Partners Network is now active in 36 [community
    networks](https://www.rural.gov/community-networks) in 10 states and
    Puerto Rico. Community networks receive on-the-ground support from
    full-time federal staff who live and work locally. These staff
    members provide technical assistance based on each community’s
    needs, helping them navigate federal programs, build relationships
    and prepare successful applications for funding.  
-   Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released a
    [Notice of Funding Opportunity
    (NOFO)](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-next-phase-thriving-communities-grant-program)
    for up to $22 million in grants to provide targeted technical
    assistance and a Call for Letters of Interest from communities
    seeking support through its [Thriving Communities
    Program](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/thriving-communities).
    Earlier this year, [DOT
    announced](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-awards-2115-million-through-new-thriving-communities)
    four Capacity Builder teams received $21.15 million to provide
    technical assistance and support to 64 communities.  
-   Earlier this year, EPA, in partnership with the Department of Energy
    (DOE), announced the 16 Environmental Justice Thriving Communities
    Technical Assistance Centers (EJ TCTACs) that will receive $177
    million to help underserved and overburdened communities across the
    country. These centers will provide training and other assistance to
    build capacity for navigating federal grant application systems,
    writing strong grant proposals, and effectively managing grant
    funding.  
-   The Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities
    and Economic Revitalization led by DOE is prioritizing the immediate
    needs of coal mining and power plant communities by coordinating,
    identifying, and delivering federal resources to all Energy
    Communities including rural, urban, oil, gas, fenceline and Tribal
    communities.

**STATES PROVIDE UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT  
**  
Because a majority of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding and critical
Inflation Reduction Act grant funding flows to states through formula
programs, the Administration has put a particular focus on helping
states deploy those resources wisely and well, in part by establishing a
state infrastructure coordinators network to provide hands-on
coordination, technical assistance and support. Governors and state
leaders from across the country have answered the call to get technical
assistance to those who need it most. Over a dozen states are now
providing significant technical assistance and local match resources to
support accessing and deploying funding from the President’s Investing
in America agenda.  Leveraging the work of state infrastructure
coordinators, states have begun to share and then emulate these best
practices.

Among some of the new technical assistance models from states:

-   Colorado created 14 Regional Grant Navigator (RGN) positions at each
    of the Councils of Government across the state to provide capacity
    support to Colorado local governments, special districts, and
    federally recognized Tribes seeking BIL and IRA funding
    opportunities through grant navigation, writing and review,
    technical support, resource sharing and regional collaboration
    support.  
-   Delaware’s Grant Assistance Program at the University of Delaware is
    providing free technical grant assistance to local governments
    funded by the state budget for BIL programs and other competitive
    and formula grant opportunities through project development, grant
    writing assistance, and project delivery assistance, including
    project implementation support, grant management, and reporting
    assistance.  
-   The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity’s
    Federal Grant Support Program is making up to $15 million available
    to Illinois-based businesses and organizations seeking competitive
    federal grants.  
-   Prompted by President Biden’s Interagency Working Group on Coal and
    Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, Kentucky
    created a program to help local governments and nonprofit entities
    apply for and match available federal funding.  
-   Louisiana’s Governor’s Office is partnering with the Louisiana
    Municipal Association and Police Jury Association to deliver
    technical assistance and non-federal match support to local
    governments via a newly created joint non-profit, the Louisiana
    Infrastructure Technical Assistance Corporation, funded with $25
    million in state funds.  
-   Maine’s Community Resilience Partnership (CRP) provides financial
    and technical assistance to communities to plan and implement
    climate-ready infrastructure, increase community resilience to the
    impacts of climate change, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For
    example, the Towns of Blue Hill, Surry and Brooksville received CRP
    funding to complete a climate vulnerability assessment across all
    three communities, positioning them for federal funding to improve a
    highly vulnerable and shared wastewater treatment facility.  
-   Massachusetts is distributing direct local technical assistance
    funding to each of the Commonwealth’s 13 regional planning agencies
    to enable municipalities to take on federal funding applications and
    other projects they may not have the staff capacity to address on
    their own.  
-   Michigan’s new infrastructure office established a Technical
    Assistance Center to allow eligible recipients to receive support
    for BIL funding applications through project planning, application
    writing, and compliance support. Through the Make it in Michigan
    Competitiveness Fund, technical assistance is also available for IRA
    and CHIPS funding applications.  
-   Minnesota is providing state grant funds of up to $30,000 for local
    agencies and Tribes that seek to apply for a federal discretionary
    grant for a transportation related purpose.

<!-- -->

-   Wisconsin’s Department of Natural Resources established a direct
    technical assistance program for eligible school districts and
    Tribal organizations looking to participate in EPA’s Clean School
    Bus Program, boosting the number of applicants for the program.
    Wisconsin entities were awarded funding for 65 electric school
    buses.  
-   Rhode Island’s Governor’s office and the Partnership for Rhode
    Island created CompeteRI to provide capacity and technical support
    to state agencies, municipalities, Tribal governments, educational
    institutions, nonprofits, and private entities as they apply for BIL
    grants.

**PHILANTHROPY AND OTHER PARTNERS STEP IN  
**  
Ensuring that the full benefits of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
Investing in America agenda reach the people and places that need them
most requires a concerted effort not only from the federal government,
but from non-federal actors of all kinds. Much of this progress wouldn’t
be possible without the many philanthropic organizations that have
stepped up to support states and local communities in delivering on this
once-in-a-generation investment.  
  
Philanthropy has long played a critical role in advancing climate action
and providing crucial capacity-building, technical assistance, and
direct support to nonprofit organizations and low-income and underserved
communities.   
  
In response to the Administration’s external engagement efforts,
philanthropic, labor and nonprofit organizations have committed new
resources to assist communities accessing and deploying federal
infrastructure funding, including:

-   Bloomberg Philanthropies, Emerson Collective, Ballmer Group, Ford
    Foundation, and the Kresge Foundation, launched the [Local
    Infrastructure Hub](/localinfrastructure.org/%3c), a national
    program to ensure that all U.S. cities and towns can access federal
    infrastructure funding to drive local recovery, improve communities,
    and deliver results for residents. The $55 million commitment of
    support for local communities, delivered in collaboration with the
    U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, and Results
    for America, has brought together leading experts and resources to
    help city leaders access and ambitiously leverage funding from the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act to
    advance groundbreaking solutions to major challenges, especially
    narrowing wealth disparities for communities of color and cutting
    the emissions that cause climate change. To date, the Local
    Infrastructure Hub has delivered technical assistance and strategic
    guidance to more than 1,100 local governments.  
-   Accelerator for America (AFA) is providing technical assistance and
    capacity building to help local government and economic development
    leaders maximize this moment of new investment in infrastructure and
    climate action. AFA is supporting more than 40 communities with
    in-kind support for strategic planning/predevelopment, grant
    writing, workforce development initiatives, peer learning cohorts,
    and project delivery innovation. AFA is facilitating partnerships
    and support from the private sector, philanthropy and other
    government partners to help local leaders leverage additional
    funding, as part of a Capacity Builder Team within DOT’s Thriving
    Communities Program. AFA supported cities have won millions in DOT
    discretionary grants.  
-   The Catalyze Registry is a new philanthropic registry and
    matchmaking service born out of The White House’s Talent Pipeline
    Challenge announced by President Biden last November. Led by What
    Works Plus funder collaborative and America Achieves, the Catalyze
    Registry enables philanthropy to scale needed support for
    initiatives that build a diverse talent pool for quality
    infrastructure careers. To date, 18 national funders have accessed
    the registry to learn about federally funded place-based coalitions
    seeking about $35 million in philanthropy to maximize their
    impact.  
-   The State Funding Readiness Project (SFRP) is a collaborative
    program between the U.S. Climate Alliance and Hua Nani Partners that
    provides no-cost rapid response technical assistance to help states
    leverage federal investments from the BIL and IRA in ways that
    advance climate equity priorities and reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions. The program matches states with specialized experts that
    offer a wide range of technical support services, including
    grant-writing assistance, technical sector expertise, and Justice40
    implementation, to help develop ambitious and competitive grant
    applications. SFRP fills gaps in state expertise and capacity that
    hinder their ability to apply for federal funding opportunities.
    Since 2022, SFRP has assisted 11 states in submitting 17 federal
    grant applications targeting more than $980 million in program
    funding.  
-   Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) has signed a memorandum of
    understanding with DOT to coordinate aligned Reconnecting
    Communities technical assistance efforts to plan and build
    infrastructure that reconnects and improves access, especially for
    marginalized communities. Working with philanthropic organizations
    like RWJF leverages additional resources and enables support to more
    communities and organizations that are working to provide people
    with better mobility options to facilitate community revitalization,
    catalyze equitable development and create access to more economic
    opportunities.  
-   Communities First Infrastructure Alliance, supported by numerous
    national and community foundations, has brought together government,
    philanthropic, and community leaders committed to advancing more
    inclusive public investment. The Communities First Fund resources
    community-based organizations to expand their capacity and
    effectively engage in the public process as part of a longer-term
    movement-building strategy and to fortify the civic infrastructure
    to meet this moment. To foster greater coordination among capacity
    builders, technical assistance providers, practitioners, and
    community partners, Communities First is coordinating Regional
    Convenings in the coming months to elevate emerging priorities,
    champion best practices, and encourage accountability standards that
    address the challenges of those disproportionately impacted by past
    underinvestment at scale. The regional convenings will support
    communities to unlock the federal resources available and actualize
    the climate & racial justice commitments of the Biden-Harris
    Administration.  
-   The Milken Institute (MI) is working to accelerate the development
    of a robust pipeline of shovel-worthy community infrastructure
    projects, focusing especially on under-served rural, urban, tribal
    and environmental justice communities with capacity challenges. MI’s
    Community Infrastructure Center platform connects community project
    sponsors to federal and non-federal funding sources and project
    readiness tools to help communities develop loan-worthy,
    grant-worthy and investment-ready projects. The CIC was initially
    supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce. To engage
    local communities and states about the importance of project
    predevelopment to enable communities to effectively access new
    federal funding, MI formed the 10,000 Communities Initiative, a
    collaborative partnership effort that organizes regional events
    across the U.S. to advance pipeline. Since public roll-out in
    January, 2023, the CIC platform now has 250 individual communities
    using our tools and 27 organizations now building a portfolio of
    2500+ climate and rural equity projects using dedicated channels on
    the platform.

In conjunction with the 1-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction
Act, the White House recently announced that major philanthropic
organizations have formed several “pooled funds,” and, in combination
with aligned national philanthropies, impact investing organizations and
intermediaries, have committed over $1.6 billion to support the
implementation of the clean energy and climate provisions of the
Inflation Reduction Act. This support will ensure more direct access to
critical technical assistance for underserved communities so that they
can realize the full benefits of the law.  
  
A current list of participants in this effort include: Ballmer Group,
Bezos Earth Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Breakthrough Energy,
ClimateWorks Foundation, Communities First, David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, Elemental Excelerator, Ford Foundation, High Tide
Foundation, Hyphen, James Irvine Foundation, John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation, J40 Accelerator, Joshua and Anita Bekenstein
Charitable Fund, Kresge Foundation, McKnight Foundation, Omidyar
Network, Open Society Foundations, Open Society Policy Center,
Rockefeller Brothers Fund, RF Catalytic Capital, Rural Climate
Partnership, Sea Change Foundation, Sequoia Climate Foundation, Skoll
Foundation, The Families and Workers Fund, The JPB Foundation, The Just
Transition Fund, The Rockefeller Foundation, Three Cairns Group, U.S.
Energy Foundation, Waverley Street Foundation, William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation, Wyss Foundation.  
  
These philanthropic initiatives will support communities and
organizations across the country as they work to access the programs and
opportunities contained in the Investing in America agenda, create
good-paying local jobs, grow clean energy industries and good jobs, and
create better, more equitable, and healthier places to live.  
  
Examples of initiatives this philanthropic funding is intended to
support include:

-   expanding green spaces to combat urban heat and build climate
    resilience,
-   supporting technical and planning assistance to access programs like
    direct pay tax incentives to advance community-led priorities and
    grant programs for electric utilities and rural co-ops to invest in
    clean energy infrastructure,
-   providing no-cost federal grant writing services to Tribes,
-   underwriting regional convenings with government and community
    leaders,
-   accelerating support for state and local understanding and use of
    federal investments, like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and
    clean energy tax credits,
-   empowering workers through union labor and workplace advocacy to
    engage in the clean energy transition,
-   and ensuring that the clean energy economy is made real and benefits
    everyone, especially in low-income, rural, energy, and disadvantaged
    communities.

The Biden-Harris Administration welcomes additional commitments from
nongovernmental stakeholders to support states and help local
communities access this once-in-a-generation investment.
