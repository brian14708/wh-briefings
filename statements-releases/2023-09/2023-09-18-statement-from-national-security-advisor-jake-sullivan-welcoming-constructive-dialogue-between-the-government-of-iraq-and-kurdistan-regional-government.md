title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Welcoming Constructive\
  \ Dialogue Between The Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional\_Government"
---
 
We welcome the constructive dialogue conducted last week between the
Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) meant to
resolve outstanding issues in a manner consistent with the Iraqi
constitution. We are encouraged by the Government of Iraq’s decision to
release additional funds to the KRG to help ensure civil servants
receive their salaries and to promote stability and economic growth. The
United States will continue to work with all relevant parties to
expeditiously reopen the Iraq-Turkey pipeline as soon as possible. The
United States will also continue to remain intensively engaged to
promote a stable and secure Iraq and to promote durable resolutions to
outstanding issues.
