WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden is announcing the inaugural members
of the President’s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in
the United States. The establishment of this Council was a significant
commitment announced by Vice President Harris on behalf of the
Biden-Harris Administration during the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit,
aimed at enhancing dialogue between United States officials and the
African Diaspora.

The African Diaspora in the United States, a rich and diverse community
of African Americans and African immigrants, is foundational to our 21st
century partnership with Africa. This community, which includes
descendants of enslaved Black Americans, has long advocated for the
prosperity of the African continent and its people, and strengthened the
unique relationship between the United States and Africa.

In accordance with Executive Order 14089, the Advisory Council comprises
up to 12 members appointed by the Secretary of State, and represents the
diversity of the African Diaspora from African American communities
around the United States and African immigrant communities across the
continent and the Caribbean. The Council’s members include individuals
who have distinguished themselves in government, sports, creative
industries, business, academia, social work, and faith-based activities.
They will provide invaluable guidance to reinforce cultural, social,
political, and economic ties between the U.S. and Africa, and promote
trade, investment, and educational exchanges between the United States
and Africa.

Rev. Dr. Silvester Scott Beaman will serve as Chair of the Council.
Bishop Beaman’s extensive experience and deep roots in Africa will
enable him to lead the Council to achieve its full potential.
