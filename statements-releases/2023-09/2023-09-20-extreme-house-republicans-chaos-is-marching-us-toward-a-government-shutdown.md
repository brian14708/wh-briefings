title: "Extreme House Republicans\u2019 Chaos Is Marching Us Toward a Government\_\
  Shutdown"
---
 
While President Biden has been in New York this week showcasing
America’s global leadership on the world stage, extreme House
Republicans are consumed by chaos and marching our country toward a
government shutdown that would damage our communities, economy, and
national security.  
  
Instead of following the bipartisan example of Republicans and Democrats
in the Senate, extreme House Republicans continue to demand a reckless
laundry list of partisan proposals as a condition of keeping the
government open—from an evidence-free impeachment that even some of
their own members [don’t agree
with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/15/congressman-ken-buck-biden-impeachment/),
to [reckless
cuts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Shalanda-Young-Interested-Parties-Memo-9.12.23-1.pdf)
to programs millions of hardworking families and seniors count on, to a
litany of other extraneous ideological demands.  
  
Just three months after threatening to default on America over their
partisan agenda, extreme House Republicans are back at it again. Their
latest 30-day continuing resolution is just more of the same—a shutdown
bill that doubles down on extreme, partisan proposals that can’t pass
the Senate and will never become law. Their bill not only makes
[devastating, indiscriminate
cuts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/19/by-the-numbers-impacts-of-house-republicans-extreme-cr-8-cuts/)
to food safety, education, law enforcement, housing, public health, Head
Start and child care, Meals on Wheels, and more—it also fails to provide
the urgent funding President Biden requested to support disaster-struck
communities, counter fentanyl trafficking, support Ukraine, provide
critical food assistance for pregnant and post-partum women and young
children, and avoid disruptions to FAA air traffic operations.  
  
And here’s what’s clear: if extreme House Republicans fail to ram
through their radical agenda, they plan to take their frustration out on
the American people by forcing a government shutdown that would
undermine our economy and national security, create needless uncertainty
for families and businesses, and have damaging consequences across the
country.  
  
**<u>Consider just some of the impacts of a Republican shutdown:</u>**

-   **Force Servicemembers and Law Enforcement Officers to Work Without
    Pay:** Under a Republican shutdown, all active-duty military
    personnel and many law enforcement officers would remain at work,
    but receive no pay until appropriated funds are available.  
-   **Endanger Disaster Response:** A Republican shutdown would create
    an increased risk that FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund is depleted and
    would complicate new emergency response efforts if additional
    catastrophic disasters occur. Funding for long-term recovery
    projects would also remain halted, worsening ongoing delays as FEMA
    awaits new appropriations.  
-   **Undermine Research on Cancer and Other Diseases:** A Republican
    shutdown would stall critical research on diseases like cancer and
    Alzheimer’s because the National Institutes of Health would be
    forced to delay new clinical trials. New patients, many of whom are
    desperately waiting for a chance at new treatment through a clinical
    trial, will be turned away.  
-   **Eliminate Head Start Slots for Kids:** Under a Republican
    shutdown, 10,000 children across the country would immediately lose
    access to Head Start, as the Department of Health and Human Services
    wouldn’t be able to award Head Start Grants during a shutdown—with
    the impacts only growing worse over time.  
-   **Risk Significant Delays for Travelers:** Air traffic controllers
    and TSA Officers would have to work without pay—potentially leading
    to significant delays and longer wait times for travelers at
    airports across the country like there were during previous
    shutdowns.  
-   **Undermine Public Health and Environmental Protections:** Most
    EPA-led inspections at hazardous waste sites as well as drinking
    water and chemical facilities would stop. EPA would halt oversight
    and review of permits and plans to ensure safe water and clean air
    in communities. Additionally, efforts to address dangerous
    contaminants like PFAS—which are linked to severe health effects,
    including cancer—would be delayed, and cleanup activities at
    Superfund sites would slow or cease.  
-   **Deny Capital for Small Businesses:** The Small Business
    Administration would not accept, review, or approve any new business
    loans—including SBA’s primary loan to small businesses—cutting off
    an important source of funding for small businesses across the
    country.  
-   **Undermine Food Safety:** The Food and Drug Administration could be
    forced to delay food safety inspections for a wide variety of
    products all across the country.  
-   **Delay Infrastructure Projects:** A Republican shutdown could delay
    major infrastructure projects across the country due to a delay in
    EPA and DOI environmental reviews, which would affect multiple
    federal agency projects. In addition, permitting could be disrupted.
    For example, no USDA loans or grants would be made for modernizing
    utilities infrastructure in rural America, including permitting
    actions for rural electric transmission and broadband projects.  
-   **Impair Workplace Safety and Accountability:** The Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would be forced to limit
    workplace inspections, denying workers a key protection against
    safety risk, and Americans who are owed back pay for their hard work
    would face delays due to the majority of Department of Labor
    investigations being suspended.

These consequences are real and avoidable—but only if House Republicans
stop playing political games with peoples’ lives and catering to the
ideological demands of their most extreme, far-right members. It’s time
for House Republicans to abide by the bipartisan budget agreement that a
majority of them voted for, keep the government open, and address other
urgent needs for the American people.
