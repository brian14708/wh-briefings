title: "Extreme Republican Shutdown Would Risk Delays for Travelers and Force Air\
  \ Traffic Controllers and TSA Officers to Work Without Getting\_Paid"
---
 
With less than one week before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House
Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples’ lives and marching
our country toward a government shutdown that would have damaging
impacts across the country—including risking significant delays for
travelers and forcing air traffic controllers and Transportation
Security Officers to work without pay.

During an Extreme Republican Shutdown, more than 13,000 air traffic
controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Officers—in addition to
thousands of other Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel—would have to
show up to do their critical jobs without getting paid until funding
becomes available. In previous shutdowns, this led to significant delays
and longer wait times for travelers at airports across the country.
Additionally, an Extreme Republican Shutdown would halt air traffic
controller training—potentially leading to long-term disruptions to the
industry at a moment when we’ve seen critical progress filling a backlog
of controllers.

The reason these transportation priorities are now at risk: extreme
House Republicans’ relentless efforts to slash funding for vital
programs rather than work in a bipartisan manner to keep the government
open and address emergency needs for the American people. House
Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal that
two-third of them voted for just a few months ago and instead proposed a
continuing resolution (CR) that proposes [devastating
cuts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/19/by-the-numbers-impacts-of-house-republicans-extreme-cr-8-cuts/) to
programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on—including rail
safety inspections and the Transportation Security Administration. Their
extreme CR also fails to provide the urgent funding President Biden
requested to avoid disruptions to FAA air traffic operations.
