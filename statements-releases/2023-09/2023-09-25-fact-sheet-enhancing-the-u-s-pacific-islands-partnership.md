title: "FACT SHEET: Enhancing the U.S.-Pacific Islands\_Partnership"
---
 
At the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit meeting at the White House on
September 25, President Biden renewed our commitment to enhancing our
partnership with the Pacific Islands, and the respective governments, to
achieve our shared vision for a resilient Pacific region of peace,
harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity, where individuals
can reach their potential, the environment can thrive, and democracy can
flourish.  Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration released the first
ever U.S. Pacific Partnership Strategy with an ambitious slate of
initiatives to achieve this vision and meet Pacific priorities including
announcing plans to provide over $810 million in new assistance.  And in
May, Secretary Blinken highlighted our commitment to working with
Congress for over $7.2 billion in new funding and programs for the
Pacific Islands region.   
  
Today, President Biden announced a new slate of activities, including
plans to work with Congress to request and provide nearly $200 million
in funding.  These new programs and activities continue to demonstrate
the U.S. commitment to work together with the Pacific Islands to expand
and deepen our cooperation in the years ahead.   
  
**Driving Forward the U.S.-Pacific Partnership**  
The foundation of our approach to the Pacific remains strong and
productive bilateral and regional collaboration with the Pacific
Islands, and listening and responding to Pacific priorities.  Our
priorities are informed by those outlined in the 2050 Strategy for the
Blue Pacific Continent and in support of the Pacific regional
architecture led by the Pacific Islands Forum.

-   **Recognizing Cook Islands and Niue:** President Biden announced
    that the United States recognized Cook Islands and Niue as
    independent, sovereign nations and intends to establish diplomatic
    relations with each nation.  This momentous occasion celebrates our
    shared history, common values, and people-to-people ties.  We also
    affirmed our shared values of promoting democracy, combating climate
    change, and supporting a free and open region that benefits people
    in the Pacific.  The recognition of the Cook Islands and Niue and
    establishment of diplomatic relations with both nations marks a
    historic achievement that will further strengthen our friendships
    and deepen our bonds for many years to come.   
-   **Increasing Our Diplomatic and Development Footprint:**  Since the
    last Summit President Biden hosted, we have opened embassies in
    Solomon Islands and Tonga.  We intend to open an embassy in Vanuatu
    in 2024, having completed Congressional notification procedures this
    year.  We are also discussing our interest in opening an embassy
    with the Government of Kiribati.  We followed through on our
    commitment to open a USAID regional Pacific Mission in Fiji and a
    Country Representative Office in Papua New Guinea.  Today, we also
    announced that USAID plans to double its current staffing footprint
    and hire more Pacific Islanders to deliver effective and
    Pacific-informed programs.   
-   **Announcing Intent to Offer Consular Services in New Embassies: **
    We intend to offer U.S. Citizen passport and emergency services and
    visa services in the new embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga and
    the future embassy in Vanuatu.  Consular services will promote
    deeper people-to-people ties through two-way travel.   
-   **Sustaining High-Level Engagement:** To build on increased
    high-level engagement under the Biden-Harris
    Administration, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will lead the
    U.S. delegation to the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in
    November 2023.  We also announced our intention to hold the next
    U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit in 2025.  
-   **Strengthening Regional Institutions: ** The United States believes
    it is important to be guided by Pacific priorities and needs, and
    values a strong, unified, and resilient Pacific Islands Forum.  To
    that end, the United States intends to provide $500,000, subject to
    Congressional notification, to strengthen the Pacific Islands
    Forum’s institutional capacity and increase U.S.-PIF cooperation.   
-   **Advancing a Democratic, Resilient, and Prosperous Pacific Islands
    Region:**  At the inaugural U.S.-Pacific Island Summit, the United
    States signaled its plans to increase regional development
    assistance to the Pacific Islands. In line with this announcement,
    the Administration is requesting and working with Congress to
    provide an additional $64 million in development assistance across
    the Pacific Islands to advance priorities laid out in the 2050
    Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and to advance additional
    bilateral support for Papua New Guinea and the Freely Associated
    States (the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the
    Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau).   
-   **Compacts of Free Association:** The Compacts of Free Association
    with the Freely Associated States have formed a bedrock of
    U.S.-Pacific cooperation for nearly four decades.  We remain deeply
    committed to these partnerships.  In May we signed Compact-related
    economic assistance agreements with the Federated States of
    Micronesia and Palau, and we are forging ahead in our negotiations
    with the Marshall Islands.   
-   **Delivering for Veterans in the Compact Nations:** The Department
    of Veterans Affairs has chartered a new Advisory Committee on U.S.
    Outlying Areas and the Freely Associated States which will identify
    issues and recommend solutions to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs
    for the real challenges our veterans face in the Pacific.

**Tackling the Climate Crisis**  
Five years ago PIF Leaders declared that climate change is the “single
greatest threat to the livelihoods, security, and well-being of the
peoples of the Pacific.”  The United States will continue to work with
the Pacific Islands to enhance global ambition to limit global
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, accelerate the clean energy
transition, and help Pacific Islands adapt to and manage the impacts of
climate change.

-   **Sea-level rise and statehood:  **For some States, particularly
    low-lying island States in the Pacific Ocean, increasing sea levels
    pose an existential threat.  Today, the President announced that the
    United States considers that sea-level rise driven by human-induced
    climate change should not cause any country to lose its statehood or
    its membership in the United Nations, its specialized agencies, or
    other international organizations.  The United States is committed
    to working with those States and others on issues relating to
    human-induced sea-level rise and statehood to advance these
    objectives.   
-   **Supporting Maritime Limits and Boundaries: ** Maritime zones are
    critical for the economies of the Pacific Islands, which depend on
    exclusive rights to resources.  The Department of State supports the
    participation of Pacific Island countries in the Centre for
    International Law (CIL) of the National University of Singapore and
    the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security
    (ANCORS) workshop on Resolving Complex Maritime Boundaries to
    enhance their legal capabilities in order to negotiate and establish
    their own maritime limits and boundaries in the face of sea-level
    rise and threats to a free and open Pacific.   
-   **Doubling Down on Early Warning Systems (EWS) for All and Data for
    Resilience: ** The United States intends to provide $8 million,
    subject to Congressional notification and the completion of domestic
    procedures, to expand our Information Services for Resilience
    Initiative announced last September.  The National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will continue to invest in weather
    and climate observations, provide critical communications services,
    and develop decision-support tools and products so that all Pacific
    Island communities have access to effective early warnings. We plan
    to build strong expert networks throughout the Pacific for
    integrating climate data and risk into island-led sustainable
    development, including through efforts being pioneered through the
    Local2030 Islands Network, which includes Pacific Island countries
    as well as Hawai’i, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern
    Mariana Islands.  Additionally, the Department of State continues to
    advance climate-based early warning for dengue fever and plans to
    convene a major pan-Pacific meeting on climate-health in 2024.  
-   **Supporting Climate Adaptation Solutions and Mobilizing Climate
    Finance: ** USAID intends to develop, working with Congress, a new
    climate finance activity that will build on the success of its
    current Climate Ready program, which has mobilized more than half a
    billion dollars in climate finance for the region.  This new
    activity is designed to continue to help Pacific regional
    organizations and national governments access the climate finance
    needed to support climate change adaptation efforts.  USAID also
    intends to continue to support grants to provide local solutions to
    help communities address local climate issues.  The U.S. Department
    of Agriculture is funding $8.5 million for the Freely Associated
    States for urban community forestry and invasive species science and
    management activities.  
-   **Strengthening Regional Disaster Preparedness:**  USAID is
    providing $12.2 million to bolster local, national, and regional
    disaster preparedness and capacity-building interventions throughout
    the Pacific Islands that promote self-reliance, enabling partner
    countries to lessen the impacts of natural hazards and respond more
    effectively to disasters.  USAID also continues to support the
    Federated States of Micronesia’s recovery from Typhoon Wutip, which
    made landfall in 2019, and is providing $6.3 million of additional
    disaster assistance which supports ongoing efforts to reconstruct
    housing and public infrastructure.  
-   **Launching the Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP) Fisheries and
    Ocean Science Vessel Initiative:**  Through the Partners in the Blue
    Pacific, the United States intends to provide $5 million, subject to
    Congressional notification, to co-fund a fisheries and ocean science
    vessel to be managed by the Pacific Community (SPC).  The vessel
    will support sustainable management of the region’s tuna resources
    at the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission as well as
    ocean science research critical to addressing climate change impacts
    on the ocean.   
-   **Expanding the Resilient Pacific Blue Economy Program:  **The
    United States intends to provide an additional $1 million to the
    Resilient Blue Economies program we launched with the Pacific
    Community (SPC) in 2022.  This funding will enable SPC to
    collaborate with the Pacific Islands to climate-proof their
    sustainable ocean economies by developing marine spatial plans based
    on robust stakeholder engagement and rigorous scientific input.  
-   **Promoting Pacific Women’s and Girls’ Climate and Clean Energy
    Leadership:  **Around the world and in the Pacific, women and girls
    are on the frontlines of climate impacts and solutions.  This new
    $1.5 million initiative supports implementation of the Pacific
    Community’s (SPC) Pacific Energy and Gender Strategic Action Plan
    (PEGSAP), which seeks to promote women’s climate and clean energy
    leadership and economic security by increasing career and income
    generating opportunities for women and girls in 22 Pacific Island
    Countries and Territories through pilot projects to promote
    women-owned businesses in the sale, distribution, and maintenance of
    renewable energy systems, and scholarships for women and girls to
    pursue studies in relevant science, technology, engineering, and
    mathematics (STEM) fields.  
-   **Pan-Pacific Climate and Health Conference: ** The Department of
    State maintains a cooperative agreement with the Pacific Islands
    Health Officers Association to develop climate-based dengue fever
    early warning systems in Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia,
    and the Marshall Islands.  As part of this agreement, PIHOA has
    agreed to organize a Pacific-wide conference on climate-health nexus
    issues to focus on identifying key challenges, solutions, and
    avenues to support climate-health priorities, including through
    governmental, philanthropic, and multilateral finance flows.   
-   **Biosecurity Workshop and Training**: The Department of State will
    support the Freely Associated States’ and Kiribati’s participation
    in the Department of Agriculture’s annual biosecurity workshop to
    strengthen their ability to better prevent, detect and eradicate
    incipient populations of invasive species from their islands as well
    as better manage and mitigate the damage caused by existing
    populations.  
-   **Strengthen Customs Facilitation of Disaster Relief Items:**  USAID
    and U.S. Customs and Border Protection plan to conduct a technical
    workshop and subsequent virtual trainings with nine Pacific Island
    countries.  The workshop trains customs officials to clear relief
    items from both public and private partners in response to emergency
    situations.

**Investing in Trade Ties and Economic Development**  
The United States is committed to partnering with the Pacific Islands,
allies, and partners to drive economic growth and prosperity, including
through increasing trade and investment ties; providing assistance to
strengthen enabling environments, infrastructure, and macroeconomic
stability; and continued support for recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic.

-   **Expanding Access to Finance for Development:**  The U.S.
    International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and USAID intend
    to launch an up to $50 million flexible Microfinance Facility to
    expand access to finance for micro, small, and medium
    enterprises (MSMEs) in the Pacific Islands, with an emphasis on
    climate resilience and adaptation-focused enterprises, as well
    as women-owned enterprises.   
    -   As a first step, DFC and USAID intend to issue an open
        expression of interest to gauge interest from financial
        institutions and learn about opportunities to mobilize lending
        in DFC-eligible countries in the Pacific Islands.   
    -   We plan to leverage partnerships with the international
        financial institutions to support high quality, sustainable
        investments in resilient economic growth in the Pacific.  The
        Department of Treasury is working with Congress to unlock
        significant new financing from the World Bank Group and the
        Asian Development Bank to spur investments to support countries
        addressing global challenges like climate change and boost
        highly concessional funding for immediate crisis response in
        vulnerable countries like those in the Pacific.  The United
        States is committed to securing strong replenishments for the
        International Development Association and the Asian Development
        Fund in 2024, with significant focus on support for small
        states.     
-   **Deepening Economic Partnerships and Development:**  The Millennium
    Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Government of Kiribati intend to
    sign a $29.1 million threshold program grant agreement to advance
    economic growth in Kiribati in partnership with the International
    Labour Organization and American Councils for International
    Education.  Once finalized, this program would help bolster the
    capabilities of the Kiribati Ministry of Employment and Human
    Resource to promote safe, accessible, decent, and inclusive
    employment opportunities for Kiribati workers and to strengthen
    workers’ rights and resilience. In addition, through partnership
    with the Kiribati Ministry of Education, the program would empower
    youth with the skills they need to thrive in the economy of the
    future.  The Kiribati program would build on the MCC’s previous and
    ongoing partnerships in the Pacific Islands, including a $20 million
    threshold program with the Solomon Islands, which aims to increase
    tourism investment and to provide communities with revenues from
    sustainable forestry as an alternative to logging.  
-   **Building Financial Sector Resilience:**  As part of U.S. efforts
    to promote reliable, trusted financial channels and connectivity in
    the Pacific, the United States intends to provide $1 million,
    subject to Congressional notification, to strengthen the enabling
    infrastructure supporting the expansion and development of
    electronic Know Your Customer systems that will help banks in the
    Pacific Islands comply with international anti-money laundering and
    countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements.  The
    Administration also intends to provide $1.25 million, subject to
    Congressional notification, as an extension of support for the IMF’s
    Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) to strengthen
    the capacity of Pacific countries to design and implement sound
    macroeconomic and financial policies, including expanded support for
    climate-related public financial management.  
-   **Delivering on the Economic Assistance Agreement Related to the
    Tuna Treaty:  **The United States and the Pacific Islands Forum
    Fisheries Agency have signed a new 10-year, $600 million agreement
    to promote economic development in the Pacific Islands and support
    fisheries management, development and sustainability.  President
    Biden included $60 million for the first year of this agreement in
    the President’s Fiscal Year 2024 budget request to Congress. 

**Building Resilient and Secure Infrastructure**  
Today, the President announced plans to expand the U.S. Pacific Islands
Infrastructure Initiative, working with Congress, to provide more than
$28 million, and to request from Congress an additional $12 million, to
support secure, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure in the Pacific
Islands.  In coordination with our Pacific partners, including Japan and
Australia, the United States will support a range of projects and
activities intended to support inclusive, climate-resilient economic
development across the region. 

-   **Increasing Digital Connectivity and Redundancy:  **The United
    States supports connecting the Pacific Islands to commercial,
    international subsea cables through efforts such as the Partnership
    for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).  Building on
    international commercial subsea cables under development, the United
    States will provide an initial investment of $3 million, subject to
    Congressional notification, and the Administration intends to
    request from Congress up to $12 million to support spurs in the
    region to meet the demand for additional secure ICT infrastructure
    investments. This announcement includes an initial investment of up
    to $3 million, subject to Congressional approval, for a USTDA
    feasibility study for the new Central Pacific Cable, which would run
    from Guam to American Samoa to complete the triangle with Hawaii and
    could connect up to an additional 12 Pacific Island countries.  
    -   The United States also intends to provide an additional $2.5
        million to continue U.S. support for the East Micronesia Cable
        in partnership with Australia and Japan, on top of our prior $20
        million commitment.  The cable provides digital connectivity for
        Kiribati, Nauru, and the state of Kosrae in the Federated States
        of Micronesia by linking them with the existing HANTRU-1
        undersea cable that connects Guam and the Marshall Islands.  
-   **Enhancing Pacific Digital Development for the Future**:  Working
    with Congress, USAID intends to invest an additional $2 million to
    accelerate the region’s digital transformation and provide more
    reliable and affordable connectivity by supporting the effective
    deployment of undersea cables and complementary satellite
    technologies through industry partners.  USAID also intends to
    assist countries as they implement their respective national
    broadband plans, including assisting with the transition from 3G-4G
    infrastructure to 5G, adopting Open RAN in their network
    deployments, and increasing cybersecurity readiness of key critical
    infrastructure.  
-   **Improving Infrastructure Access**:  The United States plans to
    provide, working with Congress, up to $10 million in additional
    funding to initiate a range of regional infrastructure and
    development projects that the U.S. Government plans to develop with
    partners over the next several years, including tourism and ports,
    as well as USTDA-supported project preparation for clean energy,
    digital, healthcare, and transportation projects under the Pacific
    Islands Infrastructure Initiative.  
-   **Bolstering Pacific Competitive and Resilient Economies**:  Working
    with Congress, USAID intends to provide $8 million to launch a new,
    demand-driven initiative to diversify trade opportunities in the
    Pacific and increase competition to drive economic growth.  The
    initiative engages public and private partners to make the business
    environment and economic system more efficient, transparent, and
    resilient, while also providing transaction advisory services to
    make private sector infrastructure investments more competitive.
     Support also includes working with financial institutions to
    increase access to U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC) and other multilateral or bilateral financing
    facilities, direct financing products, and loan portfolio guarantees
    to increase fair, competitive, and transparent small- and
    medium-sized enterprise lending.  
-   **Renewing U.S. Support to the Pacific Region Infrastructure
    Facility (PRIF):**  The United States intends to renew our funding
    to the PRIF with an additional $1.25 million, subject to
    Congressional notification, to continue support for
    climate-resilient infrastructure development and donor
    coordination.  
-   **Transaction Support for Majuro Dock Expansion Project:**  USAID
    will provide transaction advisory services to a Marshall
    Islands-based private sector company, Pacific International Inc., to
    prepare the company to secure investment and financing to expand its
    current dock infrastructure, a key part of the tuna value chain. 
    Once completed, the dock expansion project will allow RMI to
    increase its capacity to land and offload sustainably caught tuna as
    well as enable better catch documentation and enforcement of legal
    fishing.

**Supporting Peace and Security**  
The United States has long supported peace, security, stability, and
prosperity in the Pacific Islands.  We seek to continue to engage with
the longstanding regional architecture to promote maritime security
including the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and other
likeminded partners including Australia, New Zealand, and France.

-   **Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness: ** As part of the
    Indo-Pacific Quad-supported Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime
    Domain Awareness (IPMDA) initiative, the United States intends to
    provide, working with Congress, $11.4 million to support the
    IPMDA-Pacific pilot.  IPMDA-Pacific intends to bring cutting-edge
    maritime domain awareness technology to the Pacific Islands, and to
    facilitate coordination on maritime law enforcement and information
    analysis between the FFA, the Oceania Customs Organization, the
    Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police’s Pacific Transnational Crime
    Network, and their member Pacific Islands.  This Department of State
    Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)
    funded initiative intends to work with these regional institutions
    to:  accelerate information analysis and exchange; build capacity
    for in-country information collection to support analytical efforts;
    and strengthen interoperability and mutual legal assistance networks
    between regional bodies and in-country transnational crime units.   
-   **Expanding United States Coast Guard (USCG) Presence in the
    Pacific**:  The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter *Harriet Lane*, is scheduled
    to arrive in region in late 2023 as the first ever USCG Indo-Pacific
    support vessel dedicated to collaborating with Indo-Pacific
    partners.  By the end of 2023, USCG assets will have been deployed
    for a total of 380 days of operations supporting Pacific Island
    countries’ sovereignty this year.  
-   **Enhancing Ports and Customs Security: ** Working with Congress,
    the United States intends to provide $3 million to support Pacific
    partners’ ability to strengthen port security and customs,
    counter-trafficking, and anti-money laundering efforts.  The State
    Department INL-funded Advancing Port Enhancement and Customs
    Security program intends to expand Homeland Security Investigations’
    ongoing $400,000 border security programming in Vanuatu in
    partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the
    Transportation Security Administration to work with criminal justice
    institutions, particularly customs and border officials, to enhance
    the capability of ports, deploy airport screening equipment and
    further support capacity-building for law enforcement in Fiji,
    Kiribati, and Samoa.   
-   **Training Future Military Leaders: ** Over the past five years, the
    United States has provided over $2 million in International Military
    Education and Training (IMET) funding for Fiji, Tonga, and Papua New
    Guinea.  Through the IMET program, we facilitated training for 43
    students from Fiji, 16 students from Tonga, and 25 students from
    Papua New Guinea at U.S. professional military education
    institutions. These programs help build enduring ties between our
    security forces and train future Pacific Island security force
    leaders.  
-   **Addressing War Legacies Through Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)
    Assistance:**  Throughout the Pacific, the United States continues
    to make more land safe for agriculture, infrastructure, development,
    and tourism by locating and destroying UXO.  The United States is
    providing an additional $4.2 million to address this issue.  
    -   In addition to the $1 million in funding the United States
        dedicated at the 2022 Summit to locating UXO in Solomon Islands,
        the United States intends to provide, working with Congress, an
        additional $2.5 million to accelerate efforts in Solomon Islands
        to protect civilians from these deadly hazards.   
    -   In Fiji, the United States conducted explosive ordnance disposal
        (EOD) training with 15 Republic of Fiji Military Forces
        personnel to build UXO identification and destruction
        capacity.  
    -   In Marshall Islands, the United States initiated a $1.7 million
        project to identify and destroy UXO remaining from World War
        II.  
    -   In Palau, the United States trained 12 local personnel in EOD,
        cleared 9.2 acres of land of UXO, and destroyed over 1,276 UXO
        items.  
    -   Following a request from Papua New Guinea, the United States
        deployed its UXO emergency response capability, the Quick
        Reaction Force, to address UXO needs in four provinces.  
-   **Honoring the Fallen:**  Our ties were forged in the battles of
    World War II throughout the Pacific Theater.  The Defense POW/MIA
    Accounting Agency and its partners continue to work closely with
    host nation governments all over the world to search for, recover,
    and identify the remains of Americans missing from World War II to
    return to them to their families for burial with full military
    honors.  In fiscal year 2024, there are 12 investigative and 15
    recovery missions, terrestrial and underwater, that are planned in
    seven Pacific Island Nations.  
-   **Strengthening Cybersecurity and Cyber Capacity in the Pacific:**
    Working with the Partners in the Blue Pacific, the United States
    will provide $750,000 in funding which will be used to plan,
    coordinate, and execute an annual Pacific Cyber Capacity and
    Coordination Conference (P4C) in the Pacific region for three years.
     The P4C will provide a forum for Pacific Island partner nations to
    convene, establish, and build upon regional networks; enhance
    coordination on cybersecurity capacity among Pacific Island
    countries and among donor countries; enhance regional trust and
    transparency; and demonstrate breadth, depth, and choice of
    cybersecurity initiatives from trusted PBP partner governments.

**Enhancing Our Longstanding People-to-People Ties**  
While our longstanding ties were forged during World War II, they have
only deepened through rich exchanges between our countries and vibrant
Pacific Islander diaspora communities across the United States.

-   **Launching U.S. – Pacific Islands Sister City Relationships:**  As
    we strengthen our bilateral ties with the region, the United States
    launched our “7 for 70” Campaign to promote deepened ties between
    the United States and the Pacific through the formation of new
    sister cities partnerships**.  **The United States intends to form
    at least seven sister cities partnerships with other Pacific Islands
    by 2026 in celebration of the 70th Anniversary of Sister Cities
    International.  These partnerships will enhance cultural,
    educational, youth, information and trade exchanges and
    relationships amongst cities in the United States and the Pacific
    Islands, starting with Papua New Guinea.  
-   **Increasing Academic and Work Exchange Opportunities for the
    Pacific:  **The United States provided $4 million in FY2023 to
    support people to people exchange programs between the Pacific
    Islands and the United States.  This includes academic exchanges,
    opportunities for youth and mid-level leaders through the Young
    Pacific Leaders program and the Pacific Islands Professional Fellows
    Program, as well as funding for English Language Programs and the
    American Spaces across the region.  Working with Congress, the
    United States intends to more than double the number of academic
    exchange opportunities for Pacific Island countries, to include the
    U.S. South Pacific Scholarship Program, Fulbright, and the Global
    Undergraduate Exchange Program.   
    -   The U.S.–Pacific Institute for Rising Leaders Fellowship, funds
        travel for 30 mid-career public service professionals from
        Pacific Island countries and territories to the Johns Hopkins
        School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington
        for a four-week leadership development program to improve
