title: "By the Numbers: Impacts of Extreme House Republicans\u2019 30%\_Cuts"
---
 
With one day before the end of the fiscal year, instead of following the
bipartisan lead of the Senate to keep the government open, 90% of House
Republicans just voted for a partisan bill to eviscerate programs
millions of hardworking families count on—with a devastating 30% cut to
law enforcement, Meals on Wheels, Head Start, and more. They are
breaking their word, abandoning the bipartisan deal that two-thirds of
them voted for just four months ago, and marching our country toward an
Extreme Republican Shutdown that will damage our economy, our
communities, and national security. Here’s what it would mean for the
American people if extreme House Republicans’ 30% cuts were extended for
the entire year.  
  
**<u>IMPACTS OF EXTREME REPUBLICANS’ 30% CUTS:</u>**

-   **12,500** fewer FBI personnel, including agents who investigate
    crimes and keep guns out of the hands of felons and domestic abusers
-   Nearly **1,000** fewer agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
    Firearms and Explosives (ATF). ATF agents are often some of the
    first federal law enforcement on the scene of a mass shooting to
    help local law enforcement identify at-large shooters
-   **500** fewer members of local law enforcement
-   **2,215** fewer prosecutors fighting to keep America safe
-   **250,000** children would lose access to child care
-   **290,000** children would lose access to Head Start slots
-   **1 million** seniors would be robbed of nutrition services like
    Meals on Wheels
-   **3.2 million** women, infants, and children would lose vital
    nutrition assistance through the Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
-   **13,000** fewer National Institutes of Health research project
    grants, stalling research progress cancer and Alzheimer’s
-   Up to **145,000** teachers and staff could be removed from
    classrooms and school
-   **100,000** students would lose access to Pell Grants
-   **10,000** fewer rail safety inspection days next year alone, and
    roughly **44,000** fewer miles of track inspected annually—enough
    track to cross the United States nearly 15 times
-   **850,000** households could lose access to Housing Choice Vouchers
-   **1 million** American workers would be denied job training and
    employment services, with **135,000** fewer workers gaining the
    opportunity of a Registered Apprenticeship
-   **180,000** workers would lose an average of **$1,000** in back
    wages that they are owed
-   **240** Social Security field offices could be forced to close or
    shorten the hours they are open to the public
-   **37,000** fewer Americans would receive substance use treatment
    services
