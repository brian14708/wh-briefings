title: "What They Are Reading in the States: More than 4 Million Student Loan Borrowers\
  \ Enrolled in New Biden-\u2060Harris Administration SAVE\_Plan"
---
 
Across the country, local news outlets are highlighting the number of
student loan borrowers in each state who have enrolled in the
Biden-Harris Administration’s new Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)
income-driven repayment (IDR) plan.  
   
This week, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that more than 4
million student loan borrowers nationwide – thousands in each state –
are enrolled in the SAVE plan. This includes those who were transitioned
from the previous Revised Pay As You Earn – or REPAYE – Plan.  
   
The most affordable repayment plan ever, the SAVE plan will save
millions of borrowers money on their monthly payments. Borrowers who
earn less than $15 an hour will not be required to make payments, and
anyone who does earn more will save more than $1000 on payments. The
SAVE Plan also ensures that borrowers never see their balance grow due
to unpaid interest as long as they keep up with their payments.

the SAVE
Plan**](https://www.news5cleveland.com/millions-of-college-loan-holders-have-enrolled-in-the-save-plan)  
More than 4 million borrowers have enrolled in the SAVE Plan to pay back
their student loans, according to a Tuesday release from the Department
of Education. The SAVE Plan is an income-driven repayment plan.
Borrowers who make more than about $15 an hour and enroll in the plan
are expected to save about $1,000 more a year compared to other
income-based repayment options. Borrowers who make less than the $15 an
hour threshold won’t have to make payments on their debt.

The Biden administration says 143,600 student loan borrowers from
Michigan are among 4 million who have enrolled in a new repayment plan
that’s meant to lower their monthly bills, though Republican lawmakers
plan to challenge it. President Joe Biden rolled out the new Saving on a
Valuable Education (SAVE) earlier this summer after the U.S. Supreme
Court blocked his plans for mass student loan forgiveness in June.

In Michigan, some 143,600 student loan borrowers already are set up to
reduce their monthly payments through the brand new SAVE income-driven
repayment plan, according to information released Tuesday by the U.S.
Department of Education. The figure reflects both those who signed up on
their own and those who were automatically shifted over from an earlier
income-driven repayment plan, called REPAYE.

The White House recently introduced the Saving on a Valuable Education,
or SAVE, plan, as federal student loan payments are set to resume
Oct. 1. Eligible borrowers can enroll in this income-driven repayment
plan to lower monthly bills and reduce the amount paid over the life of
the student loan. Once the plan is phased in, some people will see their
monthly bills cut in half and the remaining debt canceled after making
at least 10 years of payments.

borrowers**](https://www.wtoc.com/2023/09/06/save-program-creating-affordable-options-student-loan-borrowers/)  
A new plan by the Biden-Harris administration will allow those who have
student loans enroll in a new program that could save them thousands of
dollars. The application is on studentaid.gov and four million people
have already signed up with about 180,000 in Georgia and 81,600 in South
Carolina. Depending on how much money you borrowed for school, officials
say the SAVE program will help some people’s payment down to $0 and save
others around a $1,000 per year.

Many Americans waited to see if President Biden’s debt cancellation
policy would go into effect, but a US Supreme Court decision struck down
the plan earlier this summer…However, the Department of Education seeks
other ways to provide relief through President Biden’s SAVE plan. Since
its inception, more than 4 million student loan borrowers have actively
enrolled in the income-based repayment.

Those enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, can
save about $1,000 a year, James Kvaal, the undersecretary of education,
said Tuesday. “Student loans shouldn’t push you deeper into poverty,” he
said on a conference call with reporters. With payments on student loans
scheduled to resume in October after being suspended during the
coronavirus pandemic, the SAVE plan represents the most recent effort by
President Joe Biden to reduce the debt burden for millions of college
graduates.

More than 4 million borrowers are now enrolled in a new income-driven
student loan repayment plan that could save them over a $1,000 a year,
the Biden administration said Tuesday. The Saving on a Valuable
Education, or SAVE, plan does not require borrowers who earn less than
$15 an hour to make payments, and those who earn more will save more
than $1,000 a year on their payments compared to other income-driven
plans, officials said. Borrowers also are assured their balances won’t
grow from unpaid interest.

Nearly 40,000 Iowans have enrolled in President Joe Biden’s new
income-driven repayment plan that promises a lower monthly bill and a
shorter path to loan forgiveness, the White House announced Tuesday… In
all, more than 4 million student loan borrowers had signed up for the
program since its soft rollout July 30. The Saving on a Valuable
Education (SAVE) plan officially launched Aug. 22, ahead of expiration
of the pandemic pause on payments and interest at the end of September.
When borrowers resume making payments in October — some for the first
time ever — many could see a lower payment, or even no payment, White
House officials said.  
   
**Nevada Current:** [**35,300 Nevadans enrolled in new student loan

More than 35,000 federal student loan borrowers in Nevada are enrolled
in the Biden administration’s new repayment program, according to
figures released Tuesday by the Department of Education. Nationally,
more than 4 million borrowers are enrolled. With the pause of more than
three years on federal student loan repayments coming to an end in
October, and the Supreme Court’s summer decision to strike down the
White House’s one-time debt relief program, the Department of Education
has rolled out several repayment and loan forgiveness programs. One of
those initiatives is the Saving on A Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan
that for some borrowers could result in no monthly payments.  
   
**WVEC (ABC Norfolk, Virginia):** [**More than 100,000 Virginians with

SAVE**](https://www.13newsnow.com/article/money/virginians-with-student-loan-debt-sign-up-for-save-plan/291-7189366c-6d29-4f01-a094-0d44a7869bc2)  
More than four million student loan borrowers have signed up for a new
U.S. Department of Education repayment plan to get some debt relief. 
That includes 104,000 in Virginia alone. The Biden administration
unveiled the SAVE plan in June. SAVE, which stands for “Saving on A
Valuable Education,” is an income-driven plan that means borrowers
making less than $15 an hour won’t have to make payments on their loans.
That debt may eventually be forgiven after a certain period of time.

you?**](https://www.azfamily.com/2023/09/07/87000-arizonans-apply-save-student-loan-repayment-is-it-right-plan-you/)  
With student loan payments continuing in October, the Biden
Administration and the Department of Education have rolled out a new
income-driven repayment plan called “SAVE.” SAVE is short for “Saving on
a Valuable Education’” and the feds say the goal with this repayment
option is to significantly lower monthly student loan payments to
potentially zero dollars. Like all income-driven repayment plans, it
takes your discretionary income and calculates it with a percentage of
the federal poverty line to result in your monthly payments. While most
income-driven repayment plans use 150% of the federal poverty line, the
SAVE plan uses 225%.  
   
**The Salt Lake Tribune:** [**Utahns with student loans could see $0
monthly payments under new SAVE
Plan**](https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/09/07/utahns-with-student-loans-could/)  
More than 30,000 Utahns have enrolled in the Biden administration’s new
student loan repayment plan since it launched two weeks ago, according
to White House data released Tuesday. The new “Saving on a Valuable
Education” (SAVE) Plan aims to lower monthly student loan payments and
could affect 20 million borrowers annually. It’s income-driven, meaning
a borrower’s payback amount is based on their monthly income.
