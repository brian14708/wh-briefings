title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Southern District\
  \ of Ohio\u2019s Decision on Medicare Drug Price\_Negotiation"
---
 
For decades, Big Pharma blocked Medicare from negotiating lower drug
prices for seniors, while drug companies made record profits. President
Biden and Congressional Democrats finally changed that when they passed
the Inflation Reduction Act – while every single Republican in Congress
sided with Big Pharma to keep health care costs high for millions of
families.

Today’s ruling from the Southern District of Ohio affirms that Medicare
will move forward with negotiating lower prices for millions of
seniors. And, the Biden-Harris Administration won’t stop fighting for
what we know to be true: that nothing in the Constitution prohibits
Medicare from negotiating drug prices.

Because of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and this program,
millions of people with Medicare will continue to see prescription drug
costs go down for some of the costliest drugs that treat common
conditions like heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, and
more.

There is no reason why Americans should be forced to pay two to three
times more for their prescription drugs that any other developed nation.
President Biden and his Administration will continue fighting to lower
health care costs for American families, no matter how many challenges
Republicans and Big Pharma put in our way.
