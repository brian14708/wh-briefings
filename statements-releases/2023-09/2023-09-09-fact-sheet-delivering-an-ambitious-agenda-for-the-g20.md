title: "FACT SHEET: Delivering an Ambitious Agenda for the\_G20"
---
 
When President Biden took office, he committed to restore the United
States’ leadership role in the world, rebuild our relationships abroad,
and champion an economic agenda at home and abroad to deliver
sustainable and inclusive growth for American families—and families
everywhere. This week, at the G20 Summit in New Delhi, President Biden
continued to deliver on those commitments.  
  
Leading by example and working with partners around the world, the
United States and the G20 delivered for developing countries, for our
shared planet, and for an inclusive and responsible digital
transformation. At a moment when the global economy is suffering from
the overlapping shocks of the climate crisis, fragility, and
conflict—including the immense suffering unleashed by Russia’s war in
Ukraine—this year’s Summit proved that the G20 can still drive solutions
to our most pressing issues.  
  
The United States is committed to the G20 and to building on the
progress made in India’s G20 Presidency, starting with Brazil’s
Presidency in 2024 and South Africa’s Presidency in 2025. In a sign of
the President’s steadfast commitment to the G20 as the premier forum for
international economic cooperation, the United States will host the G20
in 2026. As President Biden called for last year at the U.S.-Africa
Leaders’ Summit, the United States is also pleased to have supported and
now welcome the African Union as a permanent member of the G20, a
reflection of both the G20’s vitality and the important role of Africa
in the global economy.  
  
**<u>Delivering for Developing Countries</u>**  
  
At the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
compounding crises have resulted in a stalling or reversal of
development gains. In New Delhi, President Biden and other G20 leaders
committed to implement the G20 2023 Action Plan to Accelerate the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The United States remains
committed to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda, both at home
and around the world.  
  
At home, President Biden is rebuilding the American economy from the
bottom up and middle out and making historic investments in our
infrastructure, our people, and our climate. These policies have enabled
the United States to have the strongest recovery of any major economy.
As the world’s largest bilateral donor of official development
assistance, the United States is working to help develop countries
support their development priorities in areas like inclusive growth,
infrastructure, education, health and health security, and resilient and
sustainable food systems.  
  
Recognizing that public funding alone is not enough, President Biden is
championing an ambitious agenda to mobilize significant additional
financing for development from all sources—public and private, domestic
and international. At the G20, he delivered key elements of that agenda.

-   **Delivering a better, bigger, more effective World Bank.** The
    United States is championing a major effort to fundamentally reshape
    the multilateral development banks to meet 21<sup>st</sup> century
    challenges. Over the last year, the World Bank, with the backing of
    the G20, has made meaningful progress in unlocking new financing
    capacity and advancing operational reforms. Under Ajay Banga’s
    leadership, the World Bank is set to play a transformative role in
    addressing global challenges. Last month, President Biden asked
    Congress for funds to unlock more than $25 billion in World Bank
    Group concessional financing. In New Delhi, he rallied G20 partners
    to agree to collectively mobilize more headroom and concessional
    finance to boost the World Bank’s capacity to support low- and
    middle-income countries. This initiative will make the Bank a better
    and bigger institution able to provide resources at the scale and
    speed needed to tackle global challenges and address the urgent
    needs of the poorest countries.
-   **Supporting countries that fall into economic crisis.** President
    Biden called on the G20 as leaders in the global economy to provide
    meaningful debt relief so that low- and middle-income countries can
    regain their footing as they seek to recover from compounding
    economic shocks in the last few years, and invest in critical
    development needs. Leaders in New Delhi committed to redouble
    efforts to resolve ongoing debt distress cases—like Ghana and Sri
    Lanka. President Biden made it clear that the United States expects
    meaningful progress by the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings in
    October. 
-   **Make financing more sustainable**. President Biden pressed leaders
    to think beyond our current frameworks to provide new solutions to
    help translate unsustainable debt into transformative investments.
    The U.S. Development Finance Corporation has provided such financing
    to facilitate more than $1 billion in debt for nature swaps in the
    Western Hemisphere and Africa—unlocking funds for countries to
    tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and to invest in other
    critical development needs. At the G20, President Biden also pressed
    all creditors—including the private sector and multilateral
    development banks—to offer climate resilient debt clauses in their
    lending. The U.S. Export Import Bank is preparing to do so in select
    bilateral lending, in line with its governance framework.
-   **Developing transformative economic corridors and scaling
    high-quality investments through the Partnership for Global
    Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).** At an event co-hosted by
    President Biden and Prime Minister Modi, President Biden and
    partners announced a landmark India-Middle East-Europe Economic
    Corridor that will usher a new era of connectivity from Europe to
    Asia, facilitating global trade, as well as cooperation on energy
    and digital connectivity. President Biden also announced a new
    partnership with the European Union to expand investments in the
    Lobito Corridor. The President called on partners to deploy public
    capital to strategically leverage the expertise and financing of the
    private sector to help secure and diversify 21st century energy
    supply chains, expand digital connectivity, increase electricity
    access, bolster food security, and strengthen health systems.

**<u>Working for a Just Peace in Ukraine</u>**  
  
President Biden is engaging with countries around the world in pressing
for a just peace in Ukraine based on sovereignty and territorial
integrity. One and a half years after Russia’s illegal and unjustified
aggression against Ukraine, G20 leaders joined President Biden in
welcoming efforts to secure “a just peace that upholds all the Purposes
and Principles of the UN Charter.” G20 leaders emphasized that countries
must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial
acquisition against any state’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
G20 leaders also united in highlighting the human suffering and severe
economic impacts of the war against Ukraine. The statement highlighted
that major economies from around the world – including Brazil, India,
South Africa – are united in the need for Russia to uphold international
law including territorial integrity and sovereignty.   
  
**<u>Delivering on Food Security</u>**  
  
Since the beginning of his Administration, President Biden has made
global food security a priority and galvanized collective action to
respond to the global food crisis. The United States has committed more
than $15.2 billion in critical humanitarian assistance and medium- to
long-term food security investments around the world. These investments
have helped countries address acute needs and avert famine, as well as
diversify their supply chains. At the G20, President Biden championed an
agenda focused on mitigating the acute food crises the world is facing
today, as well as working together with G20 countries to mitigate
against future shocks. 

-   **Addressing the food security crisis exacerbated by Russia’s
    unlawful war in Ukraine. **Russia has intensified its attack on
    global food security with its July decision to withdraw from the
    Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI)—which was responsible for nearly
    33 million tons of food exports, about two-thirds of which went
    directly to middle- and lower-income countries—and its attacks on
    Ukraine’s port infrastructure to prevent Ukrainian grain shipments
    from getting to those who need it most. The United States continues
    to lead the charge to mitigate the impact of Russia’s invasion on
    world food security and to provide food assistance to the most
    vulnerable populations in the world. In addition to the more than
    $15.2 billion that the United States has provided since 2021 to
    address famine and food insecurity, the Biden-Harris Administration
    and G7 leaders have rallied the world to contribute an additional
    over $4.5 billion for acute and medium to long term food security
    assistance, half of which came from the United States. At the G20,
    President Biden was unequivocal in calling on Russia to stop
    weaponizing food, which is causing immense human suffering around
    the world. G20 leaders united to call for the full, timely and
    effective implementation of the BSGI.   
-   **Building more resilient food systems to mitigate against future
    food shocks**. Collective G20 action is necessary to help address
    global food, climate, and supply chain shocks, prevent hunger and
    build more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient agriculture and
    food systems. In New Delhi, President Biden joined G20 leaders in
    committing to keep food supply chains and trade open, including for
    agricultural inputs like fertilizer and seeds; adopt and expand
    climate-smart agricultural practices; invest in critical
    agricultural infrastructure; promote innovative agricultural
    research and innovation; and use digital technology to help lower
    production and transportation costs and diversify access to new
    global food markets.

**<u>Delivering on Global Health Challenges</u>**  
  
The United States is the world’s largest bilateral donor for global
health and is committed to working alongside the G20 to build a safer,
more equitable future. This includes working together to invest in
health equity through vaccine distribution, expanding and improving
access to health systems, and facilitating the availability of quality
services to historically marginalized groups. It also includes
strengthening health systems and institutions; combatting infectious
diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; advancing sexual
and reproductive health and rights, and accelerating efforts towards
universal health coverage.

-   **Improving pandemic preparedness and response.** Last year,
    President Biden galvanized the world to help launch a new Pandemic
    Fund to fill critical gaps in pandemic preparedness and global
    health security, committing $450 million and unlocking an additional
    $1 billion in initial contributions from nearly two dozen countries
    and philanthropies. This year, the Pandemic Fund is a reality, and
    recently concluded its first call for proposals, approving $338
    million in grants to 37 countries across 6 regions to strengthen
    disease surveillance and early warning systems and laboratories. In
    New Delhi, President Biden made it clear that the G20 cannot lose
    its focus on improving pandemic preparedness, prevention, and
    response. To this end, he has committed an additional $250 million
    in planned funds to the Pandemic Fund.
-   **Building stronger health systems.** As we emerge from the acute
    phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries’ health systems are
    struggling to restore access to basic services, like routine
    childhood immunization and maternal health care. To help the world
    get back on track, President Biden launched the [Global Health
    Worker
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-progress-on-one-year-anniversary-of-the-global-health-worker-initiative/) in
    2022, recognizing that a health workforce that is supported,
    equipped, and protected is necessary to reclaim lost ground from the
    pandemic and prepare for future health threats. President Biden
    urged G20 leaders to commit to reverse the first global decline in
    life expectancy in more than seven decades. G20 leaders committed to
    work together to strengthen primary health care and restore
    essential health services to better than pre-pandemic levels by the
    end of 2025.  
-   **Tackling the overdose crisis**: G20 leaders came together for the
    first time to elevate counternarcotics challenges, and synthetic
    drugs in particular, as a G20 priority. Leaders recognized the
    shared public health threats posed by synthetic drugs and committed
    to enhanced information sharing and capacity building to address
    these challenges, advancing the critical actions the Biden-Harris
    Administration is taking to address the overdose crisis at home.

**<u>Delivering for Our Planet</u>**  
  
Building a clean energy economy here at home is one of President Biden’s
top priorities. But climate change is an issue that requires global
action, and the G20 is collectively responsible for about 80 percent of
global emissions. In New Delhi, President Biden secured commitments to
ensure the G20 continues to set its collective ambition high to address
the climate crisis.

-   **Tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030. **At home,
    President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to
    increase investments in clean energy technologies. Outside estimates
    report that the IRA has already created more than 170,000 jobs and
    will create 1.5 million over the next decade. And the IRA will
    expand clean energy supply, speed global adoption, and drive down
    technology costs by as much as 25 percent globally. I In New Delhi,
    President Biden and G20 leaders committed to pursue efforts to
    triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, encouraging more
    countries to follow the IRA playbook of investing in clean energy
    manufacturing and deployment, creating jobs, and fighting climate
    change.
-   **Recognizing the need to peak global emissions by 2025**. President
    Biden successfully urged the G20 to join together in acknowledging,
    for the first time, the need to peak global emissions by no later
    than 2025, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43 percent by
    2030, and 60 percent by 2035, relative to 2019 levels. The
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that these
    actions are critical to achieving global net zero greenhouse gas
    emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century and limiting
    warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
-   **Encouraging countries to incorporate economy-wide targets covering
    all greenhouse gases into their nationally determined
    contributions.** G20 nations have the ability to reduce their
    emissions in a way that meaningfully supports the full and effective
    implementation of the Paris Agreement and its temperature goals.
    With President Biden’s leadership, G20 countries for the first time
    urged all countries to include economy-wide targets covering all
    greenhouse gases in upcoming cycles for Nationally Determined
    Contributions (NDCs).
-   **Launching the Global Biofuels Alliance. **Sustainable biofuels are
    critical to facilitating net zero by 2050. Advanced biofuels can be
    sustainably produced from abundant organic material—and supplied by
    reliable trading partners like the United States. In New Delhi, the
    G20 Presidency launched the Global Biofuels Alliance with the United
    States as a founding member along with India, Brazil, Italy, Canada,
    Argentina, and South Africa. This new Alliance will bring countries
    together to expand and create new markets for sustainable biofuels.

**<u>Delivering an Inclusive and Responsible Digital
Transformation</u>**  
  
The digital transformations underway offer the potential to improve the
lives of our citizens if they are harnessed responsibly and in a way
that drives broadly shared growth. In order to realize the benefits of
these technologies, President Biden believes it is necessary to address
the barriers to inclusive access and to shape regulatory and governance
approaches to maximize their benefits while mitigating their risks. This
is the agenda that he championed in New Delhi.

-   **Harnessing AI responsibly, for good and for all. **President Biden
    championed an approach to AI that includes a commitment to
    responsible AI development, deployment, and use, to leverage AI to
    solve pressing challenges while protecting people’s rights and
    safety.
-   **Cutting the digital gender divide in half by 2030.** Globally,
    approximately 260 million more men than women were using the
    internet in 2022—a divide that undermines women’s full participation
    in the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy. President Biden successfully
    secured a commitment from G20 leaders to halve the digital gender
    gap by 2030. To help meet this commitment, the United States
    announced a Women in the Digital Economy Initiative, convening
    partners from government, the private sector, and civil society to
    accelerate efforts to close the gender digital divide.
-   **Improving access to digital services to boost sustainable and
    inclusive growth. **President Biden joined other G20 leaders in
    taking steps towards unlocking the benefits of digital public
    infrastructure (DPI), stressing the importance of prioritizing
    secure, inclusive, and accountable approaches to DPI, built and
    leveraged by both the public and private sectors, that respect human
    rights and protect personal data, privacy, and intellectual property
    rights.
