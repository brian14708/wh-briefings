Today’s Census report shows the dire consequences of congressional
Republicans’ refusal to extend the enhanced Child Tax Credit, even as
they advance costly corporate tax cuts. We cut child poverty by nearly
half to record lows for all children in this nation largely by expanding
the Child Tax Credit. Last year, Congressional Republicans insisted on
raising taxes on families with children. The rise reported today in
child poverty is no accident—it is the result of a deliberate policy
choice congressional Republicans made to block help for families with
children while advancing massive tax cuts for the wealthiest and largest
corporations. No child should grow up in poverty, and I will continue to
fight to restore the expanded Child Tax Credit to give tens of millions
of families the tax relief and breathing room they deserve.
