title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Anniversary of Mahsa Amini\u2019\
  s Death and Iran\u2019s Brutal\_Crackdown"
---
 
On the occasion of the anniversary of Mahsa “Zhina” Amini’s death
tomorrow, Jill and I join people around the world in remembering her—and
every brave Iranian citizen who has been killed, wounded or imprisoned
by the Iranian regime for peacefully demanding democracy and their basic
human dignity.  
   
As we have seen over the last year, Mahsa’s story did not end with her
brutal death. She inspired a historic movement—Woman, Life, Freedom—that
has impacted Iran and influenced people across the globe who are
tirelessly advocating for gender equality and respect for their human
rights. In the face of continued oppression and violence, the citizens
of Iran remain committed to this movement and to their fight for a free
and democratic future. Iranians alone will determine the fate of their
country, but, the United States remains committed to standing with
them—including providing tools to support Iranians’ ability to advocate
for their own future.  And, we will continue to speak out against all
forms of gender-based violence against women and girls everywhere,
including women human rights defenders who are so often targeted for
using their voices.  
   
Over the last year, the United States has responded to the calls of the
Iranian people and organized an unprecedented diplomatic campaign that
led to the Iranian government’s removal from the UN Commission on the
Status of Women, and the creation of a UN fact-finding mission to
investigate their human rights abuses. We have helped a growing number
of human rights activists find safe haven in the United States.  We made
it easier for Iranians to access the internet: at the height of the
protests, 30 million Iranians—nearly one in three—were using
U.S.-supported anti-censorship tools. We have also sanctioned over 70
Iranian individuals and entities responsible for supporting the regime’s
oppression of its people. And today, we are announcing additional
sanctions targeting some of Iran’s most egregious human rights
abusers.  
   
Today—as we remember Mahsa’s tragic death—we reaffirm our commitment to
the courageous people of Iran who are carrying on her mission. They are
inspiring the world with their resilience and resolve. And together with
our allies and partners, we stand with them.
