title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Secures Voluntary Commitments\
  \ from Eight Additional Artificial Intelligence Companies to Manage the Risks Posed\
  \ by\_AI"

*Builds on commitments from seven top AI companies secured by the
Biden-Harris Administration in July*

*Commitments are one immediate step and an important bridge to
government action; Biden-Harris Administration is developing an
Executive Order on AI to protect Americans’ rights and safety*

Since taking office, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the
entire Biden-Harris Administration have acted decisively to manage the
risks and harness the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI). As the
Administration moves urgently on regulatory action, it is working with
leading AI companies to take steps now to advance responsible AI. In
July, the Biden-Harris Administration [secured voluntary
commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/)
from seven leading AI companies to help advance the development of safe,
secure, and trustworthy AI.  
  
Today, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, White House Chief of
Staff Jeff Zients, and senior administration officials are convening
additional industry leaders at the White House to announce that the
Administration has secured a [second round of voluntary
commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Voluntary-AI-Commitments-September-2023.pdf)
from eight companies—Adobe, Cohere, IBM, Nvidia, Palantir, Salesforce,
Scale AI, and Stability—that will help drive safe, secure, and
trustworthy development of AI technology.  
  
These commitments represent an important bridge to government action,
and are just one part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive
approach to seizing the promise and managing the risks of AI. The
Administration is developing an Executive Order and will continue to
pursue bipartisan legislation to help America lead the way in
responsible AI development.  
  
These commitments, which the companies have chosen to undertake
immediately, underscore three principles that must be fundamental to the
future of AI—safety, security, and trust—and mark a critical step toward
developing responsible AI. As the pace of innovation continues to
accelerate, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to take
decisive action to keep Americans safe and protect their rights.  
  
Today, these eight leading AI companies commit to:  
  
**Ensuring Products are Safe Before Introducing Them to the Public**

-   **The companies commit to internal and external security testing of
    their AI systems before their release.** This testing, which will be
    carried out in part by independent experts, guards against some of
    the most significant sources of AI risks, such as biosecurity and
    cybersecurity, as well as its broader societal effects.  
-   **The companies commit to sharing information across the industry
    and with governments, civil society, and academia on managing AI
    risks.** This includes best practices for safety, information on
    attempts to circumvent safeguards, and technical collaboration.

**Building Systems that Put Security First**

-   **The companies commit to investing in cybersecurity and insider
    threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model
    weights.** These model weights are the most essential part of an AI
    system, and the companies agree that it is vital that the model
    weights be released only when intended and when security risks are
    considered.  
-   **The companies commit to facilitating third-party discovery and
    reporting of vulnerabilities in their AI systems.** Some issues may
    persist even after an AI system is released and a robust reporting
    mechanism enables them to be found and fixed quickly.

**Earning the Public’s Trust**

-   **The companies commit to developing robust technical mechanisms to
    ensure that users know when content is AI-generated, such as a
    watermarking system.** This action enables creativity and
    productivity with AI to flourish but reduces the dangers of fraud
    and deception.  
-   **The companies commit to publicly reporting their AI systems’
    capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and
    inappropriate use.** These reports will cover both security risks
    and societal risks, such as the effects on fairness and bias.  
-   **The companies commit to prioritizing research on the societal
    risks that AI systems can pose, including on avoiding harmful bias
    and discrimination, and protecting privacy.** The track record of AI
    shows the potential magnitude and prevalence of these dangers, and
    the companies commit to rolling out AI that mitigates them.  
-   **The companies commit to develop and deploy advanced AI systems to
    help address society’s greatest challenges.** From cancer prevention
    to mitigating climate change to so much in between, AI—if properly
    managed—can contribute enormously to the prosperity, equality, and
    security of all.

As we advance this agenda at home, the Administration continues to
engage on these commitments and on AI policy with allies and partners.
In developing these commitments, the Administration consulted with
Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE, and the UK. These
commitments complement Japan’s leadership of the G-7 Hiroshima Process,
the United Kingdom’s Summit on AI Safety, and India’s leadership as
Chair of the Global Partnership on AI.   
  
Today’s announcement is part of a broader commitment by the Biden-Harris
Administration to ensure AI is developed safely and responsibly, to
safeguard Americans’ rights and safety, and to protect Americans from
harm and discrimination.

-   In August, the Biden-⁠Harris Administration launched a major
    two-year competition—the [**“AI Cyber
    Challenge”**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/09/biden-harris-administration-launches-artificial-intelligence-cyber-challenge-to-protect-americas-critical-software/)—that

    discuss risks related to AI and reaffirm the Biden-Harris
    Administration’s commitment to protecting the American public from
    harm and discrimination.
-   In June, President Biden [**met with top experts and
    researchers**](https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1671532184979619843)

    their responsibility and emphasize the importance of driving
    responsible, trustworthy, and ethical innovation with safeguards
    that mitigate risks and potential harms to individuals and our
    society. At the companies’ request, the White House hosted a
    subsequent meeting focused on cybersecurity threats and best
    practices.
-   The Biden-Harris Administration published a landmark [**Blueprint
    for an AI Bill of
    Rights**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) to

    to advance responsible AI.
-   The Office of Management and Budget will soon release draft policy
    guidance for federal agencies to ensure the development,
    procurement, and use of AI systems is centered around safeguarding
    the American people’s rights and safety.
