Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council, Neera Tanden, Assistant to the President and
Domestic Policy Advisor, and Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor to the
President and Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator, met with
leaders and advocates on efforts to advance Black women’s economic
security, especially equal pay.

Among full-time, year-round workers, Black women typically make 69 cents
for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, undermining their
financial security and costing them nearly one million dollars over a
40-year career. This is compared to the broader gender wage gap, for
which women working full-time year-round are typically paid 84 cents, on
average, for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. Participants
discussed the many factors that contribute to gender and racial wage
gaps, including outright pay discrimination, barriers to accessing
good-paying jobs, and disproportionate caregiving responsibilities.

Senior Administration officials shared the actions that the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken to close wage gaps, including by serving as a
model employer and working to prohibit the use of salary history for
federal workers and employees of federal contractors. They highlighted
efforts to strengthen child care infrastructure, such as through the
President’s historic [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/)
to expand access to high-quality, affordable care. And they also
underscored work to ensure women have access to the millions of
good-paying jobs created by the President’s historic Investing in
America agenda, including in sectors where they have historically been
underrepresented, such as transportation, construction, and clean
energy.

White House officials and participants discussed strategies for further
closing wage gaps, as well as opportunities for partnership to continue
advancing the economic security of Black women and their families.
