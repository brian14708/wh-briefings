title: "President Joe\_Biden to Establish First-Ever White\_House Office of Gun Violence\
  \ Prevention, To Be Overseen by Vice President Kamala\_Harris"
---
 
*New office will focus on implementing executive and legislative action,
including historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act signed by President
Biden, to end the scourge of gun violence in America*  
 

Tomorrow, President Biden will announce the establishment of the
first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention to reduce gun
violence, which has ravaged communities across the country, and
implement and expand upon key executive and legislative action which has
been taken to save lives.  
   
The new Office of Gun Violence Prevention will be overseen by Vice
President Harris, who has been a been a key leader in the Biden-Harris
Administration’s effort to end our nation’s gun violence
epidemic. Stefanie Feldman, a longtime policy advisor to President Biden
on gun violence prevention, will serve as Director of the Office of Gun
Violence Prevention, alongside leading gun violence prevention advocates
Greg Jackson and Rob Wilcox, who will join the Administration as Deputy
Directors of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention.  
   
*Statement from the President:* “Every time I’ve met with families
impacted by gun violence as they mourn their loved ones, and I’ve met
with so many throughout the country, they all have the same message for
their elected officials: ‘do something.’ It’s why, last year, I signed
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to keep guns out of dangerous
hands, and have taken more executive action than any President in
history to keep communities safe. But as I’ve said before – while these
are important steps, they are just the first steps toward what is
needed.  
   
“That’s why I’m announcing additional steps forward, with the first-ever
White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice
President Harris, to build upon these measures and keep Americans safe.
The Office will include Stefanie Feldman, who has capably led my
Administration’s gun violence prevention efforts and been a trusted aide
for more than a decade, alongside leading experts Greg Jackson and Rob
Wilcox whose own lives and families have been touched by the tragedy of
gun violence. They have turned their pain into purpose and dedicated
their careers to being advocates for change – that important work will
continue as they join my team in these new roles.”  
   
“I’ll continue to urge Congress to take commonsense actions that the
majority of Americans support like enacting universal background checks
and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. But in the
absence of that sorely-needed action, the Office of Gun Violence
Prevention along with the rest of my Administration will continue to do
everything it can to combat the epidemic of gun violence that is tearing
our families, our communities, and our country apart.”  
   
*Statement from the Vice President:* “Every person and every child
deserves the opportunity to fulfill their dreams and live up to their
God-given potential. Every family, in every community, should have the
freedom to live and to thrive. We know true freedom is not possible if
people are not safe. This epidemic of gun violence requires urgent
leadership to end the fear and trauma that Americans experience every
day. The new Office of Gun Violence Prevention will play a critical role
in implementing President Biden’s and my efforts to reduce violence to
the fullest extent under the law, while also engaging and encouraging
Congressional leaders, state and local leaders, and advocates to come
together to build upon the meaningful progress that we have made to save
lives. Our promise to the American people is this: we will not stop
working to end the epidemic of gun violence in every community, because
we do not have a moment, nor a life to spare.”

The Office of Gun Violence Prevention builds on historic actions taken
by President Biden to end gun violence in our country: including signing
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant legislative
action in nearly 30 years aimed at doing so, and taking more meaningful
executive action than any other president to make our schools, churches,
grocery stores, and communities safer.  
   
**The Biden-Harris Administration has worked to implement the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act,** the most significant gun violence prevention
legislation in nearly 30 years. This legislation is already saving lives
by keeping guns out of the hands of individuals under 21 who are
prohibited from purchasing firearms, empowering the Justice Department
with new authorities to prosecute firearms traffickers, improving access
to mental health services in our schools to help young people deal with
the trauma and grief resulting from gun violence, and investing in
community violence interventions.  
   
**The Biden-Harris Administration has announced dozens of executive
actions** to: keep especially dangerous weapons and repeat shooters off
our streets; hold rogue gun dealers and gun traffickers accountable;
provide law enforcement with the tools and resources they need to reduce
gun violence; and address the root causes of gun violence.  Most
recently, the Justice Department’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives – a critical leader in work to reduce gun violence –
proposed a rule to reduce the number of guns sold without background
checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  
   
President Biden **continues to call on Congress to take additional
action**, including by:

-   Banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines;
-   Requiring safe storage of firearms;
-   Requiring background checks for all gun sales;
-   Eliminating gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability; and
-   Enacting his **Safer America Plan**, which would put more police
    officers on our streets for accountable, community policing and
    invest in gun violence prevention and intervention.
