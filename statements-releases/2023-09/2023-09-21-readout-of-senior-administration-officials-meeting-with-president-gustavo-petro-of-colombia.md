On Wednesday, September 20, 2023, Principal Deputy National Security
Advisor Jon Finer, Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and
Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Richard Verma met
with President Gustavo Petro and Foreign Minister Álvaro Leyva of
Colombia during the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New
York. They discussed issues of critical importance to the United States
and Colombia, including our vital counter-drug cooperation, the
challenges presented by mass migration from Venezuela, and the urgent
need to take action to manage the growing humanitarian, public health,
and environmental crisis in the Darien region that is being caused by
unprecedented migratory transit through the dangerous jungle terrain
between Colombia and Panama.
