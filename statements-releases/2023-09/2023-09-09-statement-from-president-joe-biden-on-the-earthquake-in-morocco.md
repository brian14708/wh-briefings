---
 
I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation caused by the
earthquake in Morocco. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those
impacted by this terrible hardship. My administration is in contact with
Moroccan officials. We are working expeditiously to ensure American
citizens in Morocco are safe, and stand ready to provide any necessary
assistance for the Moroccan people. The United States stands by Morocco
and my friend King Mohammed VI at this difficult moment. Â
