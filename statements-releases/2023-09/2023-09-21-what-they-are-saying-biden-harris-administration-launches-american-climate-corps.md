title: "WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Launches American\
  \ Climate\_Corps"
---
 
As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic climate agenda,
yesterday the Administration
[launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-american-climate-corps-to-train-young-people-in-clean-energy-conservation-and-climate-resilience-skills-create-good-paying-jobs-and-tackle-the-clima/)
the American Climate Corps, a workforce training and service initiative
that will ensure more young people have access to the skills-based
training necessary for good-paying careers in the clean energy and
climate resilience economy.

The [American Climate Corps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/climatecorps/)
will mobilize a new, diverse generation of more than 20,000 Americans –
putting them to work conserving and restoring our lands and waters,
bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy, implementing
energy efficient technologies, and advancing environmental justice, all
while creating pathways to high-quality, good-paying clean energy and
climate resilience jobs in the public and private sectors after they
complete their paid training program.

*Leaders from across the country praised the announcement. Here’s what
they’re saying:*

**<u>Environmental Leaders</u>**

**Varshini Prakash, Executive Director, Sunrise Movement:** “Three years
ago, I sat on then Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden and [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/bernie-sanders)‘ Unity Climate
Task Force and shared one of Sunrise Movement’s top priorities for the
future Administration – a Civilian Climate Corps, a visionary jobs
program to put thousands of young people to work in real career pathways
fighting for their future. Now, after years of demonstrating and
fighting for a Climate Corps, we turned a generational rallying cry into
a real jobs program that will put a new generation to work stopping the
climate crisis. With the ACC and the historic climate investments won by
our broader movement, the path towards a [Green New
Deal](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/green-new-deal) is beginning to
become visible. Today’s historic action to put an American Climate Corps
into motion is a clear demonstration that the Biden Administration knows
there are more ways they can leverage executive power to lead an all out
mobilization of our government and society to stop the climate crisis.
Young people everywhere should feel empowered by this victory and
continue demanding the change we need. This past summer we saw record
climate disasters, record labor strikes demanding good, meaningful work,
and major climate protests led by young people. The American Climate
Corps is a response that begins to meet the moment and show young people
how their government can work for them. We’re often asked how President
Biden can win the support and enthusiasm of young people. He’s gotten
our attention. Keep going.”

9/20/2023\]

**Andrew Reagan, Executive Director, Clean Energy for America:** “A
21st-century Climate Corps has the potential to meaningfully grow the
American clean energy workforce, allowing us to meet the moment and lead
the global competition to build the carbon free future. Clearly,
President Biden is committed to empowering America’s clean energy
workers, in stark contrast to congressional Republicans who continue to
seek new ways to defund good-paying jobs.”
\[[Statement](https://climatepower.us/resources/president-biden-doubles-down-on-historic-climate-record-with-american-climate-corps/),
9/20/23\]

**Matt Compton, Chief of Staff, Climate Power:** “President Biden is a
champion of the American worker and the American economy. His climate
plan has already created hundreds of thousands of jobs and fueled a
clean energy manufacturing boom across the country. It’s ushering in
good-paying jobs that don’t require a four-year degree and that build
invaluable skill sets that workers can leverage over the long term. The
American Climate Corps is an investment in our environment, our economy,
and our future.”
\[[Statement](https://climatepower.us/resources/president-biden-doubles-down-on-historic-climate-record-with-american-climate-corps/),

**Manish Bapna, President and CEO, Natural Resources Defense Council:
“**In every great challenge this country has faced, it has turned to the
essential strength of its people, united around a common goal. This
combines national service with workforce training to rally a new
generation around the need to confront the existential challenge of our
time. This will build a versatile corps of workers with the skills to
help conserve and restore waters and lands, make our communities more
resilient, speed the shift to clean energy and advance environmental
justice. That’s a sound investment in the next generation. It’s a
visionary bet on the country’s future.”
\[[Statement](https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/conservation-corps-represents-new-generation-national-service),
9/20/2023\]

**Collin O’Mara, President and CEO, National Wildlife Federation**: “The
American Climate Corps is an innovative way to put young people to work
restoring natural resources, bolstering resilience, and revitalizing
communities. It’s the ultimate win-win-win. President Biden’s executive
action is the first step toward creating a truly modern conservation
corps that can address the challenges we face and inspire the next
generation of conservation leaders.”

**Trevor Dolan, Industry and Workforce Policy Lead, Evergreen Action**:
“Young people growing up amid the climate crisis have an acute
understanding of what we’re up against—and now they have an opportunity
to fight it head-on. The same voters that delivered the election for
President Biden in 2020 overwhelmingly favored the creation of a climate
corps, and today the president answered their call. With the
announcement of the American Climate Corps, President Biden’s
administration has taken a big step toward delivering good jobs for
young people in the booming clean energy economy. Young people growing

**Ben Jealous, Executive Director, Sierra Club**: “We need an all hands
on deck approach to address the climate crisis, and the Biden-Harris
Administration establishing an American Climate Corps – with specific
opportunities for youth to work in climate resilience careers – is a
historic effort to meet this moment. The Climate Corps will mobilize
young people, workers, and federal resources in a way never seen before.
The Sierra Club celebrates the Biden-Harris Administration for scaling
up clean energy, increasing well-paid union jobs, and fostering
environmental stewardship — exactly the path we must take to protect
people and the planet.”
\[[Statement](https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2023/09/sierra-club-statement-launch-american-climate-corps),
9/20/2023\]

**Margie Alt, Director, Climate Action Campaign: “**Establishing the
American Climate Corps is an important step that will help create
national purpose and better position the U.S. to meet the 50-52%
reduction in climate pollution that President Biden committed to and
scientists say is essential.  After delivering historic climate and
clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), it makes great sense that
we would recruit the workers we need to build our 100% clean economy.
The president’s climate and clean energy plan is investing in today’s
electricians, plumbers, carpenters and builders. The Climate Corps will
make sure we have the best-trained and highly-skilled workforce we need
for years to come. With this action, President Biden is delivering on
his promise to tackle the climate crisis and create opportunity for all.
And he’s putting a down payment on the work left to be done to finish
the job on climate before it is too late.”
\[[Statement](https://www.actonclimate.com/post/cacs-margie-alt-statement-on-president-bidens-american-climate-corps/),
9/20/2023\]

**Partnership for the Civilian Climate Corps:** “The Partnership for the
Civilian Climate Corps applauds President Biden’s leadership today with
the announcement of the American Climate Corps. The White House’s call
for coordination across federal agencies implementing the historic IRA
and IIJA with AmeriCorps and Department of Labor can unlock our
country’s potential to build a climate-ready workforce by utilizing the
power of national service to engage the next generation to tackle
climate resilience and mitigation challenges in local communities. By
formalizing this new initiative through interagency collaboration with
AmeriCorps and developing youth workforce development pipelines into
climate, environmental resilience, and clean energy careers, we can
create a much-needed talent pipeline that bolsters these growing
industries and puts youth on pre-apprenticeship pathways to
family-sustaining jobs.”
\[[Statement](https://www.serviceyearalliance.org/pccc_statement_american_climate_corps),
9/20/2023\]

**Jeff Ordower, North American Director, 350.org:** “This is a major win
for the climate movement. We thank all of the young people and youth-led
organizations who have been calling for this and we look forward to
seeing tens of thousands more young people trained and employed to fight
the climate crisis in the coming year. This is Biden using his Executive
Power for climate action, which is important to see. We hope that that
is the beginning of real, sustained, substantive climate leadership,
because the biggest demand that the people—including the youth—have been
calling for en masse all week, and for decades, is to end fossil fuels.
We can’t stave off climate catastrophe without that part. So the next
step is for Biden to use those same executive powers to Declare a
Climate Emergency, and to commit to phasing out fossil fuels on the
timeline the crisis demands. We celebrate today’s win, but we also can’t
ignore that as the Climate Ambition Summit proceeds today, Biden won’t
be at the table. He needs to do better, and this is only a start.”
\[[Statement](https://350.org/press-release/350-org-responds-to-american-climate-corps/),

**Kim LaFleur, NACD President**: “Opportunities to get ‘boots on ground’
with conservation districts provides the next generation meaningful
development opportunities and leadership roles within local communities.
These emerging leaders can benefit greatly from the decades of expertise
that exist within conservation districts, empowering them to take on the
climate challenge and deploy innovative solutions through the locally
led conservation delivery system.”

Corps, over 20,000 young people nationwide will be provided with
high-demand training that enables access to good-paying jobs in the
growing clean energy economy. It seems that almost daily, the
Biden-Harris Administration unveils a new initiative that young
organizers have been calling for. That’s no accident — it’s because we
have leaders in The White House who care about our futures. The Climate
Corps was a proposal designed by the Sunrise Movement that Voters of
Tomorrow integrated into our Gen Z Agenda. Last year, we took the Agenda
