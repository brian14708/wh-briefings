  Education"

Today, White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden and U.S.
Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona hosted a livestreamed
event with higher education leaders from across the nation to unveil a
new Department of
Education [report](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-outlines-strategies-increase-diversity-and-opportunity-higher-education),
“Strategies for Increasing Diversity and Opportunity in Higher
Education.” The report calls on states and higher education leaders to
prioritize efforts in the areas of outreach, admissions, financial aid,
and college completion that advance diversity on college campuses. And
it answers President Biden’s charge to the Department to elevate
promising practices to build inclusive, diverse student bodies in the
wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in* Students for Fair Admissions,
Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair
Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina*, which upended decades
of precedent on affirmative action that had enabled America’s colleges
and universities to build vibrant diverse environments.  
  
During the event, Director Tanden and Secretary Cardona reiterated
President Biden and Vice President Harris’ unyielding commitment to
expanding access to educational opportunity for all. They underscored
how this moment demands leadership, innovation, and collaboration from
leaders at every level to break down barriers for underserved students
and reimagine pathways into higher education. And they expressed their
gratitude to participants who represented a range of higher education
institutions – including Ivy Leagues, HBCUs, MSIs, and community
colleges – for their leadership in adopting key practices promoting
diversity in higher education consistent with the law.  
  
Participants in today’s event included:

-   Gene Block, Chancellor, University of California, Los Angeles
-   Christopher Eisgruber, President, Princeton University
-   Anne Kress, President, Northern Virginia Community College
-   Patricia McGuire, President, Trinity Washington University
-   Javier Reyes, Chancellor, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
-   David Wilson, President, Morgan State University
