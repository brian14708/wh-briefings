---
 
Our Administrations affirm our mutual commitment to workers’ rights and
promotion of decent work.   
   
Working people built our countries – from our most basic infrastructure
and critical services, to educating our youth and caring for our elders,
to our most advanced technologies. Workers and their trade unions have
fought for protections in the workplace, fairness in the economy, and
democracy in our societies—they are at the heart of the dynamic
economies and the healthy, sustainable world we seek to build for our
children.  In the face of complex global challenges, from climate change
to rising poverty levels and economic inequality, we must put workers at
the center of our policy solutions.  We must stand with workers and
empower them to drive the innovation we urgently need to secure our
futures.  
   
Today, the United States and Brazil announce the launch of our joint
global initiative to elevate the central and critical role that working
people play in a sustainable, democratic, equitable, and peaceful
world.  We already share an understanding and commitment to tackling
critical issues of economic inequality, safeguarding workers’ rights,
addressing discrimination in all its forms, and ensuring a just and
clean energy transition.  Promoting decent work is foundational to the
achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the
Sustainable Development Goals. We are also concerned with and attentive
to the effects of the digitalization of our economies and the
professional use of artificial intelligence on the world of work.  
   
With this new initiative, we intend to expand our ambition and
strengthen our partnership to address five of the most urgent challenges
facing working people around the globe: (1)  protecting workers’ rights
as defined in the International Labour Organization’s core conventions,
empowering workers, and ending worker exploitation, including forced
labor and child labor; (2) promoting safe, healthy, and decent work, and
accountability in public and private investment; (3) advancing
worker-centered approaches to the clean energy transition; (4)
harnessing technology and digital transitions for the benefit of all;
and (5) tackling workplace discrimination, particularly for women,
LGBTQI+ persons, and marginalized racial and ethnic groups, embracing
and promoting diversity in and access to the world of work.  We intend
to work collaboratively across our governments and with our union
partners to advance these urgent issues over the next year, envisioning
a common agenda to discuss with other countries in the G20 and in the
COP 28, COP 30, and beyond.  
   
We welcome the support and participation of labor leaders from our
countries and global organizations, as well as the leadership of the
International Labour Organization, and we hope other partners and allies
join this effort.  Together, we can create a sustainable economy based
on shared prosperity and respect for workers’ dignity and rights.
