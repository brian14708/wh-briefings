The President and First Lady will continue the annual tradition of
opening the White House gardens and South Grounds to members of the
public for Fall Garden Tours. This season’s tour weekend is scheduled
for 10:00 a.m. ET to 4:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, October 14 and Sunday,
October 15.  In the event that the federal government is shut down on
these dates, the Fall Garden Tours will be postponed or canceled.   
  
These tours are free and open to members of the public; however, a timed
ticket is required for all attendees, regardless of age. The National
Park Service (NPS) will distribute free, timed tickets outside the White
House Visitor Center, located at 1450 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, each day
beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET. Timed tickets will be distributed, one ticket
per person, on a first-come, first-served basis.  
  
Once attendees have received their tickets, the South Lawn entry point
for everyone will be located on 15<sup>th</sup> St NW between E Street
NW and Constitution Avenue NW near the Boy Scout Memorial. The ADA
entrance will be located at 15th Street NW and Alexander Hamilton Place
NW.
