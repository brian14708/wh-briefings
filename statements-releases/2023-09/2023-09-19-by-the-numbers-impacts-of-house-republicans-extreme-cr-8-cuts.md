title: "By the Numbers: Impacts of House Republicans\u2019 Extreme CR 8%\_Cuts"
---
 
With less than two weeks before the end of the fiscal year, extreme
House Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples’ lives and
marching our country toward a government shutdown instead of working in
a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency
needs for the American people.

The continuing resolution they introduced this week makes indiscriminate
cuts to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count
on—violating the agreement the Speaker negotiated with President Biden
and rejecting the bipartisan approach of the Senate. House Republicans
have made clear that these cuts are designed to force longer-term cuts,
in-line with their [extreme and damaging appropriations
bills](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Shalanda-Young-Interested-Parties-Memo-9.12.23-1.pdf).
So what would it mean for the American people if House Republicans’
proposed 8% cuts were extended for the entire year?

    more than **700** pounds of heroin, and more than **6,000** pounds

    low-income students and **7.5 million** students with disabilities  
-   Nearly **70** fewer Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)
    agents, who are often some of the first federal law enforcement on

    workforce
