title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Decision\
  \ on Access to Emergency Health Care for\_Women"
---
 
Pregnant women must have access to the emergency medical care they are
entitled to under federal law. However, last night, the Ninth Circuit
blocked a federal judge’s order that protected women in need of
emergency medical care from Idaho’s extreme and dangerous abortion ban.
The Ninth Circuit’s decision puts women’s health at risk, threatening
doctors with prosecution for providing emergency care.

The Biden-Harris Administration is deeply concerned by this decision. In
Idaho and in states across the country, far too many women are suffering
the devastating consequences of delayed care, which is threatening their
health and lives. 

The President and I will never stop fighting for reproductive rights.
Congress must pass a bill that restores the protections of *Roe v.
Wade *into federal law.
