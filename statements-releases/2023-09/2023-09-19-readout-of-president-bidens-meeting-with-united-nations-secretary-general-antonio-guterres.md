President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with United Nations
Secretary-General António Guterres during the UN General Assembly in New
York. The leaders reaffirmed the strong partnership between the United
States and the United Nations. They discussed pressing global
challenges, including the need to tackle rising poverty and inequality
and mobilize additional resources for sustainable development, combat
climate change, and uphold the UN’s foundational principles –
particularly in the face of Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine. The
leaders also discussed efforts to reform and strengthen multilateral
institutions to make them more inclusive and effective and better
equipped to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals and address
global challenges like climate change and fragility.
