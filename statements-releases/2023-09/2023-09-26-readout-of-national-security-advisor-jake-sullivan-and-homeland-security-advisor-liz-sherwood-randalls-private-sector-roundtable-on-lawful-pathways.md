title: "Readout of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Homeland Security Advisor\
  \ Liz Sherwood-Randall\u2019s Private Sector Roundtable on Lawful\_Pathways"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Homeland Security Advisor
Liz Sherwood-Randall today hosted over 70 representatives from foreign
governments, private companies, civil society, and international and
community organizations at the White House to discuss how we can work
together to further expand lawful pathways and offer an alternative to
the smugglers who prey on vulnerable migrants.

National Security Advisor Sullivan and Homeland Security Advisor
Sherwood-Randall provided an overview of the progress already made under
the new Safe Mobility Office Initiative, which the United States
launched with Canada, Spain, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia earlier
this year. The SMO Initiative includes both physical locations and a
digital portal to process and refer migrants to available legal pathways
to the United States and other participating countries. They also
discussed ways the administration can continue to partner with the
private sector and other organizations to build out the initiative to
its full potential.

Today’s event is just one of the many ways the Biden-Harris
administration is engaging with regional partners, international
organizations, and the private sector under the Los Angeles Declaration
on Migration and Protection to respond the historic migration challenge
in the Western Hemisphere.
