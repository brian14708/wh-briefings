title: "During an Extreme Republican Shutdown, American Small Businesses Would Lose\
  \ Out on More Than $100 Million in Critical Financing Every\_Day"
---
 
With just one day before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House
Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples’ lives and
livelihoods and marching our country toward a government shutdown that
would have devastating consequences for small businesses and needlessly
undermine America’s economic progress. Their partisan approach stands in
stark contrast to the Senate’s bipartisan action toward keeping the
government open and abiding by the bipartisan budget deal two-thirds of
House Republicans voted for just four months ago.  
   
An Extreme Republican Shutdown would force the Small Business
Administration (SBA) to stop processing new business loans for small
businesses. Each weekday the government is shut down, hundreds of small
businesses would see their 7(a) and 504 loan applications fail to move
forward. That means extreme House Republicans would deny more than $100
million in critical financing to American small businesses every day.
These delays can have devastating consequences for small business owners
and the communities they support, including losing the ability to
purchase critical real estate or equipment, losing out on business deals
and opportunities, and being forced into high-interest, price-gouging
loans. A shutdown would also make it harder for small businesses to
access federal contracting opportunities by halting the processing of
applications for nearly all government contracting programs—only months
after the
SBA [announced](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/07/18/biden-harris-administration-sets-record-breaking-163-billion-federal-procurement-opportunities-small) that
the Biden-Harris Administration had awarded a record $163 billion in
contracts to small businesses in Fiscal Year 2022. And an Extreme
Republican Shutdown would close SBA’s district offices, preventing more
than 2,000 Americans every day from receiving assistance.  
   
During the first two years of the Biden-Harris Administration, Americans
filed more than [10.5
million](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/jan/18/sba-administrator-guzman-new-census-data-shows-record-pace-small-business-applications-has-continued) applications
to start new small businesses, the two strongest years on record—part of
the President’s Bidenomics agenda to grow the economy from the middle
out and the bottom up.  
   
The reason this critical support for small businesses is now at risk:
extreme House Republicans’ relentless efforts to slash funding for vital
programs—including those that help small businesses—rather than work in
a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency
needs for the American people. House Republicans have turned their backs
on the bipartisan budget deal that two-thirds of them voted for just a
few months ago and instead proposed a continuing resolution (CR)
that would make [devastating
cuts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/19/by-the-numbers-impacts-of-house-republicans-extreme-cr-8-cuts/) to
programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on—including to
the Small Business Administration.  
   
**Below is a state-by-state estimate of the more than $100 million in
financing that small businesses would lose out on every day during an
Extreme Republican Shutdown:**
