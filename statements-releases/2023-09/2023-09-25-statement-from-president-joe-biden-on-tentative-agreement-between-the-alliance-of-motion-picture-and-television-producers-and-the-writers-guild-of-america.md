title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Tentative Agreement Between the Alliance\
  \ of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of\_America"
---
 
I applaud the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers for reaching a tentative agreement that
will allow writers to return to the important work of telling the
stories of our nation, our world – and of all of us. This
agreement, including assurances related to artificial intelligence, did
not come easily. But its formation is a testament to the power of
collective bargaining. There simply is no substitute for employers and
employees coming together to negotiate in good faith toward an agreement
that makes a business stronger and secures the pay, benefits, and
dignity that workers deserve. I urge all employers to remember that all
workers – including writers, actors, and autoworkers – deserve a fair
share of the value their labor helped create.
