*As part of Dr. Biden’s Joining Forces initiative, The Military
Children’s Corner celebrates our nation’s military children and educates
Americans about their service and sacrifice.   
*

WASHINGTON, D.C. – First Lady Jill Biden announced today ***The Military
Children’s Corner,* a new art display at the White House dedicated to
our nation’s military children**. As part of her [*Joining
Forces*](http://whitehouse.gov/joiningforces) initiative to support
military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors, Dr. Biden is
leveraging art as an educational tool to help Americans learn about the
experiences of the four million military-connected children whose
parents are active-duty service members, National Guard or reservists,
or veterans.

“At home and abroad, I’ve met so many incredible military children. They
may not wear a uniform, but they serve our country, too. During my
travels, military children have frequently shared their artwork with me,
offering a window into their lives,” said **First Lady Jill Biden**.
“Inspired by their stories of kindness, ingenuity, and strength, I
wanted to bring their art and talents to the White House. As visitors
enjoy *The Military Children’s Corner*, I hope they also take a moment
to reflect on the service and sacrifice of our military families.”   
   
The inaugural display features artwork from the following military
children currently at military installations Dr. Biden has engaged or
visited during her time as First Lady:

-   **Autumn**, age 8, U.S. Army, Fort Moore – Columbus, GA
-   **Paris**, age 10, U.S. Army, Fort Moore – Columbus, GA

In addition, the inaugural display features artwork from *Sesame
Street’s* Rosita, a 5-year-old Muppet whose dad, Ricardo, is a
veteran and uses a wheelchair after being injured during his military
service. The First Lady and Rosita have participated in a series of
engagements over the years with [Sesame
Workshop](https://sesameworkshop.org/our-work/impact-areas/military-families/)
to spotlight the experiences of children of military and veteran
families.  
   
*The Military Children’s Corner* is located in the East Colonnade and is
among the first displays visitors will see when they enter the East Wing
of the White House. The display case was designed to replicate the look
and feel of bulletin boards commonly found in elementary schools, making
this White House display welcoming to visitors of all ages. The display
will be updated on a quarterly basis and feature a variety of art from
military-connected children of U.S. service members around the world.  
  
As a military mom and educator for more than 30 years, Dr. Biden has
previously debuted temporary art installations at the White House to
help Americans learn more about the unique experiences of our
military-connected families. In April 2022, to celebrate the Month of
the Military Child, Dr. Biden partnered with Military Child Education
Coalition to create a display in the East Wing featuring artwork created
by military-connected children across the country and those stationed
around the world. In April 2023, Dr. Biden debuted an installation
inspired by a poem called “My Military Suitcase,” which featured
miniature wooden suitcases designed by military and veteran children to
reflect their journeys as military-connected families. Building on Dr.
Biden’s previous art installations, *The Military Children’s
Corner* provides a dedicated display at the White House to celebrate our
nation’s military children all year
round.*[ ](https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/)*

***Background on the First Lady’s Joining Forces initiative ***  
[*Joining Forces*](http://whitehouse.gov/joiningforces) is Dr. Biden’s
initiative to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and
survivors. Guided by the life experiences and the perspectives voiced
during in-person and virtual listening sessions with military-connected
families and stakeholders, the work and priorities of *Joining
Forces* centers on the needs of this community in the areas of: Economic
Opportunity; Military Child Education; and Health and Well-Being.  
   
As First Lady, Dr. Biden has visited over 25 military installations;
worked with *Joining Forces *partners to support over 30 events with the
military-connected community; and helped coordinate the Administration’s
efforts to increase and raise awareness of resources and support for
military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.
