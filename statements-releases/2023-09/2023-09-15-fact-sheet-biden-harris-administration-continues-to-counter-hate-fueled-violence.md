title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Continues to Counter Hate-Fueled\_\
  Violence"
---
 
One year ago today, President Biden and Vice President Harris hosted
the [United We Stand Summit](https://unitedwestand.gov/) to counter the
corrosive effects of hate-fueled violence on our democracy and public
safety, highlight the response of the Biden-Harris Administration and
communities nationwide to these dangers, and put forward a shared,
bipartisan vision for a more united America.

Hate must have no safe harbor in America. Even as our nation has endured
a disturbing series of hate-fueled attacks—from Jacksonville to Oak
Creek to Orlando, Charleston, Pittsburgh, El Paso, Atlanta, Buffalo, and
beyond —Americans of all beliefs and political affiliations remain
overwhelmingly united in their opposition to such violence. When
Americans cannot freely participate in the basic activities of everyday
life—like going to school, shopping at the grocery store, or attending
their house of worship—without fear of being targeted and killed for who
they are, the very fabric of our society is at risk.

Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken numerous
steps to counter hate-fueled violence—from signing the bipartisan
COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, to releasing the first-ever National Strategy
for Countering Domestic Terrorism, to signing the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, the most significant legislation in three decades to
reduce gun violence. Today, on the first anniversary of the White House
United We Stand Summit, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing an
update on our efforts to prevent, respond to, and recover from
hate-fueled violence, including by:

-   **Combating hate by investigating and prosecuting hate
    crimes. **Since January 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has
    charged more than 90 defendants in over 80 cases and secured more
    than 70 convictions of defendants. The Federal Bureau of
    Investigations has elevated civil rights violations and hate crimes
    enforcement for prioritization among its 56 field offices. DOJ
    directed the Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights
    Division to expedite review of hate crimes.
-   **Supporting communities to report hate crimes and build
    cross-community partnerships to prevent and combat hate-fueled
    violence**. By the end of the month, DOJ will have launched the
    United Against Hate program in all 94 of its U.S. Attorney’s Offices
    to strengthen trust between law enforcement and communities and to
    teach community members how to identify and report hate crimes and
    hate incidents. DOJ has already held more than 200 events
    nationwide. DOJ has awarded over $32 million in grant funding to law
    enforcement and prosecution agencies, community-based organizations,
    and civil rights groups to support outreach, investigations,
    prosecutions, community awareness and preparedness, reporting,
    hotlines, victim services, as well as supporting research and
    program evaluation studies. More information about DOJ’s response to
    hate crimes in
    available [here](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/spotlight/combating-hate-crimes).
-   **Countering domestic terrorism.** The Biden-Harris Administration
    continues to implement steadfastly the first-ever [U.S. National
    Strategy for Countering Domestic
    Terrorism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf).
    Since the strategy was released in June 2021, we have sharpened our
    understanding of the domestic terrorism threat through enhanced
    intelligence analysis, strengthened local and especially
    community-based efforts to prevent acts of domestic terrorism, and
    expanded our capabilities to disrupt and prosecute such acts—all
    while safeguarding privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
    Examples of actions we have taken include launching a new website
    with resources for financial institutions to improve anti-money
    laundering programs, joining the multistakeholder Christchurch Call
    to Action to address the role of the Internet in recruiting and
    radicalizing individuals to terrorism, doubling the number of
    Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) domestic terrorism and
    domestic violent extremism cases in two years, and forming a new
    domestic terrorism unit in the National Security Division of the
    Department of Justice (DOJ).  More information on these and many
    other actions the Administration has taken to implement the Strategy
    is
    available [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/27/fact-sheet-national-strategy-for-countering-domestic-terrorism-strategic-implementation-update/). 
-   **Helping schools prevent, address, and ameliorate the effects of
    bullying, violence, and hate. **In May 2023, the Department of
    Education (ED) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    launched the [Free to
    Learn](https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/free-learn) campaign to
    help educational institutions improve their ability to prevent
    hate-based threats and bullying, recover from hate-based violence,
    and enhance overall school safety. To support this effort, ED issued
    guidance about the ways in which Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
    funding may be used for these purposes, shared a collection of
    resources through the [Best Practices
    Clearinghouse](https://bestpracticesclearinghouse.ed.gov/free-to-learn.aspx),
    and held several Free to Learn webinars and two large conferences to
    highlight evidence-based and innovative practices. Additionally,
    DOJ, ED, DHS, and HHS released a summary of federal resources for
    parents, caregivers, and community members
    on [schoolsafety.gov](https://www.schoolsafety.gov/), a
    collaborative, interagency website that provides K-12 schools and
    districts with resources, guidance, and best practices for creating
    a safe and supportive learning environment.
-   **Protecting colleges and universities.** ED is preparing to issue a
    call to action for institutions of higher education to strengthen
    their efforts to prevent and respond to hate-based violence on their
    campuses and in their surrounding communities. ED is also providing
    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with resources
    on effective practices in prevention and response to hate-fueled
    violence and continues to support HBCUs and other [Project
    SERV](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/project-serv-school-emergency-response-to-violence/) applicants
    with technical assistance to help support recovery from a violent or
    traumatic event; to date all 13 HBCUs that were targeted with bomb
    threats and submitted grant applications for Project SERV have
    received over $2.4 million in awards.
-   **Enhancing the capacity of local institutions to prevent targeted
    violence. **On September 6, 2023, DHS announced the award of 34
    Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) grants, totaling
    $20 million, for state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments,
    nonprofits, and colleges and universities to establish or enhance
    capabilities to prevent targeted violence and terrorism. A Summary
    of FY23 awardees can be
    found [here](https://www.dhs.gov/fiscal-year-2023-targeted-violence-and-terrorism-prevention-grantee-abstracts).
-   **Increasing financial, technical, and educational resources to keep
    communities safe.** In March 2023, the Administration launched
    the [Prevention Resource Finder](https://www.dhs.gov/prevention),
    the first-ever website with a comprehensive list of Federal
    resources available to help state and local governments, community
    organizations, houses of worship, schools, and others prevent acts
    of targeted violence and terrorism. The website offers nearly 100
    resources from 17 Federal partners all in one place. In its first
    month, the website received more than 24,000 page views and more
    than 10,000 return users.
-   **Leveraging the power of national service to promote civic renewal
    and foster national unity.** AmeriCorps launched its United We
    Serve campaign to encourage and amplify opportunities for Americans
    to come together and engage in service and volunteerism. To support
    this effort, AmeriCorps onboarded a Bridging Fellow to help
    coordinate AmeriCorps programs, state service commissions, and
    leaders in the bridging community. AmeriCorps, in partnership with
    Service Year Alliance, has begun a multi-year pilot project to
    elevate existing and identify innovate bridging initiatives, and to
    create, test, measure, and spread effective practices that best
    equip AmeriCorps members with the skills to bridge divides across
    our society,
-   **Committing cultural resources to help communities prevent and heal
    in the face of hate-based violence.** The National Endowment for the
    Humanities (NEH) and National Endowments for the Arts (NEA) launched
    a new “United We Stand: Connecting Through Culture” initiative that
    leverages the arts and humanities to address hate-motivated
    violence. Next week, NEH is announcing $2.8 million in
    funding for every state, the District of Columbia, and all U.S.
    jurisdictions for programming promoting civic engagement, social
    cohesion, and cross-cultural understanding. In 2024, NEH and NEA
    will host nationwide convenings and develop resources that center
    the arts and humanities around these themes.
-   **Protecting LGBTQI+ communities from attacks on their safety. **In
    June 2023, in celebration of Pride Month, the Biden-Harris
    Administration announced new actions to protect LGBTQI+ communities
    from attacks on their rights and safety, including the Department of
    Homeland Security (DHS), with support from the Department of Justice
    (DOJ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
    launching the LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership. The Partnership
    will provide critical safety resources to LGBTQI+ community
    organizations to ensure they remain safe spaces for the community.
-   **Addressing the rise of antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related
    forms bias and discrimination**.  In December 2022, President Biden
    established an interagency group led by Domestic Policy Council
    staff and National Security Council staff to increase and better
    coordinate U.S. Government efforts to counter antisemitism,
    Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination within
    the United States. The President tasked the interagency group, as
    its first order of business, to develop a national strategy to
    counter antisemitism.  In May 2023, the White House released the
    first-ever [U.S. National Strategy to Counter
    Antisemitism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/U.S.-National-Strategy-to-Counter-Antisemitism.pdf),
    which includes over 100 actions that more than two dozen government
    agencies will take by May 2024 to counter antisemitism, as well as
    over 100 calls to action for Congress, state and local governments,
    companies, technology platforms, students, teachers and academics,
    civil society and faith leaders, and others to counter antisemitism.
-   **Addressing Anti-Asian Hate. **In January 2023, the Biden-Harris
    Administration  released the first-ever [National Strategy to
    Advance Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for Asian American, Native
    Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI)
    Communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AA-and-NHPI-Strategy-2023.pdf),
    which includes prioritizing the response to the increasing number of
    bias incidents and discrimination against AA and NHPIs, promoting
    belonging, equity, and inclusion, and improving access to federal
    resources. More information on specific actions the Administration
    has taken to counter anti-Asian hate can be
    found [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-uplift-asian-american-native-hawaiian-and-pacific-islander-communities/).

President Biden understands that addressing hate-based violence and
fostering national unity cannot be accomplished by the government
alone—instead, it requires an all-of-society effort and every American
can play a role in advancing this cause. Several private sector partners
continue to make progress on commitments announced at the United We
Stand Summit, including:

-   **Nearly 200 mayors have now signed the Mayors’ Compact to Combat
    Hate and Extremism**. By joining this Compact, organized by the U.S.
    Conference of Mayors and the Anti-Defamation League, mayors commit
    to taking key actions to prevent and address hate-fueled violence
    and build bridges across differences to create respect for and
    inclusion of all peoples within their communities. The U.S.
    Conference of Mayors continues to support mayors’ implementation of
    the Compact, including by providing technical assistance and forums
    for discussion. In June, Second Gentleman Douglass Emhoff joined the
    Conference’s annual meeting to discuss mayors’ efforts to counter
    antisemitism.
-   **Four major civic institutions—Catholic Charities USA, YMCA of the
    USA, Interfaith America, and Habitat for Humanity
    International—launched the **[**Team Up
    Project**](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/we-know-that-bridging-deep-differences-is-possible-our-organizations-do-it-every-day?sra=true),
    an ambitious initiative to promote unity by equipping community
    leaders with the skills and resources to bridge divides in
    communities across the United States. In May 2023, Team Up trained
    its first cohort of leaders, who are now working in 32 communities
    in 23 states to plan robust local bridgebuilding events over the
    next six months. For example, in Jacksonville, Florida, First Coast
    YMCA is partnering with the Jewish Community Alliance on the
    “Together Against Hate: Promoting Unity in Our Community” project to
    build a more inclusive Northeast Florida.
-   Following the announcement of its launch at the United We Stand
    Summit, Dignity.us engaged in an extensive research and stakeholder
    outreach sprint—including meeting with stakeholders across 50 states
    and tribal lands, interviewing hundreds of experts and affected
    community members, and commissioning a nationally represented
    survey—to better understand the challenges in preventing hate-fueled
    violence (HFV). **In response to these findings, in the coming
    months** **Dignity.us will launch a new hub to help to unite the
    fields of preventive actors and targeted communities,** bring in new
    strategic partners to anti-HFV coalitions, and work with innovators
    to catalyze new methods to address hate-animating narratives.
    Dignity.us’ leadership includes four former Directors of the White
    House Domestic Policy Council under Presidents George W. Bush,
    Barack Obama, and Donald J. Trump. 
-   **The Trust for Civic Infrastructure, announced at the Summit, is
    committed to building a vibrant, diverse democracy** for generations
    to come, as recommended in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
    report, [Our Common
    Purpose](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amacad.org%2Fourcommonpurpose%2Frecommendation-4-1&data=05%7C01%7Csheintz%40rbf.org%7Cb012264dd6ce4056057e08da904614ea%7Cce1d5fdfa1934be1a2daae839aaeedbe%7C0%7C0%7C637980927935367721%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=N%2Fl%2FV5jcv6WUqB9Z%2BQMHJbe6RGAPemu%2FYJ9e2qvRGFg%3D&reserved=0).
    The grantmaking collaborative will support local programming that
    brings residents to act on shared problems, building social trust
    and deepening democratic bonds. The Trust has a goal to secure $30
    million in funding by the end of the year and it is completing a
    participatory design process to determine its grantmaking strategy.
    The Trust will begin investing in communities in January 2024, with
    a focus on supporting civic programming in rural America, including
    forging rural-urban connections and innovative civic infrastructure
    models that are equipped for the digital age.
-   Since the United We Stand summit, **the McCain Institute’s
    Prevention Practitioners Network has grown to over 1,225
    interdisciplinary professionals committed to preventing hate-fueled
    violence**. The Network hosted two in-person symposia and five
    workshops with over 1,600 views; reached 1,709,345 concerned adults
    with the SCREEN Hate campaign; recruited 186 organizations to join a
    national directory of resources for youth at risk of hate
    fueled-violence; and published a comprehensive framework for
    preventing targeted violence, a framework for philanthropic
    investment in prevention, and a prioritized research agenda.
