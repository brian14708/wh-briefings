President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with the Presidents of Kazakhstan,
the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan today for
the inaugural C5+1 presidential summit on the margins of the United
Nations General Assembly.  The leaders discussed a range of issues,
including security, trade and investment, regional connectivity, the
need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all
nations, and ongoing reforms to improve governance and the rule of law. 
President Biden welcomed his counterparts’ views on how our nations can
work together to further strengthen the Central Asian nations’
sovereignty, resilience, and prosperity while also advancing human
rights through our C5+1 partnership.  President Biden thanked his
counterparts for their partnership on regional security challenges and
committed to continued collaboration on border security,
counterterrorism, and law enforcement issues.  The United States
discussed the value of creating a more favorable business environment
for U.S. trade and private sector investment through the establishment
of a private sector business platform that will complement the C5+1
diplomatic platform and noted that USAID will convene a C5+1 Regional
Connectivity Ministerial in Central Asia in October to discuss concrete
actions that will drive inclusive, sustainable economic development. 
Because President Biden recognizes that our countries must cooperate to
have resilient, secure supply chains that can support the future energy
landscape, the United States proposed launching a C5+1 Critical Minerals
Dialogue to develop Central Asia’s vast mineral wealth and advance
critical minerals security. These efforts are part of continued U.S.
support to drive investment in and development of the Trans-Caspian
Trade Route (the so-called “Middle Corridor”) through the Partnership
for Global Infrastructure and Investment that will help facilitate
regional economic integration and resilience.  Finally, President Biden
advocated for continued support of civil society and women’s economic
empowerment activities and encouraged a new C5+1 focus on mainstreaming
disability rights across all sectors.
