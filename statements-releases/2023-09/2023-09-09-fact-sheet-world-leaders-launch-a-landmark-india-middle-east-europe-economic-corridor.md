title: "FACT SHEET: World Leaders Launch a Landmark India-Middle East-Europe Economic\_\
  Corridor"
---
 
Today, we the leaders of the United States, India, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy and the European
Union announced a Memorandum of Understanding committing to work
together to develop a new India-Middle East-Europe Economic
Corridor. Announced at the G20 Leaders’ event on the Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment, this landmark corridor is expected
to stimulate economic development through enhanced connectivity and
economic integration across two continents, thus unlocking
sustainable and inclusive economic growth.    
  
Through the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, we aim to usher
in a new era of connectivity with a railway, linked through
ports connecting Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The United States
and our partners intend to link both continents to commercial hubs and
facilitate the development and export of clean energy; lay undersea
cables and link energy grids and telecommunication lines to expand
reliable access to electricity; enable innovation of advanced clean
energy technology; and connect communities to secure and stable
Internet. Across the corridor, we envision driving existing trade and
manufacturing and strengthening food security and supply chains. Our
approach aims to unlock new investments from partners, including the
private sector, and spur the creation of quality jobs.  
   
Looking to the future, the United States underscores our unwavering
commitment to pursuing transformative regional investments and working
to build out this corridor together with our partners. These investments
are a gateway to our future and underpin our shared vision of an open,
secure, and prosperous future.
