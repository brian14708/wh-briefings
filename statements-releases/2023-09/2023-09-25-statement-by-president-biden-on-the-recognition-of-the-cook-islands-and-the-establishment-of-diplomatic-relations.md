title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Recognition of the Cook Islands and the\
  \ Establishment of Diplomatic\_Relations"

Today, I am proud to announce that the United States recognizes the Cook
Islands as a sovereign and independent state and will establish
diplomatic relations between our two nations. 

The United States has a long history of cooperation with the Cook
Islands—dating back to World War II when the U.S. military built airport
runways in the northernmost atoll Penrhyn and in Aitutaki. Today’s
announcement will enable us to expand the scope of this enduring
partnership as we seek to tackle the challenges that matter most to our
peoples’ lives—from countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated
fishing, to combatting climate change, to building inclusive economic
growth, to advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and beyond.  
  
The United States plans to work closely with the Cook Islands, the
Pacific Islands Forum, and the Pacific Community to bolster Pacific
regionalism. Together, we intend to align the objectives of the United
States’ first-ever Pacific Partnership Strategy with the Pacific’s own
priorities as embodied in the Pacific Islands Forum 2050 Strategy for
the Blue Pacific Continent. And, the United States looks forward to
participating in the upcoming PIF Leaders’ Summit to support Pacific
voices, Pacific choices, and the Pacific way.   
  
The history and the future of the Pacific Islands and the United States
are inextricably linked. The United States’ recognition of the Cook
Islands, and the establishment of diplomatic relations will not only
strengthen the ties between our nations, it will help ensure that our
shared future is more secure, more prosperous, and more free—for our
people and people around the world.
