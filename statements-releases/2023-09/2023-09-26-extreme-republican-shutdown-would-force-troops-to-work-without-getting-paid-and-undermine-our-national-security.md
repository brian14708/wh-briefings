title: "Extreme Republican Shutdown Would Force Troops to Work Without Getting Paid\
  \ and Undermine Our National\_Security"
---
 
With less than one week before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House
Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples’ lives and marching
our country toward a government shutdown that would have damaging
impacts across the country—including undermining our national security
and forcing servicemembers across the country and around the world to
work without pay.  
  
During an Extreme Republican Shutdown, servicemembers would continue
working every day to keep our country safe, including our 1.3 million
active-duty troops—but wouldn’t receive their paychecks until funding
becomes available. Hundreds of thousands of their civilian colleagues in
the Department of Defense would also be furloughed, affecting the ways
in which the Department manages its affairs globally, including the
vital task of recruiting new members of the military. All of this would
prove disruptive to our national security.  
  
The reason these national security priorities are now at risk: extreme
House Republicans’ relentless efforts to slash funding for vital
programs rather than work in a bipartisan manner to keep the government
open and address emergency needs for the American people. House
Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal that
two-third of them voted for just a few months ago and have instead
proposed [devastating
cuts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/19/by-the-numbers-impacts-of-house-republicans-extreme-cr-8-cuts/) to
programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on.
