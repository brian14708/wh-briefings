title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. Action on Global\_Development"
---
 
In 2015, world leaders adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
as a roadmap for improving lives and wellbeing of people around the
world. At their core, the SDGs seek to expand economic opportunity,
advance social justice, care for our planet, promote good governance,
and ensure no one is left behind.   
  
This week, the United States and leaders came together once again at the
SDG Summit in New York to recommit to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development and the SDGs. They met at a time of both challenge and
tremendous opportunity around the world. They met with years of evidence
that when countries come together under a common development vision –
the SDGs and Millennium Development Goals before them – they have the
capacity to deliver for both people and planet. For two decades,
countries around the world delivered steady and extraordinary progress
for millions of people to improve the quality of life and health
outcomes of millions of people, while lowering poverty rates and
slashing hunger from around the world.  
  
Yet in recent years, the compounding effects of multiple crises – the
COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and conflict and migration,
exacerbated by the spillovers of Russia’s war in Ukraine – have begun to
erode development gains, including the first global decline in life
expectancy since the 1950s.  
  
At the halfway point to 2030, the world is not where it needs to be.
Globally, we are only on track to achieve 15 percent of the SDG targets.
Yet, if all countries act with urgency and redouble action and
investments across the SDGs, while deepening and expanding partnerships
across goal areas, we can achieve these ambitious goals.  
  
**The United States is committed to the full implementation of 2030
Agenda and the SDGs, at home and abroad.** As a long-standing leader on
global development, the United States is committed to reinvigorating
action on this agenda alongside our partners around the world. The
United States remains the single largest bilateral donor – investing
over $100 billion in Official Development Assistance over the last two
years alone. This includes over $43 billion to help end poverty (SDG 1);
over $20 billion to drive inclusive economic growth and decent work (SDG
8); and over $16 billion to promote peace, justice, and good governance
(SDG 16). The United States is also the largest provider of humanitarian
aid at a time of unprecedented need – investing more than $42 billion
more since the Biden Administration began.  
  
Yet the scale of what is needed cannot be achieved by any government
acting alone. At the SDG Summit, the United States called on all
nations, the private sector, civil society, and local partners to
leverage their respective capacities to do more to fuel the dramatic
progress needed to reach these goals. Since the adoption of the SDGs,
the United States has leveraged its investments to crowd in many
billions of dollars more in additional private investment.  
  
Together we can mobilize considerable additional financing for
development from all sources, including official development assistance,
domestic resources, and private investment.  Ultimately, achieving our
goals will also require leveraging knowledge and data and creating
robust policy and regulatory environments.  
  
The United States recognizes the integrated and universal nature of all
of the SDGs, and is responding to the calls of our partner countries to
address the issues most important to them, including:

-   ***Inclusive Economic Growth and Infrastructure Investment:*** The
    Biden Administration has prioritized building a more sustainable and
    inclusive global economy with the capacity to lift up the fortunes
    of the many – including by mobilizing private finance, reforming and
    scaling up the multilateral development banks (MDBs) to better
    address today’s challenges, helping countries tackle unsustainable
    debt levels, and scaling investment towards quality
    infrastructure.  
    -   The United States is leading an effort to fundamentally reshape
        the multilateral development banks to be better, bigger, and
        more effective in meeting 21st century challenges – including
        tackling global challenges like climate change and fragility
        alongside their core mission to alleviate poverty and promote
        shared prosperity. President Biden asked Congress for funds to
        **unlock more than $25 billion in new World Bank Group
        concessional financing**, and two weeks ago, secured G20
        Leaders’ support to boost the World Bank’s concessional lending
        capacity for global challenges and for crisis response in the
        poorest countries.    
    -   The United States is also calling on bilateral and private
        creditors to provide meaningful **debt relief to low- and
        middle-income countries in crisis**.  We are also taking action
        to develop new solutions to help translate unsustainable debt
        into transformative investments, including through
        debt-for-nature swaps.  
    -   Recognizing that reliable infrastructure is often the very
        foundation of economic growth, business development, and social
        empowerment, the United States committed – alongside G7 partners
        – to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 through the **Partnership for
        Global Infrastructure and Investment** (PGI) to help close the
        infrastructure gap in low- and middle-income countries. As
        demonstrated at the G20 Leaders’ Summit, the United States
        continues to strategically leverage public capital to mobilize
        private sector investments around the world to develop
        transformative economic corridors, expand regional markets,
        diversify supply chains, and support more resilient energy,
        food, digital, and health systems.  
        -   This includes the landmark [Just Energy Transition
            Partnership
            (JETP)](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/15/fact-sheet-presidents-biden-widodo-von-der-leyen-and-g20-announce-g20-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-projects/#:~:text=Indonesia%20Just%20Energy,workers%20and%20communities.)
            between Indonesia and a group co-led by the United States
            that will mobilize an initial $20 billion in financing—half
            of which will come from the private sector—to support
            ambitious new targets in Indonesia’s clean energy
            transition.  
        -   PGI builds on years of infrastructure investment across the
            U.S Government, including through the U.S. Millennium
            Challenge Corporation (MCC), which has **delivered debt-free
            infrastructure investments** to support inclusive economic
            growth in 47 economies around the world since 2004,
            benefitting over 266 million people.  In the coming days,
            MCC will sign a $500 million Connectivity and Coastal
            Resilience Compact in Mozambique; a $29 million Threshold
            Program in Kiribati in support of Sustainable Development
            Goal 8 on decent work and economic growth; and a $60 million
            Threshold Program in Kenya to support government’s efforts
            to supply clean public transportation to Nairobi.  
-   ***Global Health and Health Security:*** As a longstanding leader in
    global health, the United States has put money and partnerships to
    work to secure life-saving outcomes. Through the President’s
    Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the American people have
    invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response in the
    last twenty years, the largest commitment by any nation to address a
    single disease in history, saving 25 million lives, preventing
    millions of HIV infections, and accelerating progress toward
    controlling the global HIV/AIDS epidemic in more than 50 countries.
    Accelerating that work, the Biden Administration led **the
    largest-ever replenishment of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, TB,
    and Malaria, with donors pledging $15.7 billion**. We are now
    investing more than ever to end ongoing epidemics like HIV/AIDS, TB,
    and malaria as public health threats by 2030. Having seen how
    critical it is to have a strong health workforce in a time of
    crisis, the United States is investing in health workers through our
    core health programming supporting the President’s [Global Health
    Worker
    Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-progress-on-one-year-anniversary-of-the-global-health-worker-initiative/),
    we have expanded our support to 50 countries to strengthen [global
    health security
    systems](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-strategy-to-strengthen-health-security-and-prepare-for-biothreats/)
    in order to prepare, prevent, and respond to the next health
    emergency, and we continue to address core health needs around the
    world. The United States has committed $700 million to [the Pandemic
    Fund](https://fiftrustee.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/dfi/fiftrustee/fund-detail/pppr)
    to catalyze investment and coordination across partners to close
    country global health security capacity gaps. The United States has
    also donated, in partnership with COVAX and others, more than 688
    million doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine to 117
    countries. Beyond vaccines, the United States worked with countries
    around the world to invest in life-saving measures like COVID
    testing and treatment, protection of health workers, and developing
    the infrastructure required to get shots in arms now and in the
    future.  
-   ***Resilient and Sustainable Food Systems and Food Security:*** With
    the world facing an ongoing and protracted food crisis – millions of
    additional people have been pushed into food insecurity and chronic
    hunger. Building on its longstanding leadership, the United States
    is leading the charge to accelerate progress towards global food
    security. Under the Biden Administration, the United States
    obligated $15.2 billion in emergency food aid and development
    assistance to respond to the global food security crisis. Through
    **Feed the Future, the U.S. government’s flagship global food
    security initiative, the United States is scaling up ways to build
    more sustainable and resilient food systems in 20 target countries
    around the world** by helping farmers get goods to markets faster,
    safely store food and prevent food loss and waste, use agricultural
    data to help increase food production, and to provide drought- and
    heat-resistant seeds to farmers. These investments will create jobs
    at home and abroad. Additionally, the United States is investing
    $455 million through the McGovern-Dole Program and the Food for
    Progress Program to strengthen global food security and
    international capacity-building efforts. The investment also
    includes more than 375,000 metric tons of donated U.S. commodities
    which will help strengthen short- and long-term food security
    through climate-smart agriculture projects and be used to provide
    nutritious school meals for children. Complementing these bilateral
    efforts, the United States is also mobilizing resources and
    expertise from partners around the world to address food insecurity
    through the **Global Agriculture and Food Security Program
    (GAFSP), an innovative $2 billion multi-donor trust fund hosted at
    the World Bank. ** GAFSP has mobilized $476 million to support
    private sector development to help boost agricultural productivity
    and support smallholder farmers in low-income countries, while
    providing direct support to more than 16 million rural people,
    including 7 million women.  
-   ***Clean and Climate Resilient Economies:*** Recognizing that the
    transition to a net-zero emissions economy has the potential to
    boost economic growth, produce jobs, create entirely new industries,
    and protect vital natural ecosystems and biodiversity, the United
    States is working on the frontlines of the climate crisis with
    countries around the world. Through the **President’s Emergency Plan
    for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE**), the United States is
    bringing together its diplomatic, development, and technical
    expertise to **help more than half a billion people in developing
    countries** adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change. The
    Biden Administration is also helping partner countries transition to
    affordable and secure energy, which both reduces emissions and spurs
    economic growth. At the G20 two weeks ago, President Biden and G20
    leaders committed to pursue efforts to triple global renewable
    energy capacity by 2030. Over the past decade, **the Power Africa
    Initiative** **has helped build clean and sustainable energy
    infrastructure across the African continent**–avoiding millions of
    tons of CO2 emissions while delivering new or improved electricity
    to over 172 million people. Bilaterally, the U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID) has supported renewable energy
    auctions that facilitated $24.6 billion of investment in large-scale
    wind and solar plants – equivalent to taking six million cars off
    the road. The United States is also conserving forests and other
    landscapes. Last year alone, USAID helped protect more than 60
    million hectares globally – an area larger than the state of
    California.  
-   ***Education:*** The United States is also leading efforts to
    improve learning outcomes and to get all learners access to quality
    schooling, from pre-primary to higher education. This year, the
    United States is investing over $1 billion across nearly 100 partner
    countries to help build literacy, math, and social-emotional skills,
    so that young people gain the skills they need to lead productive
    lives, gain employment, and positively contribute to society. The
    United States is also a leading donor to the **Global Partnership
    for Education** and **Education Cannot Wait**, multilateral
    partnerships that coordinate stakeholders and leverage resources to
    improve the quality of education around the world, particularly in
    areas affected by crisis, conflict, and forced displacement.  
-   ***Gender Equality and Women’s’ Empowerment:*** This year United
    States is investing over $2.8 billion in foreign assistance programs
    that promote gender equality–*doubling* our investment from last
    year. Aligned with the [U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and
    Equality](https://www.state.gov/u-s-strategy-on-global-womens-economic-security/)
    and the [U.S. Strategy on Global Women’s Economic
    Security](https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-on-global-womens-economic-security/),
    the United States is investing in initiatives like the **Gender
    Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund** to advance economic
    security for women and girls by addressing the barriers that limit
    their ability to participate fully in the economy. The United States
    is also investing in the **Women in the Digital Economy Fund**, a
    pooled partnership that identifies, directly funds, and accelerates
    evidence-based, proven solutions to close the gender digital divide,
    thereby improving women’s livelihoods, economic security, and
    resilience, and the **Climate Gender Equity Fund** **(CGEF)**, a
    public-private partnership that expands financial inclusion for
    women-led organizations and businesses focused on advancing
    sustainable economic growth, by increasing access to climate finance
    for investment vehicles, intermediaries, businesses, and
    community-based organizations in developing countries.  
-   ***Democracy and Human Rights, Addressing Fragility and Drivers of
    Conflict:*** Recognizing, as SDG 16 states, that “there can be no
    sustainable development without peace and security and no peace and
    security without sustainable development,” the United States is
    investing in a range of efforts to promote democracy and human
    rights, and address fragility. At the first Summit for Democracy,
    the United States launched the Presidential Initiative for
    Democratic Renewal (P.I.D.R.), a landmark set of policy and foreign
    assistance initiatives building upon the U.S. Government’s
    significant, ongoing work to bolster democracy and defend human
    rights globally.  At the second Summit for Democracy, the United
    States announced up to $690 million in new funding for the P.I.D.R.
    working with Congress and subject to the availability of
    appropriations.  Through the [Democracy Delivers
    Initiative](https://www.usaid.gov/democracydelivers), the United
    States is surging attention and resources in countries experiencing
    democratic openings—where elected representatives, civil society
    leaders, and everyday people are empowered and committed to pursuing
    reforms. Under the [U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote
    Stability](https://www.state.gov/stability-strategy/), the U.S.
    government is integrating diplomatic, development, and defense
    efforts and tackling the root causes of conflict, fostering
    locally-led solutions that address local priorities and build the
    foundations for long-term stability and progress. Recognizing the
    integral role women play in negotiating durable peace, through the
    [U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and
    Security](https://www.dhs.gov/us-strategy-women-peace-and-security#:~:text=In%20June%20of%202019%2C%20in%20response%20to%20the,resolve%2C%20and%20recover%20from%20deadly%20conflict%20or%20disaster.),
    the United States government is creating opportunities for women to
    be represented in peace processes throughout the world and hold
    positions of power in countries recovering from conflict. Through
    the [U.S. Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to
    Atrocities](https://www.state.gov/atrocity-prevention/), the U.S.
    government is working with local and international partners on
    atrocity prevention and response.  
-   ***Digitalization and New Technologies**:***  The United States is
    helping countries accelerate economic growth, connect citizens to
    vital services, and provide solutions to key societal challenges in
    health, education, sustainability, and governance through open,
    inclusive, and secure digital technology. For example, Digital
    Invest, a blended finance program under PGI, is mobilizing $245
    million in investment capital – with $200 million more expected –to
    accelerate investment in last-mile connectivity and financial
    technologies that benefit women and other traditionally excluded
    populations. Digital Invest partnerships have already connected 11
    million consumers across 28 countries to digital tools and
    innovations such as pay-as-you-go solar; sustainable financing for
    internet connections at schools and health clinics; and working
    capital loans to expand digital infrastructure.
