  \ of\_Governors"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced his intent to appoint Massachusetts
Governor Maura Healey, Idaho Governor Brad Little, and South Carolina
Governor Henry McMaster to the Council of Governors for two-year terms.
Five current members will be reappointed for another term, including
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Vermont Governor Phil Scott, Delaware
Governor John Carney, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, and Michigan
Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will continue
serving as co-chair and Vermont Governor Phil Scott has been nominated
to serve as the second co-chair for this session. The Council of
Governors is comprised of 10 bipartisan Governors from across the
country and serves as the lead forum to increase coordination around
preparedness, resilience, and response between the Federal government
and state governments, and strengthen the Federal-State partnership
that’s critical to protecting our nation from threats to our homeland
security. The Council of Governors serves as the lead forum for
communication and collaboration between the States and the Federal
government on homeland defense, civil support, synchronization and
integration of State and Federal military activities in the United
States, and matters of mutual interest pertaining to the National
Guard.  
   
The Council includes leaders across the Federal government: the
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant
to the President for Homeland Security, the Deputy Assistant to the
President for Intergovernmental Affairs, Chief of the National Guard
Bureau, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and
Hemispheric Affairs, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and the
Commander of U.S. Northern Command. Other key Federal officials such as
the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are
regular participants.  
  
Governors Healey, Little, and McMaster will replace Utah Governor
Spencer Cox, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and Louisiana Governor John Bel
Edwards who completed their terms on the Council of Governors. The
President thanks Governors Cox, DeWine, and Bel Edwards for their tenure
on the Council.    
  
Governors Healey, Little, and McMaster will join five members of the
Council of Governors who were appointed by the President in July 2021,
and two that were appointed by the President in February 2023.

**Governor Maura Healey**  
Maura Healey currently serves as the 73rd Governor of the State of
Massachusetts. She is the first woman and the first openly LGBTQ person
elected to serve in the role. Under Healey’s leadership, Massachusetts
is becoming more affordable and competitive economically through her
prioritization of housing, transportation, job training and child care.
Healey is harnessing Massachusetts’ resources to deliver for residents,
families, and businesses throughout the entire state.

She is a graduate of Harvard College and Northeastern University School
of Law in Boston. Prior to her election as Governor in 2022, Healey
served as Massachusetts Attorney General where she launched the
Community Engagement Division. The division assisted with the rollout of
the Earned Sick Time law and the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights.

**Governor Brad Little**  
Brad Little currently serves as the 33<sup>rd</sup> Governor of the
State of Idaho. The people of Idaho elected Brad Little to be their
Governor in November of 2018 and reelected him in November of 2022.
Under Little’s leadership, Idaho has experienced historic investments in
education and infrastructure and unprecedented tax relief. Idaho
received the title “least regulated state” during his first term. He
seeks to ensure the lightest possible hand of government in the lives of
Idaho’s citizens, and he seeks to build the public’s confidence in state
government.

He is an Emmett native who was raised on his family’s sheep and cattle
ranching operation. He is a graduate of the University of Idaho. Prior
to his election as Governor, he served four full terms in the Idaho
Senate and as the Lieutenant Governor for 10 years.

**Governor Henry McMaster**  
Henry McMaster currently serves as the 117<sup>th</sup> Governor of the
State of South Carolina. He was sworn in following then-Governor Nikki
Haley’s appointment as United States Ambassador to the United Nations,
and was elected to a full term as governor in November 2018 and
re-elected in November 2022. Under McMaster’s leadership, South
Carolina’s economy is strong and vibrant. The state has made
transformative investments in the classroom by expanding full day
four-year-old kindergarten, raising K-12 teacher pay, and placing a
school resource officer in every school. Colleges and universities are
becoming more accessible and affordable due to the governor’s tuition
freeze and by his doubling of funding for needs-based financial aid for
in-state students. McMaster is the recipient of the Order of the
Palmetto, the state’s highest civilian honor awarded to citizens of
South Carolina for extraordinary lifetime service and achievements of
national and statewide significance. 

He is a graduate of the University of South Carolina. Prior to being
elected Governor, he served as South Carolina Attorney General and as
Lieutenant Governor.  
  
**About the Council of Governors:**  
The Council of Governors was authorized in 2008 by the National Defense
Authorization Act and formally established by then-President Obama’s
Executive Order 13528 issued on January 11, 2010. The Council focuses on
matters of homeland security; homeland defense; civil support;
synchronization and integration of state and Federal military activities
in the United States; and other matters of mutual interest, including
those involving the National Guard. Federal-State cooperation is
critical to protecting communities given the evolving challenges and
threats facing our country, which range from extreme weather to domestic
and international terrorism to a global pandemic.
