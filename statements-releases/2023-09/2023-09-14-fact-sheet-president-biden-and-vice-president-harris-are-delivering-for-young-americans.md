**VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS’S FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOMS COLLEGE TOUR**  
**Protecting Our Rights | Using Our Voices | Determining Our Future**  
  
**\*   \*   \***

As students head back to the classroom, Vice President Harris is
launching a month-long “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour” across
America to mobilize young people in the ongoing fight for fundamental
freedoms and rights. She is set to visit at least seven states to hold a
whirlwind of high-energy, large-scale campus events at around a dozen
schools – including historically Black colleges and universities,
Hispanic-serving institutions, community colleges, apprenticeship
programs, and four-year state schools. The Vice President’s flurry of
tour stops will bring thousands of students together around the critical
fights for reproductive freedom, commonsense gun safety laws, climate
action, voting rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and teaching America’s full
story.

As the Vice President officially kicks off her college tour at Hampton
University today, the White House is highlighting how the Biden-Harris
Administration has consistently engaged with, partnered alongside, and
delivered for young people across the nation.

**President Biden and Vice President Harris Are…**

**<u>Investing in our Schools and Colleges</u>**  
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that investing in
education is investing in America’s future. To ensure that every young
American has the opportunity for a strong start in life, the
Biden-Harris administration has:

-   Secured a historic $130 billion for America’s K-12 schools, which
    they are using to hire teachers, improve student achievement, and
    provide mental health support.
-   Funded
    [14,000](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-tackle-nations-mental-health-crisis/)
    additional mental health professionals to work in America’s schools
-   Created a [new program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sebt) to feed
    low-income children during summer break.
-   Invested [$39
    billion](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/arp.html#:~:text=The%20Higher%20Education%20Emergency%20Relief,during%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.)
    in colleges and universities, including more than [$25
    billion](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-opens-nearly-100m-grant-opportunities-hbcus-tccus-and-msis-and-underserved-students)
    to historically Black colleges and universities, Tribally Controlled
    Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions, which
    they are
    [using](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/07/fact-sheet-department-of-education-announces-state-by-state-american-rescue-plan-funding-for-colleges-and-universities/)
    to support students at risk of dropping out.
-   Clarified how colleges and universities can continue to promote
    opportunity and diversity after the Supreme Court effectively ended
    the use of affirmative action in college admissions.

**<u>Supporting Student Borrowers</u>**  
The average young adult (18-24) with student loans owes more than
[$14,000](https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/fsawg/datacenter/library/DLPortfolio-by-Age.xls).
President Biden and Vice President Harris are doing everything within
their power to fix problems in the student loan system, provide debt
relief to borrowers, and make college more affordable. The
administration:

-   Has already approved more than $117 billion in targeted relief for
    3.4 million student loan borrowers, including borrowers with total
    and permanent disabilities, those cheated by their colleges, those
    in public service, and more.
-   Is [continuing to
    fight](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-provide-debt-relief-and-support-for-student-loan-borrowers/)
    for student debt relief after the Supreme Court blocked their plan.
-   Already enrolled 4 million student borrowers in the most generous
    repayment plan ever, making many borrowers’ monthly payments $0 and
    saving others more than
    [$1,000](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-provide-debt-relief-and-support-for-student-loan-borrowers/)
    per year.
-   Stopped borrowers’ balances from growing because of runaway interest
    under their new income-driven repayment plan.
-   Capped undergraduate student loan payments at
    [5%](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/22/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-save-plan-the-most-affordable-student-loan-repayment-plan-ever-to-lower-monthly-payments-for-millions-of-borrowers/#:~:text=Borrowers%20with%20undergraduate%20loans%20will,principal%20balances%20of%20their%20loans.)
    of discretionary income starting next summer.

**<u>Expanding Health Care Access</u>**  
Young adults are [more
likely](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/stories/2020/10/uninsured-rates-highest-for-young-adults-aged-19-to-34-figure-1.jpg)
to lack health insurance than any other age group. Even among young
people with insurance, sizable barriers remain. [Last year, almost a
third](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/poll-finding/kff-survey-of-consumer-experiences-with-health-insurance/)
of young adults didn’t get the mental health care they needed even with
insurance. President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that
healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and they are taking action to
expand access to these essential services: 

-   The Biden-Harris Administration lowered the cost of health
    insurance, saving millions of families more than
    [$800](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/25/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-record-aca-enrollment-numbers/)
    on premiums each year.
-   More Americans have health insurance
    [today](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/08/03/new-hhs-report-shows-national-uninsured-rate-reached-all-time-low-2023-after-record-breaking-aca-enrollment-period.html#:~:text=The%20nation's%20uninsured%20rate%20declined,the%20National%20Health%20Interview%20Survey.)
    than ever before. Since President Biden and Vice President Harris
    took office, [6.3
    million](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/08/03/new-hhs-report-shows-national-uninsured-rate-reached-all-time-low-2023-after-record-breaking-aca-enrollment-period.html#:~:text=The%20nation's%20uninsured%20rate%20declined,the%20National%20Health%20Interview%20Survey.)
    Americans have gained insurance coverage, including [1.8
    million](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/NHISDataQueryTool/ER_Biannual/index_biannual.html)
    young adults (18-34) and nearly
    [700,000](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/08/03/new-hhs-report-shows-national-uninsured-rate-reached-all-time-low-2023-after-record-breaking-aca-enrollment-period.html)
    people under 18
-   The Biden-Harris Administration proposed [a new
    rule](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/25/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-action-to-make-it-easier-to-access-in-network-mental-health-care/)
    that would improve insurance coverage for mental health and
    substance use treatment.
-   All three of the nation’s leading insulin manufacturers [lowered
    prices](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/16/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-top-three-insulin-producers-lowering-prices/)
    following President Biden’s call for them to do so during his State
    of the Union.

**<u>Making the Economy Work for Workers</u>**  
Today, three years after the 2020 recession, the economy is starting to
work for young people, thanks to President Biden’s and Vice President
Harris’s efforts.

-   Earlier this year, youth unemployment hit the lowest level seen in
    [70
    years](https://www.epi.org/blog/class-of-2023-young-adults-are-graduating-into-a-strong-labor-market/).
    -   Pay for young workers is growing at its [fastest
        rate](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker?panel=1)
        since 1998.
    -   The Biden-Harris Administration has recovered more than $675
        million for 430,000 workers whose employers were breaking
        overtime rules, denying workers tips, or paying less than
        minimum wage
    -   The Administration’s historic investments in clean energy,
        infrastructure, and semiconductor manufacturing will create
        millions of good jobs, including union jobs, with fair pay and
        safe working conditions.
    -   The Department of Labor created the [WORK
        Center](https://www.dol.gov/general/workcenter) to support young
        workers in forming unions, providing information on organizing
        and collective bargaining

**<u>Lowering the Cost of Living</u>**  
Almost [10
million](https://news.gallup.com/poll/392432/americans-financial-worries-tick-past-year.aspx)
young adults (18-34s) say they are “very worried” about not having
enough money to pay their monthly bills. President Biden and Vice
President Harris understand young people are facing an affordability
crisis, and they are taking action to respond by:

-   Expanding childcare assistance for more than
    [80,000](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/11/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-actions-to-lower-child-care-costs-and-support-child-care-providers/)
    low-income families, helping them save up to
    [$3,000](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/11/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-actions-to-lower-child-care-costs-and-support-child-care-providers/)
    each year.
-   Leading a crackdown on [rental housing junk
    fees](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-on-junk-fees-in-rental-housing-to-lower-costs-for-renters/),
    including by working with online rental platforms to show the full
    cost of rent up front so that renters can easily compare options.
-   Making homeownership more affordable by reducing mortgage insurance
    costs, saving
    [850,000](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-action-to-save-homebuyers-and-homeowners-800-per-year/)
    homebuyers an average of
    [$800](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-action-to-save-homebuyers-and-homeowners-800-per-year/)
    each year.

**<u>Standing up for Reproductive Rights</u>**

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning *Roe v. Wade*,
nearly 28 million women of reproductive age live in a state with an
abortion ban. These extreme and dangerous abortion bans have an outsized
impact on young
people, [three-quarters](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americans-views-on-whether-and-in-what-circumstances-abortion-should-be-legal/)
of whom believe that abortion should be legal.   To ensure all women,
including young women, can access the health care they need, the
Biden-Harris Administration is:

-   Defending FDA’s approval of safe and effective [medication
    abortion](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/12/factsheet-the-biden-harris-administrations-record-on-protecting-access-to-medication-abortion/).
-   Strengthening [access to affordable
    contraception](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/),
    including through private and public health insurance as well as at
    clinics and pharmacies.
-   Ensuring that all patients, including pregnant women who are
    experiencing medical emergencies, can obtain emergency [medical
    care](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-commitment-to-defending-reproductive-rights-and-actions-to-protect-access-to-reproductive-health-care-one-year-after-overturning-of-roe-v-wade/).

    for reproductive health care.
-   Strengthening [privacy

    for patients and students.
-   Partnering with [state
    leaders](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dobbs-Anniversary-States-Report-6.22.23.pdf)
    fighting extreme state legislation and those advancing proactive
    policies to protect access.
-   Calling on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe* in federal
    law so women in every state can access the reproductive health care
    they need.

**<u>Preventing and Addressing Gender-Based Violence</u>**  
Young people are [disproportionately
impacted](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/fastfact.html)
by gender-based violence. To prevent gender-based violence and increase
support for survivors, the Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Signed into law legislation that strengthens the [Violence Against
    Women
    Act](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-reauthorization-of-the-violence-against-women-act-vawa/),
    which provides legal protection and increases services and support
    for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,
    and stalking, including those from underserved and marginalized
    communities, LGBTQI+ people, and people living on college campuses.
-   Issued executive orders implementing [bipartisan
    reforms](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/)
    to the military justice system that strengthen how the military
    investigates and prosecutes [sexual assault, sexual harassment, and
    domestic
    violence](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/26/fact-sheet-executive-order-2022-amendments-to-the-manual-for-courts-martial/).
-   Launched a [Task Force to Address Online Harassment and
    Abuse](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/16/fact-sheet-presidential-memorandum-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
    to promote accountability and support survivors of
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence.

**<u>Taking Action to End Gun Violence</u>**  
Gun violence is the
[largest](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/health/us-children-gun-deaths-dg/index.html)
killer of children in America – more than cancer and car accidents. More
than [20
million](https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/45th-edition-spring-2023)
young Americans (18-29s) say they are afraid of experiencing a mass
shooting. To take action on gun violence, the Biden-Harris
Administration:

-   Signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, which
    expands the use of state red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands
    of dangerous people, strengthens background checks for young people
    under age 21 trying to buy a gun, narrows the “dating loophole” to
    keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, and includes funding
    to hire or train more than 14,000 mental health professionals to
    work in schools and help young people deal with the trauma resulting
    from gun violence.
-   Announced dozens of executive actions to reduce gun violence,
    including actions to combat trafficking of firearms, hold gun
    dealers accountable, promote safe storage of firearms, rein in the
    proliferation of ghost guns, and reduce the percentage of guns sold
    without background checks.
-   Secured confirmation of Steve Dettelbach to serve as Director of the
    Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives – the first
    confirmed director since 2015

Yet President Biden is the first to say that this is not nearly enough
to address this public health epidemic. That’s why he will continue to
take action and call on Congress to act, including by banning assault
weapons and requiring universal background checks.

**<u>Tackling the Climate Crisis and Advancing Environmental
Justice</u>**  
[One in
three](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/)
young people (18-24) say that climate change is their top personal
concern. President Biden and Vice President Harris are listening to
these young people and taking unprecedented action through the most
ambitious climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in
history:

-   Securing the largest investment in climate action in world history
    through the [Inflation Reduction
    Act](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/16/fact-sheet-one-year-in-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act-is-driving-historic-climate-action-and-investing-in-america-to-create-good-paying-jobs-and-reduce-costs/),
    which puts us on a path to achieve the President’s goal of cutting
    emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030. 
-   Since President Biden and Vice President Harris took office,
    [American clean energy opportunities have
    surged](https://www.energy.gov/investments-american-made-energy),
    including announcements of dozens of new factories to produce enough
    solar panels to power 12 million additional homes and enough
    batteries to power 10 million electric vehicles each year, while
    creating [more than 170,000
    jobs](https://climatepower.us/resources/new-climate-power-report-finds-that-since-the-passage-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-170k-clean-energy-jobs-across-44-states-have-been-announced/)
    nationwide.
-   Protecting nearly 1.5 million acres of public lands as [new national
    monuments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-designates-baaj-nwaavjo-itah-kukveni-ancestral-footprints-of-the-grand-canyon-national-monument/)
    – an area almost the size of the state of Delaware – and delivering
    on an unprecedented commitment to conserve and restore 30% of lands
    and waters by 2030.
-   Taking [strong executive
    action](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/climate/) to reduce pollution
    across every sector – including electricity, transportation,
    buildings, industry, and lands and agriculture – while creating
    good-paying jobs and boosting community resilience to extreme
    weather
-   Protecting communities from pollution, [especially underserved
    communities](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/), by
    replacing lead pipes, purchasing zero-emissions school busses, and
    [more](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).

**<u>Strengthening Civil Rights and Voting Rights</u>**  
Today’s young people are America’s most diverse generation yet. [Almost
half](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-national-detail.html)
of 18-29 year-olds identify as Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian
American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander, and [one in
five](https://news.gallup.com/poll/470708/lgbt-identification-steady.aspx)
Gen Z Americans identify as LGBTQI+.  President Biden and Vice President
Harris are working to live up to the promise of equal rights for all
people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, or disability. That’s why they:

-   Issued a Day 1 executive order on equity that charged the entire
    federal government to take action to support underserved communities
    and advance racial justice, leading to more than
    [300](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/14/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-agency-equity-action-plans-to-advance-equity-and-racial-justice-across-the-federal-government/)
    actions to address issues like wage theft and maternal mortality
    that disproportionately affect people of color.
-   Clarified and strengthened protections against discrimination in
    housing, health care, education, employment, family planning
    programs, and homeless services to ensure LGBTQI+ Americans cannot
    be denied services just because of who they are or whom they love.
-   Appointed leaders to the Department of Justice with expertise in
    defending voting rights. The Department has
    [doubled](https://www.axios.com/2021/06/11/voting-rights-justice-department-merrick-garland)
    its voting rights enforcement staff to protect the voting rights of
    all Americans. 
-   Signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law and reversed the ban on
    transgender troops serving openly in our military.
-   Are
    [encouraging](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/dear-colleague-letters/2022-04-21/requirements-distribution-voter-registration-forms)
    colleges to make voter registration forms accessible on campuses.

**<u>Addressing a Failed Approach to Marijuana</u>**  
The criminalization of marijuana possession has upended too many
lives—for conduct that is now legal in many states. While white, Black
and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people
are more likely to be in jail for it.

-   The President announced a full, unconditional, and categorical
    [pardon](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/06/granting-pardon-for-the-offense-of-simple-possession-of-marijuana/)
    for prior federal and DC simple marijuana possession offenses.
-   This pardon lifts barriers to housing, employment, and educational
    opportunities for thousands of people with prior convictions under
    federal and D.C. law for simple marijuana possession.
-   The President also called on every state governor to follow his
    lead, as most marijuana prosecutions take place at the state level.
-   And because this Administration is guided by science and evidence,
    he asked the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General to begin the
    administrative process
    of [reviewing](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/)
    how marijuana is classified under federal law and undertake it
    expeditiously.

**<u>Advancing Safe, Effective, and Accountable Policing</u>**  
George Floyd’s murder exposed for many what Black and Brown communities
have long known and experienced — that we must make a whole of society
commitment to ensure that our Nation lives up to its founding promise of
fair and impartial justice for all under the law.

-   President Biden signed a historic executive order to advance
    effective, accountable policing and strengthen public safety.
-   It requires federal law enforcement agencies to: ban chokeholds;
    restrict no-knock warrants; mandate the use of body-worn cameras;
    and implement stronger use of force policies, among other things.
    Over the past year, the Administration has been [actively
    implementing the
    order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/25/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-accomplishments-on-anniversary-of-historic-executive-order-to-advance-effective-accountable-policing-and-strengthen-public-safety/).
-   The President cannot mandate changes at the state and local level,
    but is using every available tool to encourage reform and calling on
    Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to his
    desk.
