Jill and I send our love and prayers to Congresswoman Mary Sattler
Peltola on the sudden death of her husband, Eugene “Buzzy” Peltola, Jr.,
earlier today in a plane accident in Alaska.

Back in May, Mary and Buzzy hosted Jill during a visit to a rural high
school in their hometown of Bethel, Alaska. On Monday, Mary and their
daughter Kaeli joined me during a visit with troops stationed in
Anchorage to commemorate the twenty-second anniversary of the September
11, 2001 attacks on our nation.

Spend even a minute with Mary and you’ll feel the love she has
for her state and its people, and most of all, the love she has for her
husband and their seven children. Buzzy was a devoted public servant and
in the tributes coming from all over the state today, he is being
remembered as a friend to all. But we know he was, first and always, the
adored and devoted husband and father to a family now in pain.

On Monday, Mary flew back with me to Washington on Air Force One with
the whole world ahead of her. Today, I spoke with her with that world
shattered in shock and sadness. To the family – such a loss is cruel and
unfair, and the first hours, days, and weeks will be the hardest. But we
hope you remember that he will always be with you. And we pray the day
will come when his memory will bring a smile to your lips before it
brings a tear to your eyes. It will take time, but that day will come.

In the difficult time ahead, we keep you in our prayers.

May God bless Eugene “Buzzy” Peltola, Jr.
