  \ the United\_States and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the\_Philippines"

Vice President Kamala Harris met with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of
the Philippines on the margins of the U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Jakarta,
Indonesia. They welcomed the strength of the bilateral relationship.
They discussed opportunities to deepen commercial and economic
cooperation, as well as their shared commitment to upholding the
rules-based international order. This meeting builds on President
Biden’s and Vice President Harris’ bilateral meetings with President
Marcos in Washington D.C. in May 2023 and the Vice President’s November
2022 trip to the Philippines.

The Vice President reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad alliance
commitment to the Philippines, and highlighted the role the
U.S.-Philippines alliance plays in ensuring a free, open and prosperous
Indo-Pacific. The two leaders discussed the maritime security
environment in the South China Sea, and reviewed opportunities to
enhance bilateral maritime cooperation, including alongside likeminded
partners. They welcomed the identification of four additional sites
pursuant to the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement,
which will drive U.S. investment to local communities across the
Philippines and improve our shared ability to rapidly deliver
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. President Marcos and the
Vice President also discussed opportunities to bolster bilateral
economic cooperation and enhance economic resilience.
