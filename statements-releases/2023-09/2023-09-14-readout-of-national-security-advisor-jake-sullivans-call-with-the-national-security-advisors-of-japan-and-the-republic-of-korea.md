  \ Security Advisors of Japan and the Republic of\_Korea"

National Security Advisor Sullivan held a trilateral call with National
Security Secretariat Secretary General Akiba Takeo of Japan and National
Security Office Director Cho Tae-yong of the Republic of Korea to
exchange views on the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea (DPRK),
including the recent summit meeting between Russian President Putin and
DPRK leader Kim. The three NSAs reaffirmed the importance of trilateral
coordination consistent with their commitment to consult. They noted
that any arms exports from the DPRK to Russia would directly violate
multiple UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions that
Russia itself voted to adopt. They reiterated their cooperation toward
the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
