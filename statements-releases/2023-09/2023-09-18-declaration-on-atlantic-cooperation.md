**Declaration on Atlantic Cooperation**

1\.  We, as States bordering the Atlantic Ocean, share a commitment to a
peaceful, stable, prosperous, open, safe, cooperative Atlantic region
and to conserve a healthy, sustainable, and resilient resource for
generations to come.  Building on the Joint Statement on Atlantic
Cooperation issued in New York on September 20, 2022, we welcome the
opportunity to establish these guiding principles, which represent our
governments’ commitment to accomplish our shared goals.   
   
2.  We recognize that the Atlantic Ocean connects us and is an important
resource for our present and future development, health, and well-being
and offers untapped economic potential, from natural resources to new
technologies.  The Atlantic Ocean regulates our climate, is a vital
source of food and energy, is essential for trade and livelihoods, and
connects us culturally.  The Atlantic Ocean also connects us in the face
of challenges such as piracy, transnational organized crime, narcotics
trafficking, as well as illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU)
fishing, climate change, natural disasters, pollution, and environmental
degradation, which pose a threat to our well-being, livelihoods, and the
sustainable ocean economy.  Thus, we share a commitment to cooperate and
coordinate our efforts to achieve peace, stability, prosperity, and
sustainability.   
   
3.  No country alone can solve the cross-boundary challenges in the
Atlantic region or fully address the opportunities before us.  Atlantic
States have a special interest and primary role in the Atlantic.  We
understand that the manifold interdependencies between Atlantic States
and the interconnected nature of many of the challenges we face make
clear the need for deeper collaboration and integration and a commitment
to multilateralism in our efforts to work together toward common
goals.   
   
4.  We are committed to international law, and a stronger, inclusive,
representative, and effective multilateralism, with the UN Charter at
its core as the foundation of our efforts.  We acknowledge the
importance of existing national and international legal frameworks, and
we reaffirm that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
sets out the legal framework that governs all activities in the ocean
and the seas.   
   
5.  We seek to open a new chapter in advancing regional cooperation to
build shared solutions and capacity to address Atlantic challenges,
representing the interconnected approach to prosperity, safety,
stability, and sustainability.  We will advance cooperation to realize
an Atlantic Ocean that is sustainable, healthy, safe, productive, and
biologically diverse, linking resilient and prosperous coastal
communities, and supporting sustainable economic growth and social
inclusion for Atlantic States.  
   
6.  Similarly, we will advance cooperation to realize the opportunities
offered in the sustainable ocean economy – recognizing that sustainable
use of ocean resources provides the foundation for fair and equitable
economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ensuring the health
of marine and coastal ecosystems.   We will work to ensure the ocean
continues to sustainably support our livelihoods, from food for growing
populations to the conduct of global commerce, both now and for future
generations.  We recognize that there is no sustainable development
without a serious commitment to promote development, build capacity, and
alleviate poverty in developing countries.  
   
7.  We acknowledge the vital importance of the transfer of technology on
voluntary and mutually agreed terms as a critically important means to
bolster development, create jobs and income, support livelihoods,
promote human health, and bridge the technological gap among nations.  
   
8.  We will work together to address the challenges of climate change,
natural disasters, and environmental degradation, collaborating on
science-based, innovative solutions to advance our shared goals,
including averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage; building
climate resilience; promoting the conservation and sustainable use of
marine biological diversity and marine ecosystems; mitigating marine
pollution, including plastic pollution and underwater noise; and
protecting human health.   
   
9.  We reaffirm our commitment to uphold international law, including
the UN Charter, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to
promote an open Atlantic in which Atlantic States are free from
interference, coercion, or aggressive action.  We commit to uphold the
principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, political
independence of States, and the settlement of international disputes by
peaceful means and the purpose to develop friendly relations among
nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights, and
self-determination of peoples.  We seek to promote the Atlantic as a
place of peace, stability, prosperity, and cooperation.  
   
10.  We emphasize the centrality of coordination, cooperation, and
complementarity in our work, embrace solidarity of purpose, support
diversity, enable increased capacity, strive for inclusion, equity and
mutual benefit, and avoid duplication and fragmentation of effort.  
   
11.  We are determined to establish and strengthen collaborative action
on specific topics where cooperation from the entire Atlantic evolves at
the pace partners deem appropriate, is centered on their needs, and is
mutually beneficial.  We will prioritize actions that yield concrete
benefits for Atlantic States and are better addressed with actions
encompassing both the north and south Atlantic States, taking into
account the different capabilities, vulnerabilities, and realities of
States bordering the Atlantic Ocean.  
   
12.  We aim to build on existing initiatives and actively support their
work in bringing all Atlantic States together to play an equal part in
shaping our common future, including recognizing valuable work of and
improving collaboration and coordination with the existing organizations
and initiatives focused specifically on strengthening Atlantic
cooperation, including the Zone of Peace and Cooperation in the South
Atlantic, the Yaoundé Architecture for Maritime Security (YAMS), the
Atlantic Centre, the Air Centre, the African Atlantic States Process
(AASP), the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance
(AAORIA), as well as the additional work underway on a global level,
such as the UN SDGs/2030 Agenda, the Global Biodiversity Framework, the
agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological
diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), the UN Decade of
Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, and others.   
  
13.  As a demonstration of these cooperative relationships and our
commitment to achieving our common goals in the region, we join together
to establish a forum and adopt the annexed Plan of Action.  This forum,
the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, will provide a means to
promote cooperation and interaction exclusively on science and
technology and sustainable economic development among Atlantic States in
a spirit of inclusivity, trust, mutual understanding, and respect.  The
Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation will not deal with matters related
to defense, security, and governance. Participation will be voluntary
and open to the States bordering the Atlantic Ocean that endorse the
goals and principles as embodied in the September 20, 2022 Joint
Statement on Atlantic Cooperation and this Declaration.  Decisions will
be made by consensus and be based on a commitment to open dialogue and
consensus-building, with equal respect for the views of all participants
and for the unique characteristics of the South Atlantic, which is a
zone of peace and cooperation.<sup>\[1\]</sup>  We intend to meet as
appropriate to promote such cooperation.  Participating Atlantic States
will determine arrangements for organizing the work of this forum,
including implementing the Plan of Action, as needed.     
   
14.  This Declaration and the annexed Plan of Action represent the
political commitments of the participants and are not an international
agreement. 

**Annex:  Plan of Action**

1.  Through the adoption of a Declaration, the Partnership for Atlantic
Cooperation provides a forum to promote cooperation and interaction
among States bordering the Atlantic Ocean and to uphold principles for
Atlantic cooperation.  Its work will proceed at both a high level for
strategic policy and at the expert level to advance specific issues,
with actions taken by States individually, in smaller groups, or by the
entire group.    
   
2.  Participating Atlantic States plan to cooperate on activities that
would i) yield concrete benefits for Atlantic States; ii) promote the
involvement and support of a maximum number of Atlantic States; iii)
would be better addressed with resources and actions encompassing
northern and southern Atlantic States; and iv) add value to, enhance, or
broaden the scope of other initiatives, where they exist, to avoid
duplication of effort.  
   
3.  Participating Atlantic States identified the following initial topic
area for its work:  
Promoting greater scientific cooperation by sharing information,
building capacity, and increasing access to technology on voluntary and
mutually agreed terms.  
   
Within this broad topic area, work could include:   
   
A.  Scientific cooperation and shared research and environmental
observations and ocean data:

-   Promote science and technology cooperation, including data sharing
    and sharing of best practices, on coastal ecosystems, marine plastic
    pollution, Sargassum, estuarine invasive weeds, prevention and
    response to ocean-related environmental disasters, and food
    security, taking into account the needs of coastal communities.
-   Expand and broaden participation in select AAORIA activities.
-   Strengthen forecasting and early warning capabilities, particularly
    regarding severe weather events.

B.  Information and maritime awareness

-   Identify the most critical gaps in capacity and technology.
-   Increase access to maritime domain awareness technology, including
    the transfer of know-how and technology on voluntary and mutually
    agreed terms.

C.  Cadre of young Atlantic scientists

-   Establish a scholarship and exchange program to foster excellence
    and to build ties among the next generation of scientists.

4.  Participation in this initiative is voluntary and will take into
account the different capabilities, vulnerabilities, and realities of
Atlantic States.  Any participating State can propose a topic for a
working group.  Participation in working groups is voluntary.  Those
States that wish to participate in a working group will designate focal
points.  Working groups will be responsible for convening participants,
developing a workplan and timeline, and ensuring the activity is
developed in close coordination with existing initiatives.  Working
groups may invite external partners, including academics, civil society,
philanthropies, and the private sector, to contribute as observers,
subject to consensus of the group.  All decisions in and about working
groups should be made by consensus.  As determined by participants,
working groups will regularly report progress and recommendations to
Ministers to monitor implementation, ensure coordination, and mobilize
the necessary resources.   

5.  Anticipated next steps will include:

-   Inviting participating Atlantic States to identify focal points to
    participate in topic-focused working groups.
-   Convening working groups to scope the issue and determine next
    steps.
-   Convening a Senior Officials Meeting in November 2023.
