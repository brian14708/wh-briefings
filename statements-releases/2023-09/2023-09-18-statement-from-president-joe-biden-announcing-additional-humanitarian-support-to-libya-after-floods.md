title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Announcing Additional Humanitarian Support\
  \ to Libya After\_Floods"
---
 
Today—as the people of eastern Libya continue to recover and rebuild in
the aftermath of catastrophic flooding— the United States will provide
an additional $11 million to local and international organizations
responding to their urgent humanitarian needs. The Department of State
and USAID will help coordinate the delivery of this aid to the people
who need it most, joining the concerted efforts of nations and
non-profits around the world providing critical support such as water,
food, shelter, and medical assistance. And—as the United States
continues to stand with the Libyan people during this difficult hour—we
remain committed to supporting a political path toward a unified, freely
and fairly elected government in Libya that can effectively respond to
its people’s needs.
