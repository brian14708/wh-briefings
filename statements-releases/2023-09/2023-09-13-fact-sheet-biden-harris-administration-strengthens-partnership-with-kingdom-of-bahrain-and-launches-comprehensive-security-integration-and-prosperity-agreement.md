title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Strengthens Partnership with\
  \ Kingdom of Bahrain and Launches \u201CComprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity\_\
  Agreement\u201D"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that the United
States will strengthen its strategic partnership with the Kingdom of
Bahrain during a visit to Washington by His Royal Highness the Crown
Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.
Bahrain is one of the United States of America’s longest and closest
partners in the Middle East, host to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, a
Major Non-NATO Ally, and a Major Security Partner.  To build on these
ties, the Administration is launching the “Comprehensive Security
Integration and Prosperity Agreement” (C-SIPA) with Bahrain – a new
framework to promote cooperation across a range of areas, from defense
and security to science, technology, and trade.  The Crown Prince’s
visit to Washington is the culmination of nearly a year’s worth of
diplomatic engagement, including multiple trips to Manama by senior U.S.
officials, and follows on the Crown Prince’s visit to Washington in 2022
and his bilateral meeting with Vice President Harris.  
  
At the Jeddah Summit in July 2022, the President outlined his broad and
affirmative vision for a Middle East that is more secure, prosperous,
and integrated both regionally and with the world economy.  C-SIPA
further advances that vision by formalizing cooperation to deter
conflict in the region, enhance regional stability, de-escalate
tensions, and bolster trade and economic cooperation – including through
the development and deployment of advanced technologies with trusted
vendors.  This agreement follows the announcement last week at the G20
of a transformational economic corridor between India, the Middle East,
and Europe, the development of which will open unprecedented
opportunities for the Gulf region, which serves as an economic engine
and gateway between continents.  The United States is pleased to
finalize C-SIPA and is poised to begin its implementation in earnest.  
  
**Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement**  
  
Secretary Blinken and Crown Prince/Prime Minister Salman today signed
C-SIPA in an official ceremony at the State Department.  This new
bilateral agreement can serve as a cornerstone for cooperation among a
broader grouping of countries that share mutual interests and a common
vision with respect to deterrence, diplomacy, security and economic
integration, and de-escalation of conflicts in the Middle East region. 
C-SIPA is the latest manifestation of the United States’ enduring
commitment to Bahrain and to the region in support of peace and shared
prosperity.  
  
After two decades of major conflicts in the Middle East region, the
American people benefit from a region that is more peaceful, more
secure, and more integrated internally and with the broader global
economy.  Our partnership under C-SIPA will deliver on that goal by:

-   Enhancing deterrence, including through expanded defense and
    security cooperation, interoperability, and mutual intelligence
    capacity-building.  C-SIPA will help formalize steps being taken by
    U.S. Central Command to integrate the region’s air and missile
    defense systems and increase maritime domain awareness, among other
    initiatives;  
-   Promoting cooperation on trade and investment, building on the
    existing U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement;  
-   Encouraging investments in global supply chain resilience and
    infrastructure; and  
-   Promoting the development and deployment of trusted technologies,
    including in digital and Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) infrastructure supply chains, to support secure and resilient
    global telecommunications networks. C-SIPA is the first binding U.S.
    international agreement of its kind to promote cooperation in
    developing and deploying trusted technologies – a critical feature
    of today’s international security environment.

**U.S.-Bahrain Strategic Partnership**  
  
The United States established official relations with Bahrain in 1971,
but America’s cultural and social ties with Bahrain go back to the
nineteenth century and the arrival of American missionaries who built a
school, hospital, and church – all of which are still in operation
today.  Since then, Bahrain has become one of the United States’ closest
partners in the Middle East region.  
  
*Defense and Security Cooperation*

-   Bahrain hosts the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet (one of seven numbered
    fleets around the world) and the headquarters of the U.S. Naval
    Forces Central Command (NAVCENT).  Bahrain hosts thousands of U.S.
    service members and is the only country in the U.S. Central Command
    region to host military spouses and families.  It also hosts and is
    a member of the 38-nation Combined Maritime Forces and the 11-member
    International Maritime Security Construct.  The U.S. military’s
    presence in Bahrain dates back to World War II.  This presence has
    advanced U.S. interests by keeping vital commercial shipping lanes
    safe, deterring threats, and enabling broader coalitions to
    operate.  
-   Bahrain was the first Gulf country to receive F-16s in the 1990s. 
    In March 2023, Bahrain took delivery of the first of 16 F-16
    Block-70 fighter jets.  In doing so, it becomes the first customer
    to receive the latest generation Block 70 aircraft, a purchase that
    will nearly double the size of Bahrain’s F-16 fleet.  
-   Bahrain was the first regional partner to work with the U.S. Navy on
    integrating new unmanned systems and artificial intelligence after
    NAVCENT established Task Force 59 in September 2021.  Last year,
    Bahrain committed to partnering with regional countries and the
    United States to build a multinational fleet of 100 unmanned surface
    vessels.  
-   NAVCENT and Bahrain conduct an annual large-scale bilateral military
    exercise with a specific focus on the maritime domain.  The next
    iteration of this exercise, DIAMOND DEFENDER 2024, will focus on
    maritime domain awareness, as well as command, control and
    communication, while integrating manned and unmanned capabilities.  
-   Bahrain has been a Major Non-NATO Ally since 2002 and a Major
    Security Partner since 2021.  C-SIPA will provide an important
    avenue for enhancing this historic record of defense and security
    cooperation between our countries.

*Regional Integration Collaboration*

-   Bahrain has been instrumental in supporting a regional vision of
    de-escalation and broader integration, including within the Gulf
    Cooperation Council and other countries in the Middle East region.  
-   Bahrain will benefit from the India-Middle East-Europe Economic
    Corridor that was announced at the recent G20 meeting in India, with
    a vision to connect ports and rail lines across continents to open
    new markets and enhance trade throughout the region.   
-   Bahrain normalized relations with Israel in 2020 and has welcomed a
    series of senior Israel leaders, business people, healthcare
    experts, and youth to Bahrain.  
-   More recently, the Negev Forum has brought together Arabs and
    Israelis, including the largest gathering since the 1990s, to deepen
    existing areas of cooperation and explore new ones.  Bahrain
    co-chairs with the United States the Negev Forum’s Regional Security
    and Health Working Groups.  
-   In 2021, Bahrain inaugurated direct flights to Israel’s primary
    airport, Ben Gurion International Airport, further enhancing
    people-to-people ties.

*Commercial and Economic Ties*

-   Bahrain is a valued economic partner, and a Free Trade Agreement
    with the United States entered into force in 2006.  Since then,
    bilateral trade has more than tripled from $780 million to nearly $3
    billion last year.  
-   Last year, Bahrain inaugurated a U.S. Trade Zone where U.S.
    companies can develop new products and reach untapped markets,
    adding to supply chain resiliency.  During the Crown Prince’s visit,
    both sides welcomed the chance to identify strategic investment
    opportunities that benefit the United States and Bahrain in areas
    such as global supply chain resilience, diversification, and
    critical infrastructure – including through “friendshoring” with
    trusted allies and partners.   
-   During the Crown Prince’s visit, both countries have set a target
    for launching direct flights between the United States and Bahrain
    by summer 2024.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will begin
    work with the Bahrain Civil Aviation Authority this month to prepare
    for a safety assessment that, if successful, will pave the way for
    direct flights between the two countries.  
-   Bahrain’s Gulf Air has purchased twelve Boeing 787 Dreamliner
    aircraft to service long-haul routes, including three configured to
    serve routes to the United States.  Boeing has already delivered
    eight aircraft and two more are scheduled for delivery this fall,
    with the rest to be delivered in the coming years.  
-   Both sides committed during the visit to exploring ways of
    cooperating on commercial, advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) as
    part of Bahrain’s clean energy transition.  SMRs are a key part of
    the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of addressing the climate
    crisis through the accelerated deployment of innovative, zero-carbon
    technologies.  
-   In 2022, Bahrain became the first “Global Entry” partner country in
    the region with U.S. Customs and Border Control.  Since then, many
    Bahraini travelers have qualified for expedited, secure travel to
    the United States.  To qualify for Global Entry, Bahrain had to meet
    stringent security standards, exemplifying our longstanding
    partnership of trust.

*Governance and Human Rights*

-   Human rights are a key part of the U.S.-Bahrain Strategic Dialogue,
    as well as an integral part of the President’s National Security
    Strategy.  The most recent Strategic Dialogue took place in July
    2023, and was co-chaired by Secretary Blinken and Bahraini Foreign
    Minister Zayani.  This format has enabled both countries to engage
    in constructive dialogue on the importance of universal values,
    human rights, and fundamental freedoms.  Promoting human rights was
    also an important topic of discussion during the Crown Prince-Prime
    Minister’s visit to Washington this week.
