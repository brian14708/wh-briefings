U.S. officials have secured the return of Private Travis King from the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). We appreciate the
dedication of the interagency team that has worked tirelessly out of
concern for Private King’s wellbeing. In addition, we thank the
government of Sweden for its diplomatic role serving as the protecting
power for the United States in the DPRK and the government of the
People’s Republic of China for its assistance in facilitating the
transit of Private King.
