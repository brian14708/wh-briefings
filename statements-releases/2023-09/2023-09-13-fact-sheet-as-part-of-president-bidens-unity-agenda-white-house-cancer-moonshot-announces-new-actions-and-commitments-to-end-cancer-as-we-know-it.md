title: "FACT SHEET: As Part of President\_Biden\u2019s Unity Agenda, White\_House\
  \ Cancer Moonshot Announces New Actions and Commitments to End Cancer as We Know\_\
  It"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will convene a
meeting of the Cancer Cabinet to announce new actions federal agencies
are taking to advance the mission of the White House Cancer Moonshot, as
well as new commitments the Biden-Harris Administration has secured from
non-governmental organizations and the private sector to deliver
progress on the mission to end cancer as we know it.  
  
Last year, the President and First Lady reignited the Cancer Moonshot
with the goals of reducing the cancer death rate in the United States by
at least half—preventing more than 4 million cancer deaths—by 2047 and
improving the experience of people who are touched by cancer. The
President also established a Cancer Cabinet to mobilize the entire
Biden-Harris Administration in pursuit of these ambitious goals. In the
time since, the Cancer Moonshot has announced roughly 50 new programs,
policies, and resources and secured more than 100 commitments from
private companies, non-profit organizations, patient groups, and more
toward the President’s and First Lady’s goals.  
  
Accelerating the fight against cancer is a core component of the
President’s Unity Agenda, a set of priorities that Americans from every
walk of life can support. In his State of the Union address earlier this
year, President Biden laid out a bold vision to advance his Unity
Agenda, including the work of the Cancer Moonshot, specifically by
driving innovation that changes patient outcomes, providing support to
families as they navigate a cancer diagnosis, and preventing cancer by
tackling the biggest single driver of cancer deaths in this
country—smoking. Today’s actions build on the progress the Cancer
Moonshot has delivered since then, and at today’s Cancer Cabinet
meeting, the President and First Lady will hear from Cabinet leaders on
the progress made and the important work ahead.  
  
**<u>Today’s announcements from the Biden Cancer Moonshot include:</u>**

-   **$240 million in additional investment this year to accelerate new
    ways to prevent, detect, treat, and survive cancer.** The Advanced
    Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) will award an
    additional $240 million to researchers and innovators this year for
    cancer-related projects. This includes projects to develop new tools
    to detect cancers early, when cancers are most treatable; produce
    innovative approaches to visualize cancer cells during surgery to
    improve patient outcomes through the Precision Surgical
    Interventions program; pursue new treatment approaches, like
    directing bacteria to kill cancer inside the body; and design
    devices that could deliver treatments directly to cancer cells to
    treat tumors more effectively.  
-   **A new “biomedical data fabric toolbox” to advance cancer research
    progress.** ARPA-H is partnering with the National Institutes of
    Health, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and other agencies to
    develop a new Biomedical Data Fabric Toolbox for Cancer. Starting
    with cancer datasets, this program represents the first step toward
    transforming data accessibility across all medical domains,
    promising a future of boundless possibilities in health innovation.
    Today, cancer research data is collected across thousands of
    research labs, clinical care organizations, and numerous other
    sources; these entities all store their datasets differently, making
    it difficult for cancer researchers to leverage the full potential
    of massive amounts of data that exist. This initiative will pioneer
    prototype technologies capable of seamlessly searching cancer
    datasets to reveal opportunities for groundbreaking disease
    detection, prevention, and treatment, reduce the time needed to
    integrate new data sources from months to days, and improve data
    usability by the research community—so we can break down existing
    data siloes and learn from the experiences of more patients. This
    project will help bring America’s cancer research system into the
    21<sup>st</sup> century by transforming our health care system for
    cancer into a learning system, ensuring that knowledge gained
    through research is available to as many experts as possible, and
    delivering discovery and breakthroughs to patients sooner.
-   **A new nationwide health innovation network to bring cancer
    clinical trials to underserved communities and drive research
    progress.** ARPA-H is announcing that its new ARPANET-H, a
    nationwide health innovation network to tackle pressing health
    challenges, will be deployed to accelerate clinical trials for
    cancer and other diseases. This new network will reach all 50 states
    and the District of Columbia, and create a continuous feedback loop
    with patients, providers, researchers, and others that improves the
    goals, reach, and data sharing capabilities across ARPA-H programs
    to foster breakthrough collaborations and advance equitable health
    outcomes. ARPANET-H will comprise Customer Experience, Investor
    Catalyst, and Stakeholder and Operations hubs, along with a network
    of supporting spokes that connect local organizations, health
    providers, companies, and others to ARPA-H’s work. This new network
    will enable historically underserved populations to actively
    participate in clinical trials, improve equity in access to
    innovative cancer interventions and accelerate the agency’s work to
    drive breakthroughs in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer
    and other diseases.  
-   **New investments to reduce the impact of menthol and other flavored
    commercial tobacco products in communities that experience health
    disparities.** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is
    announcing awardees of a new five-year, $15 million program to help
    increase adoption, implementation, and enforcement of policies
    prohibiting the sale of menthol and other flavored tobacco products
    and increase awareness of cessation services and coverage options
    among populations experiencing tobacco-related disparities in order
    to accelerate smoking cessation.  
-   **A new award recognizing community health centers for exceptional
    performance and high clinical quality in cancer screenings.** The
    Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is launching a
    new National Quality Leader (NQL) – Cancer Screening Badge.
    Federally qualified community health centers that meet two or more
    of the Healthy People 2030 breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer
    screening targets in their annual Uniform Data System performance
    report will receive the new [NQL – Cancer Screening
    Badge](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/initiatives/advancing-health-center-excellence/community-health-quality-recognition-chqr-overview/cancer-screening-badge).
    This badge, which will be awarded annually, was created in support
    of the Cancer Moonshot’s call to action on cancer screening, and
    highlights the critical role health centers play in providing
    historically medically underserved, high-need communities with
    access to lifesaving cancer screenings. In 2022, community health
    centers—which provide comprehensive, high-quality primary health
    care services tailored to their communities regardless of their
    patients’ ability to pay—served more than 30 million patients
    nationwide.  
-   **A new plan to decrease the impact of smoking on Americans’ health
    by expanding efforts to prevent smoking and to support everyone who
    wants to quit.** While the United States has made important
    progress, smoking remains the biggest single driver of cancer deaths
    in the country. To ensure Americans who want to quit have the
    support they need, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    will finalize its Framework to Support and Accelerate Smoking
    Cessation this year. This Framework, which was developed with public
    input, will be a roadmap for enhancing collaboration and
    coordination across HHS—and with federal agencies and
    non-governmental organizations—to equitably accelerate smoking
    cessation progress, with a specific focus on communities
    disproportionately impacted by tobacco use.  
-   **New smoking cessation resources for underserved communities,
    including American Indian, Alaska Native, and Black communities, to
    reduce cancer health disparities.** NCI’s SmokeFree.gov initiative
    is extending a partnership with the Indian Health Service to
    collaborate with experts from the University of Minnesota School of
    Public Health and the American Indian Cancer Foundation to launch
    SmokeFreeNative, a text messaging program to help American Indian
    and Alaska Native adolescents and adults quit smoking, while
    honoring the significance of traditional tobacco. Additionally, NCI
    is launching digital resources this fall on
    [www.smokefree.gov](http://www.smokefree.gov) to encourage and help
    people who smoke menthol cigarettes to quit. These resources were
    created to address barriers to quitting in communities that
    experience disparities caused by menthol cigarette use, with a
    particular focus on Black communities.   
-   **A new pilot program to increase veteran engagement in tobacco use
    treatment.** The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in
    collaboration with NCI, will conduct a clinical demonstration
    project to assess how to more effectively engage veterans in
    tobacco-use treatment programs. This clinical demonstration project
    will be implemented in the next year across a subset of Veterans
    Integrated Services Network clinical resource hubs and aims to
    address the high rates of tobacco use among veterans with mental
    health disorders and address gaps in the provision of treatment
    across facilities.  
-   **New resources and actions to reduce exposures to environmental
    carcinogens.** The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is
    launching
    [epa.gov/cancer](/Users/RLSmith/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/TI7UWMJR/epa.gov/cancer),
    with new information and prominently featured resources from EPA and
    other federal agencies about secondhand smoke, smoking cessation,
    and other cancer-related topics. New regulatory efforts, through
    rules and standards in progress, will regulate unreasonable cancer
    risks associated with carcinogenic chemicals under statutes
    including the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water
    Act, and the Clean Air Act. EPA will also continue to leverage its
    existing authorities under our nation’s bedrock health and
    environmental laws to accelerate the rate of progress to prevent
    cancer, including phase-outs of carcinogens, regulatory actions to
    protect children, workers and overburdened communities, and
    enforcement actions to ensure pollution is curbed. The
    Administration’s efforts to fight cancer linked with environmental
    exposure also advance President Biden’s commitment to environmental
    justice for all.  
-   **Leveraging research in space to fight cancer on earth and
    amplifying awareness on cancer screening.** NASA’s Division for
    Biological and Physical Sciences, in partnership with the
    International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory, will fund
    several projects to advance cancer research and technology to take
    place in-orbit on the ISS. Projects will aim to develop new cancer
    treatments, broaden research advancements, foster new
    collaborations, and accelerate biomanufacturing. Additionally, NASA
    is piloting early cancer screening education videos, partnering with
    VA to drive targeted education on lung cancer screening for
    veterans.  
-   **A new partnership to further understanding of the impact cancer
    has on America’s veterans.** In alignment with the Sergeant First
    Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive
    Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, VA and NCI are announcing a new
    partnership to develop a two-way exchange process to collect more
    data on cancers in VA patients. This process will allow NCI’s
    Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the
    VA cancer registry to work together to gain crucial insights on
    veteran cancer diagnoses and treatments, while maintaining and
    protecting veteran privacy. Prior to this effort, data exchange was
    sporadic and incomplete, resulting in a lack of complete information
    on cancer in this important population. This collaboration will help
    us better understand—and ultimately treat—cancer among veterans and
    all Americans.  
-   **An expansion of virtual cancer care for America’s veterans.** VA
    is announcing that it is adding more than 30 new sites to its VA
    National TeleOncology program, which provides resources and staff
    support through partnerships with VA medical centers nationwide.
    This program makes highly specialized care, like virtual tumor
    boards for multiple cancers, available to veterans, in particular,
    living in rural locations.

**The Cancer Moonshot is also announcing the following new commitments
from non-governmental organizations:**

-   **The American Cancer Society (ACS) will create a new oncology
    professional navigator curricula and certification program**. In
    2024, the ACS, with input from key partners, will lead the creation
    and implementation of a standardized national curricula for
    professional, non-clinician navigators to support people with
    cancer. Navigation by trained professionals in clinical settings is
    an integral component to improving cancer outcomes in the United
    States, helping to ensure every cancer patient has access to timely,
    quality, and culturally competent care, especially in historically
    marginalized communities. Additionally, ACS with will work with key
    partners to establish new programs such as navigator certification
    to support evaluation and adherence to best practices that align
    with improved outcomes.  
-   **The HealthWell Foundation will** **provide more than $300 million
    in 2024 to underinsured oncology patients to offset out-of-pocket
    medication costs.** This will enable these patients to adhere to
    prescribed treatment regimens, and improve survival. In 2024,
    HealthWell will also start providing financial assistance to address
    disparities in oncology clinical trials and to support oncology
    caregivers—self-funding $500,000 for the program.   
-   **The African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council (AATCLC)
    is launching a coordinated effort to make Emotional Brain Training
    (EBT) services available for stress management and smoking
    cessation.** In collaboration with the University of California, San
    Francisco Smoking Cessation Leadership Center, AATCLC will launch a
    coordinated effort within three months to promote the use of a free
    app for anyone new to EBT to gain easily scalable, rapid-acting
    tools to assist with smoking cessation. EBT has shown long-term
    effectiveness in treating stress overload, as well as mood and
    addictive behaviors including smoking.  
-   **CVS Health will be launching an** **expanded smoking cessation
    program in a dozen states**. In addition to their currently offered
    smoking cessation and counseling, CVS Health will launch a
    comprehensive smoking cessation assessment, prescribing and
    counseling program at its retail pharmacies in 12 states, further
    increasing patient access to smoking cessation care. Combined with
    its expanding digital capabilities, CVS Health will be able to reach
    patients in their neighborhoods, helping address health disparities
    and breaking down barriers to care, building on their commitment to
    not sell tobacco products.  
-   **Komodo Health, a health data and technology startup, is announcing
    a new platform to measure cancer disease burden, map cancer
    outcomes, and illuminate disparities in cancer care.** Over the next
    two years, this effort will deliver insights to help public health
    officials, government agencies, and patient advocacy organizations
    to directly support efforts to close the screening gap and decrease
    the impact of preventable cancers. Built on more than 330 million
    patient experiences, Komodo’s platform can be used to spotlight gaps
    in care, identify disparities in disease burden, and understand the
    impact of cancer on discrete patient populations. This research will
    enable public and private partners to direct resources to reduce the
    burdens of lung cancer.  
-   **The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) will invest more than $17
    million to bring clinical trials and treatment innovation to diverse
    and underrepresented communities across the country.** For example,
    LLS is expanding its Influential Medicine Providing Access to
    Clinical Trials (IMPACT) Research Grant Program to include seven
    major, geographically diverse cancer centers and surrounding local
    cancer care delivery settings, to bring blood cancer treatment
    studies into more communities. As part of the investment, LLS’s
    Equity in Access Research Program will spend $2.5 million withing
    the next year to initiate multi-year studies addressing systemic,
    institutional, clinician, and patient-related barriers to trial
    participation. In the next five years, LLS aims to improve the speed
    of innovation and expand equitable access to treatments that have
    the potential to increase blood cancer patients’ quality of life and
    survival.   
-   **TOUCH, the Black Breast Cancer Alliance, will bolster Black
    women’s breast cancer clinical trial participation by 2025
    committing to reaching 350,000 Black women and motivating 25,000
    into trial portals.** Additionally, TOUCH Care, the first program to
    provide a nurse navigator service to assist Black breast cancer
    patients in clinical trials by developing culturally-agile
    recruiting materials, training trial staff, and coaching patients,
    is being piloted with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, and
    will add five trials annually. Less than three percent of breast
    cancer clinical trial participants are Black.   
-   **xCures, a health-data technology platform, is launching a study to
    enhance the collection and organization of comprehensive data for
    Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) and Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
    (DIPG).** The study will streamline and standardize data gathering
    and identify patterns that can predict disease progression and
    treatment response, leading to more personalized treatment plans and
    targeted therapies. xCures pledges to maintain the data
    infrastructure for this study, and to make the data freely available
    to academic and government researchers. This will improve access and
    collaboration, with the ultimate goal of bringing innovation to more
    patients and providing a better understanding of these deadly
    cancers.  
-   **The DIPG DMG Research Funding Alliance is launching an online hub
    to support pediatric brain cancer patients from diagnosis through
    treatment and grief support.** This hub, DIPG OneLink, will provide
    entry to two complementary data registry studies by the Children
    Brain Tumor Network and xCures, enrolling 250 DIPG/DMG patients in
    2023 and expanding to over 700 patients by the end of 2024. The
    project will collect, store, and harmonize clinical records,
    imaging, and multiomics information that will be readily accessible
    to families and researchers.  
-   **The Focused Ultrasound Foundation (FUSF) is committing more than
    $3 million over the next three years for clinical trials exploring
    focused ultrasound as part of cancer treatment.** In partnership
    with the Cancer Research Institute and the Parker Institute for
    Cancer Immunotherapy, FUSF has defined a roadmap to move towards
    clinical adoption of focused ultrasound and cancer immunotherapy
    combination treatments in glioblastoma, diffuse midline glioma,
    pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and pediatric solid
    tumors. In addition, and in partnership with Arms Wide Open, FUSF
    will co-fund a preclinical research project exploring focused
    ultrasound for neuroblastoma.     
-   **The National Brain Tumor Society (NBTS) is launching a
    comprehensive effort to** **advance quality of life (QoL) research
    for people facing brain tumors.** NBTS will create a new QoL
    Research Agenda, the first of its kind in the brain tumor space.
    This work will foster strong patient, clinician, researcher, and
    industry partnerships to support future QoL research, and NBTS will
    formally launch its QoL research funding agenda in early 2024.  
-   **The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) will launch a national
    initiative to increase skin cancer awareness and early detection
    among firefighters.** To protect first responders from the impacts
    of their unique exposure to carcinogenic chemicals, AAD will partner
    with fire stations and firefighter support organizations to educate
    them on the importance of early detection. To date, volunteer
    dermatologists have conducted screenings with over 2,700 local
    firefighters and volunteers in six states, including California,
    Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, with the program
    expanding nationwide in 2024.    
-   **The National LGBT Cancer Network is making tailored tobacco
    cessation materials more readily available.** LGBTQIA+ communities
    use commercial tobacco products at rates 49 percent higher than the
    general population, but there is a dearth of tailored cessation
    materials for these communities. Building on its community tailored
    website and a series of social media shareables, the National LGBT
    Cancer Network is creating at least six LGBTQIA+ tailored,
    print-based tobacco cessation materials, and will launch a
    print-on-demand store with all these materials available in the next
    year. The National LGBT Cancer Network will work with stakeholders
    like the North American Quitline Consortium, NCI-designated cancer
    centers, and community members to ensure these materials are
    compelling and motivational, and widely promote their availability.
