---
 
Jill and I send our deepest condolences to all the families who have
lost loved ones in the devastating floods in Libya.  In this difficult
hour, the United States is sending emergency funds to relief
organizations and coordinating with the Libyan authorities and the UN to
provide additional support.  We join the Libyan people in grieving the
loss of too many lives cut short, and send our hope to all those missing
loved ones.
