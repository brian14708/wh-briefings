Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
spoke on the phone today with Prime Minister of Kosovo Albin Kurti.  Mr.
Sullivan conveyed condolences for the loss of the Kosovo police officer
slain in the line of duty during the violent attacks that took place on
September 24.  He also expressed concern about Serbian military
mobilizations near the Kosovo border.  He noted recent decisions by NATO
to bolster the NATO Kosovo Force’s (KFOR) presence and activity,
especially in northern Kosovo, and underscored the readiness of the
United States to work with our Allies to ensure KFOR remained
appropriately resourced to fulfill its mission.  In addition, Mr.
Sullivan and Prime Minister Kurti discussed the EU-facilitated Dialogue
between Kosovo and Serbia, which Mr. Sullivan underscored was the only
long-term solution to ensuring stability throughout Kosovo.
