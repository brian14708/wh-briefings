title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Launches American Climate Corps\
  \ to Train Young People in Clean Energy, Conservation, and Climate Resilience Skills,\
  \ Create Good-Paying Jobs and Tackle the Climate\_Crisis"
---
 
*In its first year, the American Climate Corps will put more than 20,000
young people on career pathways in the growing fields of clean energy,
conservation and climate resilience*

Since taking office, President Biden has delivered on the most ambitious
climate, clean energy, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in
history – signing into law the largest investment in climate action
ever, protecting more than 21 million acres of public lands and water,
and advancing the Justice40 Initiative, which directs 40 percent of the
benefits from key federal investments to disadvantaged communities. As
part of this historic commitment to tackle the climate crisis, President
Biden promised to mobilize the next generation of clean energy,
conservation and resilience workers.

**Today, through his Investing in America agenda, President Biden is
delivering on that commitment by taking executive action to launch the
American Climate Corps** – a workforce training and service initiative
that will ensure more young people have access to the skills-based
training necessary for good-paying careers in the clean energy and
climate resilience economy. The American Climate Corps will mobilize a
new, diverse generation of more than 20,000 Americans – putting them to
work conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community
resilience, deploying clean energy, implementing energy efficient
technologies, and advancing environmental justice, all while creating
pathways to high-quality, good-paying clean energy and climate
resilience jobs in the public and private sectors after they complete
their paid training program.

The American Climate Corps will focus on equity and environmental
justice – prioritizing communities traditionally left behind, including
energy communities that powered our nation for generations, leveraging
the talents of all members of our society, and prioritizing projects
that help meet the [Administration’s Justice40
goal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).
Additionally, President Biden is calling on Tribal, State, and local
governments, labor unions, nonprofit service allies, the private sector,
and philanthropy to collaborate with the Federal government to expand
skills-based training partnerships to ensure our nation has the
workforce necessary to meet our climate goals. In fact, just today, five
new states are launching their own Climate Corps, which will work as
implementing collaborators of the American Climate Corps. With today’s
announcement, ten states will have launched Climate Corps since 2021.

Additionally, the White House is launching a new website where anyone
interested in joining or supporting the American Climate Corps can sign
up to learn more:
[www.whitehouse.gov/climatecorps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/climatecorps).

The American Climate Corps will:

-   **Train young people in clean energy, conservation and climate
    resilience related skills:** The American Climate Corps is a new
    initiative that will provide the next generation of Americans with
    job training and service opportunities to work on a wide range of
    projects that tackle climate change – including restoring coastal
    wetlands to protect communities from storm surges and flooding,
    deploying clean energy, managing forests to improve health and
    prevent catastrophic wildfires, implementing energy efficient
    solutions to cut energy bills for hardworking families, and more.
    All American Climate Corps programs will be paid experiences that
    adhere to a common set of programmatic standards, and provide
    pathways to high-quality employment opportunities in the public and
    private sectors. No prior experience is required for most positions.
    Through the American Climate Corps, federal departments and
    agencies, will build upon existing relationships to ensure that all
    young people have the chance to participate in these
    opportunities.  
-   **Coordinate Recruitment Across Federal Programs:** In the coming
    months, to facilitate a streamlined experience for American Climate
    Corps participants, the Federal government will launch a dedicated
    American Climate Corps recruitment website, where participants can
    learn about and apply for opportunities in their community and
    organizations can learn how to work with American Climate Corps
    members. Moreover, to ensure Federal agencies are working together
    to implement the American Climate Corps, the Department of Labor,
    Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Energy, and
    AmeriCorps will sign a memorandum of understanding to formalize this
    new initiative, and AmeriCorps will stand up a new “American Climate
    Corps hub,” which will support the American Climate Corps.  
-   **Expand AmeriCorps Segal Education Awards Access:** Today,
    President Biden is encouraging the Chief Executive Officer of
    AmeriCorps to consider expanding access to Segal AmeriCorps
    Education Awards to American Climate Corps members conducting
    national service work. Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards can be used
    by AmeriCorps members after completing their service to pay for
    post-secondary education and training or to reduce their student
    debt.  
-   **Streamline Pathways into Civil Service:** The Office of Personnel
    Management (OPM) has issued a [proposed
    rulemaking](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2023-17372.pdf?utm_source=federalregister.gov&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list)
    that could, if finalized, create a streamlined pathway into federal
    service for federally-supported national, state, local, or Tribal
    service programs, including American Climate Corps programs.  
-   **Leverage Tribal, State and Local Governments:** Five states across
    the country, including California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, and
    Washington, have already launched successful climate corps programs,
    demonstrating the power of skills-based training as a tool to expand
    pathways into good-paying jobs. Today, five new states – Arizona,
    Utah, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Maryland – are moving forward
    with state-based climate corps that are funded through
    public-private partnerships, including AmeriCorps, which will work
    with the American Climate Corps as implementing collaborators to
    ensure young people across the country are serving their
    communities, while participating in paid opportunities and working
    on projects to tackle climate change.

Today’s announcement builds on nearly $500 million of Biden-Harris
Administration investments to expand pathways into good-paying union
jobs by
[prioritizing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/17/fact-sheet-biden-administration-to-take-steps-to-bolster-registered-apprenticeships/)
Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship programs, including in
clean energy and other climate-focused careers. To continue building on
this historic agenda, the Administration is:

-   **Investing in Pre-Apprenticeships and Registered Apprenticeships
    through the Department of Labor:** Earlier this year the Department
    of Labor YouthBuild program [awarded $90 million to
    grantees](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20230428-0),
    including supporting pre-apprenticeships that will educate and train
    young people in green initiatives. And the Department of Labor
    supported a historic [$20M cooperative
    agreement](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20230306)
    with the TradesFutures, a non-profit working to develop, promote and
    improve Apprenticeship Readiness Programs, to advance equitable
    opportunities in construction trades. TradesFutures seeks to enroll
    more than 13,000 participants in pre-apprenticeship readiness
    programs – giving them hands-on learning experience and skill
    development – and expects to subsequently place at least 7,000 of
    them into Registered Apprenticeships in the construction industry.  
-   **Investing in Pre-Apprenticeship Programs through the Department of
    Energy**: Today, the Department of Energy’s [Career Skills Training
    Program](https://www.energy.gov/scep/career-skills-training-program#:~:text=The%20Career%20Skills%20Training%20Program%20is%20designed%20to,industry-related%20certification%20to%20install%20energy%20efficient%20building%20technologies.)
    announced $10 million to provide grants to pay the Federal share of
    career skills training programs under which students concurrently
    receive classroom instruction and on-the-job training for the
    purpose of obtaining an industry-related certification to install
    energy efficient building technologies. Additionally, just this
    week, DOE hosted the inaugural meeting of the 21<sup>st</sup>
    Century Energy Workforce Advisory Board, which is charged with
    advising the Secretary of Energy in developing a strategy for the
    Department of Energy to support and develop a skilled energy
    workforce, including—among other goals—prioritizing effective
    education and job training for underrepresented groups and
    socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals.  
-   **Expanding National Service Opportunities to Advance our Wildfire
    Crisis Strategy:** Today, AmeriCorps and U.S. Forest Service
    launched Forest Corps – a five-year $15 million agreement, and the
    first major interagency partnership under President Biden’s American
    Climate Corps. Beginning next summer, this program will engage 80
    young adults, ages 18-26, in wildland fire prevention,
    reforestation, and other natural and cultural resource management
    projects to support the U.S. Forest Service’s Wildfire Crisis
    Strategy and Reforestation Strategy. Consistent with President
    Biden’s call for Congress to increase the AmeriCorps living
    allowance, AmeriCorps NCCC Forest Corps members will receive a
    compensation package equivalent to $15 an hour, including lodging,
    transportation, clothing, a living allowance, health benefit, and
    more. Members will receive extensive training, hands-on-experience,
    and leadership skills for future careers in natural resource
    management, forest health, and climate resilience at the U.S Forest
    Service or other organizations.

-   **Expanding the Indian Youth Service Corps:** This week the
    Department of the Interior announced a $15 million commitment
    through President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda to expand the
    Indian Youth Service Corps and other programs supporting the next
    generation of conservation and climate stewards. This effort will be
    facilitated in collaboration with the Office of Strategic
    Partnerships, which was launched during the 2022 White House Tribal
    Nations Summit to assist with building partnerships, leveraging
    resources, and promoting innovative solutions for Indian Country.
    With funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Interior
    Department will expand the capacity of the Corps and similar
    projects serving underserved communities by 30 percent, reaching
    over 5,000 young people. The expanded programs will work with
    federally recognized Tribes and Tribal organizations as well as
    programs serving the U.S. territories, the Native Hawaiian
    Community, and urban communities across the United States.
