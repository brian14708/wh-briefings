title: "Readout of White\_House and Department of Agriculture Roundtable on Climate-Smart\
  \ Agriculture and Forestry with Agriculture, Conservation, and Environmental Organizations"
---
 
Yesterday, the White House and the Department of Agriculture convened a
roundtable with leaders from 15 agriculture, conservation, and
environmental organizations to discuss President Biden’s historic
investments in climate-smart agriculture and forestry through the
Inflation Reduction Act and Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities.
America’s farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners play a critical role
in addressing the climate crisis through the deployment of climate-smart
practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase storage of
carbon in soils and trees, improve land and forest health through
conservation and restoration, and create new revenue streams. Recent
investments provide a historic opportunity to scale up the
implementation of these climate solutions while also supporting our
rural communities and creating new economic opportunities for farmers
and rural communities.

Participants stressed the importance of ensuring these tools work for
operations of all sizes, and address barriers to access and ensure
equity in program delivery. Officials sought feedback from participants
on the implementation of these investments and the work their
organizations and partners are doing to implement and scale up
climate-smart agriculture and forestry solutions. Administration
officials and stakeholders mutually agreed that in order to build a
stronger rural economy and address the climate crisis through
agriculture and forestry solutions, solutions should be locally led,
innovative, and driven by the latest science. The discussion also
highlighted the critical role of efforts to measure, monitor, report,
and verify the carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions
reductions resulting from these efforts.

The discussion emphasized the importance of protecting the Inflation
Reduction Act investments and ensuring the continued availability of
funds and assistance because of their positive impact on farm income,
among other reasons. Participants highlighted the importance of
technical assistance and staffing to support the implementation of
climate-smart practices and systems, as well as the economic
opportunities created through this assistance, especially in the face of
extreme drought, storms, fires, and other pressures. Officials closed
the meeting by reiterating the President’s commitment to investing in
farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners and advancing climate-smart
solutions and thanked participants for their engagement and feedback.
