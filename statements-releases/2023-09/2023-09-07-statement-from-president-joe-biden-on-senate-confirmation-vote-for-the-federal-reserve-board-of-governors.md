title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Confirmation Vote for the Federal\
  \ Reserve Board of\_Governors"
---
 
“I applaud the Senate for confirming my superbly qualified nominees to
the Federal Reserve Board of Governors on a bipartisan basis. In the
past year, inflation has come down by around two-thirds, while the job
market has remained historically strong, and I am confident that Dr.
Jefferson, Dr. Cook, and Dr. Kugler will help continue this progress. My
Administration remains laser focused on bringing costs down for families
while maintaining the world-beating economic growth that America has
experienced in the last two-plus years.  
  
With the confirmation of these outstanding economists to the Federal
Reserve, the American people can be confident that the Fed’s important
mission remains in good hands, and it will continue working for them,
not any partisan agenda.”  
  
*Dr. Jefferson will be only the second-ever Black Vice Chair of the
Federal Reserve Board. Dr. Cook was the first-ever Black woman on the
Federal Reserve Board, and has now been confirmed to a full 14-year
term. Dr. Kugler will make history as the first-ever Hispanic American
to serve on the Federal Reserve Board.*
