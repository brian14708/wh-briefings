We, the Leaders of India, Brazil, South Africa, and the United States,
met on the margins of the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi to reaffirm
our shared commitment to the G20 as the premier forum for international
economic cooperation to deliver solutions for our shared world.

As the G20’s current and next three Presidencies, we will build on the
historic progress of India’s G20 Presidency to address global
challenges. In this spirit, together with the World Bank President, we
welcome the G20’s commitment to build better, bigger, and more effective
multilateral development banks. This commitment underscores what we can
do, by working together through the G20, to support our people toward a
better future.
