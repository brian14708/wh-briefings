title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Senate\u2019s Bipartisan\
  \ Bill to Prevent an Extreme Republican\_Shutdown"
---
 
The Senate’s bipartisan continuing resolution will keep the government
open, make a down payment on disaster relief, and is an important show
of support for Ukraine. House Republicans should join the Senate in
doing their job, stop playing political games with peoples’ lives, and
abide by the bipartisan deal two-thirds of them voted for in May.
