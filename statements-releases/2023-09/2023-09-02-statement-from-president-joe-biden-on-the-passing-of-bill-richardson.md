title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden On the Passing of Bill\_Richardson"
---
 
Bill Richardson wore many weighty titles in his life – Congressman,
Governor, Ambassador, Secretary. He seized every chance to serve and met
every new challenge with joy, determined to do the most good for his
country, his beloved New Mexico, and Americans around the world. Few
have served our nation in as many capacities or with as much
relentlessness, creativity, and good cheer. He will be deeply missed.  
   
Bill’s legacy will endure in many places – in New Mexico, which Bill
served for seven terms as congressman and two as governor; at the
Department of Energy, where he helped strengthen America’s nuclear
security; and at the United Nations, where he put his considerable
negotiating skills to work advocating for American interests and values
on the world stage.  
   
But perhaps his most lasting legacy will be the work Bill did to free
Americans held in some of the most dangerous places on Earth. American
pilots captured by North Korea, American workers held by Saddam Hussein,
Red Cross workers imprisoned by Sudanese rebels – these are just some of
the dozens of people that Bill helped bring home. He’d meet with anyone,
fly anywhere, do whatever it took. The multiple Nobel Peace Prize
nominations he received are a testament to his ceaseless pursuit of
freedom for Americans. So is the profound gratitude that countless
families feel today for the former governor who helped reunite them with
their loved ones.  
   
Bill and I crossed paths for the first time decades ago, when he was a
staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which I served on as
Senator. Over the years, I saw firsthand his passion for politics, love
for America, and unflagging belief that, with respect and good faith,
people can come together across any difference, no matter how vast. He
was a patriot and true original, and will not be forgotten. Jill and I
send our love to his family, including his wife of over 50 years,
Barbara.
