title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on District Court\u2019\
  s Ruling on\_DACA"
---
 
We are deeply disappointed in today’s DACA ruling from the District
Court in Southern Texas. On day one of his Administration, President
Biden issued a memorandum directing the federal government to take all
appropriate actions to “preserve and fortify” the DACA
policy. Consistent with that directive, the Administration has defended
the DACA policy from legal challenges, and issued a final rule codifying
this longstanding policy. During this Administration, hundreds of
thousands of DACA recipients have been able to live and work lawfully in
our country without fear of deportation. 

As we have long maintained, we disagree with the District Court’s
conclusion that DACA is unlawful, and will continue to defend this
critical policy from legal challenges. While we do so, consistent with
the court’s order, DHS will continue to process renewals for current
DACA recipients and DHS may continue to accept DACA applications.

We are committed to protecting all the Dreamers who have throughout
their lives enriched our communities and our country, and we continue to
call on Congress to provide permanent protection to the hundreds of
thousands of Dreamers in the United States.
