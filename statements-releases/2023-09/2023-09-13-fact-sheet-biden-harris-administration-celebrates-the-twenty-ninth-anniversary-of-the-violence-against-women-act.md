title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Celebrates the Twenty-Ninth\
  \ Anniversary of the Violence Against Women\_Act"
---
 
Today, on the anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the
Biden-Harris Administration marks the progress we have made through VAWA
to transform the United States’ response to sexual assault, domestic
violence, dating violence, and stalking. President Biden’s commitment to
preventing and addressing gender-based violence has remained a
cornerstone of his career—from the initial passage of VAWA twenty-nine
years ago to, in 2023 alone, implementing historic [bipartisan military
justice
reform](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/) and
issuing the first-ever [U.S. National
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/National-Plan-to-End-GBV.pdf) to
End Gender-Based Violence.  
  
Since he first championed VAWA in 1994, President Biden has worked
across the aisle to reauthorize and strengthen this critical
legislation. With each reauthorization, VAWA has been expanded to
improve safety and support for all survivors, increase prevention
efforts, and inspire social change that will ensure all people are able
to live free from violence.  
  
Most recently, President Biden signed the [VAWA Reauthorization Act of
2022](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-reauthorization-of-the-violence-against-women-act-vawa/) and
secured the highest-ever funding level for VAWA implementation. Over the
last year, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to implement
changes that were passed as part of the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022
by:

-   **Distributing record funding to states, Tribes, and territories for
    local prosecutors, law enforcement, and victim advocates to support
    survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and
    stalking. ** Funding for the Department of Justice, Office on
    Violence Against Women (OVW), established formula grants that have
    increased funding markedly—for critical programs such as the
    Services, Training, Officers, and Prosecutors Violence Against Women
    Formula Grant Program; the Sexual Assault Services Grant Program;
    and the Rural Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence,
    and Stalking Program.  These funds will contribute to efforts to
    support victims and advance justice in communities across our
    Nation.   
     
-   **Expanding special Tribal criminal jurisdiction with support to
    Native communities.  **The VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 expanded
    special Tribal criminal jurisdiction (STCJ) to cover non-Native
    perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, stalking, sex
    trafficking, and assaults on Tribal law enforcement officers on
    Tribal lands. It also authorized a pilot project to enhance access
    to safety for survivors in Alaska Native villages. The Department of
    Justice moved quickly to identify and deploy resources to support
    Tribal implementation of STCJ, including by issuing or announcing
    awards for new technical assistance and to establish an
    Alaska-specific Intertribal Technical Assistance Working Group. OVW
    also issued an interim final rule to reimburse Tribes for expenses
    incurred in exercising STCJ, which will permit OVW to administer the
    Tribal Reimbursement Program starting in 2024.  
     
-   **Increasing culturally-specific resources and support for survivors
    and communities. **The VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 increased
    services and support for survivors from underserved and marginalized
    communities—including for LGBTQI+ survivors of domestic violence,
    dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. OVW is supporting
    organizations to maintain and replicate existing successful
    LGBTQI+-specific services, including through two additional
    LGBTQI+-specific projects through the Grants for Outreach and
    Services to Underserved Populations Program.  
     
-   **Addressing online harassment and abuse and combatting
    cybercrimes.  **Complementing the
    Administration’s [efforts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/03/executive-summary-initial-blueprint-for-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/) to
    promote online safety through the [Task Force to Address Online
    Harassment and
    Abuse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/16/fact-sheet-presidential-memorandum-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/),
    the bipartisan year-end omnibus allocated $8 million to implement
    initiatives addressing cybercrimes, including two programs newly
    authorized by the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022.   
    -   To better support State, Tribal, and local law enforcement,
        prosecutors, and judicial personnel, OVW is working to establish
        the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals,
        to assist victims of cybercrimes.  
         
    -   A $1 million grant will be released by OVW  along with a
        solicitation, to launch a technical assistance project on the
        prosecution and investigation of online abuse and harassment.   
         
    -   DOJ’s Office of Access to Justice, in consultation with OVW,
        will work to raise awareness through United States Attorneys’
        Offices about the new federal civil cause of action for the
        non-consensual distribution of [intimate
        images](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/readout-of-white-house-state-legislative-convening-on-non-consensually-distributed-intimate-images/),
        passed into law in VAWA 2022.  
         
-   **Promoting prevention and strengthening services for survivors of
    sexual assault. **The VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 improves
    prevention and response to sexual violence, including through
    increased support for the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) Rape Prevention and Education Program and Sexual
    Assault Services Program and enactment of the Fairness for Rape Kit
    Backlog Survivors Act, which requires state victim compensation
    programs to allow sexual assault survivors to file for compensation
    without being unfairly penalized due to rape kit backlogs. DOJ
    awarded $51.8 million—a nearly 45% increase in funding from the
    previous year—to provide victims of sexual assault with services in
    every state and the District of Columbia, as well as American Samoa,
    Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico,
    and the Virgin Islands.  
     
-   **Addressing the nexus between firearms and domestic
    violence. ** The VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 strengthened
    protections for domestic violence survivors at risk of experiencing
    gun violence, and established a historic restorative justice grant
    program, offering survivors alternative approaches to healing and
    justice. President
    Biden [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-13-new-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence-by-maximizing-the-benefits-of-the-bipartisan-safer-communities-act/) the
    Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which narrowed the “boyfriend
    loophole” by helping to keep guns out of the hands of domestic
    abusers. DOJ is training federal law enforcement and educating state
    and local law enforcement and prosecutors on this historic change.
    And the FBI is reporting denied transactions of firearm purchases,
    fully implementing the NICS Denial Notification Act, which helped
    state law enforcement investigate and prosecute cases against
    individuals legally prohibited from purchasing firearms who try to
    do so.  
     
-   **Expanding options for survivors to hold offenders
    accountable.** VAWA established a historic restorative justice grant
    program, offering survivors alternative approaches to healing and
    justice. Recognizing that survivors and communities need more tools
    to hold offenders accountable and allow survivors to rebuild their
    lives, OVW released a solicitation to offer training and technical
    support to implement restorative practices, as defined in the VAWA
    Reauthorization Act of 2022.
