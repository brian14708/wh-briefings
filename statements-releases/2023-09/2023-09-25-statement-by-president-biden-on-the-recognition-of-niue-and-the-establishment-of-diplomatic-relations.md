  \ of Diplomatic\_Relations"

Today, I am proud to announce that the United States recognizes Niue as
a sovereign and independent state and will establish diplomatic
relations between our two nations.

Niue plays a critical and constructive role in the Pacific, including
supporting the region’s sustainable development, security, and marine
protection and ocean conservation. Today’s announcement will enable us
to deepen our cooperation with Niue on these challenges and more—from
tackling the climate crisis, to protecting maritime borders and marine
resources, to building sustainable economic growth, to maintaining a
free and open Indo-Pacific region.

The United States plans to work closely with Niue, the Pacific Islands
Forum, and the Pacific Community to bolster Pacific regionalism.
Together, we intend to align the objectives of the United States’
first-ever Pacific Partnership Strategy with the Pacific’s own
priorities as embodied in the Pacific Islands Forum 2050 Strategy for
the Blue Pacific Continent. And, the United States looks forward to
participating in the upcoming PIF Leaders’ Summit to support Pacific
voices, Pacific choices, and the Pacific way. 

Since day one of my Administration, I have been committed to being an
active and engaged partner in the Pacific. Last year, I launched our
first-ever national strategy dedicated to the Pacific Islands. I
appointed the first US Envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum. We held the
first US-Pacific Islands Summit. And today we are meeting with the full
Pacific Islands Forum at the White House for the first time. Today’s
recognition of Niue—and the establishment of diplomatic relations—will
not only further strengthen our bonds in the region, it will help forge
the shared future we seek—one of greater security, prosperity, and
dignity for all.
