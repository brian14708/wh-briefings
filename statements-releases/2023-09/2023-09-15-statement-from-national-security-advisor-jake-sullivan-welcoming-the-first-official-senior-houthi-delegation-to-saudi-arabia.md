title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Welcoming The First\
  \ Official Senior Houthi Delegation to Saudi\_Arabia"

We welcome the arrival of a senior Houthi delegation to Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. This is the first official visit by Houthi representatives to
Riyadh since the war in Yemen began nearly a decade ago. It comes after
nearly 18 straight months of calm that began after a UN-mediated truce
first went into effect on April 2, 2022. President Biden, from his first
weeks in office, has made de-escalating and ending the war in Yemen one
of his top foreign policy priorities. The United States has been proud
to lend our diplomatic support to these peace efforts in coordination
with the Yemeni parties and the United Nations. We commend the
leadership of Saudi Arabia for this current initiative and thank the
leadership of Oman for its important role. We call on all parties to
this terrible conflict to further solidify and expand on the benefits of
the truce that has brought a measure of peace to the Yemeni people, and
ultimately bring this war to an end.
