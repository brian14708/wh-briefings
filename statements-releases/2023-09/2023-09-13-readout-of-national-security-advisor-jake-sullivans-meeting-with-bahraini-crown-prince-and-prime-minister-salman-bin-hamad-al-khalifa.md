  \ Crown Prince and Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad Al\_Khalifa"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with the Crown Prince and
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain, His Royal Highness Salman bin
Hamad Al Khalifa, at the White House today to discuss a range of
bilateral, regional, and global issues.  Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the
United States’ enduring commitment to Bahrain’s security and thanked the
Crown Prince for Bahrain’s steadfast partnership – including hosting the
U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet and the headquarters of U.S. Naval Forces
Central Command.  

Both sides welcomed the signing today of the “Comprehensive Security
Integration and Prosperity Agreement” (C-SIPA), a landmark new framework
for enhancing cooperation across a range of areas – from defense and
intelligence to advanced technology and trade and investment.  C-SIPA
will serve as a cornerstone for enhanced bilateral cooperation between
the United States and Bahrain, and is in line with President Biden’s
vision for a more stable and prosperous Middle East region forged
through security and economic integration between allies and partners. 
Mr. Sullivan and the Crown Prince-Prime Minister pledged to stay in
regular contact in the coming weeks and months to oversee implementation
of the agreement.  They also welcomed the announcement at the G-20 of
the India-Middle-East-Europe-Economic Corridor, a game-changing
initiative under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure, which
promises significant benefits for countries across the Middle East
region.  They also engaged in constructive dialogue on the importance of
universal values, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.

Both delegations discussed opportunities to strengthen economic and
commercial ties under C-SIPA, including a target of summer 2024 to
launch direct flights between the United States and Bahrain.  They also
discussed exploring bilateral cooperation on the development of
commercial advanced small modular reactors – a key element in the
Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of deploying innovative, zero-carbon
technologies.

The Crown Prince and his team also participated in a bilateral
technology dialogue with senior U.S. officials at the White House today
to explore ways of deepening cooperation on critical and emerging
technologies, including artificial intelligence.
