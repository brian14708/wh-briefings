title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on House Republicans\u2019\
  \ Extreme 30%\_Cuts"
---
 
Extreme House Republicans are now tripling down on their demands to
eviscerate programs millions of hardworking families count on—proposing
a devastating 30% cut to law enforcement, Meals on Wheels, Head Start,
and more. They are breaking their word, abandoning the bipartisan deal
that two-thirds of them voted for just four months ago, and marching our
country toward an Extreme Republican Shutdown that will damage our
economy and national security. The path forward to fund the government
has been laid out by the Senate with bipartisan support—House
Republicans just need to take it.
