title: "Joint Leader Statement to Mark the Second Anniversary of\_AUKUS"
---
 
Today, we, the leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United
States mark the second anniversary of the announcement of AUKUS.    
   
The first major initiative of AUKUS was our decision to support
Australia’s acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered
submarines (SSNs).  In March 2023, we stood together in San Diego and
announced the pathway to deliver on this commitment — an ambitious plan
that will strengthen our combined military capabilities, boost our
industrial capacity, and enhance our ability to deter aggression in the
Indo-Pacific.  Our nations continue to deliver on these goals; the first
Australian military personnel graduated from the U.S. nuclear power
school in July and the USS North Carolina completed the first SSN port
visit to Australia as part of AUKUS in August.  We continue to engage
openly and transparently with the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) and remain committed to an approach that sets the highest
non-proliferation standard.  We welcome commencement of Australia’s
bilateral negotiations with the IAEA on an arrangement pursuant to
Article 14 of Australia’s Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement.  
   
We have also deepened our cooperation on advanced capabilities.  Two
years ago our nations pledged to foster deeper integration of our
scientists, industrial bases, and supply chains as part of AUKUS.  Since
then, we have launched an ambitious proposal to streamline defense
collaboration among our nations while strengthening our ability to
protect the sensitive technologies that underpin our security.  We will
act with purpose to develop and produce the capabilities that will
matter most in the future; our plans to modernize defense trade set in
place a foundation on which we will build those capabilities.  We
continue to make progress across our current capability development
programs, including holding the first demonstration of AUKUS artificial
intelligence and autonomous capabilities in the United Kingdom.  As our
work progresses on these and other critical defense and security
capabilities, we will seek opportunities to engage allies and close
partners.  
   
As democracies, our legislatures have an important role to play to
oversee and enable our progress.  We are committed to working with them,
and look forward to historic action that will empower AUKUS’s success,
including authorizing the necessary legislation to implement our
submarine cooperation and modernize our defense trade systems while
strengthening our ability to protect critical technologies.  
   
Our work under AUKUS reflects our continued commitment to supporting a
free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable.  Australia, the
United Kingdom, and the United States have a long history of working
together, along with other allies and partners, to uphold the
rules-based international order where human rights and the rule of law
are respected, and states can make sovereign choices free from
coercion.  Today, as we mark the second anniversary of AUKUS, we
recommit ourselves to these values and look forward to continued
progress as our nations stand together to help sustain peace, stability,
and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.
