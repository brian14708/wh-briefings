title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Senator Dianne\_Feinstein"
---
 
Senator Dianne Feinstein was a pioneering American. A true trailblazer.
And for Jill and me, a cherished friend.  
  
In San Francisco, she showed enormous poise and courage in the wake of
tragedy, and became a powerful voice for American values. Serving in the
Senate together for more than 15 years, I had a front row seat to what
Dianne was able to accomplish. It’s why I recruited her to serve on the
Judiciary Committee when I was Chairman – I knew what she was made of,
and I wanted her on our team. There’s no better example of her skillful
legislating and sheer force of will than when she turned passion into
purpose, and led the fight to ban assault weapons. Dianne made her mark
on everything from national security to the environment to protecting
civil liberties. She’s made history in so many ways, and our country
will benefit from her legacy for generations.  
  
Often the only woman in the room, Dianne was a role model for so many
Americans – a job she took seriously by mentoring countless public
servants, many of whom now serve in my Administration. She had an
immense impact on younger female leaders for whom she generously opened
doors. Dianne was tough, sharp, always prepared, and never pulled a
punch, but she was also a kind and loyal friend, and that’s what Jill
and I will miss the most.  
  
As we mourn with her daughter Katherine and the Feinstein family, her
team in the Senate, and the people of California, we take comfort that
Dianne is reunited again with her beloved Richard. May God Bless Dianne
Feinstein.
