  19\_Vaccines"

Since entering office, my Administration has made historic progress in
our ability to manage COVID-19 so that it no longer meaningfully
disrupts our lives. Today marks another important milestone. Following
an independent scientific review, the Food and Drug Administration and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now
authorized, approved, and recommended everyone 6 months and older get an
updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against serious illness this fall
and winter.  
   
Today’s announcement also means that we now have immunizations for all
three major seasonal respiratory viruses – COVID-19, flu, and RSV. As we
head into fall and winter, we are in our strongest position yet with
more tools and systems available than ever before – including safe and
effective vaccines, widely available at-home tests, and effective
treatments.  
   
Vaccination against COVID-19 remains the most important protection in
avoiding hospitalization, long-term health complications, and death. I
encourage all Americans to stay up-to-date on their vaccines.
