title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Student Debt Relief Action for University\
  \ of Phoenix\_Borrowers"
---
 
On Day One of my Administration, I promised to fight for hardworking
families and to fix problems in the student loan system that have been
failing borrowers for too long. As part of that effort, my
Administration has approved over $117 billion in debt relief to over 3.4
million borrowers, including over $14 billion in relief for 1.1 million
borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them or closed abruptly.  
   
Today, my Administration approved another $37 million in debt
cancellation for over 1,200 borrowers who were deceived by the
University of Phoenix. These borrowers were cheated into believing that
by attending the University of Phoenix they would have promising career
prospects at Fortune 500 companies – yet those benefits and
opportunities never existed.    
   
My Administration won’t stand for colleges taking advantage of
hardworking students and borrowers. As long as I am President, we will
never stop fighting to deliver relief to borrowers who are entitled to
it – like those who attended University of Phoenix – and we will hold
colleges accountable for misleading and cheating their students.    
   
Today’s actions come on top of all we’ve been able to achieve for
students and student loan borrowers in the past few years.  This
includes: achieving the largest increases in Pell Grants in over a
decade; fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that
borrowers who go into public service get the debt relief they’re
entitled to under the law; and creating the most generous Income-Driven
Repayment plan in history, called
[SAVE](http://www.studentaid.gov/save). And, we’re not done. As I
announced earlier this year in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision
on our student debt relief plan, we will continue to pursue an
alternative path to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as
possible as quickly as possible. We will use every tool at our disposal
to get student loan borrowers the relief they need to reach their
dreams.
