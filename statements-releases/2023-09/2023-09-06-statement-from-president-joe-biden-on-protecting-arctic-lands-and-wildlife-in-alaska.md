title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Protecting Arctic Lands and Wildlife\
  \ in\_Alaska"
---
 
Alaska is home to many of America’s most breathtaking natural wonders
and culturally significant areas. As the climate crisis warms the Arctic
more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, we have a
responsibility to protect this treasured region for all ages. Canceling
all remaining oil and gas leases issued under the previous
administration in the Arctic Refuge and protecting more than 13 million
acres in the Western Arctic will help preserve our Arctic lands and
wildlife, while honoring the culture, history, and enduring wisdom of
Alaska Natives who have lived on these lands since time immemorial. From
day one, I have delivered on the most ambitious climate and conservation
agenda in our country’s history. But there is more to do, and my
administration will continue to take bold action to meet the urgency of
the climate crisis and to protect our lands and waters for generations
to come.
