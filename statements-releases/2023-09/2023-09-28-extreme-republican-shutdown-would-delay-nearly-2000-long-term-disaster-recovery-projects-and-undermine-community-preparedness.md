title: "Extreme Republican Shutdown Would Delay Nearly 2,000 Long-Term Disaster Recovery\
  \ Projects and Undermine Community\_Preparedness"
---
 
With just days left before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House
Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples’ lives and marching
our country toward a government shutdown that would have damaging
impacts across the country—including delaying long-term disaster
recovery and undermining preparedness in communities across the country.
Their partisan approach stands in stark contrast to the Senate’s
bipartisan progress towards keeping the government open and making a
down payment on disaster relief funding.  
  
As the Administration has continued to call on Congress to provide
disaster relief funding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s
Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) continues to dwindle and is now forced to
prioritize only immediate lifesaving and life sustaining operations. An
Extreme Republican Shutdown would leave the DRF underfunded—delaying
nearly 2,000 long-term recovery projects in communities across the
country. For example, Wilson County School in Tennessee would continue
being unable to push forward with rebuilding due to a deadly tornado
that left 100 teachers and 1,000 students without classrooms. In New
Jersey, millions of dollars meant to help rebuild a senior citizen
building following Hurricane Ida would remain frozen. And in Florida,
hundreds of millions of dollars of Hurricane Ian recovery obligations
would continue to be delayed. 

An Extreme Republican Shutdown would also undermine communities’
preparedness by preventing fire departments from accessing funding
necessary to retain firefighters and purchase equipment, halting first
responder training, and jeopardizing access to grants for disaster and
terrorism preparedness.  
  
The reason these disaster recovery and preparedness priorities are now
at risk: extreme House Republicans’ relentless efforts to slash funding
for vital programs rather than work in a bipartisan manner to keep the
government open and address emergency needs for the American people.
House Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal
that two-thirds of them voted for just a few months ago and instead
proposed a continuing resolution (CR) that proposes [devastating
cuts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/19/by-the-numbers-impacts-of-house-republicans-extreme-cr-8-cuts/) to
programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on—including to
FEMA. Their extreme CR also fails to provide the urgent funding
President Biden requested for FEMA’s DRF.
