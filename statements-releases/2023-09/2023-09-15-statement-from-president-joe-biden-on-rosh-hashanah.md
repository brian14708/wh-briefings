title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden On Rosh\_Hashanah"
---
 
Tonight at sundown, Jewish communities in the United States and around
the world will celebrate Rosh Hashanah – the Day of Judgment, the
anniversary of the creation of the world, and the start of a Jewish new
year.  
   
Throughout the High Holidays – commencing with Rosh Hashanah, continuing
through the 10 Days of Repentance, and concluding on Yom Kippur – the
stirring sound of the *shofar* calls us to examine our character and
conduct. Heartfelt prayers invite us to repair our relationship with
each other, with ourselves, and with God. And the *tashlich* ritual,
that symbolizes casting away our sins, inspires us to learn from our
mistakes and commit to doing better in the future.  
   
During this spiritual time of reflection and atonement, we are also
uplifted by the hope a new year brings. As Jewish families gather around
the table, and apples are joyfully dipped in honey, we are reminded that
it is never too late to change and begin anew.  Our actions have the
power to shift the balance of our fate, our nation, and our world.  
   
I’ve always believed that the message of Rosh Hashanah is universal. As
Americans, the power lies within each of us to make our country more
free and fair, to transform the story of our time, and to heal the soul
of our nation.  
   
Throughout the High Holidays and in the year ahead, let us summon the
courage to reflect on who we are and extend compassion, love, and
kindness to all. Let us celebrate and protect generations of Jewish
Americans whose values, culture, and contributions have shaped our
character as a nation, and enriched every part of American life. And let
us remember the common values that bind us together as fellow
Americans.  
   
Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to all those celebrating Rosh
Hashanah in the United States, Israel, and around the world.  
   
May we all be inscribed in the Book of Life.  
   
May it be a happy, healthy, and sweet New Year.  
   
Shana Tovah U’Metukah.
