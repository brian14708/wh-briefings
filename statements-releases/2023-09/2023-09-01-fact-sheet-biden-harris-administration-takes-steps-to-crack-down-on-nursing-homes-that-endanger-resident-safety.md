  \ Nursing Homes that Endanger Resident\_Safety"
---
 
*Biden Administration Delivers on the President’s State of the Union
Promise with Proposed Federal Minimum Staffing Requirements, Tougher
Enforcement Initiatives, and Efforts to Expand Nursing Workforce*

The nursing home industry receives nearly $100 billion annually from
American taxpayers, yet too many nursing homes chronically understaff
their facilities—resulting in poor, substandard care that endangers
residents. When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be
forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths,
or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours.

Residents also suffer avoidable injuries like falls and bedsores.
Workers become burnt out from the daily struggle to deliver the quality
care they know their residents deserve. During the pandemic, over
[200,000 nursing home residents and
workers](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/over-200000-residents-and-staff-in-long-term-care-facilities-have-died-from-covid-19/)
died—around one-fifth of all COVID-19 deaths in the United States.

President Biden is committed to building a long-term care system where
all seniors can age with dignity, where people with disabilities can
receive high-quality services and supports in the setting of their
choice, and where there is a pipeline of direct care workers into
good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union. In his
[State of the Union
address](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/),
President Biden pledged that his Administration would “protect seniors’
lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit
fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.”

In April, President Biden signed an [Executive Order on Increasing
Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting
Caregivers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/),
a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers,
direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with
disabilities, and aging loved ones. The Executive Order carries forward
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) actions to [enhance access
to home and community-based
services](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/ensuring-access-medicaid-services-cms-2442-p-notice-proposed-rulemaking),
raise wages for and retain direct care workers, help residents [smoothly
transition back
home](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/long-term-services-supports/money-follows-person/index.html)
from nursing homes, and advance a [government-wide strategy to lift up
family caregivers.](https://acl.gov/CaregiverStrategy) It also builds on
the [President’s 2024
budget](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2024-budget-in-brief.pdf)
request for a $150 billion transformative investment in home care.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is following through on the
President’s commitment to nursing home residents and their families. HHS
is announcing important new steps to crack down on nursing homes that
endanger resident safety:

-   **The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing a
    rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels, so that nursing
    home owners could not slash staffing to unsafe levels.** If
    finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a
    Registered Nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of
    registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and
    to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of
    the facility’s residents. To ensure affected nursing homes have
    ample time to hire necessary staff, CMS is proposing that the
    minimum staffing requirements go into effect in phases.  
-   To improve nursing home safety in the short-term, **CMS** **is also
    announcing new efforts to improve enforcement of existing staffing
    standards, which currently require nursing homes to provide
    “sufficient” staffing and eight hours per day of Registered Nurse
    care.** These actions will help address substandard care and
    strengthen accountability even before the new minimum staffing
    requirements come into effect.  
-   The **HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) is also
    undertaking important oversight of nursing home performance**,
    examining nursing home spending of taxpayer funds, inappropriate
    prescribing of antipsychotic medications, and emergency preparedness
    planning by facilities.

In addition, HHS is announcing new steps to help expand the nursing
workforce:

-   **CMS, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services
    Administration (HRSA), is announcing a national nursing career
    pathways campaign.** The campaign will help recruit, train, retain,
    and transition workers into nursing home careers as nursing staff.
    **This plan will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition
    reimbursement**.

Today’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration over
the past few years to support nursing home residents and workers. These
efforts also align with the Administration’s continued support for care
at home, including significant investments in [home and community-based
services](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html).

**Setting a Minimum Federal Floor for Safe Levels of Nursing Home
Staffing**

Staffing levels at nursing homes are closely linked to quality of care.
For instance, a study of one state’s nursing facilities showed that even
a [20-minute
increase](https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jgs.16689)
in staffing per resident day from a Registered Nurse was associated with
22% fewer cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-related deaths in
nursing homes. Other studies similarly find that higher staffing is
associated with better quality of patient care and patient health
outcomes. Chronic understaffing [disproportionately
affects](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0094)
facilities serving a higher share of residents from certain racial and
ethnic groups. In recent years, there has been a disturbing trend
towards private equity firms and other large corporate owners
[purchasing nursing
homes](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-increase-transparency-nursing-home)
and slashing levels of staff as a way to maximize profits.

Research suggests the result is more illness and more deaths in those
homes. For example, [a working
paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28474/w28474.pdf) examining
18,000 nursing home facilities between 2000 and 2017 found that private
equity ownership increased excess mortality for residents by 10%,
increased prescription of antipsychotic drugs for residents by 50%,
decreased hours of frontline nursing staffing by 3%, and increased
taxpayer spending per resident by 11%. The study implies an additional
20,150 lives lost as a result of private equity ownership.

Based on a multi-faceted approach aimed at determining the minimum level
and type of staffing needed to ensure long-term care facilities have a
workforce sufficient for resident safety and well-being, **CMSis
proposing a rule to set a federal floor for staffing levels.** Under the
proposed rule, if finalized:

-   Nursing facilities must have a Registered Nurse on site
    around-the-clock. The academic literature has repeatedly found that
    having a trained professional on site 24/7 is important for
    improving nursing home safety. Under the proposal, 22% of nursing
    homes would have to hire Registered Nurses to meet this
    requirement.  
-   In addition to having at least one Registered Nurse full-time,
    nursing homes must provide at least .55 hours (33 minutes) per
    resident day of care from a Registered Nurse, exceeding standards in
    nearly all states. Staffing hours per resident per day are the total
    number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total
    number of residents. This means that a facility with 100 residents
    would be required to provide a total of 55 Registered Nurse hours
    over the course of a day. If broken out into 8-hour shifts, this
    would mean having two Registered Nurses on staff for each 8-hour
    shift, and a third Registered Nurse for one shift during the day.
    Under the proposal, 36% of nursing homes would have to hire
    Registered Nurses to meet the hours per resident day standard after
    accounting for Registered Nurses hired for the 24/7 requirement.  
-   Nurse aides are especially critical to safe, quality care. These
    workers help residents with basic tasks of daily living, like
    eating, bathing, and going to the bathroom. Under the proposal,
    nursing homes must provide 2.45 hours (2 hours and 27 minutes) per
    resident day of care from nurse aides, exceeding standards in all
    states. This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides
    per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents. Under the
    proposal, 68% of nursing homes would have to hire nurse aides to
    meet this requirement.

When accounting for average hours currently worked by other types of
workers that are not covered by these standards, this translates to
expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day.  

The proposal also makes clear that the numerical staffing levels are a
floor—not a ceiling—for safe staffing. Under the proposal, nursing homes
would have to undertake a robust assessment of their particular
facility, including consulting with workers and their representatives,
to determine whether higher levels of staffing and what staff
competencies are needed to meet the needs of their particular resident
population. Nursing homes caring for residents with more acute needs may
well have to hire more workers than the minimum standards in order to
provide a safe environment. In addition, state laws with higher staffing
requirements would not be preempted.

The federal minimum staffing standards proposed by CMS are robust yet
achievable. For example, non-profit nursing homes are about three times
as likely as for-profit homes to already provide staffing at or above
the proposed levels. We recognize that nursing homes in rural areas may
face greater challenges and require greater time to hire additional
workforce. To ensure that affected nursing homes have ample time to
identify and hire the necessary workers, the proposed rule would give
most nursing homes three years to meet the new standard for nurses and
nurse aides, and nursing homes located in rural areas would have five
years to meet the new standards. To meet the requirement for a
Registered Nurse on site 24/7, rural facilities would have three years
and all other facilities would have two years.

The proposal includes possible hardship exemptions from the minimum
staffing requirements. The need for an exemption must be proven with
documentation that demonstrates meaningful efforts to hire workers at
prevailing wages, as well as demonstrated financial investments in
staffing.

The proposal also increases transparency about how taxpayer dollars are
being spent. If finalized as proposed, state Medicaid agencies would
need to publicly report the percent of payments for Medicaid-covered
services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and
support staff in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for
individuals with intellectual disabilities.

**Increasing Nursing Home Accountability**

As the Administration works to implement the new proposed minimum
federal floor for staffing, it is also committed to improving nursing
home safety in the immediate-term. That’s why today HHS is announcing
new efforts to improve enforcement of existing standards. HHS is taking
action to:

-   **Increase Audits of Nursing Homes’ Staffing**: CMS is expanding
    audits of the direct care staffing data that nursing homes must
    report to make sure that federal and state inspectors, as well as
    residents and their families, have accurate information, including
    through Nursing Home Care Compare, CMS’ informational website that
    families and prospective residents use to learn about facilities.  
-   **Ensure Taxpayer Dollars Go Toward Safe, High-Quality Care**:
    HHS-OIG is performing new oversight work to follow the money on how
    nursing homes spend the taxpayer funds they receive. This will
    include analysis of how nursing homes may profit at the expense of
    taxpayers and residents by using services, suppliers, or facilities
    controlled by parties they own or are otherwise connected to, rather
    than from vendors who might charge a more competitive price. These
    “related-party transactions,” have not only obscured how taxpayer
    funds are being used by nursing homes, but also obscure whether
    profits and payouts to shareholders are prioritized above
    investments in resident safety and fair wages for workers. 

<!-- -->

-   **Improve Nursing Home Inspections**: CMS will undertake new
    analyses of state inspection findings to ensure cited deficiencies
    receive the appropriate consequence, particularly in incidences
    involving resident harm. These analyses will ensure citations are
    applied more consistently and reflect the seriousness of the
    deficiency, permitting appropriate follow-through and enforcement.  
-   **Crack Down on Inappropriate Antipsychotic Prescribing Practices
    and Risks:** Grave [concerns
    persist](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/c7cded0bf6f55567b55d78ef9e56687d/antipsychotic-medication-ltcf.pdf)
    that nursing homes are overprescribing dangerous antipsychotic drugs
    to residents. To support efforts to reduce the misuse of these
    powerful medications, HHS-OIG is examining risks at nursing homes
    that have concerning prescribing practices. This builds on recent
    actions by CMS to [increase
    oversight](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-takes-additional-steps-strengthen-nursing-home-safety-and-transparency)
    of inappropriate use of antipsychotic medication.  
-   **Enhance Resident Safety During Emergencies:** Nursing home
    residents are often among the most vulnerable to public health
    emergencies, and recent emergencies have exposed weaknesses in
    nursing home emergency planning and harm to residents who suffered
    from inadequate care. The HHS-OIG is undertaking a new effort to
    improve resident safety during emergencies, including launching a
    national study of nursing home preparedness and key challenges, and
    identifying practices to strengthen protections for residents.

The Administration is committed to using its existing authorities to
enhance the safety, quality, and accountability of nursing facilities.
But Congress also needs to act. **For over eight years, funding for
survey and certification programs to conduct health and safety
inspections hasn’t changed, even as the volume of complaints about
nursing homes has risen. That’s why the** [**President’s 2024
budget**](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2024-budget-in-brief.pdf)
**called onCongress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.**

**Growing the Nursing Workforce and Supporting Job Quality**

CMS, in partnership with HRSA, is launching a new nursing home staffing
campaign to help workers pursue careers in nursing homes. To bolster
recruitment, training, and retention among nursing home workers, CMS
will invest over $75 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement
for nursing workers through the Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment
Program. CMS will also work to streamline entry to and raise awareness
of rewarding career opportunities in nursing homes.  

These new investments are on top of the [hundreds of
millions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-to-improve-quality-of-nursing-homes/)
of dollars the Administration has made available to invest in training
and recruiting nurses and other caregivers. For example:

-   The Department of Labor’s [Nursing Expansion Grant
    program](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=341995)
    made nearly $80 million in grants available to address barriers to
    training in the nursing workforce and expand our national pipeline
    of qualified nursing professionals. These funds have been allocated
    to [programs across the
    country](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/skillstraining/NE%20Grantee%20Brief%20Abstracts%20FINAL%20July%202023.pdf#:~:text=The%20awards%20range%20from%20%243%2C543%2C416%20to%20%245%2C999%2C908.%20Twenty-one,high-skilled%20jobs.%20Awards%20range%20from%20%241%2C124%2C821%20to%20%243%2C000%2C000.)
    to train healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals, including
    direct care workers, to advance in their careers and to increase the
    number of clinical and vocational nursing instructors and
    educators.  
-   HRSA has also provided [grant
    funding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-to-improve-quality-of-nursing-homes/)
    to increase the number of nursing preceptors—those who supervise
    nursing students in clinical rotations—to help support nursing
    schools in expanding admissions to train more students and providing
    those students with clinical exposure.  
-   The American Rescue Plan also supported HRSA’s Nurse Corps
    scholarship and loan repayment program with [$200
    million](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text)
    in funding.

Tying together these critical investments, HHS is strengthening the
health workforce through its [Health Workforce
Initiative](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/07/06/new-hhs-initiative-aims-strengthen-nations-health-workforce.html)
by connecting skilled health care providers to communities in need
through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs and helping to
build the pipeline of health workers in the most underserved
communities.

**Building on Other Nursing Home Reform Progress**

Today’s announcement builds on steps taken by the Administration to
support nursing home residents and workers in furtherance of the
President’s Action Plan. These include:

-   **Shedding light on ownership and management.** CMS issued a
    [proposed
    rule](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-increase-transparency-nursing-home)
    requiring nursing homes to disclose additional information about
    their owners and management, and sets the stage for the disclosure
    of whether these entities are private equity investors or real
    estate investment trusts. For the first time, CMS also [released
    data](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/04/20/hhs-releases-new-data-and-report-hospital-and-nursing-home-ownership.html#:~:text=April%2020%2C%202022%20Contact%3A%20HHS%20Press%20Office%20202-690-6343,seniors%20by%20improving%20safety%20and%20quality%20of%20care)
    on mergers, acquisitions, ownership changes, and consolidations of
    Medicare-enrolled hospitals and nursing homes, and data identifying
    common ownership across facilities.

<!-- -->

-   **Incentivizing quality performance through Medicare and Medicaid
    funding.** CMS issued [a final
    rule](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/fiscal-year-fy-2024-skilled-nursing-facility-perspective-payment-system-final-rule-cms-1779-f)
    updating Medicare payment policies and rates for FY 2024, including
    an over $1 billion payment increase under the Skilled Nursing
    Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System and updates to the Skilled
    Nursing Facility (“SNF”) Quality Reporting Program and the SNF
    Value-Based Purchasing Program to encourage high-quality care. CMS
    has also issued [a
    bulletin](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-encourages-states-use-medicaid-payments-nursing-homes-drive-better-health-outcomes-residents)
    encouraging states to use their Medicaid authorities to drive better
    health outcomes for residents and improve staff pay, training, and
    retention.  
-   **Strengthening oversight of the worst-performing nursing homes.**
    CMS
    [implemented](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-to-improve-quality-of-nursing-homes/)
    escalating penalties and raised the safety standards for homes in
    the Special Focus Facility program, which provides oversight for the
    worst-performing nursing homes. It also enhanced technical
    assistance to help such facilities improve.  
-   **Addressing misdiagnosis and overprescribing.** CMS is giving the
    public more access to information on misdiagnosis of schizophrenia,
    which can lead to overprescribing of dangerous antipsychotics. CMS
    is conducting audits of schizophrenia coding by nursing homes and
    adjusting Care Compare quality ratings based on [audit
    findings](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-takes-additional-steps-strengthen-nursing-home-safety-and-transparency)
    involving inaccurate schizophrenia diagnoses.  
-   **Preventing abuse and Medicare fraud.** CMS issued a [final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/18/2022-23873/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-cy-2023-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other)
    requiring nursing home owners to be fingerprinted for federal
    background checks.  
-   **Cracking down on illegal debt collection.** [CMS and the Consumer
    Financial Protection
    Bureau](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/08/hhs-joins-cfpb-protect-nursing-home-residents-and-their-caregivers-illegal-debt-collection-practices.html)
    are reinforcing regulations banning facilities from illegally
    holding families responsible for their loved ones’ nursing home
    debt.  
-   **Improving pandemic preparedness.** CMS [updated
    guidance](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-issues-significant-updates-improve-safety-and-quality-care-long-term-care-residents-and-calls)
    to require an infection control specialist be on site at least
    part-time in nursing homes to improve response to pandemics—not just
    an off-site consultant as the prior Administration allowed.  
-   **Improving families’ ability to comparison shop.** Caregivers and
    prospective residents can better choose between facilities based on
    improvements to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System and
    Care Compare, including [new
    data](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-enhances-nursing-home-rating-system-staffing-and-turnover-data)
    on turnover, weekend staffing, and charges of violations, as well as
    owners, affiliated entities, and chains.  
-   **Increasing vaccination access***.* HHS is working to increase
    COVID-19 vaccination rates for long-term care residents. [CMS
    finalized the adoption of quality
    measures](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/fiscal-year-fy-2024-skilled-nursing-facility-perspective-payment-system-final-rule-cms-1779-f)
    intended to encourage nursing homes to ensure all residents and
    workers are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Additionally,
    CMS recently finalized requirements for nursing homes and other
    long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccines to residents
    and workers and provide education on their benefits.
