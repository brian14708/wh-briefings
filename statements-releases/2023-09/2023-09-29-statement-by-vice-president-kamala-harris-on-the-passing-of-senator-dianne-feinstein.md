title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Senator Dianne\_\
  Feinstein"
---
 
Senator Dianne Feinstein was one of the greatest public servants that
California and our nation has ever known.  
   
As the first woman president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
the first woman to serve as mayor of San Francisco, and the
longest-tenured woman to serve in the United States Senate, Dianne
Feinstein broke barriers, inspired generations of women to run for
office, and improved the lives of millions of Americans through her
vision, courage, and leadership.  
   
From her work to help pass the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, to her work
to safeguard California’s public lands, and her longstanding advocacy
for reproductive rights, marriage equality, and LGBTQ+ rights, Senator
Feinstein helped build a better America.  
   
For years, I witnessed Senator Feinstein’s leadership, when the cameras
were on and when they were off. In 2008, when I was re-elected District
Attorney of San Francisco, it was Senator Feinstein who swore me in. As
a United States Senator, it was my honor to serve the people of
California alongside Senator Feinstein.  
  
On the Senate Intelligence Committee, we spent a great deal of time
together—in classified, bipartisan briefings and hearings—working on
issues critical to America’s national security and the stability of the
world. Senator Feinstein and I shared a fundamental belief in the
importance of strong American leadership. And I saw firsthand how she
worked courageously to ensure that our leadership was guided by our
nation’s values.  
   
In the tradition of so many great Senators from California, she was not
only a leader for our state, but for our nation and our world. Through
her long career, Senator Feinstein worked across the aisle to help our
nation live up to its promise.  
   
Doug and I send our prayers to Senator Feinstein’s family.
