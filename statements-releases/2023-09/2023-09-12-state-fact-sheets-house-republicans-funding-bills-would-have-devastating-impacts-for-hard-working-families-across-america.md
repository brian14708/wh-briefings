title: "STATE FACT SHEETS: House Republicans\u2019 Funding Bills Would Have Devastating\
  \ Impacts for Hard-Working Families Across\_America"
---
 
*House Republicans’ bills would raise a host of costs for families, hurt
students, seniors, and rural communities, slash support for law
enforcement, and undermine our economy—* *while Congressional
Republicans fight separately for multi-millionaires and big corporations
to get massive tax cuts*

Earlier this year, the President and Congressional leaders reached a
bipartisan budget agreement that averted a first-ever default and
protected our historic economic progress. The President, House
Democrats, Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans all stand by this
promise. Unfortunately, Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans are
ignoring the bipartisan budget agreement they passed and instead
advancing extreme, partisan appropriations bills that break their public
promise and gut key investments in the American people.

House Republicans claim these cuts are about fiscal responsibility—but
they aren’t. Not only would their bills add at least $100 billion to
deficits over 10 years by making it easier for the wealthy and big
corporations to cheat on their taxes, but House Republicans are
separately pushing corporate tax giveaways that would cost over $500
billion if made permanent—including at least $30 billion in retroactive
tax breaks for investments companies made last year. These retroactive
tax cuts alone would erase the savings from their deep cuts to
education, health, and labor programs.<sup>1</sup>

Today, the Office of Management and Budget released 51 fact sheets
highlighting the devastating impacts of these extreme cuts on states and
the District of Columbia. Below are some of the most harmful elements of
House Republicans’ appropriations bills that they will begin to consider
this week.

The cuts in the House appropriations bills would:

-   **Slash Funding for Schools with Low-Income Students**: House
    Republicans’ 80 percent cut to Title I funding would impact
    26 million students in schools that teach low-income students by
    forcing a reduction of up to 226,000 teachers, aides or other key
    staff. 

<!-- -->

-   **Eliminate Tens of Thousands of Preschool Slots**: House
    Republicans’ cut to Head Start would mean as many as 82,000 children
    would lose access to high-quality preschool—undermining their
    education, leaving fewer children ready to enter kindergarten ready
    to learn, and making it more difficult for parents to join the
    workforce.

<!-- -->

-   **Slash Funding for Law Enforcement:** The proposed cut to the FBI
    would eliminate up to 1,850 personnel, including up to 673 agents,
    and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be
    forced to eliminate approximately 400 positions, including more than
    200 agents. The House bill also cuts funding for U.S. Attorneys by
    roughly 12 percent, which would eliminate approximately 1,400
    positions. 

<!-- -->

-   **Raise Housing Costs for Tens of Thousands**: The proposed cuts
    would raise housing costs by eliminating funding for Housing Choice
    Vouchers for 20,000 households, including approximately
    6,000 households headed by seniors. In addition, a nearly 70 percent
    cut to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program would result in
    20,000 fewer affordable homes being constructed, rehabbed, or
    purchased in communities across the country.

<!-- -->

-   **Slash Critical Job Training and Workforce Development Programs:**
    The proposal would result in half a million fewer people receiving
    job training and employment services. These harmful cuts would
    deprive businesses of the skilled workforce they need to thrive, and
    would cut off workers’ pathways to good jobs.

<!-- -->

-   **Undermine Critical Health Research: **House Republicans’ cuts
    would undermine critical research efforts to find treatments and
    cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s by cutting $3.8
    billion for the National Institutes of Health. They would also
    eliminate funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and
    Quality, which would end the Long COVID research at the agency and
    delay other priority health services research.

In addition to demanding these draconian cuts, House Republicans are
also fighting to rescind vital funding that is helping make our tax code
fairer, rebuilding America’s infrastructure, lowering costs for
families, and tackling the climate crisis. Their proposals would:

-   **Increase Risks of Lead Exposure:** The proposal would rescind over
    $564 million in funding for programs that mitigate housing-related
    risks of lead poisoning and other illnesses and hazards to lower
    income families, especially children, resulting in 55,000 fewer
    homes safe of hazards and adversely impacting approximately 78,000
    children.

<!-- -->

-   **Protect Wealthy Tax Cheats:** While House Republicans separately
    lay the groundwork for more than $3 trillion in tax cuts skewed to
    the wealthy and big corporations, they are also fighting to make it
    easier for wealthy tax cheats to avoid paying what they
    owe—proposing to rescind $67 billion dollars in funding for the IRS
    enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, which would increase the
    deficit by more than $100 billion.

<!-- -->

-   **Increase Energy Costs for Rural Americans:** Rescinding $2 billion
    in funding provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for programs at
    USDA would undermine programs that help agricultural producers and
    rural small businesses convert to renewable energy systems, and that
    help rural Americans to build clean, affordable, and reliable energy
    by working with approximately 900 electric cooperatives in 47
    States.

<!-- -->

-   **Shortchange Home Electrification Projects:** Rescinding $4.5
    billion in funding provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for the
    High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program would impact at least
    250,000 home electrification and appliance upgrade projects in low-
    and medium-income homes across all States, territories, and tribes.

<!-- -->

-   **Undermine Clean Technology Investments and Pollution Reduction:**
    Rescinding $20 billion in funding provided by the Inflation
    Reduction Act for programs at EPA would take away funds designed to
    help communities access grant opportunities to reduce pollution and
    mobilize private capital into clean technology projects, especially
    in low-income and disadvantaged communities. These programs will
    spur investment in clean technology projects and expand economic
    opportunities in communities, helping to cut harmful pollution and
    protect people’s health while tackling the climate crisis.

<!-- -->

-   **Slash Support for Teachers:** Rescinding $1.7 billion—or 77
    percent—in the Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants
    (Title II) program would severely undermine the program’s ability to
    improve the effectiveness of teachers in the classroom.

**<u>A deal is a deal.</u>** The President and the Speaker already made
a bipartisan budget agreement—one that would result in $1 trillion of
deficit reduction over the next decade. Every party to that agreement
except House Republicans—House Democrats, Senate Democrats, Senate
Republicans, and President Biden—are honoring their word. It is a
balanced deal that protects critical investments while ensuring fiscal
responsibility. We urge House Republicans to follow the law they helped
enact and the Senate’s bipartisan approach to funding the government
according to the deal.

1.  The House Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill cuts
    these programs by a total of $30.7 billion, not counting rescissions
    included in the bill.
