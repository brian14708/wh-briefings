title: "Memorandum of Understanding on the Principles of an India \u2013 Middle East\
  \ \u2013 Europe Economic\_Corridor"
---
 
Pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding, the Governments of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the European Union, the Republic of India, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), the French Republic, the Federal Republic of
Germany, the Italian Republic, and the United States of America (the
“Participants”) commit to work together to establish the India – Middle
East – Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC). The IMEC is expected to
stimulate economic development through enhanced connectivity and
economic integration between Asia, the Arabian Gulf, and Europe.  
  
The IMEC will be comprised of two separate corridors, the east corridor
connecting India to the Arabian Gulf and the northern corridor
connecting the Arabian Gulf to Europe. It will include a railway that,
upon completion, will provide a reliable and cost-effective cross-border
ship-to-rail transit network to supplement existing maritime and road
transport routes – enabling goods and services to transit to, from, and
between India, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and Europe.  
  
Along the railway route, Participants intend to enable the laying of
cable for electricity and digital connectivity, as well as pipe for
clean hydrogen export. This corridor will secure regional supply chains,
increase trade accessibility, improve trade facilitation, and support an
increased emphasis on environmental social, and government impacts.  
  
Participants intend that the corridor will increase efficiencies, reduce
costs, enhance economic unity, generate jobs, and lower greenhouse gas
emissions – – resulting in a transformative integration of Asia, Europe
and the Middle East.  
  
In support of this initiative, Participants commit to work collectively
and expeditiously to arrange and implement all elements of these new
transit 2 routes, and to establish coordinating entities to address the
full range of technical, design, financing, legal and relevant
regulatory standards.  
  
Today’s Memorandum of Understanding is the result of initial
consultations. It sets forth political commitments of the Participants
and does not create rights or obligations under international law. The
Participants intend to meet within the next sixty days to develop and
commit to an action plan with relevant timetables.
