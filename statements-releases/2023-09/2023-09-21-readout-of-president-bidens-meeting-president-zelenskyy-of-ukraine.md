President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of
Ukraine at the White House today. President Biden reiterated that the

counteroffensive.  President Biden provided an update on forthcoming
U.S. security assistance. He shared that the United States will announce
a significant new package today, including more air defense capabilities
to help Ukraine protect its people and critical infrastructure from
Russian attacks both now and in the winter. The United States is
also coordinating sustained deliveries of short range air defense
systems like the Avenger, longer range air defense systems such as the
HAWK, and hybrid systems that pair Western air defense interceptors with
existing Ukrainian systems. He also shared that Abrams tanks will arrive
in Ukraine next week. In addition, the United States is committed to
bolstering Ukraine’s defensive capabilities in the long term, including
through partnerships with Ukraine’s defense industrial base. To that

brings together U.S. defense industry, Ukrainian business leaders,
and officials from both governments to explore options for joint
ventures and co-production.

who will focus on engaging the private sector, partner countries, and
Ukrainian counterparts to align support for priority investments and
reforms designed to improve the business climate.

Ukraine. President Biden underscored the importance of strong,
politically independent anti-corruption institutions, including the
National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, Special Anti-Corruption
Prosecutor, and the High Anti-Corruption Court<s>.</s>

diplomatic effort to secure global support for a just and lasting peace.
