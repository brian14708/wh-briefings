Vice President Kamala Harris today joined leaders of the Association of
Southeast Nations (ASEAN) member states and Timor-Leste, as well as the
ASEAN Secretary General, for the annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Jakarta,
Indonesia.  She reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to strengthening our
partnership with ASEAN, upholding ASEAN centrality, and supporting
robust implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. The Vice
President commended Indonesia’s successful chairmanship of ASEAN and
expressed support for Laos as it prepares to assume
the ASEAN chairmanship in 2024. She welcomed the presence of Timor-Leste
in its capacity as ASEAN observer, and pledged U.S. support for
Timor-Leste’s ASEAN accession process.

The Vice President reflected on the strength of the U.S.-ASEAN
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the historic outcomes of the
2022 U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, D.C. To ensure the United
States’ elevated partnership with ASEAN reaches its full potential, the
leaders announced their intent to establish, through a public private
partnership, a U.S.-ASEAN Center in Washington, D.C. The Vice President
also highlighted new initiatives that are strengthening the United
States’ partnership with ASEAN on economics and trade, climate and
energy, health, and maritime issues such as sustainable fishing, as well
as education and cultural exchange.

The leaders discussed a range of regional and global issues, including
the importance of upholding international law in the South China Sea,
efforts to support the people of Burma in returning their country to the
path of democratic transition, and Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine –
including its negative effects in Southeast Asia.
