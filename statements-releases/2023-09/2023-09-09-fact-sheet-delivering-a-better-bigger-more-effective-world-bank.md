title: "FACT SHEET: Delivering a Better, Bigger, More Effective World\_Bank"
---
 
President Biden is leading a major new initiative with G20 partners to
fundamentally reshape and scale up the World Bank to more effectively
deliver poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth—while better
addressing global challenges that can undermine the achievement of these
very goals.

Since the Biden-Harris Administration launched this initiative last
fall, significant progress has been made.  Thanks to the further
leadership of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a growing coalition of
countries has come together to reform the World Bank’s mission and
vision, incentives, operational model, and financing capacity.  With
measures implemented and identified under the G20’s Capital Adequacy
Review, the multilateral development bank system could unlock $200
billion in new lending capacity over the next decade.  In addition,
President Biden nominated Ajay Banga to lead and revitalize the World
Bank, and fully deliver on the promise of this initiative. 

To amplify the impact of the ongoing reforms to the World Bank and
advance progress at a global level, President Biden has asked Congress
for support that would unlock new concessional World Bank financing by
more than $25 billion just from U.S. action. 

-   Global Challenges Boost: President Biden asked Congress for funding
    to unlock $25 billion in new International Bank for Reconstruction
    and Development (IBRD) concessional lending capacity and provide
    borrowers more headroom so that they can address global challenges. 
    This new lending capacity will enable the World Bank to better
    support developing countries by providing more resources on better
    terms, and helping countries pursue more ambitious reforms and
    development projects with regional and global benefits.

-   Enhanced Support for the Poorest: The World Bank must continue to
    pay sufficient attention to the needs of the poorest and most
    vulnerable countries, which are facing multiple, compounding crises,
    including those stemming from global challenges.  President Biden
    has requested from Congress funding to provide a $1 billion
    contribution to support the International Development Association’s
    (IDA) immediate crisis response in the world’s poorest countries. 

In New Delhi, President Biden rallied G20 partners to agree to
collectively mobilize more headroom and concessional finance to boost
the World Bank’s capacity to support low- and middle-income countries. 
We are aiming for our joint contributions to deliver a one-time boost to
IBRD equivalent to three times the World Bank’s annual non-concessional
lending volume, and to double IDA’s crisis lending capacity.  This
initiative will make the World Bank a stronger institution that is able
to provide resources at the scale and speed needed to tackle global
challenges and address the urgent needs of the poorest countries.

President Biden will continue to call on G20 Leaders to commit to
further progress on evolving the World Bank and other multilateral
development banks over the next year, and he will push for concrete
results by the Rio de Janeiro Summit under Brazil’s G20 Presidency in
2024.
