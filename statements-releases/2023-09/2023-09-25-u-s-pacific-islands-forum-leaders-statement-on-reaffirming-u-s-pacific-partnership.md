title: "U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Statement on Reaffirming U.S.-Pacific\_\
  Partnership"
---
 
We—the governments of Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Caledonia, New
Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall
Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and the United
States of America—meet on the occasion of the second U.S.- Pacific
Islands Forum Summit, held at the White House in Washington, D.C. from
25-26 September 2023.   
   
We reaffirm our support for the Declaration on U.S.-Pacific Partnership
issued in Washington on September 29, 2022, which outlined our shared
vision for a resilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security,
social inclusion, and prosperity, where individuals can reach their
potential, the environment can thrive, and democracy can flourish.  
   
We commit to working together in genuine partnership, rooted in mutual
respect, consistent with the principles of the UN charter, and in the
spirit of transparency and accountability.  
   
  
**Political Leadership and Regionalism**

1.  We recognise and reaffirm the importance of strong and enduring
    political will and leadership in progressing regional priorities, in
    respect of Pacific cultures, values and traditions. We commit to
    partnering to support and nurture generations of leadership grounded
    in the Pacific Way with a commitment to gender equality and social
    inclusion.  
2.  We welcome the United States’ renewed commitment to the Pacific
    Islands region and to strengthening both bilateral and regional
    cooperation in support of Pacific Islands’ development aspirations
    and to enable a stable, secure, inclusive, and prosperous regional
    environment. We commit to working together to support the successful
    delivery and implementation of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue
    Pacific Continent (2050 Strategy).   
3.  We acknowledge the unique political relationship between the United
    States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated
    States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, a cornerstone of
    U.S.-Pacific cooperation, and we underscore the paramount importance
    of the timely and successful completion of negotiations of, and the
    relevant domestic processes regarding agreements relating to, the
    Compacts of Free Association between the United States and these
    three Pacific Island States and their subsequent implementation. 
    The United States plans to work expeditiously to meet the needs of
    the Republic of the Marshall Islands through ongoing Compact
    negotiations.   
4.  We reiterate the importance of upholding the purposes and principles
    of the UN Charter, as well as shared values enshrined in the 1982
    United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the South Pacific
    Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Rarotonga Treaty), and the Nuclear
    Non-Proliferation Treaty. We reaffirm our commitment to the
    international nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime and
    its central role in maintaining international peace and security,
    including in the Pacific. States Parties to the Rarotonga Treaty
    reaffirmed their commitment to the maintenance of the South Pacific
    Nuclear Free Zone and encouraged the United States to ratify the
    Treaty’s protocols, as soon as possible.  
5.  We reaffirm the importance of the rules-based international order
    and the UN Charter, and condemn all wars of aggression, including
    Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and underscore the need to
    reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace
    that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, in
    line with the UN Charter and relevant UN resolutions.  
6.  We acknowledge the legacy of World War II and the nuclear legacy of
    the Cold War. We, too, acknowledge and welcome the United States’
    commitment to addressing legacy issues from World War II, including
    working with allies and partners to address the safe removal of
    unexploded ordinances. We, too, acknowledge the United States’
    commitment to addressing the Republic of the Marshall Islands’
    ongoing environmental, public health concerns, and other welfare
    concerns.

**Partnership and Cooperation**

1.  Recognising the importance of building and maintaining this
    partnership, we commit to holding the next U.S. – Pacific Islands
    Forum Summit in 2025 and intend to hold biennial political
    engagements thereafter. We intend to enhance U.S.-Pacific
    Partnership through regularised Ministerial and Senior Officials
    engagements, including the PIF Leaders Dialogue with Forum Dialogue
    Partners. We intend to strengthen our bilateral and regional
    cooperation on a range of shared priority issues impacting the Blue
    Pacific region, especially on the need for urgent and ambitious
    action to address climate change and disaster risk.   
2.  We acknowledge and respect the Pacific Islands Forum as the apex of
    the Pacific regional architecture and the driver of regional
    priority setting and resource allocation, and fully support the Blue
    Pacific Principles for Dialogue and Engagement. We intend to
    continue working through and in support of Pacific regional
    institutions and mechanisms, including the Council of Regional
    Organizations of the Pacific to advance the shared objectives
    outlined in the 2050 Strategy and the 2050 Strategy Implementation
    Plan. We acknowledge the United States’ commitment to support
    Pacific priorities working with other partners.  
3.  We recognise the importance of enduring partnerships and cooperation
    and welcome further opportunities to strengthen reciprocal
    diplomatic representation, and noted the Leaders decision in 2023 to
    consider the establishment and operationalisation of a permanent
    Pacific Islands Forum Special Envoy Office in the United States of
    America, to manage coordination with the United Nations as well as
    Washington.  
4.  Recognising the value of public-private partnerships, we look
    forward to opportunities to convene the Pacific with U.S. businesses
    with the primary purpose of building investment partnerships,
    fostering innovation and technology, clean energy transformation,
    and entrepreneurship, and propelling progress in critical sectors.

**Climate Change and Disasters**

1.  We recognise that climate change is the single greatest existential
    threat facing the Blue Pacific, and we acknowledge the climate
    crisis that threatens the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of its
    people and ecosystems, recognising that Pacific Islands Forum
    Leaders have declared that the Pacific region is in a state of
    climate emergency.  
2.  We are redoubling efforts to promote and accelerate greater global
    ambition on climate action to limit the increase in global average
    temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and in this regard, emphasize
    the importance of both meaningful mitigation action, particularly
    from major emitters, and international financial support for
    meaningful mitigation action.  
3.  We commend the Pacific region for the development of the Pacific
    designed, led and owned regional financing initiative through the
    Pacific Resilience Facility (PRF)*.* We welcome the United States’
    announcement to support the establishment of the PRF with initial
    funding of $2 million.  
4.  We underscore the importance of continued efforts to mobilise and
    simplify the process for timely access to finance to support Pacific
    Island countries’ climate priorities, including through steps to
    operationalise the PRF.  
5.  We acknowledge the importance of further developing vulnerability
    measures, and considering such metrics in relevant international
    processes, including the potential use of a multidimensional
    vulnerability index, as criteria to access concessional
    finance.  International institutions may consider incorporating the
    MVI into their assessment processes, where appropriate.   
6.  We stress the importance of continuing to strengthen disaster
    preparedness and response capacities in the Pacific to save lives
    and livelihoods when threatened by climate change and disaster
    risks. We recognise ongoing efforts to develop a Pacific
    Humanitarian Response Coordination Mechanism and welcome the support
    for the Pacific Humanitarian Warehousing capacities, to improve
    coordination and the efficiency of regional and national disaster
    response efforts.  
7.  We support the robust implementation of the Early Warnings for All
    initiative and its ambition to ensure that all Pacific people are
    protected from hazardous weather, water, and climate events through
    life-saving multi-hazard early warning systems, sharing lessons
    learned and supporting the Weather Ready Pacific Decadal Programme
    of Investment.    
8.  We will prioritize strengthening climate resilience in order to
    safeguard the wellbeing of populations, ecosystems, and economies
    against climate risk and continue to promote regional stability. We
    look to enhance climate adaptation by supporting the fresh water,
    sanitation, and hygiene sectors, strengthening food systems, expand
    agricultural, forestry, and infrastructure resilience through
    increasing climate-smart programming, better designs, and
    construction, combatting invasive species, and fostering regional
    collaboration to enhance climate resilience in the Blue Pacific
    region.  
9.  Consistent with the mandate from the 27<sup>th</sup> UN Climate
    Change Conference, we are committed to operationalizing loss and
    damage funding arrangements and in this context establishing a fund
    for responding to loss and damage whose mandate includes a focus on
    addressing loss and damage. We are working together to design an
    effective fund that assists developing countries that are
    particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,
    including the Pacific Islands, respond to loss and damage in a way
    that supports country ownership and national solutions and programs
    that can respond flexibly to the evolving impacts of climate change.

**Ocean and Fisheries**

1.  We support the sustainable, inclusive, and equitable management and
    development of fisheries and other coastal and marine ecosystems and
    resources, which are essential to Pacific economies and food
    security.  
2.  We strive to enhance cooperation to understand, protect, safeguard,
    and conserve the health and sustainability of the Pacific Ocean and
    its resources, upon which our nations depend. We endeavor to
    sustainably manage our ocean resources, including fisheries, to
    optimize the benefits for the Pacific peoples.  
3.  We commit to securing the limits of the Blue Pacific Continent to
    promote the stability, security, certainty, and predictability of
    maritime entitlements irrespective of the impacts of climate
    change-related sea-level rise. Bearing in mind the Pacific Islands
    Forum Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of
    Climate Change-Related Sea-Level Rise, the United States will work
    with Pacific Island States and other countries toward the goal of
    lawfully establishing and maintaining baselines and outer limits of
    maritime zones and will not challenge such baselines and outer
    limits irrespective of the impacts of climate change-related
    sea-level rise.  
4.  We recognize the rights and entitlements of all States under the
    international law of the sea as reflected in United Nations
    Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and underscore the
    importance of compliance with international law, highlighting those
    obligations relating to protecting and preserving the marine
    environment.  
5.  We acknowledge the current work of the International Law Commission
    Study Group on sea-level rise in relation to international law, on
    issues relating to statehood and the protection of persons affected
    by sea-level rise. We are committed to working with each other and
    others on issues related to climate change-related sea-level rise
    and statehood.  
6.  We commit to working together to ensure the Agreement under the
    United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation
    and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond
    National Jurisdiction secures the ratifications needed to enter into
    force as soon as possible.

**Trade and Investment**

1.  Through regular engagement under the U.S. Pacific Islands Trade and
    Investment Dialogue, we plan to continue to work together to promote
    new trade and investment opportunities and deepen trade ties, with a
    view toward creating durable trade relationships that advance
    sustainable and inclusive growth, including through discussions on
    enhanced access to finance for small and medium enterprises,
    improved business-enabling environments, correspondent banking
    access, and trade capacity.  
2.  We look forward to the prospect of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries
    Subsidies entering into force by the 13<sup>th</sup> Ministerial
    Conference, and to its full implementation. To this end, we intend
    to work towards our respective acceptance of the Agreement, as
    necessary, and to accelerate progress toward the conclusion of
    negotiations to achieve a comprehensive agreement on fisheries
    subsidies, including through disciplines on certain forms of
    fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing,
    recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential
    treatment for developing country members and least developed country
    Members should be an integral part of these negotiations.  
3.  We recognise that the Pacific Islands value the benefits offered by
    the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and support the
    U.S. Congress’ efforts to reauthorize the GSP.  
4.  We recognise the Pacific region’s efforts to secure aid for trade to
    achieve its development aspirations and will work towards supporting
    components of the implementation of the Pacific Aid for Trade
    Strategy 2020 – 2025.  
5.  We plan to invest in safe and secure communications and access to
    information, through appropriate technology infrastructure and
    cybersecurity arrangements to enable business, education, and
    digital connectivity for Pacific peoples.  
6.  We welcome the progress made towards completing negotiations related
    to the Annexes of the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of
    Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United
    States of America (“South Pacific Tuna Treaty”) and the conclusion
    of negotiations on its related Economic Assistance Agreement, which
    has long served as a cornerstone for U.S-Pacific cooperation.

**Peace & Security**

1.  We reaffirm our commitment to the Boe Declaration and working to
    address human security, environmental and resource security,
    transnational crime and cybersecurity.  
2.  We intend to work together on key law enforcement and justice sector
    challenges through new capacity building and operational efforts to
    promote the rule of law; strengthen border security and maritime law
    enforcement, including to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated
    fishing; and tackle money laundering, cyber and financial crime,
    transnational organized crime, and the trafficking of humans,
    narcotics, and wildlife. We support strengthening institutional
    capacity to deter and disrupt all forms of corruption and support
    efforts by Pacific Islands Forum members to uphold and implement the
    commitments of the Teieniwa Vision and its implementation plan.  
3.  We seek to strengthen longstanding cooperation on combating illegal,
    unreported, and unregulated fishing through new capacity building
    and technological initiatives, to supplement our existing bilateral
    agreements and regional arrangements in collaboration with the Forum
    Fisheries Agency.  
4.  We seek to strengthen national and regional good governance and
    democratic institutions across the Pacific, including through
    support for accountability, transparency, anti-corruption, civil
    society, human rights, and an independent and free media
    environment.   
5.  We are concerned that the climate crisis may exacerbate threats to
    international peace and security and worsen risks of current and
    future conflict and fragility. In this context, we urge the UN
    Secretary-General to consider appointing a Special Representative
    for Climate and Security.

**People-Centered Development**

1.  We commit to promoting inclusive, sustainable, and equitable
    development, including for women, children, youth, persons with
    disabilities, and members of marginalized racial, ethnic and
    Indigenous communities, so that no one is left behind.   
2.  We reaffirm a commitment to gender equality and social inclusion
    including the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration,
    recognising that no country can thrive if most vulnerable
    communities and marginalised groups are left behind.   
3.  We intend to promote regional health and health security, including
    through new Global Health Security partnerships, and build capacity
    to combat communicable and noncommunicable diseases, mindful of a
    One Health approach, so Pacific peoples can live long and healthy
    lives.   
4.  We intend to expand our longstanding people-to-people ties through
    increased training, capacity building and exchange programs,
    scholarships, diaspora outreach, sports diplomacy, cultural exchange
    promotion, such as the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture in
    2024 hosted by Hawai’i and implementing new initiatives such as
    Sister City Partnerships.  We intend to promote youth volunteer
    service across the region including through the return of the Peace
    Corps to the Pacific.  
5.  Above all, we reaffirm our commitment to translating our shared
    vision into common actions to ensure the continued growth, dynamism,
    resilience, inclusivity and stability of the people of the Blue
    Pacific Continent.    
6.  This statement is made in respect of the competences of the
    signatories and of the respective governments.
