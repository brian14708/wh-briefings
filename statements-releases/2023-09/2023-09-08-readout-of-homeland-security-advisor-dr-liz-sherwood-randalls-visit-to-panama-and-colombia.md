Between September 5-7, 2023, Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall led an interagency delegation to Panama and Colombia to
advance our joint efforts with regional partners to address the urgent
humanitarian situation and growing migration challenge in the Darien
jungle region.

While in Panama, Sherwood-Randall met with President Laurentino
Cortizo.  They discussed the necessity to effectively reduce the
unprecedented irregular migratory flows in the region and the importance
of both increasing enforcement measures to deter irregular movement and
expanding safe legal pathways for migration.  Dr. Sherwood-Randall
expressed appreciation for the important contribution Panama is making
in offering Temporary Protected Status to migrants in Panama within the
framework of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.

While in Colombia, Sherwood-Randall met with Foreign Minister Álvaro
Leyva to discuss the important initiatives that Colombia is pursuing in
collaboration with the United States to disrupt transnational criminal
groups that are exploiting migrants.  She expressed appreciation for
cooperation in the opening of new U.S. Secure Mobility Offices in
Colombia.  She also described the critical need to build on these
efforts to both deter irregular migration and address the humanitarian
and environmental crisis in the Darien region.

In both countries, Sherwood-Randall conducted field visits to the Darien
jungle to assess what additional steps the United States can take to
support our regional partners in reducing irregular migration and
providing humanitarian relief.

Members of the delegation included Deputy Secretary of State for
Management and Resources Richard Verma, Combatant Commander of the U.S.
Southern Command General Laura Richardson, Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs Melissa
Dalton, Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy at the
Department of Homeland Security Blas Nunez-Neto, Special Assistant to
the President and NSC Coordinator for the Los Angeles Declaration on
Migration and Protection Katie Tobin, and Director of Operations at U.S.
Southern Command Rear Admiral Thomas Allan.
