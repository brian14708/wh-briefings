---
 
*Nine East Coast states and four Federal agencies sign new agreement to
strengthen regional collaboration on offshore wind supply chain
development*  
  
*New Atlantic Transmission Action Plan is another step in broader
strategy to seize near-term and long-term offshore wind opportunities
across America   *

President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is growing an [American
offshore wind
industry](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-advance-american-offshore-wind-opportunities/) that
will create thousands of good-paying union jobs across the country,
power millions of homes with clean electricity, and strengthen our
energy security while reducing dangerous climate pollution. This week
the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new steps to expand America’s
offshore wind supply chain to benefit workers and communities, plan and
build transmission infrastructure to connect projects to the grid, and
advance innovation to reduce deployment barriers and lead on
cutting-edge technologies.  
  
American workers across manufacturing, shipbuilding, construction, and
other sectors are [building this new industry right
now](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/20/fact-sheet-bidenomics-is-boosting-clean-energy-manufacturing-for-offshore-wind-and-creating-good-paying-american-union-jobs/).
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to use every tool
available—including leveraging historic resources from President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda, a key pillar of Bidenomics—to bring the
nation’s first major offshore wind projects online in the near-term and
achieve the goal of 30 gigawatts by 2030.  
  
To help unlock offshore wind opportunities for decades to come and
support state goals for clean energy and economic development, the
Administration’s newest steps include:

-   **Securing East Coast Memorandum of Understanding on Offshore Wind
    Supply Chain Collaboration: **Today, as part of ongoing efforts of
    the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership launched
    by President Biden, nine East Coast states and four federal agencies
    are announcing a new [Memorandum of
    Understanding](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Federal-State-MOU-on-East-Coast-Offshore-Wind-Supply-Chain-Collaboration.pdf) (MOU)
    to strengthen regional collaboration on offshore wind supply chain
    development. The MOU will help expand manufacturing facilities, port
    capabilities, workforce development, and other key supply chain
    elements in a coordinated and sustainable way. MOU efforts include:
    -   The states of Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
        Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode
        Island will develop sub-regional implementation plans to harness
        each other’s existing strengths, efficiently fill high-priority
        gaps, and advance economic development and environmental
        justice.
    -   Federal agencies—the Departments of Energy, the Interior,
        Commerce, and Transportation—will provide technical support to
        the states and help develop a shared East Coast procurement and
        leasing timeline to facilitate greater alignment.
    -   The MOU will encourage investment in multiple states to meet
        offshore wind goals, building on supply chain plans that are
        underway and improving coordination going forward, including
        through future solicitations. In particular, the MOU provides a
        path for states to incentivize the development of U.S. offshore
        wind vessels and U.S. steel production, helping support
        expansion of these industries and good-paying jobs across
        multiple regions.
    -   States and federal agencies will collaborate on addressing
        supply chain needs for both fixed-bottom and floating offshore
        wind, including port infrastructure, and advance best practices
        for quality jobs and community benefits.
    -   While this MOU focuses on coordination between East Coast
        states, which have the most advanced offshore wind projects in
        the country and have helped spur initial U.S. supply chain
        development, the benefits are expected to be national in scope.
        This MOU supports broader efforts of the Federal-State Offshore
        Wind Implementation Partnership to fill national supply chain
        gaps identified in the [U.S. Offshore Wind Supply Chain
        Roadmap](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/national-offshore-wind-research-and-development-consortium-announces-us-offshore-wind),
        which can unlock tens of thousands of good-paying jobs
        throughout the country. 
-   **Launching Atlantic Offshore Wind Transmission Action
    Plan:** Earlier this week, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the
    Department of the Interior (DOI) [issued a comprehensive action
    plan](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-releases-roadmap-accelerate-offshore-wind-transmission-and) to
    connect the first generation of Atlantic offshore wind projects to
    the electric grid and increase transmission over the next several
    decades. This plan lays out steps to collaborate across
    jurisdictions on transmission planning, technological development,
    economic support, and siting and permitting. Informed by a series of
    stakeholder convenings and an ongoing study of buildout scenarios,
    these actions will help guide cost-effective transmission solutions,
    including network approaches to connect multiple projects to shore.
    In direct response to Tribal input, DOE is launching a new [Tribal
    Nation Technical Assistance Program for Offshore Wind
    Transmission](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/tribal-nation-offshore-wind-transmission-technical-assistance-program),
    offering education and training resources to support Tribal
    engagement. This program and the overall action plan are funded in
    part by the Inflation Reduction Act.
-   **Funding Wind Energy Innovation Projects: **Today, DOE is
    announcing three sets of selections for a combined $72 million
    support a range of wind energy research and technology development
    areas. DOE’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies
    Office selected 13 projects to receive a combined [$30
    million](https://www.energy.gov/eere/ammto/funding-selections-ammto-large-wind-turbine-materials-and-manufacturing-funding) to
    innovate manufacturing processes for wind turbine equipment, such as
    using 3D printing to make large turbine blades. AMMTO also
    announced [$15
    million](https://www.energy.gov/eere/ammto/funding-selections-domestic-near-net-shape-manufacturing-enable-clean-and-competitive) for
    a project to innovate domestic production of large, metallic
    components for offshore and onshore wind energy and hydropower that
    will reduce costs and completion time. DOE’s Wind Energy
    Technologies Office awarded [$27 million from the President’s
    Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/doe-wind-energy-technologies-office-selects-15-projects-totaling-27-million) to
    support 15 projects to lower costs and address deployment barriers
    across both offshore and land-based wind. Among these awards, four
    projects will advance high-voltage direct current (HVDC)
    transmission technologies for offshore wind, including by developing
    innovative controls and standards and supporting workforce training
    needs. Five projects will support offshore wind social science
    research, including efforts to build capacity for affected
    communities to better participate in and benefit from offshore wind
    development—furthering the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
    to advancing offshore wind in a way that promotes ocean co-use,
    protects biodiversity, and provides local economic opportunities.

The Administration’s latest steps will help drive long-term growth
across the American offshore wind industry—which President Biden has
jumpstarted by taking decisive action across a [multi-prong offshore
wind
strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-advance-american-offshore-wind-opportunities/).
The Biden-Harris Administration has
already [approved](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-fourth-major-offshore-wind-project) four
commercial-scale offshore wind projects and remains on track to complete
reviews of at least 16 offshore wind project plans by 2025, representing
more than 27 gigawatts of clean energy. Just last week, DOI’s Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management [completed environmental
review](https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/boem-completes-environmental-analysis-proposed-wind-project-offshore-new-0) for
a fifth proposed project, with more on the horizon.  
  
In just the last year, since President Biden signed the Inflation
Reduction Act into law, investments in the U.S. offshore wind industry
have [increased by $7.7
billion](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/20/fact-sheet-bidenomics-is-boosting-clean-energy-manufacturing-for-offshore-wind-and-creating-good-paying-american-union-jobs/),
and the number of companies looking to support this supply chain has
risen 54% to 4,100 companies across all 50 states.
