title: "FACT SHEET: Deepening the United\_States-ASEAN People-to-People Relationship:\
  \ Investing in education, cultural exchange, and the next generation of\_leaders"
---
 
The strength of U.S.-ASEAN relations is anchored in the friendship
shared by our combined one billion people. Each year the United States
provides more than $70 million to support educational and cultural
exchanges with the people of Southeast Asia, which foster greater
understanding, enhance cooperation, and create lifelong friendships that
increase the long-term strength and resilience of communities across the
United States and ASEAN.

At the historic 2022 U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, D.C.,
President Biden and Vice President Harris significantly expanded the
United States’ investment in educational, cultural, and people-to-people
ties through new concrete commitments:

-   Announced  doubling the size of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders
    Initiative, or “YSEALI” – now celebrating its 10<sup>th</sup>
    anniversary – within three years;
-   Extended the Billion Futures Scholarship program so that more
    students from Southeast Asia can study at U.S. universities;
-   Doubled the Fulbright U.S.-ASEAN Visiting Scholars Program;
-   Launched a new exchange program, “U.S.-ASEAN University Connections
    Initiative,” to facilitate collaboration among academics from the
    United States and Southeast Asia;
-   Expanded English language training programs in Southeast Asia;
-   Announced the launch of the U.S.-ASEAN Institute for Rising Leaders
    at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International
    Studies.

At a moment when two-thirds of the ASEAN region is 35 or younger, the
voices of youth leaders are more important than ever.  Our commitment to
deepening people-to-people ties and emboldening the leaders of the next
generation is marked by nearly 6,000 Young Southeast Asian Leaders
Initiative program alumni and the YSEALI network’s more than 150,000
members.  Building off Indonesia’s ASEAN chair year theme, “ASEAN
Matters: Epicentrum of Growth,” the “YSEALI Matters Forum: Leading with
Impact” is bringing together 40 YSEALI alumni for a two-day program in
Indonesia on the sidelines of the U.S.-ASEAN Summit.  In addition, U.S.
and Southeast Asian experts and officials will lead sessions and offer
their expertise.  Discussions will focus on impactful leadership,
harnessing social media, the potential of artificial intelligence as a
vehicle for public good, taking action through private-public
partnerships, and the intersection of community and civic engagement.  

During her trip to Jakarta, the Vice President will have an opportunity
to meet  these YSEALI delegates, recognize the critical role youth play
in advancing ASEAN centrality, and underscore the United States’
enduring commitment to young leaders and the future prosperity and
security of Southeast Asia.

**YOUNG SOUTHEAST ASIA LEADERS INITIATIVE (YSEALI)**

2023 marks the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Young Southeast Asian
Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), the U.S. Government’s signature leadership
development and networking program for youth across Southeast Asia. 

YSEALI seeks to build the leadership capabilities of youth in the
region, strengthen ties between the people of the United States and
Southeast Asia, and nurture a community of leaders who work across
borders to solve shared issues.

YSEALI is open to young people ages 18-35 from all Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries (Burma, Brunei,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam) and Timor-Leste. Responding to priorities from
youth in Southeast Asia, YSEALI programs focus on four themes: Civic
Engagement; Economic Empowerment and Social Entrepreneurship; Education;
and Environmental Issues

YSEALI opportunities include professional and academic exchanges in the
United States, regional workshops and the YSEALI Academy at Fulbright
University Vietnam for networking and skills development, digital media
engagement, and a YSEALI *Seeds for the Future* grant competition to
support emerging leaders’ efforts to address regional issues.

On the margins of the U.S.-ASEAN Summit, the United States is announcing
YSEALI Next, an alumni network executive steering committee to advise on
YSEALI’s future goals by charting the next ten years of YSEALI from a
program participant perspective. The committee will have members from
each of the 10 ASEAN member states and Timor-Leste, representing the
geographic, racial, religious, and ethnic diversity of Southeast Asia.

Alumni and network members are committed to leading positive change in
the areas of civic engagement; economic empowerment and social
entrepreneurship; education access; and environment and sustainability. 
YSEALI members represent the breadth and diversity of ASEAN, but they
all exemplify the YSEALI motto: never too young to lead. 

The United States will continue to engage and empower ASEAN youth and
young professionals through YSEALI.  Since January 2023, more than 6,700
YSEALI members have taken YSEALI Learns online courses.  The U.S.
Department of State is also on track to double the number of YSEALI
professional and academic fellowship exchange opportunities from 450
to900 by 2025. 

**COOPERATION THROUGH EDUCATION**

Beyond YSEALI, the United States engages with ASEAN member countries
through high school, university, and professional and cultural exchange
programs, grants, and more.  The Department of State has awarded 269
grants to alumni of our exchange programs from ASEAN member states, runs
7,500 programs at 51 American Spaces in ASEAN countries; and has
nominated more than 48,000 students, researchers, and professionals from
ASEAN member states to U.S. government-funded academic and professional
programs.
