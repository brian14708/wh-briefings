title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Jimmy\_Buffett"
---
 
A poet of paradise, Jimmy Buffett was an American music icon who
inspired generations to step back and find the joy in life and in one
another.  
   
His witty, wistful songs celebrate a uniquely American cast of
characters and seaside folkways, weaving together an unforgettable
musical mix of country, folk, rock, pop, and calypso into something
uniquely his own.  
   
We had the honor to meet and get to know Jimmy over the years, and he
was in life as he was performing on stage – full of goodwill and joy,
using his gift to bring people together.  
   
Over more than 50 studio and live albums and thousands of performances
to devoted Parrot Heads around the world, Jimmy reminded us how much the
simple things in life matter – the people we love, the places we’re
from, the hopes we have on the horizon.  
   
A two-time Grammy nominee and winner of multiple country music awards,
he was also a best-selling writer, businessman, pilot, and
conservationist who championed the waters and Gulf Coast that he so
loved.  
   
Jill and I send our love to his wife of 46 years, Jane; to their
children, Savannah, Sarah, and Cameron; to their grandchildren; and to
the millions of fans who will continue to love him even as his ship now
sails for new shores.
