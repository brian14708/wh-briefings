title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on North Carolina Enacting Medicaid\_\
  Expansion"
---
 
Every American deserves high-quality affordable health care. Period. So
I applaud Governor Cooper and the bipartisan elected officials who have
made North Carolina the 40th state to expand Medicaid under the
Affordable Care Act. Thanks to their leadership, 600,000 North
Carolinians will finally have access to affordable, quality coverage
under Medicaid – many for the first time in their lives. The expansion
will also benefit rural hospitals across the state and invest in
critical mental health resources. I commend Governor Cooper for his
years of leadership fighting to get this monumental step forward for
North Carolina families done. Every day my Administration works to bring
down the cost of health care for all Americans, and I’ll continue to
urge leaders, especially those in states who have not yet expanded
Medicaid, to join our efforts.
