  \ for Ukraine\u2019s Economic\_Recovery"

Today, I am proud to announce that I am appointing Penny Pritzker to
serve as the new U.S. Special Representative for
Ukraine’s Economic Recovery.

As an accomplished public servant, former Secretary of Commerce, and
transformative industry leader—with deep familial ties to
Ukraine—Special Representative Pritzker brings decades of experience and
expertise to this critical position. Working in lockstep with the
Ukrainian government, our allies and partners, international financial
institutions, and the private sector, she will drive the United States’
efforts to help rebuild the Ukrainian economy. This includes mobilizing
public and private investment, shaping donor priorities, and working to
open export markets and businesses shut down by Russia’s brutal attacks
and destruction.  Special Representative Pritzker will also work with
Ukraine’s other international partners, including via the G7
coordination platform, to ensure that international efforts are
complementary and mutually reinforcing, as well as to encourage
international partners to keep stepping up their support for Ukraine’s
immediate economic recovery needs. Special Representative Pritzker will
help the Ukrainian government make reforms needed to strengthen its
economy, and Special Representative Pritzker will work with Ukraine to
help ensure that as Ukraine begins to rebuild, it rebuilds stronger.

As we take this next step to help Ukraine forge a stronger future, we
remain steadfastly committed to helping it defend its freedom today. The
brave people of Ukraine have inspired the world with their resilience
and resolve, and as this announcement reaffirms, the United
States remains committed to stand with them, for as long as it takes.
