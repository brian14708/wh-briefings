title: Statement by National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Explosion
  at Fuel Depot in Nagorno-Karabakh
---
 
We are saddened by the news that at least 68 people have been
killed and hundreds injured in an explosion at a fuel depot in
Nagorno-Karabakh and express deep sympathy to the residents of
Nagorno-Karabakh and to all of those suffering.  We urge continued
humanitarian access to Nagorno-Karabakh for all those in need.  The
United States will continue to support those affected by the ongoing
crisis as 28,000 people have crossed into Armenia from Nagorno-Karabakh.
Administrator Power is on the ground and today, the United States is
announcing additional humanitarian assistance to address health care and
other emergency needs, helping local communities provide shelter and
essential supplies – such as hygiene kits, blankets, and clothing – to
address the needs of those affected or displaced by violence in
Nagorno-Karabakh.  Since 2020, we have supported the provision of food,
water, emergency medical care and evacuations, and family reunifications
for conflict-affected communities in Nagorno-Karabakh and the region.
