Vice President Kamala Harris is attending the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and the
East Asia Summit in Jakarta, Indonesia from September 5-7, to reaffirm
the United States’ enduring commitment to Southeast Asia and ASEAN
centrality. The Biden-Harris Administration’s 2024 budget requested an
unprecedented $1.2 billion in economic, development, and security
assistance for the nations of Southeast Asia, in addition to $90 million
dedicated solely to engagement with ASEAN and efforts to strengthen
ASEAN institutions. Building on the success of the 2022 U.S.-ASEAN
Special Summit in Washington, DC, these resources are intended to
support the robust implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the
Indo-Pacific and ensure U.S.-ASEAN cooperation delivers concrete
benefits for the people of Southeast Asia, the United States, and the
broader Indo-Pacific.

At the 2022 U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh, the United States and ASEAN
took the historic step of upgrading our relationship to a *Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership* (CSP). To ensure this elevated partnership
reaches its full potential, the leaders of ASEAN and the United States
are announcing their intent to establish, through a public-private
partnership, a <u>U.S.-ASEAN Center in Washington, DC</u>. The Center
will serve as a key hub for ASEAN’s engagement with the United States.
Subject to consultations between ASEAN and the United States, the
Center’s future activities may include:

-   Facilitating official U.S.-ASEAN engagements, and building deeper
    habits of cooperation between ASEAN and the full range of U.S.
    departments and agencies;
-   Enhancing connectivity among ASEAN and the U.S. private sector, with
    particular attention to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
    as well as civil society;
-   Arranging cultural and educational activities aimed at strengthening
    ties among the combined one billion people of the United States and
    ASEAN;
-   Conducting research to support and elevate the substantive work of
    the U.S.-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership; and
-   Facilitating capacity-building programs that advance the shared
    objectives and vision of the United States and ASEAN.

Under the auspices of the U.S.-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership, President Biden and Vice President Harris have already
overseen an unprecedented expansion in U.S.-ASEAN relations, marked by
the launch of new ministerial dialogue processes on health, environment
and climate, energy, transportation, and women’s empowerment, as well as
elevated engagement within existing dialogue tracks on foreign affairs,
economics, and defense – led on the U.S. side by Secretary Becerra,
Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Kerry and Administrator Regan,
Secretary Granholm, Secretary Buttigieg, Administrator Power, Secretary
Blinken, Ambassador Tai, and Secretary Austin, respectively.
Additionally, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has
now extended the U.S.-ASEAN Regional Development Cooperation Agreement
to 2029, and the United States is rapidly scaling the Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment in Southeast Asia. In the years to
come, the United States and ASEAN will continue working together to
institutionalize and expand cooperation in each of these important
areas, in order to promote ASEAN as an “Epicentrum of Growth” and
advance a free and open region that is increasingly connected,
prosperous, secure, and resilient.

INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE INNOVATION ECONOMY, AND HIGH-QUALITY
INFRASTRUCTURE

The Biden-Harris Administration continues to strengthen U.S. economic
cooperation with Southeast Asia and ASEAN in pursuit of inclusive growth
and broad-based prosperity. The United States is the largest source of
foreign direct investment in Southeast Asia, and more than 6,200 U.S.
businesses have contributed to a record $520.3 billion in total trade
between the United States and the nations of ASEAN in 2022, creating
625,000 jobs in all 50 states and 1 million jobs throughout Southeast
Asia. 

In August 2023, U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Tai co-chaired a
ministerial with ASEAN economic ministers, deepening cooperation on
trade facilitation, good regulatory practices, the digital economy, and
support for SMEs. Ministers also endorsed the 2023-2024 ASEAN-U.S. Trade
and Investment Framework Arrangement and Expanded Economic Engagement
Work Plan. In June 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
co-chaired a U.S.-ASEAN Senior Officials Dialogue on Transportation in
preparation for a U.S.-ASEAN transportation ministerial, deepening
U.S.-ASEAN cooperation on transportation infrastructure and the
development of a regional electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. Key
U.S.-ASEAN economic initiatives include:

-   Infrastructure Financing: At the ASEAN Indo-Pacific Forum in
    Jakarta, U.S. Trade and Development Agency Director Enoh Ebong is
    announcing new activities designed to leverage over $8 billion in
    financing across ASEAN to promote the development of sustainable
    infrastructure and regional connectivity. These initiatives catalyze
    $3 billion in climate financing that advances ASEAN’s net zero
    goals, and $5 billion in public and private financing for investment
    in digital infrastructure, transportation, healthcare, and smart
    cities in ASEAN countries.
-   Catalyzing Private Sector Investment: The U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation is announcing nearly $600 million in
    new financing for private sector investments across Southeast Asia
    that will spur economic growth, advance financial inclusion,
    leverage technology to expand access to education and healthcare,
    and support food and energy security. This includes a $100 million
    loan portfolio guarantee to support lending to micro, small, and
    medium-sized enterprises in Indonesia and a $15 million equity
    investment to support the creation and growth of climate tech
    start-ups that improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions
    across Southeast Asia.
