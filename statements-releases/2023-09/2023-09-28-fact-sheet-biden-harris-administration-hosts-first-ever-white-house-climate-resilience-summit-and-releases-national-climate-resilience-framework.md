*In conjunction with White House Summit on Building Climate Resilient
Communities, Administration announces more than $500 million in
additional investment for resilience*

Across the country, Americans are experiencing the devastating impacts
of climate change. In just the first eight months of the year, there
have been [23 separate billion-dollar weather and climate
disasters](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/) – more than any
other year on record. And the longer-term effects of climate change –
including sea-level rise, hotter average temperatures, changing
precipitation patterns, and more – are affecting every corner of society
and every community in America.

That’s why President Biden is leading the most ambitious climate,
conservation, and environmental justice agenda in history. Today
President Biden is fulfilling a
[commitment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/19/remarks-by-president-biden-on-climate-resilience-palo-alto-ca/)
he made in June to host the first-ever **White House Summit on Building
Climate Resilient Communities**. This Summit, which will include
representatives from more than 25 states, territories, and Tribal
Nations, underscores the Administration’s commitment to solutions that
will both dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions *and* better
manage climate threats, and recognizes the importance of locally
tailored, community-driven strategies.

The Summit will amplify the leadership of climate resilience
practitioners nationwide – the construction workers, educators, resource
managers, city and state resilience officers, emergency managers, local
and Tribal leaders, and many others who are striving to help their
communities adapt to today’s climate impacts and prepare for future
climate risks. It also provides an opportunity for practitioners and
senior Administration officials from more than 15 federal departments
and agencies to jointly discuss needs and opportunities for future
climate resilience efforts, including maximizing the impact of the [more
than $50
billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-makes-historic-investments-to-build-community-climate-resilience/)
for climate resilience in President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,
as well as President Biden’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and
Resilience
([PREPARE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PREPARE-Action-Plan.pdf)),
which builds climate resilience in developing countries.

In conjunction with the Summit, the Administration is releasing the
**National Climate Resilience Framework**, a vision for a climate
resilient Nation designed to guide and align climate resilience
investments and activities by the federal government and its partners.
The Framework identifies common principles and specific actions to
expand and accelerate progress towards six objectives:

Additionally, the Administration is announcing today more than a dozen
new actions – including the awarding or availability of more than **$500
million in dedicated funding** – to help build a climate resilient
Nation, and commitments from major philanthropies to expand financial
support for climate resilience and align investments with national
climate resilience priorities.

Today’s announcements come on the heels of a historic stretch of actions
and investments through President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to
bolster climate resilience nationwide. Just last week, President Biden
took executive action to launch the [American Climate
Corps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-american-climate-corps-to-train-young-people-in-clean-energy-conservation-and-climate-resilience-skills-create-good-paying-jobs-and-tackle-the-clima/)
– a workforce training and service initiative that will mobilize more
than 20,000 young Americans to help build a more sustainable, resilient
nation. And in the past two months, the Administration has also invested
billions to [combat extreme heat and storm-induced flooding by expanding
urban
forests](https://www.fs.usda.gov/news/releases/usda-invests-1-billion-nearly-400-projects-expand-access-trees-and-green-spaces),

*Today’s actions include:*

**Boosting Climate Resilience in Buildings**

-   Transitioning the Building Sector to Zero Emissions. The Department
    of the Treasury issued guidance this week on the 45L new energy
    efficient home tax credit that offers up to $5,000 to eligible
    contractors who construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate an energy
    efficient home to meet EPA Energy Star Certification and DOE’s Zero
    Energy Ready Homes Certification. This comes on the heels of the
    Department of Energy [opening applications for $400
    million](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-400-million-states-improve-building-energy)
    for states and territories to adopt and implement building energy
    codes that reduce utility bills, increase efficiency, lower
    greenhouse gas emissions that fuel the climate crisis, and make
    buildings more resilient to climate disaster.
-   Strengthening the Power Grid for States and Tribes. The Department
    of Energy (DOE) is announcing the eighth cohort of its [Grid
    Resilience State and Tribal Formula
    Grants](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-resilience-statetribal-formula-grant-program#:~:text=On%20September%205%2C%202023%2C%20the,State%20and%20Tribal%20Formula%20Grants.).
    This cohort includes $167.7 million in awards from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law across 11 states, 2 territories, and 20 Tribes.
    With this cohort, DOE has now awarded more than $748 million to
    modernize the electric grid to reduce impacts of climate-driven
    extreme weather and natural disasters, while also ensuring power
    sector reliability.
-   Promoting Climate Resilient Building and Energy Codes and Standards.
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Mitigation
    Framework Leadership Group, which works with federal agencies to
    advance hazard risk reduction across the nation, is issuing a set of
    Federal best practices for incorporating latest consensus-based
    codes and above-code standards to achieve climate resilience and
    greenhouse gas reduction in physical assets that are funded with
    federal dollars. This publication is a product of the [National
    Initiative to Advance Building
    Codes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-initiative-to-modernize-building-codes-improve-climate-resilience-and-reduce-energy-costs/).
-   Advancing Federal Agency Leadership in Climate Adaptation Planning.
    Federal agencies are taking action to build a resilient government
    through the implementation of their Climate Adaptation Plans, which
    are roadmaps that agencies developed to adapt physical assets and
    operations to climate risk. The White House Council on Environmental
    Quality and Office of Management and Budget are directing agencies
    to use a data-driven, climate science-based approach to evaluate
    their climate risk and develop resilience and adaptation strategies
    that will ensure more resilient federal operations and a resilient
    workforce.  

**Strengthening Local Engagement and Partnerships**

-   Establishing New Community Climate Resilience Centers. The
    Department of Energy is announcing the recipients – in Arizona,
    California, Maryland, Michigan, and North Carolina – of a combined
    $5 million to establish Climate Resilience Centers. These centers
    will improve the use and utility of DOE climate science and
    engagement with local communities to address local climate
    resilience challenges while also supporting Historically Black
    Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions.
-   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Climate
    Adaptation Partnerships program (CAP/RISA) is announcing eight new
    awards totaling approximately $3.9 million. Funded projects will
    work cross-regionally – in flood-impacted communities everywhere
    from Hawai’i and the U.S. Caribbean to the East Coast and in
    wildfire-impacted communities in Colorado and New Mexico – over the
    next three to four years to test, scale, and transfer knowledge that
    builds national adaptation capacity. Projects will also generate
    locally relevant knowledge and strategies to reduce risks from
    flooding and wildfires in frontline communities.

<!-- -->

-   NOAA will grow support for equitable adaptation by extending the
    reach of the CAP/RISA network to the Central Midwest (Kansas,
    Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska). This is the first time there has been
    a CAP/RISA program in this region. This new CAP/RISA will focus on
    engaging Tribal Nations and women farmland owners in a community of
    learning about inland climate adaptation and community resilience.
-   In alignment with the Administration’s policy goals, philanthropic
    organizations are leveraging new federal funding from President
    Biden’s Investing in America agenda and committing resources to
    advance actions that help communities plan for and adapt to a
    changing climate. A [dozen philanthropic
    organizations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Philanthropic-contributions_WH-Summit-on-Building-Climate-Resilient-Communities_092723.pdf)
    have invested more than a combined $800 million in complementary
    climate resilience priorities – and are committed to continuing to
    work with the federal government, communities, and local leaders on
    opportunities to further advance shared policy priorities and
    climate resilience goals.

**Bolstering Workforce and Community Benefits**

-   The Department of Labor is awarding $16 million to support
    organizations in 12 states as they pilot strategies to improve job
    quality and increase the availability of good jobs in the critical
    sectors of climate resilience, care, and hospitality. The Critical
    Sectors Job Quality grants being announced today will enable
    recipients to design and deploy programs that align with the [Good
    Jobs Principles](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/principles)
    developed by the Departments of Labor and Commerce, leveraging
    workforce strategies, such as sector partnerships with workers and
    employers, to create good climate resilience jobs to benefit workers
    and employers. Programs will expand career awareness, provide
    training, and improve access to quality jobs within the climate
    resilience sector for historically underrepresented and underserved
    communities.
-   NOAA will award $12.7 million through its Climate Smart Communities
    Initiative (CSCI) to help communities protect people, property,
    infrastructure, economies and natural resources from climate-related
    hazards. CSCI will work to support communities by helping them to
    identify and use climate science data and tools needed to understand
    their exposure to climate-related hazards, and to use that
    information to create and implement climate resilience plans.
-   . The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is announcing the
    Pacific Islands Cultural Initiative, a $1.3 million investment to
    fortify cultural heritage and resilience in the U.S. Pacific
    Islands. In August 2023, NEH awarded $2 million to cultural and
    educational organizations, Tribal Nations, and municipalities
    through its new Cultural and Community Resilience and Climate Smart
    Humanities Organizations programs, which support community-based and
    strategic planning efforts to safeguard cultural resources and
    foster cultural resilience against the impacts of climate change.
-   The Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and Administration
    for Strategic Preparedness and Response in the Department of Health
    and Human Services (HHS) is launching a new Climate and Health
    Outlook Portal. Built on the data underlying the HHS Climate and
    Health Outlook, the Portal features interactive county-level maps
    with heat, wildfire, and drought forecasts for the current month,
    along with individual-level climate health risk factors. This tool,
    being released in initial beta form, is designed for emergency
    response and health care professionals to support planning and
    preparation for the potential impacts of these climate hazards and
    assist the public with learning more about the climate-related
    health risks they may face in their county.

**Ensuring Resilient Lands and Waters**

-   . The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation is
    announcing up to $328 million in funding available through President
    Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and annual appropriations to
    help make Western communities more resilient to drought and climate
    change, including in the Colorado River Basin. Funding will support
    grants for water desalination, water recycling and reuse, and small
    water storage projects. In addition, earlier this week, NOAA
    announced availability of $2 million in funds through the National
    Integrated Drought Information System to support Tribal Nations in
    addressing current and future drought risk on Tribal lands across
    the western United States.
-   Earlier this week, the Wildland Fire Management and Mitigation
    Commission, established by President Biden’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law, released a report recommending improvements to
    Federal policies related to preventing, mitigating, suppressing, and
    managing wildland fires, as well as rehabilitating affected lands.
-   . Earlier this week, the Department of the Interior’s National Park
    Service and the nonprofit American Forests signed a five-year
    agreement to help return the threatened whitebark pine to its range
    in the northern Rockies. At least half of all whitebark pines have
    died in recent decades due to threats including climate change,
    negatively affecting the long-term outlook for this critical
    keystone plant species. The new partnership, made possible through
    funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, will support restoration
    activities in national parks where whitebark pine grow – making
    whitebark pine ecosystems more resilient to climate impacts – and
    advance the Interior Department’s National Seed Strategy.
