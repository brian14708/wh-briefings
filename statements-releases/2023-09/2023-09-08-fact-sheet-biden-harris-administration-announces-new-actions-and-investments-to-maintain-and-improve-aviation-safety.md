*Following Mike Whitaker’s nomination to lead FAA, the Biden-Harris
Administration announces new actions to maintain and improve aviation
safety*

Following President Biden’s nomination of Mike Whitaker to lead the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Biden-Harris Administration
is announcing new actions and investments to maintain and improve
aviation safety – which builds on the $25 billion in investments in
airport infrastructure from the Administration’s Investing in America
agenda. These initiatives will further enhance safety while fostering
new technology and expanding the economic benefits of American aviation.

However, the Administration cannot do this alone. Congress must also
commit to supporting the FAA’s safety efforts. Without sufficient
funding levels and continued investment in safety, the current standard
Americans expect could be jeopardized in the future. That is also why
Congress should move immediately to confirm Mike Whitaker.  At a time
when the FAA faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities—thanks to
quickly evolving technology and all-time high demand for air travel—
Whitaker’s extensive leadership and aviation experience are critical.

**Safety Investment Initiatives  
**  
U.S. airspace is the safest in the world because of our unwavering focus
on the highest standards, as well as our commitment to stay vigilant and
address potential risks. Building on that commitment, today the
Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a $26 million investment to
improve aviation safety:

1) *Surface Awareness Initiative* – To improve controller situational
awareness and reduce close-calls on the runway, the FAA will deploy
surface surveillance systems to airports that do not already have this
technology.

2) *Approach Runway Verification ***– **To prevent incorrect runway
landings that can result in close-calls, the FAA will expand its
terminal automation system, which will provide Air Traffic Controllers
alerts about aircraft alignments, to 84 airports.

3) *Runway Incursion Device* **–** The FAA will deploy a memory aid
device used by controllers for occupied and closed runways to 72
additional airports. This device provides a visual and audible alert to
remind controllers to check the runway before issuing clearances.  
  
**Biden-Harris Administration Actions to Date**  
  
Since Day 1, the Biden-Harris Administration has acted to maintain and
improve aviation safety.  
  
***Investments***  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is making critical investments,
including:

-   $15 billion through the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
    upgrade airport infrastructure, including runway and taxiway safety
    enhancement projects such as:  
    -   Dickinson/Theodore Roosevelt Regional Airport, Dickinson, North
        Dakota—$2 million for runway extension, runway vertical/visual
        guidance system installation, and to reconstruct taxiway and
        runway lighting.  
    -   Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Texas—$30 million to
        construct aircraft rescue & firefighting building.  
    -   Marshall Don Hunter Sr Airport, Marshall, Alaska—$16 million for
        runway lighting, runway rehabilitation, and surface projects.  
    -   Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, Birmingham,
        Alabama—$3 million to construct/extend/improve safety area.
-   $5 billion through the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
    upgrade FAA-owned airport traffic control towers. The focus on
    backlog items will help to improve safety and security.  
-   $121 million for airports to reduce runway risk, including projects
    to reconfigure taxiways, install new lighting systems, and provide
    more flexibility on the airfield. This includes:  
    -   Boston Logan International, Massachusetts—$44.9 million to
        simplify airfield layout.  
    -   Willow Run Airport, Detroit, Michigan—$12.8 million to construct
        a 6,720-foot parallel Taxiway A to eliminate the need for
        aircraft to back-taxi on the runway.  
    -   Naples Municipal Airport, Florida—$3.5 million to improve
        non-standard pavement geometry and reconstruct 3,000 feet of the
        existing service road to enable the safe movement of vehicles
        and ground service equipment.  
-   Hiring 1,500 air traffic controllers in 2023 to provide needed
    capacity nationwide.

***Maintaining the Highest Standards***  
  
In 2023, the FAA has taken a number of actions to ensure that we
continue to uphold the highest safety standards. This includes the
National Safety Summit—the first of its kind since 2009—which brought
together more than 200 aviation safety leaders from across the industry
to discuss ways to enhance flight safety. In addition, the FAA:

-   Formed an independent Safety Review Team that will present concrete
    recommendations on how the FAA can continue to enhance safety.  
-   Launched Stand Up for Safety Campaign, in collaboration with the
    National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), which included
    mandatory special emphasis training for the controller workforce.  
-   Issued safety directives to airlines with specific safety steps for
    pilots, airlines, and others to take to reinforce proper procedure
    and awareness.  
-   Facilitating approximately 90 runway safety meetings at airports
    across the country, including LaGuardia Airport, Dallas Fort Worth
    International Airport, and Baltimore-Washington International
    Thurgood Marshall, to identify and address airport-specific risk in
    the surface environment.

The Biden-Harris Administration is asking Congress to take similar steps
to ensure the safety of Americans and the success of American aviation: 

1) **Quickly confirm Mike Whitaker to lead the FAA.** The FAA has been
without permanent leadership for nearly a year and a half, after
undeserved attacks against, and procedural obstruction of, the
President’s prior nominee. 

2) **Reauthorize the FAA in a timely manner**. The Administration is
focused on ensuring that the aviation sector works well for the American
people, and reauthorizing the FAA in a timely manner will help achieve
that goal. If there is a lapse in authorization, the FAA would not be
able to collect revenues used to fund the national airspace system. This
means an average of about $1.5 billion per month would not be
collected—money that could have gone to improve the aviation system.

3) **Approve the Administration’s budget anomaly requests and keep the
government funded**. The anomaly requests will allow the FAA to continue
to hire to meet the vital goal of 1,800 new air traffic controllers in
2024, and fully support implementation of ongoing airspace safety
infrastructure projects. The anomaly requests should be included as part
of a forthcoming short-term continuing resolution needed to avoid severe
disruptions to government services in the first quarter of the fiscal
year.  
  
4) **Fully fund the FAA in FY2024 at levels the Administration
requested,** which includes approximately $456 million that the House
did not fund. For example, the House proposed $12 million less for the
system that allows airlines to access flight plans, Notice to Air
Missions (NOTAMs), and weather information. The Administration’s
proposed funding would allow the FAA to immediately make key safety
improvements.
