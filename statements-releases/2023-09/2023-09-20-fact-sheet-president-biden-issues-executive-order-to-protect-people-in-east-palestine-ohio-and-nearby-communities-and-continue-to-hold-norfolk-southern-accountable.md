title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Issues Executive Order to Protect People in East\
  \ Palestine, Ohio and Nearby Communities, and Continue to Hold Norfolk Southern\_\
  Accountable"

*President Biden directs FEMA to appoint a Federal Disaster Recovery
Coordinator*  
*to oversee long-term recovery efforts in the community*  
  
*The President also announces new steps to ensure Norfolk Southern
continues meeting its obligations to the community*

Since the onset of the Norfolk Southern train derailment, the
Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a robust, whole-of-government
response to support the people of East Palestine, Ohio, and nearby
affected communities. Under President Biden’s leadership, within hours
of the derailment, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) deployed a
team to East Palestine to support state and local emergency and
environmental response efforts. The Department of Transportation (DOT)
also arrived on scene to investigate what led to the derailment, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) closely coordinated with the
Governor, Ohio Emergency Management Agency and Federal and local
partners, and Federal officials went door to door to check on
families.  
  
President Biden pledged he would make Norfolk Southern clean up its mess
in East Palestine, and he meant it. EPA ordered Norfolk Southern to
clean up environmental damage caused by the derailment, including
cleaning or disposing of contaminated soil and water resources, as well
as reimbursing the government’s response costs. The EPA and state and
local partners are continuing to test the air, soil, and water for
dangerous contaminants. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to
ensure Norfolk Southern complies with the Federal Unilateral
Administrative Order it was issued to cover all cleanup costs, and
Federal officials remain on the ground and will continue to closely
monitor conditions in the affected communities for as long as it may
take to ensure the contamination is fully addressed.  
  
**As part of his commitment to the people of East Palestine, President
Biden is today issuing an Executive Order to ensure that Norfolk
Southern continues to be held accountable for this disaster, to address
any of the disaster’s long-term effects, **and to ensure federal
assistance is available to affected communities should needs develop
that are not met by Norfolk Southern.  
  
The Executive Order directs the following Federal agency actions:  
  
**Federal Emergency Management Agency**

-   Within five days of the Executive Order, FEMA will designate a
    Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator to oversee long-term recovery
    efforts in the affected communities. The Coordinator will conduct a
    comprehensive assessment of any unmet needs that are not addressed
    by Norfolk Southern and would qualify for Federal assistance. The
    Coordinator will also collaborate with the Federal, State and local
    governments, the private sector and voluntary, faith-based and
    community organizations supporting the recovery.  
     
-   The State of Ohio’s request for a major disaster declaration
    pursuant to the Stafford Act will be held open. If the FEMA
    Administrator receives new information from the State, including
    needs that are not being addressed by Norfolk Southern, she will
    immediately submit a recommendation on whether a major disaster
    declaration is warranted.

**Environmental Protection Agency**

-   EPA will continue to direct removal of contaminated soils and
    wastewater from the derailment site, in compliance with state and
    Federal law. In addition, EPA will ensure that any remaining
    contamination in surface stream sediments is addressed, and that air
    and water monitoring continue.  
     
-   Within 30 days, EPA will provide a report to the President on the
    status of air, soil, and water monitoring and whether Norfolk
    Southern continues to comply with the Federal Unilateral
    Administrative Order to address the imminent and substantial
    endangerment caused by the company’s derailment. Moving forward, EPA
    will provide the President with an updated report every 60 days
    until all cleanup, assessment, and monitoring work required by EPA’s
    Order has been completed. 

**Health and Human Services Administration**

-   Within 60 days, HHS will provide the President with a report
    summarizing key conclusions from the public health testing and
    assessment that has been conducted to date, and the resources HHS
    and the CDC have provided to address any health conditions related
    to the derailment.   
     
-   In coordination with the affected States, HHS will continue to
    monitor the public health consequences of the derailment, including
    to determine whether any acute medical conditions develop. If such
    medical conditions develop, HHS and EPA will each evaluate whether a
    public health emergency should be declared.  
     
-   HHS will provide technical assistance to the States of Ohio and
    Pennsylvania in the event that either State considers submitting a
    proposal for services through the Medicaid program for individuals
    affected by the derailment.

**Department of Transportation**

-   Within 60 days, DOT will provide the President with a report
    detailing the actions the Department is taking in response to the
    East Palestine train derailment. This report will be updated within
    120 days of the final National Transportation Safety Board
    investigation, and DOT will provide the President a preliminary set
    of follow-on actions to ensure accountability.
