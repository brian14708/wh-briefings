title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Passage of the Bipartisan Bill to Keep\
  \ the Government\_Open"
---
 
Tonight, bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate voted to keep the
government open, preventing an unnecessary crisis that would have
inflicted needless pain on millions of hardworking Americans. This bill
ensures that active-duty troops will continue to get paid, travelers
will be spared airport delays, millions of women and children will
continue to have access to vital nutrition assistance, and so much more.
This is good news for the American people.  
   
But I want to be clear: we should never have been in this position in
the first place. Just a few months ago, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a
budget agreement to avoid precisely this type of manufactured crisis.
For weeks, extreme House Republicans tried to walk away from that deal
by demanding drastic cuts that would have been devastating for millions
of Americans. They failed.  
   
While the Speaker and the overwhelming majority of Congress have been
steadfast in their support for Ukraine, there is no new funding in this
agreement to continue that support. We cannot under any circumstances
allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted. I fully expect the
Speaker will keep his commitment to the people of Ukraine and secure
passage of the support needed to help Ukraine at this critical moment.
