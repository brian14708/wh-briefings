title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Support\
  \ Children and Families in Foster\_Care"

*In honor of National Kinship Care Month, Administration releases a
historic package of regulations to ensure children in the child welfare
system thrive*

The more than 391,000 American children and youth living in foster care
deserve to grow up in safe and loving homes devoted to their health,
happiness, and success. These are often our most vulnerable children,
and we have a solemn responsibility as a country to ensure they grow up
healthy, supported and with as much opportunity as all other children.

From day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to
protect children and youth in the child welfare system, support the
thousands of dedicated kinship and foster families who are a critical
resource to children and families in times of need, and invest in
community-based child abuse and neglect prevention programs that help to
prevent the conditions that lead to kids entering foster care in the
first place.

Today, and in recognition of National Kinship Month, the Biden-Harris
Administration is building on this progress and releasing three landmark
regulations to strengthen services and supports for children and
families in the child welfare system. Specifically, the regulations
will:

-   Support kinship caregivers – family members and loved ones who step
    forward to care for a child in foster care – by making it easier for
    them to access resources and financial assistance.
-   Protect LGBTQI+ youth in foster care from abuse and mistreatment and
    ensure they have the services they need to thrive.
-   Expand access to legal services for children and families at risk of
    entering or in the child welfare system.

Taken together, this landmark package of new rules, issued by the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for
Children and Families, will advance equity in the child welfare system
and have a profound impact on the safety and wellbeing of families
across the country.

**Support kinship caregivers.** When parents are having a difficult time
safely caring for their own children, it is often grandparents, aunts,
uncles, and other relatives who step forward to provide a loving home
for those children, either temporarily or permanently. These kinship
caregivers help children stay connected to their families and cultural
identity, and research shows that children in foster care who are able
to live with their kin experience less trauma. But for too long, federal
regulations imposed significant burdens on these kinship caregivers by
making it harder for them to become foster families. Today, HHS has
issued a final regulation that will allow states to simplify the process
for kinship caregivers to become foster care providers, and require that
states provide these family members with the same financial support that
any other foster home would receive. This regulation will help families
across the country care for children in their extended family, and
receive the resources and financial supports they need and deserve.
These changes will advance the Administration’s priority of equity for
families who have been underserved and adversely affected by persistent
poverty. 

**Protect LGBTQI+ youth.** LGBTQI+ youth face profound disparities in
the foster care system. Because of family rejection and abuse, LGBTQI+
children are overrepresented in foster care where they face poor
outcomes, including mistreatment and discrimination because of who they
are. To address these disparities, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/15/executive-order-on-advancing-equality-for-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-individuals/)
directing HHS to protect LGBTQI+ youth in the foster care system. Today,
HHS is delivering on that promise by releasing a proposed regulation to
protect LGBTQI+ youth in foster care. The proposed rule would require
that every state’s child welfare agency ensure that LGBTQI+ children in
their care are placed in foster homes where they will be protected from
mistreatment related to their sexual orientation or gender identity,
where their caregivers have received special training on how to meet
their needs, and where they can access the services they need to thrive.

**Expand access to legal services.** Many families that come to the
attention of a child welfare agency are in the midst of or recovering
from familial, health, housing, or economic challenges. Children and
families in the child welfare system must navigate complex legal
proceedings related to these challenges, but are often forced to do so
without access to a lawyer. This makes it harder for families to achieve
stability and get the resources they need. Oftentimes access to legal
representation could avoid placing children in foster care. For example,
under this rule if a parent was seeking a restraining order from an
abusive spouse in order to keep their children safe and prevent their
removal from the home, a state could use federal funds to help that
parent access a lawyer to file a restraining order. Today, HHS is
releasing a proposed rule that will allow child welfare agencies to use
federal funds to expand access to legal services for families who need
access to a lawyer to achieve stability. In addition, the rule would
allow Tribes to be reimbursed for the legal costs of intervening in a
state foster care court proceeding over the parental rights of an Indian
child, which Tribes have the authority to do under the Indian Child
Welfare Act, but which can be costly for Tribes.

These new regulations build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s track
record of strengthening services for children and families in the child
welfare system, including:

-   Investing hundreds of millions of dollars in community-based child
    abuse and neglect prevention programs.
-   Proposing a $5 billion expansion of evidence-based foster care
    prevention services to allow more children to remain safely in their
    own homes with their own families.
-   Proposing a $9 billion expansion to provide housing vouchers to all
    20,000 youth exiting foster care annually — a key step in helping
    them secure stable housing during this difficult transition.
-   Working to help states place more children with relatives and other
    trusted adults instead of in group homes, and calling on Congress
    for an additional $1 billion to help youth aging out of foster care
    find a job, enroll in and afford higher education, obtain basic
    necessities, and access preventative health care
-   Calling on Congress to make the Adoption Tax Credit fully refundable
    and proposing extending it to legal guardians — including
    grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives.
-   Working with states to help youth aging out of the foster care
    system to stay in school, participate in job training programs, pay
    their bills, and transition to adulthood.
-   Expanding the Military Parental Leave Program, which enables service
    members to spend needed time with their families following a child’s
    adoption or placement in long-term foster care.
-   Bringing the child poverty rate to a historic low during the
    expanded Child Tax Credit, preventing children from being
    unnecessarily removed from their families because of poverty.
