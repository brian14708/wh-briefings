In the ten years since President Truong Tan Sang and President Barack

Charter, international law, and respect for each other’s political
system, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Vietnam
and the United States will continue to deepen cooperation in the
following areas to ensure the interests of the people of both countries
and contribute to peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity in the
region and in the world.   
   
**<u>POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS</u>**  
   
The two Leaders underscored the need to continue deepening political and
