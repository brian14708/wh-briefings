President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with President Luiz Inácio Lula da
Silva of Brazil today on the sidelines of the United Nations General
Assembly. The two leaders discussed the launch of the Partnership for
Workers’ Rights, the first joint U.S.-Brazil global initiative to
advance the rights of working people around the world, including how our
two countries will continue to work closely together to successfully
implement it and ways to elevate labor priorities in multilateral
forums.  
  
President Biden and President Lula noted the importance of the
restoration of democracy in Venezuela, and President Biden reiterated
the United States’ support for the people of Venezuela and outlined our
vision of a step-by-step approach where concrete actions toward
restoring Venezuelan democracy, leading to free and fair elections, are
met by corresponding sanctions relief by the United States.  
  
The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to cooperation on climate,
and discussed the importance of continuing to support Haiti as it deals
with a humanitarian and security crisis. President Biden urged President
Lula to support a Multinational Security Support mission to Haiti.
During the meeting, President Biden expressed concern about the global
effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine, particularly on food and energy
security, especially on the poorest nations on the planet, and voiced
support for the return of Russia to the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
