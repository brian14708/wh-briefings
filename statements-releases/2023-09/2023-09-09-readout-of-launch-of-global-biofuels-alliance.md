title: "Readout of Launch of Global Biofuels\_Alliance"
---
 
President Biden has made turning the tide towards a clean energy
transition one of his Administration’s top priorities.  Tackling the
climate crisis requires global action, and while in New Delhi, India,
for the G20 Leaders’ Summit, President Biden has continued to build
innovative partnerships as part of a global effort to combat climate
change.

Today, on the margins of the G20 Leaders’ Summit, President Biden joined
Indian Prime Minister Modi and leaders from Argentina, Brazil, Italy,
Mauritius, and the UAE to launch the Global Biofuels Alliance, a
partnership to make progress in our shared commitment to deploy cleaner,
greener fuels around the world that help meet our decarbonization
goals.  Leaders from Bangladesh and Singapore also attended as observer
countries to the alliance.

The Alliance is focused on securing the supply of biofuels, ensuring
these biofuels remain affordable and are produced sustainably.  Founding
members of the Alliance will continue outreach to other countries
committed to these shared values with the goal of adding more countries
to this effort.
