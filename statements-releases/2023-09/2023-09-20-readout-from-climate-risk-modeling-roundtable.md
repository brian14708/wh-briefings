title: "Readout from Climate Risk Modeling\_Roundtable"
---
 
Last week, the Council of Economic Advisers, in coordination with the
Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Clean Energy Innovation
and Implementation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the
Council on Environmental Quality, hosted a roundtable discussion on
climate modeling for risk management applications. The meeting brought
together leaders of U.S. climate modeling centers with academic experts
on climate risk, representatives from the insurance, reinsurance, and
catastrophe risk modeling industries, Federal and state financial
regulators, and representative from Federal agencies tasked with
managing climate risks.

The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the economic, financial, and
fiscal risks posed by climate change. Shortly after taking office,
President Biden signed an Executive Order on [Climate-Related Financial
Risk](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/)
which directs agencies across the Federal government to take steps to
quantify and manage climate-related risks. This work – along with
broader adaptation and resilience efforts across the U.S. – requires
high-quality, actionable, decision-relevant information on physical
climate risks.

Discussions focused around recommendations detailed in the April 2023
report on [Extreme Weather Risk in a Changing
Climate](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PCAST_Extreme-Weather-Report_April2023.pdf)
from the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. The
report highlights the challenge of managing extreme weather risks in a
setting where historic experience cannot be assumed to represent current
risks, and highlights opportunities to provide improved information to
support risk management and risk reduction decisions.

Major topics of discussion included:

1.  How to further greater scientific focus and more transparent,
    peer-reviewed research on climate risk modeling and the important
    role of Federal climate science institutions within this community;
2.  The importance of integrating climate vulnerability and exposure
    data with physical hazard information and how to address the
    institutional challenges of doing so;
3.  The need for highly granular information for climate risk management
    applications and how to address the scientific challenges of
    furthering data granularity;
4.  Challenges and opportunities in evaluating scientific quality and
    reliability of climate risk data in the private sector, and how to
    further public-private communities of practice on around these
    matters;
5.  The connection between climate risk modeling and actionable climate
    services to meet communities’ and decision-makers’ climate risk data
    and information needs.
