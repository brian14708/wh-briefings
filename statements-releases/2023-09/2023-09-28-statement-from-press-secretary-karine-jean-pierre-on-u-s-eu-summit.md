President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Charles Michel of
the European Council and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European
Commission to the White House on Friday, October 20, 2023 for the
second U.S.- EU Summit since President Biden took office.  

The leaders will review the strong cooperation between the United States
and the European Union, including our shared commitment to support
Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty and to impose costs on Russia for
its aggression.  

They will advance U.S.- EU efforts to accelerate the global clean energy
economy based on secure, resilient supply chains, and will continue
cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, including digital
infrastructure and artificial intelligence. 

They will also review joint activities to strengthen economic resilience
and to address related challenges.
