National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met on September 16-17 with
Chinese Communist Party Politburo Member, Director of the Office of the
Foreign Affairs Commission, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malta.  This
meeting was part of ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of
communication and responsibly manage the relationship.  The two sides
had candid, substantive, and constructive discussions, building on the
engagements between President Biden and President Xi in Bali, Indonesia
in November 2022.  This meeting follows on recent high-level
engagements, including between National Security Advisor Sullivan and
Director Wang Yi in May in Vienna as well as meetings between Secretary
Blinken, Secretary Yellen, Special Envoy Kerry, Secretary Raimondo, and
their counterparts in Beijing over the last several months.  The two
sides discussed key issues in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship,
global and regional security issues, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and
cross-Strait issues, among other topics.  The United States noted the
importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.  The two
sides committed to maintain this strategic channel of communication and
to pursue additional high-level engagement and consultations in key
areas between the United States and the People’s Republic of China in
the coming months.
