title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with the President\u2019s Intelligence\
  \ Advisory\_Board"
---
 
Yesterday, President Biden and members of his national security team met
with the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) to thank its
members and staff for their service and to discuss the Board’s efforts
to evaluate the U.S. Intelligence Community’s crucial work to protect
our Nation. The President expressed his appreciation for the Board’s
efforts to ensure the U.S. Intelligence Community’s authorities and
activities are effective and comply with law and policy, specifically
noting the Board’s recent study on the value of Section 702 of the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the vital intelligence collection
authority that will expire later this year unless renewed by Congress.
The President particularly welcomed the Board’s unanimous finding that
Congress’ failure to reauthorize Section 702 could be “one of the worst
intelligence failures of our time.” The President also discussed with
the Board how the Intelligence Community is set up to contribute to the
U.S. Government-wide effort to combat the threat posed by illicit
fentanyl. Lastly, the President emphasized his support for robust
oversight of the U.S. Government’s intelligence activities and commended
the Intelligence Oversight Board, a subset of the PIAB tasked with this
responsibility, for its ongoing work to ensure these activities comply
with the Constitution and all applicable laws, Executive Orders, and
Presidential Directives.
