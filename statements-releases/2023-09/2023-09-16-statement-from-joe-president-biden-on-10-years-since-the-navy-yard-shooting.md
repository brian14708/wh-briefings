title: "Statement from Joe President\_Biden on 10 Years Since the Navy Yard\_Shooting"
---
 
Ten years ago today at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington,
D.C., a shooter entered Building 197 and senselessly took 12 lives,
injured 8 others, and devastated the lives of countless others forever.
Days later, I visited survivors of this horrific attack in the hospital.
I’ll never forget their resilience and bravery in the face of
unthinkable violence and pain.  
   
One decade later, our work to end the scourge of gun violence in our
country is, sadly, far from over. Last year, I signed the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act into law, the most significant legislative action
in nearly 30 years to end gun violence. And I have now taken more
meaningful executive action than any president in American history to
try and make our schools, churches, grocery stores, and communities safe
from gun violence. But there is simply no replacement for Congressional
action. That is why I continue to call on Republicans in Congress to
stop standing in the way of universal background checks legislation, as
well as other commonsense legislation supported by a strong majority of
Americans, that can help end our nation’s gun violence epidemic once and
for all. Jill and I are praying for the survivors and those who continue
to grieve the loss of their loved ones today.
