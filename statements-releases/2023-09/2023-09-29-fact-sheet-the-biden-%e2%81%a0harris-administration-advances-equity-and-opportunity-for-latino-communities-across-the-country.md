title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Equity and Opportunity\
  \ for Latino Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
From the Latino business owners and workers who help fuel our nation’s
economy to the barrier-breaking Latino leaders the President has
appointed throughout the federal government, the Latino community has
embodied the truth that our diversity is our strength as a Nation. This
Hispanic Heritage Month, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to
celebrate the remarkable achievements and contributions of the Latino
community. Through the major laws and executive orders, the President
has signed — from the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction
Act, two executive orders on racial equity, and more — President Biden
and Vice President Harris will continue to invest in the future of
Latino communities.  
  
**Growing Economic Opportunity for Latino Families and Communities**  
President Biden’s economic plan — Bidenomics — is one that invests in
the future of all communities, including Latino communities, by making
smart public investments in America, empowering and educating workers to
grow the middle class, and promoting competition to lower costs and help
entrepreneurs and small businesses thrive. And this vision is already
delivering results. Bidenomics has:

-   Created 13.5 million jobs — including around 4 million for Latino
    workers — and achieved the lowest Latino unemployment rate on
    record.  
-   Achieved record low Latino child poverty rates in 2021, due in large
    part to the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the Child Tax
    Credit.  
-   Tripled the Earned Income Tax Credit for 17 million workers without
    dependent children — an estimated 26% of all workers benefitting are
    Latino.   
-   Began reversing decades of infrastructure disinvestment, including
    with $4 billion to reconnect communities that were previously cut
    off from economic opportunities by transportation infrastructure and
    to help advance transportation projects in underserved communities,
    including Latino communities.  
-   Began closing the digital divide for Latino families, with funding
    and a commitment to connect every person in America to reliable,
    affordable high-speed internet by 2030. Over a third of Latino
    households report not having high-speed internet at home.  
-   Delivered the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in
    American history, which disproportionately impacts communities of
    color: 29% of Latinos live within three miles of a Superfund site.

**Helping Latino-Owned Small Businesses Grow and Thrive**  
Under this Administration, Latino entrepreneurs have started new
businesses at the fastest rate in over 10 years — faster than any other
demographic in the country. To continue this momentum, the Biden-Harris
Administration has:

-   Improved the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) flagship loan
    guarantee programs to expand the availability of small dollar loans
    to underserved communities. Since fiscal year 2020, the number of
    SBA-backed business loans to Latino entrepreneurs increased by more
    than 80%.  
-   Launched a whole-of-government effort to expand access to federal
    contracts and awarded a record $69.9 billion to small disadvantaged
    businesses last fiscal year.  
-   Through Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program, invested
    $1.6 billion in Latino-owned and Latino-majority shareholder
    depository institutions.  
-   Through Treasury’s State Small Business Credit Initiative, provided
    $2.5 billion in funding and incentive allocations to support the
    provision of capital to underserved businesses — with $1 billion of
    these funds to be awarded to the jurisdictions that are most
    successful in reaching underserved businesses.

**Ensuring Equitable Educational Opportunity for Latino Students**  
To expand educational opportunity for the Latino community in K12 and
beyond, Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Secured a 30% increase in child care assistance funding last year.
    25% of families benefiting from federal child care assistance come
    from Latino families. Additionally, the President secured an
    additional $1 billion for Head Start, a program where more than a
    third of children and pregnant women who benefit identify as
    Latino.  
-   Through the American Rescue Plan, secured $130 billion — the largest
    investment in public education in history — to help students get
    back to school and recover academically in the wake of the COVID-19
    pandemic.  
-   Reestablished the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational
    Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics.  
-   Approved more than $117 billion in student loan debt cancellation
    for 3.4 million Americans and launched a new student loan repayment
    plan — the Saving on a Valuable Education plan — to help many
    students and families cut in half their total lifetime payments per
    dollar borrowed.  
-   Championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in the last decade –
    a combined increase of $900 to the maximum award over the past two
    years to benefit low – and middle-income students.  
-   Invested nearly $15 billion in Hispanic-serving colleges and
    universities, the largest investment in the future of Hispanic
    students in our entire history.   
-   Fixed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, so all qualified
    borrowers get the debt relief they are entitled to.  More than
    662,000 public servants have received more than $42 billion in loan
    forgiveness since October 2021.

**Empowering and Protecting Latino Workers**  
To empower and protect all workers, including Latino workers, the
Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Provided $40 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to States,
    localities, community colleges, and local organizations to deliver
    training, expand career paths, encourage more Registered
    Apprenticeships, provide retention and hiring bonuses in critical
    industries, and power efforts to help underserved Americans and
    those who face barriers to employment secure good jobs.  Individuals
    who identify as Hispanic now represent 22% of all apprentices,
    higher than their 18% share of the overall workforce.  
-   Protected workers, including Latino workers, who are suffering from
    extraordinarily high temperatures when they work outside by
    directing the Department of Labor to issue the first-ever Hazard
    Alert for heat and ramp up enforcement to protect workers from
    extreme heat.   
-   Updated Davis-Bacon prevailing wage standards for the first time in
    nearly 40 years, which will raise wages over time for one million
    construction workers, including Latino workers.  
-   Proposed a new rule to extend overtime pay to as many as 3.6 million
    workers — including 420,000 Latino workers — including by increasing
    the overtime salary threshold from about $36,000 per year to roughly
    $55,000 per year.

**Improving Health Outcomes for Latino Communities**  
President Biden believes that we are stronger as a Nation when we work
together to lift everyone’s well-being. To improve health outcomes for
Latinos, the Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Increased Latino enrollment in health care coverage through the
    Affordable Care Act by 900,000, or 53%, from 2020 to 2022, helping
    more Latinos gain health insurance than ever before.  
-   Through the Inflation Reduction Act, locked in lower monthly
    premiums and helped close the gap in access to medication by
    improving prescription drug coverage and lowering drug costs in
    Medicare.  Over the next 4 years, Medicare will negotiate prices for
    up to 60 drugs covered under Medicare Part D and Part B, and up to
    an additional 20 drugs every year after that.   
-   Allocated $7.6 billion through the American Rescue Plan to nearly
    1400 community health centers, which predominately serve Latinos and
    communities of color, and provided 69% of Latino uninsured adults
    access to a zero-premium plan and 80% access to a health plan for
    less than $50 a month.  
-   Made a historic $1.5 billion investment to grow and diversify the
    nation’s health care workforce through programs such as the National
    Health Service Corps, where 13% of primary care physicians are
    Latino (compared to 6% in the national physician workforce).  
-   Through the Department of Health and Human Service’s Language Access
    Steering Committee, prioritized providing access to language
    services appropriate to health and behavioral health care services
    to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for
    underserved communities, including Latinos.  
-   The Biden-Harris Administration is leading the most ambitious
    climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in history.
    This includes the [Justice40
    initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    which is delivering 40% of certain Federal investments in clean
    energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other
    programs to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and
    overburdened by pollution. The Administration is also working to
    replace every lead pipe in America, ensure millions of low-income
    households have access to affordable, clean solar energy through the
    Inflation Reduction Act, and more. In addition, just last week,
    President Biden launched the [American Climate
    Corps](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-american-climate-corps-to-train-young-people-in-clean-energy-conservation-and-climate-resilience-skills-create-good-paying-jobs-and-tackle-the-clima/)
    – a workforce training initiative that will put more than 20,000
    young people to work in the growing fields of clean energy,
    conservation and climate resilience, prioritizing equity and
    environmental justice in order to leverage the talents of all
    members of society.

**Improving Our Immigration System**  
The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to pursuing
immigration reform legislation, including a pathway to citizenship for
Dreamers and farm workers, , and will continue to call on Congress to
make long overdue reforms to the U.S. immigration laws. To improve our
immigration system, the Biden-Harris Administration:

-   Issued a Day 1 Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of
    Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, to
    take actions to preserve and fortify the 2012 Deferred Action for
    Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, under which eligible undocumented
    immigrant youth are provided temporary protection from removal and
    work authorization. In October 2022, the Department of Homeland
    Security issued a final rule codifying the DACA policy. The
    Department of Justice continues to defend DACA against legal
    challenges.  
-   Stood up programs that allow noncitizens to request appointments at
    ports of entry or apply for lawful pathways at overseas processing
    centers, in addition to creating a parole program for noncitizens
    from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.    
-   Provided continued protection to Salvadorians, Hondurans,
    Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans through Temporary Protected Status.  
-   Directed the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
    and the Secretary of State to improve naturalization processing,
    identify and remove barriers to naturalization, and reduce backlogs
    for naturalization applications.  Earlier this year and consistent
    with the President’s directive, United States Citizenship and
    Immigration Services published guidance to simplify the
    naturalization process for individuals serving in the U.S. armed
    forces, and to clarify naturalization processes for adopted
    children.

**Enhancing Public Trust and Strengthening Public Safety for Latino
Communities**  
Our criminal justice system must protect the public and ensure fair and
impartial justice for all. These are mutually reinforcing goals. To
enhance equal justice and public safety all communities, including the
Latino community, the President has:

-   Signed into the law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the
    most significant gun violence reduction legislation enacted in
    nearly 30 years, taken more meaningful executive action than any
    other president to make our schools, churches, grocery stores, and
    communities safer, and launched the first-ever White House Office of
    Gun Violence Prevention. Latinos are twice as likely to be a victim
    of gun violence and homicide.  
-   Signed a historic Executive Order to put federal policing on the
    path to becoming the gold standard of effectiveness and
    accountability by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to ban
    chokeholds; restrict no-knock warrants; mandate the use of body-worn
    cameras; implement stronger use-of-force policies; provide
    de-escalation training; submit use-of-force data; submit officer
    misconduct records into a new national accountability database; and
    restrict the sale or transfer of military equipment to local law
    enforcement agencies, among other things.   
-   Taken decisive and historic action to make America’s communities
    safer, including calling on Congress to invest roughly $25 billion
    in federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement to prevent and
    reduce crime through evidence-based strategies; protect civil
    rights; and fund additional officers for safe, effective,
    community-oriented policing consistent with the standards in the
    President’s Executive Order to enhance public trust and safety.  
-   Secured the first-ever dedicated funding stream for community
    violence intervention programs that have reduced violence by as much
    as 60%.
