title: "Statement from Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall on U.S.\
  \ Law Enforcement Taking Custody of Major Narcotics\_Defendant"
---
 
 Today, United States and Mexican law enforcement officials
successfully transferred custody to the U.S. Department of Justice of
Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of “El Chapo” who has been indicted for drug
trafficking, money laundering, and other violent crimes.  The
extradition of Lopez is testament to the significance of the ongoing
cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on countering
narcotics and other vital challenges, and we
thank our Mexican counterparts for their partnership in working to
safeguard our peoples from violent criminals.  We also recognize that
U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials and service members have made
the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty ensuring that there is
accountability and justice for those who break the law, and we will
remain forever grateful for their the brave and tireless efforts.  The
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to use every tool available to
aggressively counter the deadly scourge of fentanyl and other
narcotics that are killing so many Americans.
