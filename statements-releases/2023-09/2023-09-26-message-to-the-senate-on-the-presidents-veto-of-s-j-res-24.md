title: "Message to the Senate on the President\u2019s Veto of S.J. Res.\_24"
---
 
TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:

I am returning herewith without my approval S.J. Res. 24, a joint
resolution that would disapprove the final rule entitled “Endangered and
Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Species Status for Northern
Long-Eared Bat.”

     The final rule, issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS), provides Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections to
the northern long-eared bat, whose populations have been heavily
impacted by white-nose syndrome.  The northern long-eared bat now faces
extinction due to white-nose syndrome, a deadly disease that has spread
across approximately 79 percent of the northern long-eared bat’s entire
range and is expected to affect 100 percent of the species’ range by the
end of the decade.  Data indicate white-nose syndrome has caused
estimated declines of 97 to 100 percent in affected northern long-eared
bat populations.  Following a rigorous review of the best available
scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present, and
future threats, as well as ongoing conservation efforts, the USFWS
listed the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species under the
ESA.

     S.J. Res. 24 would overturn a science-based rulemaking that follows
the requirements of the law, and thereby undermines the ESA.  Bats are
critical to healthy, functioning ecosystems and contribute at least $3
billion annually to the United States agriculture economy through pest
control and pollination.  If enacted, S.J. Res. 24 would undermine
America’s proud wildlife conservation traditions and risk extinction of
the species.

     Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 September 26, 2023.
