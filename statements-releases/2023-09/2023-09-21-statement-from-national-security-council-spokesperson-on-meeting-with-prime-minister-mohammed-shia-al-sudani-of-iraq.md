Deputy Assistant to the President and White House Coordinator for the
Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk and Deputy Assistant and
Senior Advisor to the President for Energy and Investment Amos
Hochstein met last night with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani of
Iraq to confirm the strong U.S. partnership with Iraq as outlined in the
Strategic Framework Agreement between the two countries. The United
States took special note of Prime Minister Sudani’s leadership moving
Iraq’s policy towards strengthening its own energy security, including
with electricity grid connections to Jordan, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia,
as well as major energy deals with western firms to capture flared gas
in southern Iraq for domestic use and future export. Hochstein and
McGurk also welcomed recent agreements between the Government of Iraq
and the Kurdistan Regional Government regarding monthly budget
allocations, and emphasized the urgency of reopening the Iraq-Turkiye
Pipeline as soon as possible. On regional matters, McGurk pledged full
U.S. support to help finally resolve outstanding maritime boundary
issues with Kuwait, particularly in relation to UNSCR 833. Sudani
welcomed this support, and reaffirmed Iraq’s longstanding and clear
policy recognizing Kuwait’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, all
prior bilateral agreements between the two friendly countries, and
adherence to international law, including UN Security Council
Resolutions.
