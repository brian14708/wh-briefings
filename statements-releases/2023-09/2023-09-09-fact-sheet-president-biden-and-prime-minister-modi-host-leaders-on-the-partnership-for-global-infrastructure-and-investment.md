title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden and Prime Minister Modi Host Leaders on the Partnership\
  \ for Global Infrastructure and\_Investment"
---
 
At the 2023 G20 Summit in New Delhi, India, President Biden and Prime
Minister Modi co-hosted a group of G20 leaders to accelerate investments
to scale high-quality infrastructure projects and the development of
economic corridors through the **Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment (PGI).**  
  
The meeting of the leaders from the United States, European Union (EU),
France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mauritius, the United Arab
Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and the World Bank demonstrated the collective
urgency to make meaningful progress in narrowing the infrastructure gap
in low- and middle-income countries to enable inclusive and sustainable
growth and promote economic activity and prosperity.

To further scale this work, the United States will continue to leverage
public capital to mobilize private sector investments and collaborate
with partners to develop agile and flexible relationships that directly
respond to our partners’ needs, laying the groundwork to create more
security, prosperity, and opportunities for generations to come.  
  
Across the world, from Asia to Africa to the Western Hemisphere, PGI
will continue to build and strengthen coalitions of partners —
governments, the private sector, and multilateral development banks — to
develop key economic corridors and drive high-quality investments.  
  
**Today, President Biden announced a range of new projects to generate
economic growth, incentivize new investments, and create quality jobs.
They include a landmark India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, as
well as a partnership with the European Union to join the United States
in supporting the expansion of the Lobito Corridor, and new PGI projects
in a range of sectors and across regions.**  
  
**<u>Developing Key Economic Corridors</u>**  
**Launch of the Landmark India-Middle East-Europe Economic
Corridor: **Earlier this year, President Biden outlined his vision to
develop economic corridors by strategically layering transformative
investments across multiple sectors in countries to leverage broader
effects of boosting economic development, securing supply chains, and
bolstering regional connectivity. Today, the leaders of the United
States, India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany,
Italy and the European Union announced a new [India-Middle East-Europe
Economic
Corridor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/09/fact-sheet-world-leaders-launch-a-landmark-india-middle-east-europe-economic-corridor/) .
The transformative partnership has the potential to usher in a new era
of connectivity from Europe to Asia with a railway, linked through
ports, connected by the Middle East. This will create novel
interconnections to facilitate global trade, expand reliable access to
electricity, facilitate clean energy distribution, and strengthen
telecommunications links.  The [founding
partners](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/09/joint-statement-from-the-united-states-and-the-european-union-on-support-for-angola-zambia-and-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congos-commitment-to-further-develop-the-lobito-corridor-and-the/) intend
to work with international partners and the private sector to:

-   Connect India to Europe—linked by a railway line and existing ports
    through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel—that will generate
    economic growth while incentivizing new investments and the creation
    of quality jobs;
-   Connect two continents to commercial hubs and facilitate the
    development and export of clean energy;
-   Support existing trade and manufacturing synergies and strengthen
    food security and supply chains; and
-   Link energy grids and telecommunication lines through undersea
    cables to expand reliable access to electricity, enabling innovation
    of advanced clean energy technology and connect communities to
    secure and stable Internet.

**Further development of the Lobito Corridor:**  Since President Biden
announced investments to develop the Lobito Corridor in May 2023, the
United States and its partners are advancing efforts to support a
transparent and developed critical minerals sector that can both
diversify the global electric vehicle supply chain and benefit local
economies. The Corridor serves as an important economic link connecting
both the continent and the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia
through the Lobito port in Angola. Once transport infrastructure
connecting all three countries is fully operational, the Corridor aims
to enhance export possibilities, boost the regional circulation of
goods, and promote the mobility of citizens. Specific new announcements
include:

-   Today, the European Union officially [teamed
    up](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/09/joint-statement-from-the-united-states-and-the-european-union-on-support-for-angola-zambia-and-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congos-commitment-to-further-develop-the-lobito-corridor-and-the/) with
    the United States to support the development of the Corridor,
    including supporting the African Governments in launching
    feasibility studies for the construction of a new greenfield rail
    line expansion from eastern Angola through northern Zambia.  
-   Together, the United States and the European Union intend to explore
    cooperation in the areas of transport infrastructure investments;
    measures to facilitate trade, economic development and transit; and
    support to related sectors to fuel inclusive and sustainable
    economic growth and capital investment in Angola, Zambia and
    Democratic Republic of the Congo in the longer term. Specifically,
    this includes developing clean energy projects to increase the power
    supply to surrounding communities, supporting diversified investment
    in critical minerals and clean energy supply chains, extending
    digital access, growing agriculture value chains to enhance local
    food production for the region’s expanding population and to address
    global food insecurity, as well as augmenting local workforce
    training, support for small and medium enterprises and economic
    diversification.
