title: "Message to the Senate on the President\u2019s Veto of S.J. Res.\_9"
---
 
TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:

I am returning herewith without my approval S.J. Res. 9, a joint
resolution that would disapprove the final rule entitled “Endangered and
Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Lesser Prairie-Chicken; Threatened
Status with Section 4(d) Rule for the Northern Distinct Population
Segment and Endangered Status for the Southern Distinct Population
Segment.”

The final rule, issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS), provides Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections to an
American bird species whose historical habitat on the Great Plains has
diminished by approximately 90 percent and whose populations have
plummeted toward disappearance.  Following a rigorous review of the best
available scientific and commercial information regarding the past,
present, and future threats, as well as ongoing conservation efforts,
the USFWS listed the Southern Distinct Population Segment of the lesser
prairie-chicken as endangered, and the Northern Distinct Population
Segment of the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened.  The rule also
affirms and protects locally led and crafted voluntary conservation
agreements that landowners and land managers have developed in recent
years, which provide certainty for industry as well as safeguards for
prairie-chicken populations.

S.J. Res. 9 would overturn a science-based rulemaking that follows the
requirements of the law, and thereby undermines the ESA.  The lesser
prairie-chicken serves as an indicator for healthy grasslands and
prairies, making the species an important measure of the overall health
of America’s grasslands.  If enacted, S.J. Res. 9 would undermine
America’s proud wildlife conservation traditions, risk the extinction of
a once-abundant American bird, and create uncertainty for landowners and
industries who have been working for years to forge the durable, locally
led conservation strategies that this rule supports.

Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 September 26, 2023.
