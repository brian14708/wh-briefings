*Over $695 billion in funding and over 74,000 projects announced thanks
to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda*

For far too long, this country’s infrastructure was under resourced and
neglected, leading to crumbling roads and bridges, aging water systems,
an unreliable electric grid, and inadequate high-speed internet access.
Three years ago today, President Biden signed the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law – a once-in-a-generation investment in America’s
infrastructure to reverse this trend, strengthen communities, and
transform the U.S. economy. Since then, the Biden-Harris Administration
has been breaking ground and cutting ribbons on projects in every state
to rebuild roads and bridges, strengthening our supply chains, ensuring
safe routes to schools, providing clean drinking water for communities,
expanding high-speed internet access for all, and much more.

To date, the Administration has announced **over $568 billion in
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, including over 66,000 projects
and awards** in all 50 states, D.C., the territories, and Tribal
Nations. That’s part of the 74,000 total clean energy and infrastructure
projects funded so far under the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing
in America agenda, which also includes historic investments in clean air
water, climate action, and semiconductor manufacturing.

President Biden and Vice President Harris are delivering an
Infrastructure Decade, unlocking access to economic opportunity,
creating good-paying jobs, boosting domestic manufacturing, and growing
America’s economy from the middle up and bottom out in every community
across the country. His Investing in America agenda has improved the
lives of millions of Americans and is planting the seeds for a better
and more prosperous future for decades to come, including connecting
everyone in America to reliable, affordable high-speed Internet service,
replacing every lead pipe in the country and much more by the end of the
decade.

**<u>HISTORIC PROGRESS BY THE NUMBERS</u>**

Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Administration has
already:

-   Announced $568 billion for over 66,000 projects across the country;

    clearing a longstanding backlog of projects to clean up contaminated
    sites and advance environmental justice;
-   Provided funding to 180 programs that advance President Biden’s
    Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal that 40% of the overall
    benefits of certain federal clean energy, climate, and other
    investments flow to disadvantaged communities;
-   Created 940,000 construction jobs and construction employment is at
    a record high—higher than the previous peak before the Great
    Recession.

**<u>ACCOMPLISHMENTS ACROSS KEY SECTORS</u>**

The Biden-Harris Administration has made notable progress implementing
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law across key sectors:

-   **Roads and Bridges:** Safe, modern transportation systems connect
    people to opportunity and critical destinations, bringing goods to
    market, bringing communities together, and enabling economic growth.
    That’s why President Biden secured the largest investment in
    transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and major
    projects, since President Eisenhower’s investment in the Interstate
    Highway System. Since President Biden took office, improvements have
    started on over 196,000 miles of roads and over 11,400 bridge repair
    projects are underway – making our roadways safer and reconnecting
    communities across the country. This includes some of the most
    economically significant bridges in the country, like the [Blatnik
    Bridge](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-nearly-5-billion-for-major-transportation-projects-nationwide/)
    between Wisconsin and Minnesota or the [I-55 America’s River
    Crossing](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-invests-nearly-394-million-i-55-bridge-memphis-tennessee-and)
    between Tennessee and Arkansas. The Infrastructure Law is also
    funding thousands of smaller bridge projects, many of which are
    already complete, like the Second Avenue Bridge in Detroit and the
    Montgomery Avenue Bridge in Philadelphia.

<!-- -->

-   **Rail:** When President Biden took office, he laid out his vision
    to bring world-class passenger rail to the United States. That’s why
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $66 billion in rail, the
    largest investment in passenger rail since the inception of Amtrak
    and an unprecedented investment in rail safety. Projects are
    underway across the country to modernize the Northeast Corridor –
    the most heavily trafficked rail corridor in the United States – to
    build new high-speed rail service, improve the efficiency of freight
    rail service, and eliminate dangerous rail crossings. An additional
    $1.5 billion will be announced today from the Department of
    Transportation for rail investments to provide faster, safer, and
    more reliable service for travelers and commuters. For example, the
    [Brightline
    West](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-billions-to-deliver-world-class-high-speed-rail-and-launch-new-passenger-rail-corridors-across-the-country/)
    High Speed Rail project broke ground earlier this year, using $3
    billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to connect Las Vegas
    and Southern California with 200-mile-per-hour zero emission train
    service and creating more than 35,000 jobs.

<!-- -->

-   **Airports:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion
    to modernize and upgrade airports and air traffic facilities
    nationwide, improving passenger experience through expanding
    capacity, increasing accessibility, and reducing delays. The
    Biden-Harris Administration has delivered funding for over 400
    airport terminal projects to modernize and expand terminals – over
    200 of which are under construction or complete­. This includes
    projects like the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Terminal
    Modernization project, where a new concourse was built with five new
    gates and upgraded waiting area was completed this year, and the San
    Diego International Airport Project, where construction is underway
    to build a new terminal with the addition of 30 gates, a five-story
    parking plaza, and roadway improvements. The Administration has also
    completed over 1,600 projects to upgrade and replace air traffic
    control towers to ensure the safe operation of the Nation’s
    airspace.

<!-- -->

-   **Ports and Waterways:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests
    $17 billion to upgrade our nation’s ports and waterways. The
    Department of Transportation and Army Corps of Engineers have
    together funded over 580 port and waterway projects to strengthen
    supply chain reliability, speed up the movement of goods, reduce
    costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Major projects are
    already under construction, including at Montgomery Locks and Dam in
    Pennsylvania and Soo Locks in Michigan, which received a combined
    $1.65 billion to modernize and expand aging locks on key rivers that
    are lynchpins of national supply chains, keeping critical goods
    flowing and lowering costs for families. The Army Corps of Engineers
    has also invested $142 million to make the Port of Norfolk,
    Virginia, the deepest port on the East Coast, allowing enhanced
    navigation for larger commercial vessels. And today, the Department
    of Transportation is announcing nearly $580 million to increase
    capacity and efficiency at coastal seaports, Great Lakes ports, and
    inland river ports.

<!-- -->

-   **Transit and School Buses:** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    makes the largest investment in public transit ever, at nearly $90
    billion – including billions to electrify or upgrade our bus,
    transit rail, and ferry fleets**.** Funding from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law has deployed over 4,600 American-made transit
    buses and over 8,900 clean school buses in over 1,300 communities
    across the country, prioritizing disadvantaged communities. Through
    the Capital Investment Grant program, the Administration is funding
    long-awaited capital projects – like the Mill Plains BRT in
    Vancouver, Washington, that provides fast, reliable transit service,
    and which opened earlier this year; and the Phoenix Northwest Light
    Rail Extension, which is now complete and is expected to transport
    nearly 2 million Phoenix residents to new stations and employ
    transit-oriented development to develop new housing and retail along
    this route.

<!-- -->

-   **Clean Water:** President Biden believes that every American should
    be able to turn on the tap and drink safe, clean water. To date, the
    Biden-Harris Administration has announced over $40.3 billion to
    provide clean water across the country and improve water
    infrastructure, as part of the largest investment in clean water in
    U.S. history. This includes $9 billion announced so far toward
    President Biden’s commitment to replace every lead pipe within a
    decade. Under this Administration, 367,000 lead pipes have already
    been replaced, benefiting nearly 1 million people and protecting
    communities across the country from the irreversible health effects
    of lead exposure. To further accelerate lead pipe replacement, last
    month President Biden announced a [new
    rule](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-final-rule-to-replace-lead-pipes-within-a-decade-announces-new-funding-to-deliver-clean-drinking-water/)
    requiring water systems nationwide to replace lead service lines
    within 10 years. Altogether, funding from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law has financed 2,400 drinking water and wastewater
    projects across the country. For example, the [Lewis and Clark Rural
    Water System](https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/news-release/5000) has
    now completed the construction of 300 miles of water pipeline to
    deliver reliable clean water to 350,000 people in rural Minnesota,
    Iowa, and South Dakota. In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration
    through the Department of Interior has funded 575 projects for water
    recycling, storage, conservation, desalination, and other purposes
    to improve drought resilience across the West. One project under
    construction is the B.F. Sisk Dam in California’s Central Valley,
    which has received over $210 million to fortify and expand the dam’s
    reservoir by 130,000 acre-feet, making it the largest addition of
    surface water storage currently underway in the country.

<!-- -->

-   **High-Speed Internet:** Since President Biden took office, 2.4
    million American homes and small businesses have been connected to
    high-speed internet for the first time, and construction has begun
    in 21 states on high-speed internet projects that will improve
    network resilience and connect rural and Tribal communities. For
    example, homes and small businesses in Eureka, Montana, are now
    being connected to fiber-based high-speed internet through a $12
    million USDA project. The Biden-Administration has also provided
    funding to more than 281 Tribal governments to connect over 65,000
    Tribal households with high-speed internet. In addition,
    Infrastructure Law funding has helped launch construction on middle
    mile networks that are building or upgrading over 3,200 miles of
    middle mile high-speed internet infrastructure across 15 states and
    territories. One example is the HERO Project in North Carolina, an
    $11 million project to construct over 200 miles of fiber through
    central and southeastern North Carolina, including around Fort
    Liberty, Pope Air Force Base, and Camp Lejeune, benefitting both
    civilian and military populations. The Administration also
    implemented new rules to expose internet junk fees, enabling 300
    million Americans to shop for home and mobile internet plans that
    best meet their needs and budget.

<!-- -->

-   **Modernizing the Grid and Deploying Clean Energy:** The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law includes more than $62 billion in funding at the
    Department of Energy to advance our clean energy future by investing
    in clean energy demonstration and deployment projects, manufacturing
    technologies domestically, increasing U.S. competitiveness, making
    our power grid stronger and more resilient to extreme weather, and
    all while creating high-quality, good-paying union jobs and lowering
    costs for Americans across the nation. Since President Biden took
    office, the federal government has provided funding to over 400
    states, Tribes, and territories and launched over 100 projects to
    improve the resilience and reliability of America’s electric grid
    and deliver cheaper and cleaner electricity—representing the largest
    single investment in electric transmission and distribution
    infrastructure in the history of the United States. For example,
    [the Joint Targeted Interconnection Queue Transmission Study Process
    and Portfolio (JTIQ)
    project](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/grid-resilience-and-innovation-partnerships-grip-program)
    is coordinating the comprehensive planning, design, and construction
    of five transmission projects across seven Midwest states. Projects
    are also [strengthening the grid locally and helping communities
    like Estes Park, CO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6Jy9Vt0mGU) to
    power through future severe weather events by installing an
    innovative battery storage project.

<!-- -->

-   **Resilience:** Across the country, Americans are experiencing the
    devastating impacts of climate change. The Biden-Harris
    Administration has deployed $27.4 billion in funding towards an “all
    hazards” approach to protecting our infrastructure and communities
    from physical, climate, and cybersecurity-related threats. To date,
    the Biden-Harris Administration has launched over 6,000 projects to
    help communities proactively build resilience to these threats
    before disasters strike. That includes protecting communities from
    wildfires by removing hazardous fuels from nearly 18 million acres
    of land through the Infrastructure Law and other sources, as well as
    funding projects to elevate or relocate over 3,500 homes and
    buildings outside of the reach of floodwaters, and creating a record
    wildland firefighting workforce of 16,700 with boosted pay.

<!-- -->

-   **Legacy Pollution:** The Biden-Harris Administration is cleaning up
    the air, land, and water in communities that have been burdened by
    legacy pollution for far too long. Funding from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law has helped plug over 9,600 orphaned oil and gas
    wells that pollute communities with methane leaks. To date, the
    Administration has allocated funding to 95 previously unfunded
    Superfund site projects, including the longstanding backlog of
    projects, to clean up contaminated sites and advance environmental
    justice, leading to completed cleanups at 10 Superfund sites and 24
    brownfield sites. For example, after decades of community advocacy,
    the Environmental Protection Agency has completed the cleanup of the
    Clearview Landfill Superfund project in Philadelphia’s Eastwick
    neighborhood, which will prevent toxins from leaching into the
    nearby Darby Creek.

**DELIVERING PROJECTS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY**

To deliver on the promise of this historic legislation and deliver
impact to communities and workers as soon as possible, the Biden-Harris
Administration has:

-   **Accelerated Federal** **Permitting:** President Biden has been
    clear that the government can and must deliver more projects, more
    quickly. Through his Investing in America Agenda, he is delivering
    on that promise by accelerating project reviews while protecting
    communities and our environment. The Biden-Harris Administration has
    taken historic steps to accelerate and improve the federal
    permitting process so that Americans across the country can benefit
    from the promise of the Investing in America agenda – including
    lowering energy costs for families and creating hundreds of
    thousands of good-paying and union jobs. The Administration has
    taken a three-prong approach. First, investing $1 billion through
    the Inflation Reduction Act funds to hire experts and invest in new
    technologies to expedite reviews. Second, passing the first reforms
    to modernize the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the
    first time in 50 years and finalizing the Bipartisan Permitting
    Reform Implementation Rule to accelerate the federal environmental
    review process. And third, using executive authorities, wherever
    possible, to improve permitting and environmental review processes.
    Thanks to these actions, the Biden-Harris administration has cut six
    months off the median time it takes for agencies to complete the
    most extensive form of environment review, cut the average time it
    takes to complete a Department of Transportation environmental
    assessment by more than one-third, and expanded use of the fastest
    form of environmental review – categorical exclusions. Since the
    start of the Administration, over 15 federal agencies have
    developed, expanded, or adopted 125 categorical exclusions for
    projects with insignificant environmental impact in key sectors such
    as electric vehicle charging, broadband, semiconductor
    manufacturing, clean energy, and transmission.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanded Technical Assistance**: In the past, too many communities
    have lacked the resources to access and deploy transformative
    Federal funding opportunities. The Biden-Harris Administration has
    made it a priority to help state, local, Tribal and territorial
    governments and other nongovernmental partners effectively navigate
    the historic funding provided through the Investing in America
    agenda. New technical assistance and capacity building programs like
    the Department of Transportation’s Thriving Communities,
    Environmental Protection Administration’s Get the Lead Out
    Initiative, and U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Partners
    Network provide training, hands-on support, and expert assistance to
    communities across the country. The Administration has identified
    over 100 technical assistance programs to help would-be applicants
    with their planning and delivery needs—and has worked with
    philanthropy and civil society stakeholders to ensure that
    historically-underserved communities have the tools they need to
    take advantage of this historic opportunity.

**Invested in Workforce:** The Investing in America agenda is projected
to create hundreds of thousands of good-paying and union jobs for years
to come that provide critical benefits and supportive services – many of
which do not require a four-year college degree. The Biden-Harris
Administration is committed to ensuring that all workers—including
women, people of color, veterans, and those that have been historically
left behind–have equitable access to those job opportunities and the
training and skills needed to fill them. The Administration has launched
nine Investing in America Workforce Hubs in Augusta, Baltimore,
Columbus, Michigan, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, and
Upstate New York to build partnerships that train and connect Americans
to these jobs in key sectors such as transportation, clean energy and
manufacturing. In addition, the Administration has made unprecedented
federal investments in these sectors. Since the President took office
over $80 billion from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan have been
committed to strengthen and expand the American workforce. These
investments have bolstered Registered Apprenticeships resulting in the
hiring of more than 1 million apprentices and deployed hundreds of
millions of dollars to support for community college workforce training
programs.
