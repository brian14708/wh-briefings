title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Contract Between the International\
  \ Association of Machinists and\_Boeing"
---
 
I congratulate the International Association of Machinists and Boeing
for coming to an agreement that reflects the hard work and sacrifices of
33,000 Machinist workers. This contract provides a 38% wage increase
over four years, improves workers’ ability to retire with dignity, and
supports fairness at the workplace. This contract is also important for
Boeing’s future as a critical part of America’s aerospace sector. And it
was achieved with the support of my economic team, including Acting
Labor Secretary Julie Su and National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard.

Over the last four years, we’ve shown collective bargaining works. Good
contracts benefit workers, businesses, and consumers—and are key to
growing the American economy from the middle out and the bottom up.
