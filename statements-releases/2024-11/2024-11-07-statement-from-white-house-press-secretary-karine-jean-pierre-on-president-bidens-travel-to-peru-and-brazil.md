President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to Lima, Peru from November

Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, where he will highlight U.S.
economic leadership and engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.

President Biden will then travel to Manaus and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
from November 17-19. While in Manaus, President Biden will visit the
Amazon rainforest to engage with local, indigenous, and other leaders
working to preserve and protect this critical ecosystem, the first such
visit of a sitting U.S. President. In Rio de Janeiro, President Biden
will meet with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil on the
margins of the G20 and reinforce U.S. leadership on workers’ rights and
clean economic growth. During the G20, President Biden will demonstrate
the strong value proposition of the United States to developing
countries and lead the G20 to work together to address shared global
challenges like hunger and poverty, climate change, health threats, and
developing country debt burdens.
