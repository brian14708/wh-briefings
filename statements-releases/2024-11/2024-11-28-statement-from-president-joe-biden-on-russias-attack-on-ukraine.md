title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Russia\u2019s Attack on\_Ukraine"
---
 
Overnight, Russia carried out a horrific aerial attack against Ukraine.
Ukrainian authorities report that Russia launched nearly 200 missiles
and drones against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure, depriving
Ukrainian civilians of access to electricity. This attack is outrageous
and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of
supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian
aggression. 

On this day, my message to the Ukrainian people is clear: the United
States stands with you. Earlier this year, and at my direction, the
United States began prioritizing air defense exports so they go to
Ukraine first. The Department of Defense has delivered hundreds of
additional air defense missiles to Ukraine, as a consequence of this
decision, and further deliveries are underway. For months, my
Administration has been working to help Ukraine increase the resilience
of its energy grid in preparation for the winter, and the Department of
Defense continues to surge other critical capabilities to Ukraine,
including artillery, rockets, and armored vehicles.

Russia continues to underestimate the bravery, resilience, and
determination of the Ukrainian people. The United States stands with
more than 50 countries in support of Ukraine and its fight for freedom.
