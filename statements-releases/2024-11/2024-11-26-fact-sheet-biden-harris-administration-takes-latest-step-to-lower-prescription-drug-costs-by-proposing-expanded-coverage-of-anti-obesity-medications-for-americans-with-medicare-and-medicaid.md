title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Latest Step to Lower Prescription\
  \ Drug Costs by Proposing Expanded Coverage of Anti-Obesity Medications for Americans\
  \ with Medicare and\_Medicaid"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a new rule to
significantly expand coverage of anti-obesity medications for Americans
with Medicare and Medicaid. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with
obesity. An estimated 42 percent of the U.S. population has obesity,
which is now widely recognized as a chronic disease, with increased risk
of all-cause mortality and multiple related comorbidities such as
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, some cancers, and more.   
   
Over the past few years, there have been major scientific advancements
in the treatment of obesity, with the introduction of new life-saving
drugs. These anti-obesity medications can help prevent the development
of Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, these drugs reduce deaths and sickness
from heart attack and other cardiovascular outcomes by up to 20%. But
for too many Americans, these critical treatments are too expensive and
therefore out of reach. Without insurance coverage, these drugs can cost
someone as much as $1,000 a month.  
   
Currently, Medicare and Medicaid cover the use of AOM’s for certain
conditions, like diabetes.  Today’s new proposal would expand access to
these innovative medications for obesity, which is widely recognized as
a disease and help an estimated 3.4 million Americans with Medicare.
Medicare coverage would reduce out-of-pocket costs for these
prescription drugs by as much as 95 percent for some enrollees.
Approximately 4 million adult Medicaid enrollees would also gain new
access to these medications. This proposal would allow Americans and
their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead
healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these
drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our
nation.  
   
Since taking office, the President has built on, strengthened, and
protected Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act, by signing
laws such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction
Act to lower prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums. The
President is proud of the fact that the Inflation Reduction Act allows
Medicare to negotiate down the price of drugs, a tool that will help
Medicare lower the cost of some of the most expensive medications in the
program.  That power to negotiate drug prices is critical because
Americans pay two to three times more than people in other countries for
their prescription drugs.  An analysis from the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) finds international prices for anti-obesity
medications are much lower than U.S. list prices and generally lower
than U.S. net prices for these same medications. It’s unacceptable that
Americans – especially those without insurance coverage for these drugs
— are forced to pay so much more for life-saving medications.  The
proposed rule would be implemented at the same time as a comprehensive
agenda to lower the costs of drugs, including the drug price negotiation
program and increased market competition.  We can lower drug prices and
improve health outcomes for Americans.  
   
Thanks to the President’s efforts, seniors are already seeing lower
prescription drug costs with insulin capped at $35, free vaccines, and
out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs capped at $2,000 starting in
2025. Already this year, nearly 1.5 million people with Medicare Part D
saved nearly $1 billion in out-of-pocket prescription drugs costs in the
first half of 2024 because of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
Inflation Reduction Act. Furthermore, HHS has reached agreement with
drug manufacturers for the first ten negotiated drugs, with new prices
that are reduced between 38 to 79 percent starting in 2026.  
   
The President’s new actions are all in addition to an already impressive
track record on fighting for the health care of Americans across the
nation. The Biden-Harris Administration’s [National Strategy on Hunger,
Nutrition, and
Health](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/White-House-National-Strategy-on-Hunger-Nutrition-and-Health-FINAL.pdf)
focused on ending hunger and reducing diet-related diseases such as
obesity. One of the Strategy’s pillars is integrating nutrition and
health, which recognizes the opportunities within Medicare and Medicaid
to support beneficiaries’ access to nutritious foods, obesity
counseling, and other nutrition-related services. Obesity is a
multi-faceted disease and we need to work on all levels from prevention
to treatment to address this persistent challenge.
