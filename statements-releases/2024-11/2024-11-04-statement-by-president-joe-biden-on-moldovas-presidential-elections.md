I congratulate Maia Sandu on her historic reelection as the President of
Moldova.   
  
On Sunday, the Moldovan people went to the polls and voted in favor of
President Sandu’s vision for a secure, prosperous, and democratic
Moldova. President Sandu’s reelection comes just two weeks after the
Moldovan people passed a constitutional referendum in support of
membership in the European Union.   
  
For months, Russia sought to undermine Moldova’s democratic institutions
and election processes. But Russia failed. The Moldovan people have
exercised their democratic right to choose their own future, and they
have chosen to pursue a path aligned with Europe and democracies
everywhere.
