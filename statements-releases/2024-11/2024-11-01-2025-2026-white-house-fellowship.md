The application for the 2025-2026 White House Fellows Program is now
open.  
  
Today, Rose Vela, Director of the President’s Commission on White House
Fellowships, announced the opening of the application season for the
2025-2026 White House Fellowship year: “This uniquely non-partisan
program has a distinguished legacy that reaches back more than half a
century, and we hope that Americans with a passion for leadership and
public service will take a look at the website, examine the criteria,
and consider applying – or urge others to consider applying.”  
  
Founded in 1964, the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships
is the Nation’s premier program for leadership and public service. The
White House Fellowship offers exceptional Americans first-hand
experience working at the highest levels of the Federal Government on a
strictly non-partisan basis. Selected individuals spend one year in
Washington, D.C., working as full-time paid government employees, aiding
Cabinet Secretaries, senior White House staff, and other top-ranking
government officials.  
  
The program has fostered a remarkable legacy of leadership. Of the
nearly 900 alumni in the last half-century, scores have gone on to top
positions in the military, business, education, media, and philanthropy.
Alumni currently serving in the Administration include Secretary of the
Navy Carlos Del Toro, Deputy Secretary of State Dr. Kurt M. Campbell,
and U.S. Ambassador to Panama Mari Carmen Aponte.

The 2025-2026 White House Fellows Program year will begin in August
2025, and conclude in August 2026. All applicants must be United States
citizens, and must have completed at least their undergraduate
education. With the exception of active-duty military personnel, Federal
Government employees are not eligible to apply.  
  
Selection criteria include:

-   A record of remarkable early-career professional achievement.
-   Evidence of leadership skills and the potential for further growth.
-   A demonstrated commitment to public service.
-   The skills to succeed at the highest levels of the Federal
    Government and the ability to work effectively as part of a team.
