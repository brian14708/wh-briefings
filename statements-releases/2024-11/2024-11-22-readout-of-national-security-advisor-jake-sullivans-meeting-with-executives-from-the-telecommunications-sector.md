title: "Readout of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s Meeting with Executives\
  \ from the Telecommunications Sector"
---
 
Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Deputy National
Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger hosted
a meeting with executives from the telecommunications sector to share
intelligence and discuss the People’s Republic of China’s significant
cyber espionage campaign targeting the sector. The meeting was an
opportunity to hear from telecommunications sector executives on how
the U.S. Government can partner with and support the private sector on
hardening against sophisticated nation state attacks. Today’s meeting
reflects the ongoing efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to
engage with executives across critical infrastructure sectors to improve
our domestic cybersecurity and bolster our national resilience.
