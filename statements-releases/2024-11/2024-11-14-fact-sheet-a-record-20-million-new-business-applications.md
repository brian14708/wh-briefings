title: "FACT SHEET: A Record 20 Million New Business\_Applications"
---
 
*The Biden-Harris Administration has powered a small business boom,
overseeing record growth and support for small businesses across the
country*

Since President Biden and Vice President Harris took office, American
entrepreneurs have filed over 20 million new business applications, the
most in any single Presidential term in history. Under the Biden-Harris
Administration, we have had the first, second, and third strongest years
of new business applications on record, and are on track for a fourth.
This is happening in communities across the country—with the most new
business applications in a single Presidential term in every state. Each
new business is an act of hope and confidence in the economy, and each
of these applications marks the first step in that journey. Over the
last four years, entrepreneurs have filed an average of over 440,000
applications every month, a rate over 90% faster than pre-pandemic
averages.

The Biden-Harris Administration has powered a small business boom across
the country. Business ownership has doubled among Black households and
hit a 30-year high for Hispanic households; new business creation rates
hit a 30-year high for Asian Americans; and women own a higher share of
businesses than before the pandemic. While the Biden-Harris
Administration has invested in small businesses that lift communities in
every corner of the country—rural, urban, and everywhere in between—
Congressional Republicans have repeatedly tried to cut SBA’s funding by
nearly a third and want to raise taxes and costs for small businesses.

Today’s announcement builds on significant actions taken by the Biden
Administration to support small businesses, including:

-   **Record levels of capital through the Small Business
    Administration.** In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, [the SBA backed an
    historic $56 billion in
    capital](https://www.sba.gov/article/2024/10/24/new-report-reveals-historic-surge-small-business-financing-under-biden-harris-administration)
    to small businesses and disaster impacted communities, providing
    over 100,000 financings in the forms of loans, investments, and
    surety bond guarantees to small businesses. Compared to FY20, the
    SBA tripled its lending to Black-owned business, doubled lending to
    Latino-owned and women-owned small businesses, and significantly
    increased lending to businesses owned by Native, Veteran, and rural
    entrepreneurs. The SBA also prioritized increasing access to small
    dollar loans, doubling the number of loans under $150,000.

-   Lowering costs for small businesses through the Investing in America
    agenda. The Inflation Reduction Act included a number of provisions
    that have saved small business owners money. These laws created a
    tax credit to cover 30% of the cost of switching to solar power,
    allowed small businesses to deduct up to $1.00 per square foot of
    their business for making high energy efficiency upgrades, and
    lowered health care costs that saddle small business owner’s budgets
    by capping out-of-pocket prescription drugs costs for seniors at
    $2,000, capping the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, and
    preserving the American Rescue Plan’s premium tax credit supports
    for the Affordable Care Act—[saving millions of small business
    owners and self-employed
    workers](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2608) an
    average of $700 per year on their health insurance premiums.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanding access to capital across the country through the State
    Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI).** Through SSBCI, the
    American Rescue Plan is providing nearly $10 billion to support
    small business loan and venture capital programs implemented by
    states, territories, and Tribal governments across the country.
    Through 2023, [SSBCI funds had already catalyzed $3.1
    billion](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/256/Summary-of-Participating-Jurisdictions-2022-and-2023-Annual-Reports.pdf)
    in public and private financing for small businesses. Further, SSBCI
    funds have already supported $1.2 billion in [venture capital
    financing](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/256/SSBCI_Spotlight.pdf)
    and it is expected that jurisdictions may support as many as 200
    investment funds over the course of the SSBCI program. In addition,
    SSBCI support targets underserved and very small businesses. Through
    December 2023, 75% of transactions supported underserved businesses
    and 78% supported business with fewer than 10 employees.

-   **Awarding record federal contracts to small businesses**. The
    federal government is the world’s largest purchaser of goods and
    services, giving it an important role in creating opportunities for
    entrepreneurs. In FY23, federal agencies [awarded a record $178.6
    billion](https://www.sba.gov/article/2024/04/29/biden-harris-administration-awards-record-breaking-178-billion-federal-procurement-opportunities)
    in federal contracts to small businesses—representing 28.4% of all
    eligible federal contracting dollars. These federal contract awards
    enable small business growth, supporting more than one million jobs
    in manufacturing, construction, defense, and other core industries.
    Federal agencies also awarded a record $76.2 billion to small
    disadvantaged businesses.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting entrepreneurs through hands-on assistance and services
    to help them successfully access capital and grow and scale their
    businesses.** In addition to providing access to capital and
    contracting opportunities, federal agencies also provided
    significant hands-on services and assistance to ensure that small
    businesses had the support they needed to capitalize on federal
    supports and access the broader market. Building on longstanding SBA
    assistance programs provided through their Regional Field Offices,
    Small Business Development Centers, Veteran’s Business Outreach
    Centers, Women’s Business Centers, and SCORE small business
    mentoring, the American Rescue Plan included the **largest-ever
    dedicated federal investment in navigator services for small
    businesses through the Small Business Community Navigators Pilot
    Program, delivering training to over 350,000 entrepreneurs and 1:1
    counseling services to over 33,000 small business owners. It also
    included the** largest-ever direct Federal investment in small
    business incubators and accelerators through the Minority Business
    Development Agency’s [Capital Readiness
    Program](https://www.mbda.gov/news/press-releases/2023/08/biden-harris-administration-announces-competition-winners-minority).
    And through Treasury’s SSBCI [technical assistance
    grants](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/State-Small-Business-Credit-Initiative-Technical-Assistance-Application-Approvals.pdf)
    and [Small Business Opportunity
    Program](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/SSBCI-SBOP-Sep-2024.pdf)
    awards, the Federal government is leveraging local and non-profit
    partners to ensure entrepreneurs can get the support they need
    regardless of where they live.

<!-- -->

-   **Catalyzing small business growth and investments in industries of
    the future**. The-Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments
    in clean energy, infrastructure, innovation, and manufacturing have
    also boosted small businesses. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    will continue to provide support for and lower costs for small
    businesses by reducing shipping delays caused by aging
    infrastructure, increasing access to customers by expanding
    high-speed internet coverage, and leveraging small business
    contractors to complete critical projects for the Federal Highway
    Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and National Highway
    Traffic Safety Administration. The CHIPS and Science Act also
    provides [$54 million in
    funding](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/04/chips-america-announces-over-50-million-funding-opportunity-encourage)
    to small business to help them explore and participate in the
    commercial microelectronics marketplace. The Inflation Reduction Act
    builds on these direct investments, providing tax credits and
    incentives to support small business involvement in the green energy
    transition, including by making it cheaper for small businesses to
    use and supply clean fuels, solar panels, commercial clean vehicles,
    and other green products.
