  \ the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity Leaders\u2019\_Summit"
---
 
The United States has deep economic ties to the Western
Hemisphere. Through the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity,
the Biden-Harris Administration’s premier economic initiative for the
region, the United States is strengthening and expanding our efforts
to enhance regional competitiveness by focusing on the drivers of
bottom-up and middle-out economic growth that will create good-quality
jobs and more resilient supply chains.

The Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (known as the Americas
Partnership or APEP) launched at the Summit of the Americas in
2022, includes member countries that represent90 percent of the
hemisphere’s GDP and nearly two-thirds of its people.

At the [inaugural Leaders’
Summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/03/fact-sheet-president-biden-hosts-inaugural-americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity-leaders-summit/) on
November 3, 2023, President Biden and leaders of the eleven other
Americas Partnership countries—Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and
Uruguay—deepened our shared commitment to ahemisphere that is among the
most dynamic economic regions in the world.  During the past year,
Ministers
from the [Trade](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/august/joint-statement-first-person-meeting-trade-ministers-americas-partnership-economic-prosperity), [Foreign
Affairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3Knd-ED1M),
and [Finance](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2285) tracks
have met to set goals and develop priority workstreams
to intensify regional economic cooperation.  U.S. Trade Representative
Katherine Tai, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary
of the Treasury Janet Yellen all hosted their Americas
Partnership ministerial counterparts to drive inclusive sustainable
growth and strengthen critical supply chains in semiconductors, medical
supplies, and clean energy and critical minerals. 

One year on, [the initiative is delivering concrete
results](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/07/remarks-of-national-security-adviser-jake-sullivan-54th-washington-conference-on-the-americas-luncheon/) to
improve the lives of people throughout the region while creating
economic opportunities within the hemisphere. As National Security
Advisor [Jake Sullivan said at the Brookings
Institution](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/23/remarks-by-apnsa-jake-sullivan-at-the-brookings-institution/)this
year, “we’re working to make the Western Hemisphere a globally
competitive supply chain hub for semiconductors, clean energy, and
more.”

Since its launch, the Americas Partnership is: 

**Driving investment and expanded entrepreneurship** by leading efforts
to train an inclusive and diverse cohort of entrepreneurs and connect
them with financing opportunities. 

-   The Americas Partnership Investor Network was launched at a [July
    2024 White House
    meeting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/17/readout-of-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivans-meeting-to-inaugurate-the-americas-partnership-angel-investor-network/) hosted
    by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. As part of the
    Network, a diverse group of angel and venture capital investors
    pledged to collectively invest more than $1 billion in early-stage
    companies and entrepreneurs in Latin America and the Caribbean by
    2030.  The Inter-American Development Bank’s innovation and venture
    arm, IDB Lab, contributed $300,000 toward implementation of this
    Investor Network by the Uruguay Innovation Hub and
    Endeavor, creating new opportunities for the region’s next
    generation of high-impact entrepreneurs.

-   The inaugural cohort of 46 impact enterprises from Colombia, Costa
    Rica, Mexico, and Panama graduated from [USAID’s CATALYZE Americas
    Partnership Accelerator
    program](https://agora2030.org/kinesis-2/), with the next cohort of
    119 impact enterprises from Barbados, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
    Peru, and Uruguay in the training pipeline.  The program’s work
    across 10 target countries has mobilized the first $1.5 million of
    the investment goal of at least $20 million in two years.

-   Canada’s AcelerarMe Program is providing training and mentoring to
    businesswomen in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and
    Mexico, executed by the Thunderbird School of Global
    Management.  The program aims to graduate an estimated 450
    entrepreneurs by 2026.  Already, two active cohorts have
    completed the majority ofthe training and four new cohorts will
    begin training in January 2025.

-   In 2024, Americas Partnership countries supported Small and Medium
    Enterprises (SMEs) through the [Americas Partnership SME Inclusive
    Trade
    Inventory](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/august/joint-statement-first-person-meeting-trade-ministers-americas-partnership-economic-prosperity),
    including programs which assist micro-SMEs, that are owned and led
    by women, Indigenous persons, minorities, and those from
    historically underrepresented and underserved communities.  This
    fall, Americas Partnership governments held a [Best Practices
    Exchange](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/october/americas-partnership-countries-highlight-resources-inclusive-trade-and-small-business) to
    strengthen knowledge-sharing among APEP countries. 

**Advancing economic competitiveness and supply chain
resilience for Americas Partnership economies.**

-   The Department of State has driven inclusive and sustainable growth
    by providing up to $7 million to the [IDB’s Biodiversity and Natural
    Capital Facility](https://www.iadb.org/en/project/RG-O1721). 
    This [Fund for
    Nature](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-announces-americas-partnership-fund-for-nature-during-regional-summit-2/) is
    supporting Americas Partnership member countries with technical
    cooperation to mainstream climate, biodiversity, natural capital,
    and nature-based solutions into economic development plans and
    investments.

-   To bolster semiconductor production capabilities across the Western
    Hemisphere, the Department of State, in collaboration with the IDB,
    unveiled the [CHIPS ITSI Western Hemisphere Semiconductor
    Initiative](https://www.state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-and-inter-american-development-bank-collaborate-on-semiconductor-initiative-in-the-western-hemisphere/)*.* 
    This groundbreaking initiative, supported through the [CHIPS Act
    International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI)
    Fund](https://www.state.gov/the-u-s-department-of-state-international-technology-security-and-innovation-fund/),
    is enhancing semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging
    capabilities in key Americas Partnership countries, beginning with
    Mexico, Panama, and Costa Rica.  Under the initiative, Costa Rica,
    Panama, and the Dominican Republic signed MOUs with Arizona State
    and Purdue Universities to expand their skilled semiconductor
    workforce. 

<!-- -->

-   The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and IDB
    Invest have supported almost $2 billion worth of projects in
    APEP member countries over the past year.  In addition, DFC and IDB
    Invest launched the [Americas Partnership
    Platform](https://idbinvest.org/en/americas-partnership-platform) to
    facilitate co-investments, and added a $30 million technical
    assistance facility to support new and existing projects under the
    Platform.

-   The Inter-American Development Bank delivered a “Phase I” report to
    Americas Partnership members in June 2024 to evaluate and enhance
    members’ competitiveness in the three priority supply chain
    sectors (semiconductors, medical supplies, and critical minerals). 
    This report highlighted the scale of the nearshoring opportunity in
    our region, while identifying areas where targeted policy
    innovations and infrastructure improvements will attract additional
    investment.  In the next stage, the IDB is engaging policymakers and
    other stakeholders throughout the region to develop concrete,
    country-specific policy recommendations in a set of “Phase II”
    reports. 

<!-- -->

-   Americas Partnership countries launched the Americas Partnership
    Clean Hydrogen Working Group, co-led by Chile, Uruguay, and the
    United States.  Backed by the [Department of State’s Power Sector
    Program](https://www.state.gov/power-sector-program/), the Working
    Group seeks to ensure the Western Hemisphere is a global leader in
    clean hydrogen development and deployment as countries seek to meet
    their national clean energy and climate goals. 

<!-- -->

-   APEP countries have led a wide range of initiatives on key member
    priorities.  For example, Ecuador and Peru have joined forces to
    promote sustainable food production.  [The Dominican Republic has
    led an
    effort](https://dominicanrepubliclive.com/dominican-republic/news/dr-to-host-best-practices-workshop-with-the-participation-of-12-countries/) to
    promote transparency and integrity in the public sector.  Chile is
    spearheadingexpanded cooperation in civil and commercial space
    affairs. Supported by agencies like the U.S. Trade and Development
    Agency (USTDA), Americas Partnership countries are also aiming to
    improve regulatory systems and market access for essential medical
    products across the region.

<!-- -->

-   Finally, trade ministers are using the Americas Partnership to
    promote regional implementation of the [2022 Summit of the Americas
    Declaration on Good Regulatory
    Practices](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/SOA%20GRP%20Declaration%2005192022.pdf), with
    the goal of promoting compatibility in technical standards that will
    strengthen supply chains.  

In the year since the November 3, 2023 Leaders’ Summit, the Biden-Harris
Administration has worked together with the members of the Americas
Partnership for Economic Prosperity to take concrete steps towards
fulfilling the hemispheric vision of economic prosperity for all of our
citizens.
