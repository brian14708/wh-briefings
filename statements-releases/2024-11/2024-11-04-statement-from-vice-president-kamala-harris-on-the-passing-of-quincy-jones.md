title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Quincy\_Jones"
---
 
Quincy Jones was a trailblazer.  
   
He lived his life unapologetically, using his gifts to lift others up.
He broke down barriers and opened doors for those who came after him,
not for praise but because he knew the power of our shared potential.  
   
For more than half a century, as a composer, arranger, record and movie
producer, Quincy Jones created art that brought joy to millions of
people. As an activist, Quincy Jones championed civil and human rights.
He brought together artists who wanted to unite their voices to drive
change. As a role model, in particular for young people of color in the
music industry, Quincy Jones offered inspiration and mentorship.   
   
I was honored to call Quincy a friend. I will always remember his
generosity of spirit, his selfless support, and his deep kindness. Our
world has lost a giant. But in his melodies, and in the lives he
touched, Quincy’s legacy will live on forever.  
   
Today, Doug and I are praying for the Jones family and all those who
loved him.
