title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Final CHIPS Award for\_TSMC"
---
 
Two years ago, shortly after I signed the CHIPS & Science Act, I visited
Arizona to announce a commitment by TSMC to invest in America, create
American jobs, and shore up American supply chains. On that day, I spoke
about how the United States invented semiconductors and used to
manufacture nearly 40% of the world’s chips, but now makes closer to 10%
of them and none of the most advanced chips. I came to office determined
to change that, and we have since delivered on that promise, catalyzing
nearly $450 billion in private investment in semiconductors, creating
over 125,000 new construction and manufacturing jobs, and reshoring
critical technologies to bolster our national and economic security.

Today’s final agreement with TSMC – the world’s leading manufacturer of
advanced semiconductors – will spur $65 billion dollars of private
investment to build three state-of-the-art facilities in Arizona and
create tens of thousands of jobs by the end of the decade. This is the
largest foreign direct investment in a greenfield project in the history
of the United States. The first of TSMC’s three facilities is on track
to fully open early next year, which means that for the first time in
decades an America manufacturing plant will be producing the
leading-edge chips used in our most advanced technologies – from our
smartphones, to autonomous vehicles, to the data centers powering
artificial intelligence. 

Today’s announcement is among the most critical milestones yet in the
implementation of the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act, and demonstrates
how we are ensuring that the progress made to date will continue to
unfold in the coming years, benefitting communities all across the
country.
