I congratulate Yamandú Orsi on his election to serve as Uruguay’s 43rd
President.  I also send my congratulations to the people of Uruguay for
their unyielding commitment to democracy as they successfully exercised
the fundamental right to vote.  
   
In the over 150 years of diplomatic relations between Uruguay and the
United States, we have built an enduring partnership based on our
peoples’ shared values.  Uruguay has been at the vanguard of promoting
democracy in the Americas, as well as leading in the [Americas
Partnership for Economic
Prosperity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/04/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-marks-the-anniversary-of-the-americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity-leaders-summit/) to
invest in innovations that create opportunities for the middle class
throughout the hemisphere.  As President-elect Orsi prepares to take
office in March, I am confident our two countries will continue
our work together to build more secure and prosperous futures for our
people.
