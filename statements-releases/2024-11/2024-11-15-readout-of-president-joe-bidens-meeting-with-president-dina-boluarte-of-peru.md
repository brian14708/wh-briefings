President Biden met today with President Dina Boluarte of Peru at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ week in Lima, Peru.

partnership with the United States.  The two leaders discussed U.S.-Peru
cooperation in security and counternarcotics, economic investment and
trade, and space collaboration.  

President Biden reiterated our commitment to support Peru’s
counternarcotics capabilities through a $65 million security assistance
package that includes the planned transfer of nine Black Hawk
helicopters.  He thanked President Boluarte for Peru’s close
coordination on counternarcotics, including Peru’s decision to approve
measures required to share radar information between the United States
and Peru for the first time in a decade.  President Biden also
highlighted a California Caltrain donation of more than 100 locomotives
to the city of Lima to promote cleaner transportation.
 Lastly, President Biden discussed our expanded space cooperation with
Peru, including through a NASA Sounding Rocket Memorandum of
Understanding that NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Peruvian

States and the United Nations to call for the return to democratic
governance in Venezuela.
