title: "FACT SHEET: President Joseph R. Biden and President Prabowo Subianto Commemorate\
  \ 75 Years of Diplomatic\_Relations"
---
 
Today, President Biden welcomed President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia
to the White House. The two leaders commemorated 75 years of diplomatic
relations built on shared values of democracy, pluralism, and a common
commitment to the rules-based international order. As the world’s
second- and third-largest democracies, the United States and Indonesia
share a commitment to addressing evolving challenges and capitalizing on
emerging opportunities based on mutual benefit and respect for each
other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Over the last 75 years,
our countries have continued to deepen our partnership, most recently
elevating the relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in
2023.  

Since 2002, the United States has provided over $6.8 billion in
development, economic, health, and security assistance to support
Indonesian development efforts, which includes more than $2.2 billion to
jointly advance education and health outcomes and over $1.4 billion to
promote economic growth, democratic governance, and human rights,
including support to civil society. To continue expanding this
cooperation, President Biden and President Subianto announced new
initiatives to deliver a better future for our citizens and a free,
open, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific. 

**PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE, RESILIENT ECONOMIC GROWTH**

The United States and Indonesia have long been partners in advancing
prosperity for our citizens and those across the Indo-Pacific, including
through the G20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the
Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, and the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity. The United States will
continue to partner with Indonesia on activities to promote sustainable
urban development, including the deployment of innovative smart city
solutions, quality infrastructure, and international best practices to
improve the quality of life for city residents in Indonesia. Ongoing
technical assistance, pilot projects, and training programs supported by
the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL),
and the U.S. Department of Commerce are designed to mobilize capital,
deploy innovative and secure technologies, and foster new public-private
partnerships to advance Indonesia’s sustainable development goals. As
part of the two leaders’ commitment to implement our Comprehensive
Strategic Partnership, President Biden has announced the following
programs to promote sustainable economic prosperity. 

-   Trade and Investment Framework Agreement: The United States and
    Indonesia are committed to future engagement and cooperation on
    trade, including agricultural trade, and will explore holding a
    Trade and Investment Framework Agreement meeting in 2025. The United
    States looks forward to expanding our robust relationship in
    agricultural trade that accounted for $7 billion in two-way annual
    trade in 2023.        
-   Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF): The United States,
    Indonesia, and 12 other IPEF partners have broken new ground with
    this framework that will deliver economic benefits and serve as a
    regional platform for long-term economic cooperation. The IPEF
    partners have negotiated three economic cooperation agreements aimed
    at promoting competitive supply chains, accelerating the transition
    to cleaner economies, and creating a more predictable playing field
    for workers and businesses.
-   Millennium Challenge Corp (MCC) Indonesia Infrastructure and Finance
    Compact:  The U.S. MCC and the Government of Indonesia launched the
    $649 million [Indonesia Infrastructure and Finance
    Compact](https://www.mcc.gov/where-we-work/program/indonesia-infrastructure-and-finance-compact/)—a
    five-year grant focused on improving the quantity and quality of
    infrastructure investments and increasing access to finance for
    small and medium enterprises, especially those owned by women.
-   Promoting Labor Rights: The U.S. Department of State and DOL have
    provided more than $2 million for programs in Indonesia to foster
    labor rights and workplace democracy, as well as ensuring
    occupational health for workers in high-risk industries.
-   Digital Infrastructure Smart City Pilot Project: USTDA partnered
    with Autodesk, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco, ESRI, Honeywell,
    IBM, and Motorola to launch a $7.6 million project. This project
    will implement innovative smart city technologies to enhance urban
    management, streamline emergency response, and support sustainable
    infrastructure.

The Biden-Harris Administration has reiterated its commitment to
partnering with Indonesia on tackling the climate crisis and ensuring
the United States and Indonesia are at the forefront of harnessing the
clean energy transition, as well as reducing deforestation. As co-leads
with Japan of the International Partners Group (IPG), the United States
has been working with Indonesia to help implement its goals in the Just
Energy Transition Partnership (JETP).  We are helping to catalyze $21.6
billion in public ($11.6 billion) and private ($10 billion) sector
financing.  To date, we have 32 ongoing technical assistance programs
funded by the countries in the IPG that total $202.7 million with an
additional $831.42 million approved in seven loan and equity
investments. 

-   Supporting Clean Energy Transition Planning: The U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE) is supporting a JETP Captive Coal study for
    site-specific decarbonization of the steel, cement, paper, and
    aluminum industries, which could lead to $2 billion in investment
    for clean energy deployments. Furthermore, USAID has assisted
    Indonesia to accelerate its net zero emission target in the power
    sector and define policy reforms to achieve its JETP goals.
-   Mobilized Finance for Clean Energy: USAID and the U.S. Development
    Finance Corporation assisted one geothermal and two small hydropower
    plants obtain $239.5 million in private investment to support
    Indonesia’s commitment to reach net zero emissions in the energy
    sector by 2060 or earlier.
-   Just Energy Workforce Transition: The United States is partnering
    with Indonesia to develop a jobs data collection methodology to
    address Indonesian workforce clean energy transition.
-   Mobilizing Renewable Energy Mini Grids: USTDA, in a public-private
    partnership with the DOE’s national labs under the Net Zero World
    Initiative, is supporting mobilization of $6 to $10 million at five
    sites and will mobilize up to $2 billion in investments to convert
    500 MW of diesel to renewable energy hybrid mini grids. 
-   Exploring Clean Energy Alternatives for Industrial Growth: The
    United States and Indonesia are partnering on a “Battery2EV” supply
    chain roadmap that identifies clean energy alternatives to captive
    coal-powered industrial growth. 
-   Expanding Access to Climate-Resilient Water and Sanitation: USAID is
    expanding Indonesian access to climate-resilient water and
    sanitation in 38 cities and districts.  Technical assistance
    integrates upstream water resource management with downstream urban
    service delivery.
-   Signed Marine Conservation Debt-For-Nature Swap Agreement: In 2024,
    Indonesia and the United States signed the largest bilateral
    debt-for-nature swap agreement as part of the Tropical Forest and
    Coral Conservation Act. The roughly $34 million agreement provides
    funding to conserve coral reefs across much of Central and Eastern
    Indonesia.
-   Emergency Management Memorandum of Understanding: The United States
    and Indonesia disaster response agencies signed a five-year
    Memorandum of Understanding that will serve as a framework for
    future cooperation in disaster preparedness.

The United States is investing in Indonesia’s healthy workforce. Access
to quality health services in Indonesia, particularly for the poorest
and most vulnerable people, remains a challenge. Through USAID, the
United States has invested more than $1.1 billion to help Indonesia
strengthen its health systems—including $58.9 million last year. These
investments include the following:

-   Bolstering Health Security: The United States supports Indonesia’s
    effort to prevent and respond to infectious and zoonotic disease
    outbreaks. USAID helped expand Indonesia’s early warning alert and
    response system in the animal and human health sectors for emerging
    infectious diseases from two to 38 provinces.
-   Tuberculosis Detection: In over 250 hospitals, USAID-supported
    screening efforts reached more than four million people, resulting
    in the identification and treatment of 40,000 TB patients.
    Additionally, USAID supported the establishment of 12 drug-resistant
    tuberculosis clinics, delivering life-saving treatments to 321
    patients.
-   Expanding Use of National Electronic Health Platform: USAID helped
    connect more than 23,500 healthcare facilities in 38 provinces to a
    national electronic health information platform, improving data
    access and enhancing health services for patients.

**INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE**

President Biden and President Subianto celebrated the health and
strength of our people-to-people ties. Over the past year, around 100
Indonesian leaders have traveled to the United States to participate in
U.S. Department of State professional exchanges on journalism, economic
development, financial systems, civil aviation, and cybersecurity, among
other topics. This year, we celebrated 10 years of academic exchange
through the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI). In 2024
alone the United States hosted 165 young leaders from Indonesia through
YSEALI and other youth exchange programs. Building on this decades-long
partnership and recognizing this new era of cooperation under our
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, President Biden announced the
following new programs to further strengthen these ties:

-   Cultural Heritage Preservation: A $275,000 grant will assist several
    Indonesian museums to develop and digitize a cataloging system
    enhancing their emergency preparedness capacity. Another $299,800
    grant assists with documenting and preserving Indonesian local
    languages through community engagement and open-source digital
    platforms.**   **
-   Interfaith Dialogue: The United States and Indonesia engaged in
    interfaith dialogues, including the [Cross-Cultural Religious
    Literacy Conference](https://conference.leimena.org/) to strengthen
    tolerance, promote inclusivity, and encourage interfaith
    collaboration.
-   Increased Access to Higher Education: In 2023, USAID trained over
    700 staff members and over 6,000 students from more than 55
    Indonesian universities in soft skills development, applied STEM
    learning. USAID improved access for Indonesian students to U.S.
    education through a  new Indonesia government-funded scholarship
    program that sent, worth a value of approximately $9.56 million.  
-   Educational Exchange: Indonesia and the United States plan to expand
    the Fulbright program to welcome American Fulbright scholars and
    English Teaching Assistants into educational institutions run by the
    Ministry of Religious Affairs. The EducationUSA Fall Fair showcased
    92 registered U.S. universities and expanded its capacity to provide
    free information about U.S. higher education to Indonesian students
    by 25 percent in 2024
-   Improving Digital Literacy: USAID’s Saring Daring U-Challenge
    activity, in partnership with Meta and Love Frankie, has improved
    the ability of 288 university students to create and disseminate
    content on digital literacy issues, and increased engagement among
    120,000 students and enhanced digital literacy awareness among an
    additional 240,000 students. USAID is also partnering with AWS to
    train 50,000 university students in market-driven cloud computing
    skills.
-   Partnering on Resilient Semiconductor: Purdue University has formed
    a strategic partnership with Indonesia’s National Semiconductor
    Ecosystem Development Task Force to enhance Indonesia’s supply chain
    resilience in critical and emerging semiconductor technologies,
    leveraging Purdue University’s expertise as a leading research
    university.
-   Promoting Democratic Governance and Human Rights:** **The
    Biden-Harris Administration has invested over $50 million through
    Department of State and USAID in initiatives that strengthen
    democratic governance, promote respect for fundamental freedoms and
    human rights, and bolster the role of civil society in
    Indonesia. The United States and Indonesia have also reaffirmed
    their steadfast support for the Open Government Partnership as a way
    to enhance transparency, accountability and public participation,
    deliver for the public, and advance anti-corruption priorities.

**DEEPENING REGIONAL AND GLOBAL COOPERATION**

The United States and Indonesia are united by a shared commitment to
ASEAN centrality and the common principles articulated in the ASEAN
Outlook on the Indo Pacific (AOIP) and the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy. 
In 2022, Presidents Biden and Jokowi upgraded ASEAN-U.S. relations to a
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in recognition of the breadth and
depth of U.S. cooperation with ASEAN across a wide range of important
issues in ASEAN’s political-security, economic, and socio-cultural
community pillars. In 2023, Indonesia as ASEAN chair spearheaded the
ASEAN-U.S. Statement on Cooperation on the AOIP to affirm the
fundamental principles shared between the AOIP and the U.S. Indo-Pacific
Strategy and enhance ASEAN-U.S. coordinated action across the AOIP’s
four areas of cooperation.  The Biden-Harris Administration advanced our
collective security through: 

-   Expansion of Super Garuda Shield: Super Garuda Shield has expanded
    from being the cornerstone for the U.S.-Indonesia military
    relationship to include troops from Australia, Canada, France,
    Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore,
    and the United Kingdom, and this year included a cyber exercise for
    the first time. It involves more than 4,000 service members from 23
    nations observing — or training side-by-side — in one of the largest
    multinational exercises in the Indo-Pacific region.
-   Expanding Military-to-Military Relationship: The United States and
    Indonesian militaries conduct over 200 different types of military
    engagement each year. Additionally, the International Military
    Education and Training program with Indonesia represents the largest
    U.S. training education program in the USINDOPACOM area.
