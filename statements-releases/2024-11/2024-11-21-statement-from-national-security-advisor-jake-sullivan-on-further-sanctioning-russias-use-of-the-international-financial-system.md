title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Further Sanctioning\
  \ Russia\u2019s Use of the International Financial\_System"
---
 
In September, President Biden announced a surge in security assistance
and additional actions to help Ukraine as it continues to resist
Russia’s aggression. And today, the United States is imposing
significant new sanctions on over 50 financial institutions to further
degrade Russia’s ability to use the international financial system to
fund and prosecute its brutal war against the people of Ukraine.  These
targets include Gazprombank, Russia’s largest remaining bank not
sanctioned by the United States, as well as 50 other persons and
entities operating in the Russian financial sector.  

In response to Russian aggression, President Biden has led international
efforts alongside the G7 and many of our allies and partners to hold
Russia accountable for its aggression. Today’s sanctions will further
curtail Russia’s abuse of the international financial system to help
finance its war against Ukraine.

The United States remains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest
possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to
do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing
sanctions and other restrictions on Russia’s war machine.
