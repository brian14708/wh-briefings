title: "New Brazil-U.S. Partnership for the Energy\_Transition"
---
 
*Establishing a Climate-Forward Clean Energy Industrial Partnership*

Brazil and the United States share the goal of creating more
competitive, clean, fair, and resilient economies by promoting the clean
energy transition in a way that fosters  economic growth and the
generation of high-quality jobs, while reducing emissions and keeping
our 1.5°C goals within reach, consistent with the Paris Agreement. Along
with other domestic priorities, these objectives align with the
following public policy agendas in both countries:

-   Brazil has recently launched its policy of development called *Nova
    Indústria* that seeks to strengthen Brazil’s industrial capacity and
    supply chains, including in bioeconomy decarbonization and energy
    security. Brazil also has, among other policies, the Ecological
    Transformation Program, the Fuels of the Future Program, the
    National Plan for Energy Transitions (PLANTE), and the National
    Hydrogen Program (PNH2).

-   The United States is implementing ambitious pieces of legislation,
    including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
    Reduction Act, which contain significant incentives to diversify
    clean energy supply chains and accelerate the growth of both clean
    power generation and clean energy technology manufacturing,
    including clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

Brazil and the United States have immense potential to lead the global
energy transition on some of its most promising fronts. This new
partnership presents a strategic opportunity to strengthen bilateral
cooperation on clean industrial development, leveraging
complementarities across both our public and private sectors. The two
sides announce their intent, in particular, to focus coordination across
three pillars:

1.  Clean energy production and deployment: accelerate and expand clean
    energy production and deployment, particularly to harness Brazil and
    the United States’ vast clean and renewable resources, including
    wind, solar, hydropower, and potentially, other biocapacity
    resources. This would accelerate efforts to decarbonize the power,
    transportation, and industrial sectors.

<!-- -->

1.  Clean energy technology supply chain development: increase
    cooperation on innovation, workforce training, and project
    development for clean technologies, including efforts to manufacture
    solar and wind components, long-duration storage batteries, and zero
    and low-emission vehicles and components; produce clean hydrogen;
    increase production, processing, and recycling of critical minerals;
    and scale carbon management technologies.

<!-- -->

1.  Green industrialization: advance efforts to decarbonize
    manufacturing and industrial sectors writ large to attract
    investments from global companies, and drive closer coordination
    across Brazilian and U.S. private sector partners to achieve
    net-zero emissions in their supply chains, as well as position our
    companies to effectively compete in a world where global trade will
    increasingly account for embedded emissions. 

Brazil and the United States, through a leader-level partnership around
these three priorities, intend to align incentives and mobilize public,
private, and multilateral development bank (MDB) financing to generate a
myriad of shared benefits, such as creating local clean energy jobs that
empower communities and workers; integrating and expanding clean energy
supply chains; advancing clean energy technological development; and
stimulating new investments, including in the areas of climate
resilience and combatting deforestation. The partnership intends to
serve as a framework to elevate and coordinate the strong existing
collaboration between Brazilian and U.S. institutions, including the
U.S.-Brazil Energy Forum, the Fazenda-Treasury Climate Partnership, the
U.S.-Brazil Climate and Clean Technology Plan, the U.S.-Brazil CEO
Forum, the U.S.-Brazil Clean Energy Industry Dialogue, the U.S.-Brazil
Climate Change Working Group, and the U.S.-Brazil Strategic Minerals
Dialogue.

Through this partnership, announced by Presidents Lula and Biden, Brazil
and the United States intend to mobilize all relevant government
agencies in our countries to shape and accelerate just and inclusive
energy transitions and provide the needed signals for public and private
sector stakeholders to fully participate in this effort.
