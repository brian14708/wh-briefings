Today, ahead President Biden’s meeting with President Boluarte of Peru
on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum,
the United States commemorates our indispensable partnership with Peru. 
The United States and Peru will celebrate 200 years of diplomatic
relations in 2026, which will mark two centuries of strong ties in the
areas of diplomacy, trade, sustainable development, security, democracy
and human rights, counter-narcotics, and protecting the environment. 
This year, the United States and Peru marked 15 years of the United
States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.  Since 2001, the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) has invested over $1.8 billion to
promote economic, social, and political development and to support Peru
as it manages the migration flows impacting the region.  Peru is a
founding partner of the [Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity
(Americas Partnership or APEP)
initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/04/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-marks-the-anniversary-of-the-americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity-leaders-summit/),
endorsed the [Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and
Protection](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/26/fact-sheet-fourth-ministerial-meeting-on-the-los-angeles-declaration-on-migration-and-protection/),
and recently agreed to [increase cooperation with the United States on
space and critical
minerals](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-of-america-and-peru-sign-memorandum-of-understanding-to-strengthen-cooperation-on-critical-minerals/).

Recent examples of our strong collaboration in key areas include:

**Bolstering Security and Strengthening the Rule of Law***. * The United
States and Peru maintain a long-standing security and defense
partnership focused on strengthening counternarcotics operations,
combatting transnational organized crime, improving disaster response,
building peacekeeping capacity, and bolstering regional security.

-   During APEC Economic Leaders’ Week, the U.S. government announced a
    **$65 million counternarcotics assistance package** that includes
    the planned transfer of nine Black Hawk helicopters to Peru over the
    next five years.  This assistance, along with the decision by the
    United States and Peru to **restart cooperation under the non-lethal
    aerial interception agreement** for the first time in 10 years, will
    support Peru’s efforts to combat narcotics trafficking and
    transnational organized crime. 

<!-- -->

-   Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, the United States, through the
    Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law
    Enforcement, has provided **more than $350 million in assistance to
    Peruvian law enforcement** institutions to combat narcotics
    trafficking, disrupt transnational criminal organizations, and
    promote the rule of law.

<!-- -->

-   The United States is reinforcing security at the Port of Chancay
    through technical assistance and provision **three cargo and vehicle
    inspection scanners totaling more than $8.5 million**.  These
    state-of-the-art scanners will ensure that cargo moving through the
    port does not pose a safety threat to Peru.

<!-- -->

-   The United States Southern Command provides **extensive training and
    capacity building on cyber defense strategies** to Peru.  The United
    States and Peru co-led Resolute Sentinel military exercises in 2023
    and 2024 to enhance interoperability among security forces in the
    region.  The United States has invested $750,000 in the construction
    of training areas, barracks, and buildings to support emergency
    response in Peru.

<!-- -->

-   This year, the United States and Peru relaunched the **Defense
    Bilateral Working Group** to be followed by the **Political-Military
    Dialogue** in 2025.  The United States and Peru also established a
    **Bilateral Security Working Group** to develop and address security
    issues facing Peru and the region.

<!-- -->

-   The **U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit SOUTH (NAMRU-SOUTH)** is a
    U.S. Navy command that conducts research on infectious diseases in
    South and Central America.  It is collocated on Peruvian naval bases
    in Callao and Iquitos, Peru, and is comprised of 15 U.S. active-duty
    military, five Department of Defense civilians, and nearly 180
    Peruvian staff.

<!-- -->

-   The U.S. Coast Guard completed four successful partnership
    engagements with Peru during 2024 aimed at **minimizing risks of
    inadequate illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing** (IUU-F)
    and port regulation and oversight, the lack of which leads to
    corruption, coercion, and other illicit activities.

**Promoting Mutual Economic Prosperity, Development, and Good
Governance**

-   The United States is Peru’s number one partner in job creation,
    **generating over 1.1 million jobs in Peru** in 2023 through
    **bilateral trade totaling more than $20.5 billion** in 2023,
    according to Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism.  U.S.
    direct investment in Peru in 2023 was more than $6.6 billion.

<!-- -->

-   Through Peru’s **active participation in the Americas Partnership**,
    we are driving inclusive, sustainable growth and strengthening
    critical supply chains via increased trade and investment.

<!-- -->

-   **More than 500,000 U.S. citizens visit Peru annually**, providing
    the largest single group of visitors that sustains Peru’s
    world-class tourism sector.  Peru has the largest Summer Work and
    Travel program of any country with 8,000 young Peruvians providing
    important annual staffing for U.S. ski resorts, theme parks, and
    small businesses.

<!-- -->

-   The State Department and USAID provided **more than $580 million for
    Peru to advance critical development and humanitarian priorities**
    since FY 2021 in support of efforts to strengthen democratic
    institutions and procurement transparency, combat environmental
    crime, protect natural resources, support farmers in cultivating
    alternative crops to coca, and enhance health security.  This
    support includes $335 million in humanitarian assistance to support
    integration for migrants and meet their immediate humanitarian needs
    inside Peru.

<!-- -->

-   USAID mobilized **more than $5 million in private investments to
    expand internet access** for more than 100 rural Peruvian Amazon
    communities. The initiative has trained over 15,000 people in
    digital skills and provided financial education to more than 20,000
    individuals.

<!-- -->

-   USAID has **supported the boom in the cacao, chocolate, and coffee
    industries** in Peru over the course of the past 15 years. As a
    result, Peru is the second largest producer of organic cacao in the
    world and is among the top 10 producers of conventional cacao.

**A Space Partnership**.  The United States and Peru are advancing space
cooperation into civil and defense sectors.  A significant milestone in
this partnership is Peru’s decision to join the [Artemis
Accords](https://www.state.gov/artemis-accords/) this year, committing
to shared principles for responsible and sustainable space exploration.

-   During APEC Economic Leaders’ Week, the United States’ National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Peru’s Space Agency,
    the National Commission for Aerospace Research and Development
    (CONIDA), will sign a **memorandum of understanding (MOU) to enhance
    space cooperation**.  The MOU will include safety training, a joint
    feasibility study for a potential sounding rockets campaign, and
    technical assistance for CONIDA on sounding rocket launches, which
    are small, low-cost flight opportunities to suborbital space used to
    strengthen space science research and investigation.  Additionally,
    the U.S. and Peruvian governments will issue a Joint Communique on
    Space Exploration.

<!-- -->

-   In February 2024, USAID **invested $2.1 million and partnered with
    NASA** and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)
    to launch the second phase of SERVIR Amazonia.  This three-year
    program uses cutting-edge NASA satellite data and geospatial
    technology to help Peru and others in the region address Amazon
    conservation, enhance climate risk strategies, and build resilience
    to extreme weather.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Defense will **deliver a telescope to Peru in 2025
    to detect space debris**, building on the [Space Situational
    Awareness
    agreement](https://www.spacecom.mil/Newsroom/News/Article-Display/Article/3367184/usspacecom-conida-and-the-peruvian-air-force-sign-ssa/)
    that Peru signed with the United States Space Command in April 2023.

**Safe, Secure, and Sustainable Infrastructure***. * The United States’
public and private sectors play a significant role in strengthening
Peru’s infrastructure through investments and capacity—building in
critical sectors such as transportation, water and sanitation, energy,
and agriculture.  This year Peru became the first country in Latin
America to join the [Blue Dot
Network](https://www.state.gov/blue-dot-network/) for quality
infrastructure.

-   Rail:  California commuter rail line **Caltrain will donate 90
    passenger cars and 19 locomotives** to the city of Lima for its
    commuter metro rail project.  This transaction, facilitated by the
    U.S. Departments of State and Commerce, will provide efficient
    public transit, save the city of Lima millions of dollars, and
    generate up to $500 million in U.S. exports of rail, track material,
    signaling systems, and protection equipment for crossings.

<!-- -->

-   <u>Seaports</u>:  In October, Peru’s National Port Authority
    approved the master plan for the **Port of Matarani, an expansion
    proposal that includes new U.S. private sector investments of more
    than $500 million** to enable continued growth in Peru’s southern
    region as Latin America’s main port for copper and a key port for
    agricultural exports.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing
    thePeruvian Navy technical expertise through **a $180 million
    foreign military sales case for construction at the Peruvian naval
    port at Callao**, which may lead to a $1 billion effort beginning in
    2025 to construct the new port for the Peruvian Navy.

<!-- -->

-   Sister Ports:  On November 1, the U.S. port of Hueneme in California
    and the Peruvian port of Paita established a “sister port”
    relationship under the **new U.S. Sister Ports Program**, managed by
    the Department of State’s Office of Transportation Policy.  The
    ports will exchange best practices in safety and security, smart
    port technology, sustainability, green shipping corridors,
    public-private collaboration, and port business and marketing.

    Cajamarca to close the region’s sizeable water infrastructure gap. 
    Furthermore, in FY 2023, USAID mobilized **$30 million in new
    investments for water security** through 15 projects in Peru,
    including improving natural water sources, wetlands, and watersheds.
