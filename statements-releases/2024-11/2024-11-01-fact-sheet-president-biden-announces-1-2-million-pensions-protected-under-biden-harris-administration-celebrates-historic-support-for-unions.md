title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces 1.2 Million Pensions Protected Under\
  \ Biden-\u2060Harris Administration, Celebrates Historic Support for\_Unions"

*President Biden travels to Philadelphia to announce over 29,000 union
workers and retirees covered by a Pennsylvania-based pension plan will
have their benefits protected*.

Today President Biden will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to
announce that the Biden-Harris Administration has protected more than
1.2 million pensions because of the American Rescue Plan’s (ARP) Butch
Lewis Act, according to a new report from the Department of Labor.
During the visit, President Biden will announce actions to prevent cuts
to the earned pension benefits of 29,000 United Food and Commercial
(UFCW) workers and retirees, primarily in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and
New Jersey. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan – which zero Republicans
voted for – the Biden-Harris Administration has protected the pensions
of over 65,000 Pennsylvanians, 80,000 Michiganders, 78,000 New Yorkers,
73,000 Illinoisans, 63,000 Ohioans, 63,000 Californians, 42,000
Floridians, 38,000 Missourians, 36,000 Texans, and many more to date.

The President’s announcement in Philadelphia comes after the Vice
President announced the protection of pension benefits of over 22,500
union workers and retirees under the Detroit Carpenters Pension Fund
last month.

Last week, President Biden [spoke with](https://youtu.be/L9FgrH5dpfo)
Pennsylvania residents Roger Custer, a retired Teamster, and his wife,
Marsha. Roger’s earned pension benefits were cut by hundreds of dollars
per month in 2019, but because of the American Rescue Plan, Roger’s
pension benefits were fully restored and protected for decades to come.

Since they took office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have
fought hard to protect union workers and ensure a secure retirement for
every American.  The ARP’s Butch Lewis Act pension protections – called
the Special Financial Assistance program – will provide security for
roughly 2 million workers and retirees, ensuring their pensions remain
solvent and will be able to pay the full benefits that these workers
have earned over the next several decades. Additionally, for retirees
who previously suffered cuts to their earned benefits due to their
pension plans becoming insolvent, or to avoid future pension plan
insolvency, the Butch Lewis Act restores their benefit level and makes
them whole for previous losses.

Today’s announcement will save the workers and retirees covered by the
UFCW Tristate Pension Fund from an estimated reduction to their earned
benefits of 15% on average beginning within four years. Instead, thanks
to ARP, the plan will now pay full benefits to workers and retirees into
at least the 2050s.

The President also will highlight new data from the Department of
Labor’s report showing the historic progress in delivering pension
security for union workers and retirees that finds:

-   More than 120,000 retirees who otherwise would have continued to
    suffer or would have seen new reductions in their earned pension
    benefits have instead received an average of roughly $13,600 each in
    earned benefits so far that were protected or restored thanks to
    President Biden’s and Vice President Harris’s American Rescue Plan.
    The Butch Lewis Act is restoring benefits levels, making retirees
    whole for previous benefit cuts, and preventing additional cuts that
    would have resulted from new plan insolvencies suffered through no
    fault of their own. That includes thousands of Western Pennsylvania
    Teamster retirees who saw their benefits cut by up to 30% back in
    2019.

<!-- -->

-   **Workers and retirees in plans receiving assistance from the Butch
    Lewis Act had suffered or faced projected average cuts of 41%** to
    their monthly pension benefits**,** with many facing cuts to earned
    benefits as large as 70% or more**.**

<!-- -->

-   **Union workers and retirees across many industries have had their
    pension benefits protectedto date, including:**
    -   Nearly 620,000 workers and retirees in Teamster pension plans,

    <!-- -->

    -   More than 152,000 workers and retirees in UFCW pension plans,

    <!-- -->

    -   More than 103,000 workers and retirees in Bakers and
        Confectionery worker pensions plans,

    <!-- -->

    -   Over 89,000 workers and retirees in United Steelworker pension
        plans,

    <!-- -->

    -   Tens of thousands of workers and retirees in Communications
        Worker of America (55,000), Musicians (49,000), and Carpenters
        (29,000) pension plans, among many more.

The pension protection legislation included in President Biden’s and
Vice President Harris’s American Rescue Plan was named after veteran and
retired Teamster Butch Lewis (1951-2015) for his role in fighting to
protect union retirees’ pensions from harsh benefit cuts through no
fault of their own. Ultimately, the Butch Lewis Act is expected to
ensure roughly 2 million workers’ and retirees’ pension plans remain
solvent and will be able to pay the full benefits that workers have
earned through at least 2051, making its inclusion in the ARP the most
significant effort to protect the solvency of the multiemployer pension
system in 50 years.

Today’s announcement builds on historic actions President Biden and Vice
President Harris have taken to support union workers. While the prior
Administration rolled back overtime protections and appointed union
busters to the National Labor Relations Board, this Administration has
expanded overtime protections for millions of workers, appointed worker
advocates to the National Labor Relations Board, and also ensured
federal dollars are going to create good jobs with the free and fair
choice to join a union and that federal construction projects are built
using a project labor agreement. The Biden Administration has also
expanded worker protections and safety, made it easier to organize and
collectively bargain, provided funding to increase registered
apprenticeship programs, and is making sure the Administration’s
historic infrastructure investments are built with American-made
construction materials and create good jobs. And, the Administration
worked to protect and strengthen Social Security and the retirement
plans of hardworking Americans, including by taking action to ensure
retirement advisors act in the financial interest of retirement savers.
The President also signed SECURE 2.0 into law, which encourages more
employers to offer retirement plan benefits to their workers and makes
it easier for Americans to save for retirement.

Ensuring that union workers and their families enjoy the retirement
security they earned through a lifetime of work is just one of the ways
that the Biden-Harris Administration has kept its commitment to workers
and delivered on being the most pro-union administration in American
history.
