title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Quincy\_Jones"
---
 
Quincy Jones was a musical genius who transformed the soul of America –
one beat, one rhythm, and one rhyme at a time.

Growing up as a child facing segregation and poverty, he found music to
be a refuge. As a teenager, he trained with some of the greatest
musicians ever.

Over the next seven decades, he became a producer, composer,
instrumentalist, executive, and so much more, discovering some of our
most iconic artists and shaping the most memorable records and scores in
history.

His God-given talent earned him countless awards and honors in music,
film, and television. He was one of few Americans to earn an EGOT and
received 28 Grammy Awards – among the most of all time.

In only a way he could, Quincy Jones solidified Black culture as
American culture.

He was a great unifier, who believed deeply in the healing power of
music to restore hope and uplift those suffering from hunger, poverty,
and violence, in America and the continent of Africa.

Jill and I send our love to his entire family and everyone whose spirit
was elevated by his extraordinary contributions.

May God bless Quincy Jones.
