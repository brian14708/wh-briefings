title: "Joint Statement from President\_Biden of the United\_States and President\
  \ Macron of France Announcing a Cessation of\_Hostilities"
---
 
Today, after many weeks of tireless diplomacy, Israel and Lebanon have
accepted a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon. The
announcement today will cease the fighting in Lebanon, and secure Israel
from the threat of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations operating
from Lebanon. This announcement will create the conditions to restore
lasting calm and allow residents in both countries to return safely to
their homes on both sides of the Blue Line. The United States and France
will work with Israel and Lebanon to ensure this arrangement is fully
implemented and enforced, and we remain determined to prevent this
conflict from becoming another cycle of violence.  The United States and
France also commit to lead and support international efforts for
capacity-building of the Lebanese Armed Forces as well as economic
development throughout Lebanon to advance stability and prosperity in
the region.
