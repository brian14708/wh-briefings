Today’s data show inflation has fallen to 2.3%, similar to the level
before the pandemic, while our economy has continued to expand by nearly
3% per year. After a hard-fought recovery, we are making progress for
working families. Gas prices are close to $3.00 per gallon—the lowest
for any Thanksgiving week since the pandemic—and the cost of a
Thanksgiving meal has fallen two years in a row, providing needed relief
during the holidays. Household incomes are up almost $4,000 more than
prices during this Administration. Let’s build on this progress and
lower costs for key items like housing and medicine, and not squander it
with sweeping policies that would raise prices for working families.
