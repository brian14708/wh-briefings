title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Transgender Day of\_Remembrance"
---
 
Today, on Transgender Day of Remembrance, we mourn the transgender
Americans whose lives were taken this year in horrific acts of violence.
There should be no place for hate in America – and yet too many
transgender Americans, including young people, are cruelly targeted and
face harassment simply for being themselves. It’s wrong. My
Administration has taken significant action to strengthen the rights and
protect the safety of all Americans, including working across the
federal government to combat violence against transgender Americans.
Every American deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and to
live free from discrimination. Today, we recommit ourselves to building
a country where everyone is afforded that promise.
