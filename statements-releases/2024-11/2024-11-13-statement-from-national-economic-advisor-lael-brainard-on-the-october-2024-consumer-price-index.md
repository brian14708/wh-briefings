  \ Consumer Price\_Index"

Todayâ€™s report shows CPI inflation was 2.6% in October, close to its
pre-pandemic rate. This has been a hard-fought recovery, but we are
making progress for working families, with gas prices down to $3.08 per
gallon, insulin prices down from as much as $400 to $35 per month for
seniors, and household incomes up by $4,000 more than prices during this
Administration. We will keep fighting to lower costs for families on key
items like housing and health care, and against policies that would
undermine our progress on bringing inflation down.
