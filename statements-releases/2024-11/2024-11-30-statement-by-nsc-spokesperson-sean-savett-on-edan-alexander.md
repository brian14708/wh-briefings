title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Sean Savett on Edan\_Alexander"
---
 
The hostage video released today of American-Israeli citizen Edan
Alexander is a cruel reminder of Hamas’s terror against citizens of
multiple countries, including our own. We have been in touch with Edan’s
family. The war in Gaza would stop tomorrow and the suffering of Gazans
would end immediately — and would have ended months ago — if Hamas
agreed to release the hostages. It has refused to do so, but as the
President said last week, we have a critical opportunity to conclude the
deal to release the hostages, stop the war, and surge humanitarian
assistance into Gaza. This deal is on the table now. President Biden and
the United States will continue to work around the clock to secure the
release of our citizens including through diplomatic efforts and by
increasing pressure on Hamas terrorists through sanctions, law
enforcement actions, and other measures. On behalf of the Alexanders and
all the families of the hostages still being held by Hamas, we will
never cease in our efforts to secure their immediate release.
