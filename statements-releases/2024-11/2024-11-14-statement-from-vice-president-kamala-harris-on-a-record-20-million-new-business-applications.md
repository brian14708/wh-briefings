  Applications"

Small businesses are the backbone of our communities. They strengthen
the middle class by creating jobs and advancing opportunity. That is why
President Biden and I have spent every day of our Administration
fighting to invest in America’s small businesses, their owners and
entrepreneurs, and the workers who power them.  
  
Today, I am proud to celebrate that a record 20 million new small
business applications have been filed since we took office. This
milestone comes as our Administration is investing billions of dollars
in community lenders that provide capital and financial support to small
business owners and entrepreneurs in overlooked and underserved
communities. Our efforts are working with record small business creation
from communities that are traditionally underrepresented in
entrepreneurship.  
  
President Biden and I will continue to invest in small business owners
and entrepreneurs in communities across our nation, ensuring they have
the resources to not only survive but thrive.
