title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Call with U.S. Servicemembers"
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke on Monday with U.S. service members
responsible for numerous successful counterterrorism operations in Iraq
and Syria that significantly disrupted the ability of the Islamic State
of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to plan, organize, and conduct attacks in the
region and beyond. The President noted that over the last 60 days, U.S.
military forces often working together with local partners have
conducted nearly 100 operations against ISIS terrorists leading to the
removal of 32 ISIS leaders, the uprooting of external attack planning
cells, and the destruction of training camps and hideouts.  This
relentless and targeted pressure on ISIS has been a hallmark of the
Biden-Harris administration’s approach to counterterrorism, and we
continue to be vigilant as we work every day to protect the American
people and our allies and partners from harm.  President Biden expressed
his deep gratitude to the brave members of the military, their teams,
and their families for their service to the country, and he recognized
their courage and heroism. He also inquired about the recovery of the
service members who were injured during these operations and was
thankful to learn that they are doing well.
