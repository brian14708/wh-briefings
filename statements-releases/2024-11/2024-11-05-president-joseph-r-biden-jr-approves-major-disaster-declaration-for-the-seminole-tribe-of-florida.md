title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Major Disaster Declaration for the\
  \ Seminole Tribe of\_Florida"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Seminole Tribe of Florida and ordered Federal aid to
supplement the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by
Hurricane Milton beginning on October 5, 2024, and continuing.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals of the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to the Seminole Tribe of Florida and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
Hurricane Milton.  For a period of 90 days of the Tribal Nation’s
choosing within the first 120 days from the start of the incident
period, assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures,
including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program
is authorized at 100 percent of the total eligible costs.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Ms. Leda M. Khoury of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
