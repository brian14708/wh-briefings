title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Sean Savett on the Murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan\
  \ in the\_UAE"
---
 
We condemn in the strongest terms the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the
UAE and our prayers are with his family, the Chabad-Lubavitch community,
the broader Jewish community, and all who are mourning his loss. This
was a horrific crime against all those who stand for peace, tolerance,
and coexistence. It was an assault as well on UAE and its rejection of
violent extremism across the board. The United States is working in
close coordination with Israeli and UAE authorities, and we have offered
all appropriate forms of support. We commend the rapid efforts of UAE
authorities who now have suspects in custody. Those who carried out this
crime, and anyone supporting them, must be held fully accountable.
