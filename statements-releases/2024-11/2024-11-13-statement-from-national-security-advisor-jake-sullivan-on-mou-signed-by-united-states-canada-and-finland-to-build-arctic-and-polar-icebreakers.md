title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on MOU Signed by United\_\
  States, Canada, and Finland to Build Arctic and Polar\_Icebreakers"
---
 
In July, the United States, Canada, and Finland announced a
groundbreaking new partnership that advances our national security by
spurring the production of polar icebreakers and other capabilities.
This partnership will ensure that the polar and Arctic regions remain
peaceful and cooperative. 

Today, just months after we kicked off this partnership, we are taking a
significant step forward to enhance collaboration on the production of
these vessels through the exchange of knowledge, information, and
resources among our countries. This transformative partnership will
enhance our ability to uphold international rules and maintain security
in the polar and Arctic regions, while at the same time laying the
foundation for a resilient and competitive shipbuilding industry that is
capable of meeting both national and global demand for these critical
assets.
