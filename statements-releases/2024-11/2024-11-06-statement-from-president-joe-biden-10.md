What America saw today was the Kamala Harris I know and deeply admire.

She’s been a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity,
courage, and character.

Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic
campaign that embodied what’s possible when guided by a strong moral
compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just,
and full of more opportunities for all Americans.

As I’ve said before, selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made
when I became the nominee for president in 2020. It was the best
decision I made. Her story represents the best of America’s story. And
as she made clear today, I have no doubt that she’ll continue writing
that story.

She will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She
will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will
continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to
come as she puts her stamp on America’s future.
