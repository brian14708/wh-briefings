We are closely monitoring the situation in Syria and have been in
contact over the last 48 hours with regional capitals. The Assad
regime’s ongoing refusal to engage in the political process outlined in
UNSCR 2254, and its reliance on Russia and Iran, created the conditions
now unfolding, including the collapse of Assad regime lines in northwest
Syria. At the same time, the United States has nothing to do with this
offensive, which is led by Hay’at Tahir al-Sham (HTS), a designated
terrorist organization. The United States, together with its partners
and allies, urge de-escalation, protection of civilians and minority
groups, and a serious and credible political process that can end this
civil war once and for all with a political settlement consistent with
UNSCR 2254. We will also continue to fully defend and protect U.S.
personnel and U.S. military positions, which remain essential to
ensuring that ISIS can never again resurge in Syria.
