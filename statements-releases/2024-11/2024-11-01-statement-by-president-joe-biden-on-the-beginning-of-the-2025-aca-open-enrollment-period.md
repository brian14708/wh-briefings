  Period"

Today is the first day of Open Enrollment for health insurance in the
Affordable Care Act Marketplace, which has given millions of Americans
the peace of mind that comes with quality health care. I am proud of the
work we have done to make the Affordable Care Act more accessible and
more affordable than ever – lowering costs by $800 per person per year
and getting rid of red tape. As a result of my and Vice President
Harris’s efforts, 9 million more Americans have been able to receive
coverage, and starting today and running through January
15<sup>th</sup>, 2025, Americans across the country can join them.

Just this week, prominent Republicans in Congress threatened to undo
this progress and undermine the Affordable Care Act, just like my
predecessor tried and failed to do repeatedly. Their plan would rip
coverage away from over 45 million Americans, eliminate critical
protections for over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions,
increase premiums for women and older adults, and erode Medicaid
coverage for millions of children, pregnant women, and people with
disabilities. We won’t let it happen on our watch.

Vice President Harris and I will always stand up to these attempts to
roll back access to health care and drive up costs. We will continue to
fight to make health care and prescription drugs more affordable for all
Americans. I encourage Americans to visit HealthCare.gov before January
15<sup>th</sup> to sign up for or renew your health coverage for 2025.
