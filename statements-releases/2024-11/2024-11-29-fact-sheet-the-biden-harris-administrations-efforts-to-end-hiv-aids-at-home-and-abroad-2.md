title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Efforts to End HIV/AIDS\
  \ At Home and\_Abroad"
---
 
Ahead of World AIDS Day, we remember those who have died from
AIDS-related illnesses—honoring their courage and contributions as
essential to the progress made thus far. We also stand in solidarity
with the more than 39 million people with HIV around the world. Four
years ago, the Biden-Harris Administration renewed and strengthened the
government’s bipartisan commitment to ending the HIV epidemic. Since
then, significant progress has been made through a whole-of-society
approach, unprecedented investments, and a steadfast commitment to
leading with science, advancing equity, and addressing HIV stigma and
discrimination.

Domestically, the implementation of the updated National HIV/AIDS
Strategy (NHAS) has not only focused on reducing new HIV infections and
improving health outcomes for people with HIV but also expanded efforts
to address social determinants of health, reform outdated HIV
criminalization laws, and strengthen partnerships with communities and
organizations nationwide.

Globally, under the Biden-Harris Administration, the President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) released a five-year strategy
with five strategic pillars and three enablers designed to end global
HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

PEPFAR—the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease
in history—has saved more than 25 million lives and enabled more than
7.8 million babies to be born HIV-free across 55 countries since its
inception in 2003.

These actions collectively contribute to bending the trajectory of the
epidemic toward its eventual end. The latest HIV incidence estimates are
continuing to move in the right direction overall, although disparities
continue in the U.S.

-   In 2022, HIV incidence among people ages 13 and older decreased 12%
    compared with 2018 in the U.S., driven by a 30% decrease among young
    people aged 13-24 years.
-   In 2022, new HIV infections among gay, bisexual, and other men who
    have sex with men (MSM) were approximately 16% lower for Black men
    and 20% lower for White men compared to 2018. There was no decrease
    in new HIV infections among Hispanic/Latino men, who accounted for
    39% of estimated new HIV infections among gay, bisexual, and other
    MSM in 2022.
-   Data also show significant declines geographically in the U.S., with
    estimated new HIV infections decreasing 16% in the South in 2022
    compared with 2018.
-   Data show that the rate of HIV-related deaths declined 25%,
    highlighting the effectiveness of early diagnosis and linking people
    to care and treatment.
-   As of 2022, 36% of people who could benefit from pre-exposure
    prophylaxis (PrEP) were prescribed this medication, up for 25% in
    2020. 

Over the past year the Administration acted to:

**Expand Equitable Treatment and Prevention of HIV in the U.S.**

-   **Increase Access to HIV Prevention.** The U.S. government is
    committed to expanding access to HIV prevention medications,
    including long-acting injectable PrEP. The White House continues to
    work with federal agencies, policymakers, and Congress to expand
    access to PrEP for uninsured and underinsured individuals, including
    the proposed 10-year $9.8 billion National PrEP Program. The Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched a new PrEP pilot
    program in five jurisdictions to accelerate PrEP uptake and improve
    patient access and utilization. The Centers for Medicare and
    Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a [National Coverage
    Determination](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/faq-prep-hiv-06242024.pdf)
    for Medicare Part B coverage of PrEP. This ensures that all Medicare
    recipients can receive PrEP medication and additional critical
    services like counseling sessions, HIV testing, and vaccination at
    no cost. Additionally, the Departments of Health and Human Services,
    Labor, and the Treasury released
    [FAQs](http://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-68.pdf)
    to clarify that long-acting injectable PrEP, as well as related
    baseline and monitoring services, must be covered without cost
    sharing.
-   **Implementing the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE)
    initiative.** The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    launched the EHE initiative in 2019 to advance innovative,
    community-driven solutions that leverage science in HIV prevention,
    diagnosis, treatment, and response in regions with the greatest
    need. In jurisdictions receiving EHE funding, HIV incidence
    decreased 21% among those ages 13 and older in 2022 compared with
    the 2017 EHE baseline year. Between 2021-2023, more than 61,000
    people were prescribed PrEP in the CDC EHE-funded programs. The
    Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-supported health
    centers provided PrEP services to 183,000 patients with EHE funding
    in 2021-2023. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program supported over 22,000
    clients new to care and re-engaged 19,000 clients through EHE, with
    79.2% of those new to treatment achieving viral suppression in 2022.
    With EHE funding, 406 community health centers conducted a
    cumulative 7.2 million HIV tests, substantially increasing the
    proportion of their patients aware of their HIV status. Indian
    Health Service EHE-supported sites performed over 20,000 HIV tests,
    and the CDC distributed over 600,000 free HIV self-tests. Between
    2017 and 2022, the initiative prevented 9,500 new HIV infections in
    the EHE jurisdictions, saving over $5.1 billion in lifetime HIV
    medical costs – a figure projected to grow with continued efforts.

**Strengthen Global Efforts for HIV Prevention and Treatment**

-   **Leading the Global Fight to End HIV/AIDS as a Public Health Threat
    by 2030.** Through PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
    Tuberculosis (TB), and Malaria (Global Fund), the American people
    have supported the HIV response in more than 100 countries,
    investing more than $26 billion over the past four years. 
-   **Providing Greater Access to HIV Prevention**. UNAIDS data show
    there were 52% fewer new HIV infections in 2023 than in 2010 across
    PEPFAR-supported countries, compared with a 39% reduction globally,
    demonstrating the impact of PEPFAR support to HIV prevention
    interventions. PEPFAR supported HIV testing for 83.8 million people,
    an increase of 12 million compared to last year. PEPFAR also
    supported 35.1 million voluntary medical male circumcisions for HIV
    prevention since 2007, including 2.7 million in FY 2024. PEPFAR is
    delivering on the growing demand across partner countries for highly
    effective PrEP for HIV prevention. In the last four years, new
    annual PrEP initiations supported by PEPFAR have increased by more
    than 500%, reaching 2.5 million people protected from HIV infection
    in FY 2024.  PEPFAR is providing long-acting, injectable PrEP in
    five countries and is actively working on expansion plans for
    innovations in long–acting, injectable PrEP that can  contribute
    toward ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat. 
-   **Expanding Access to HIV Treatment.** Over the last four years,
    PEPFAR added more than 2.1 million people with HIV on life-saving
    antiretroviral treatment. As of July 2024, PEPFAR is currently
    ensuring HIV treatment for more than 20.6 million people, including
    566,000 children, and more than 14.6 million people are now
    receiving treatment via multi-month dispensing. 
-   **Supporting the Global Fund.** The United States is the largest
    single investor in the Global Fund, a critical partner to achieving
    our goal of ending HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria as public health
    threats by 2030.  Over the last two decades, investments in the
    Global Fund have cut the combined death rate from HIV/AIDS, TB and
    malaria by 61% and have helped save 65 million lives.

**Ensure Accessible Healthcare and Support Services**

-   **PEPFAR Initiatives to Support Equitable HIV Care.** PEPFAR
    launched several major initiatives aimed at addressing health equity
    for vulnerable populations globally – including adolescent girls and
    young women, children and key populations.   In FY24, PEPFAR also
    provided support to 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children
    living with or affected by HIV/AIDS and their caregivers. Some
    PEPFAR initiatives include:

<!-- -->

-   The $40 million Safe Births, Healthy Babies initiative to accelerate
    progress to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission in three high
    burden countries.
-   The $8 million Nursing Leadership Initiative to equip nurses in
    Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Eswatini, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa,
    and Zambia with the skills and capacities they need to deliver
    high-quality HIV services across seven PEPFAR-supported countries.
-   The Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored and Safe
    (DREAMS) program    reached 2.3 million adolescent girls and young
    women across 15 countries with comprehensive HIV prevention
    services, including nearly 475,000 who started PrEP in the past
    year.
-   The Key Populations Action Plan to address the HIV service equity
    gaps among key population groups that face disproportionate risks of
    HIV infection and challenges in accessing services.
-   **Advancing Cervical Cancer Prevention for Women with HIV.**
    Cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining illness, where women with HIV
    are up to six times more likely to develop persistent precancerous
    lesions and progress to cervical cancer, often with more aggressive
    forms and higher mortality. To address this significant health
    threat, in 2018, PEPFAR, the George W. Bush Institute and UNAIDS
    established the Go Further Partnership to eliminate cervical cancer
    among women living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. Go Further
    partner countries have made tremendous progress and have performed
    nearly 10 million cervical cancer screens. As of June 2024, PEPFAR
    reached more than 6.3 million women HIV with cervical cancer
    prevention services and treated more than 350,000 precancerous
    lesions.
-   **PEPFAR’s Commitment to Health Equity.** The first pillar of the
    PEPFAR Strategy focuses on health equity, including advancing gender
    equitable programs, engaging youth, ending HIV/AIDS in children,
    promoting key population leadership, ensuring holistic combination
    prevention, and dismantling structural barriers.
-   **Sustaining Quality-of-Life for People Living with HIV in the
    U.S.** The National HIV/AIDS Strategy includes five quality of life
    indicators – overall health, mental health, food insecurity, stable
    housing, and employment. In observance of World AIDS Day, the White
    House Office of National AIDS Policy will be hosting a
    Quality-of-Life Symposium for people with HIV, researchers, federal
    partners, and public health experts to explore how the HIV service
    community can increase its focus on ensuring overall wellness for
    people with HIV across the lifespan and address social determinants
    of health. 
-   **Supporting the Aging HIV Community.** Agencies across the U.S.
    government are working to address medical and social support needs
    of people aging with HIV and long-term HIV survivors. HRSA, CDC, and
    the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have all increased their
    efforts to conduct additional research, highlight best practices and
    provide tailored care and support services.
-   **Ensuring Equitable Access to Care.** The NHAS Federal
    Implementation Plan prioritizes access to PrEP in vulnerable
    communities, promotes compliance with civil rights laws (including
    language access services and disability rights), and assists state
    and local governments in protecting people with HIV from violence,
    retaliation, and discrimination. Domestic HIV programs, including
    the EHE initiative continuously strive to create and enhance
    healthcare systems that provide high quality, affordable, and
    culturally appropriate prevention, testing, and care for all
    individuals, especially the priority and key populations identified
    in the NHAS.

**Increase Awareness and End Stigma and Discrimination**

-   **CDC Updating HIV Testing Guidance.** CDC will publish draft
    updated HIV screening guidelines recommending at least one HIV test
    in a lifetime for all persons 15 years of age or older. These draft
    recommendations update the ages for HIV screening including
    eliminating an upper age limit, a change that would be a significant
    step toward addressing HIV testing stigma by normalizing HIV
    screening as a lifelong practice and help promote earlier diagnosis
    and treatment across all age groups, ultimately supporting efforts
    to end the HIV epidemic.
-   **Reform of HIV Criminalization Laws.** For the first time, the
    proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget invests in state and local efforts
    to promote equity and protect civil rights through a new $10 million
    Department of Justice grant program to support modernization of
    outdated state criminal statutes with a discriminatory impact on
    people with HIV. Outdated HIV criminalization laws do not reflect
    our current understanding of HIV transmission, discourage HIV
    testing, and exacerbate the challenges faced by people with HIV. The
    Department of Justice reached a landmark settlement with Shelby
    County, Tennessee, ending discriminatory enforcement of a law that
    imposed higher criminal penalties for prostitution for people with
    HIV.

<!-- -->

-   **Adoption of Science Informed Treatment and Messaging**. PEPFAR and
    domestic HIV programs have adopted HIV interventions such as PrEP
    along with the complementary, life-affirming message of U=U
    (undetectable =untransmittable) to dismantle stigma and
    discrimination for people with HIV. U=U means that a person with an
    undetectable viral load cannot be transmit HIV to other sexual
    partners.
-   **Organ Donation between Patients Living with HIV.** An NIH-funded
    clinical trial confirmed that kidney transplantation is safe between
    donors and recipients with HIV—a practice currently only permitted
    in the United States under a research protocol. This research was
    made possible by the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE) implemented
    in 2015 to legalize transplants between donors and recipients living
    with HIV. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    announced a [final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/27/2024-27410/organ-procurement-and-transplantation-implementation-of-the-hiv-organ-policy-equity-hope-act)
    that will expand access to kidney and liver transplants for people
    with HIV by removing clinical research requirements for these
    transplants.

**Prioritize Community-Driven Responses**

-   **Mobilizing Rising HIV Leaders.** In July, the White House Office
    of National AIDS Policy hosted Th*e White House Rising Leaders
    Summit: Shaping the Future of HIV Today.* The Summit convened young
    emerging leaders in public health from diverse communities. The
    event generated actionable ideas to advance the vision and goals of
    the Administration’s National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), solidifying
    the Administration’s commitment to nurturing innovative leadership
    in the fight against HIV. Globally, PEPFAR launched a $20 million
    Youth Initiative to elevate youth leadership in the HIV response to
    reduce new HIV infections and increase awareness of HIV status among
    adolescents and young people.
-   **Hispanic/Latino Community Engagement.**  In September, the White
    House Office of National AIDS Policy hosted a Summit on HIV in
    Hispanic/Latino Communities called, *“¡Adelante!”* The Summit
    occurred at a critical moment when Hispanic/Latino people,
    representing about 19% of the U.S. population, accounted for nearly
    32% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2022, with Hispanic/Latino gay men
    now representing the highest number of new HIV cases in the country.
    It brought together federal agencies, cross-sector partners, and
    individuals with lived experience to amplify diverse voices,
    generate actionable solutions, and drive collective action. This
    Summit reinforced the Administration’s commitment to accelerating
    the nation’s HIV response in Hispanic/Latino communities and
    ensuring sustained impact through collaboration and equity-focused
    strategies.
-   **Making the HIV Response More Sustainable**. Over the last four
    years, PEPFAR increased its partnerships with local organizations by
    29%, and in FY24 PEPFAR has directly supported more than 380 local
    partners to build long-term sustainable capacity in partner
    countries. PEPFAR is focused on ensuring that the large majority of
    HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs in 2030 and beyond will
    be led and delivered by governments or by other domestic entities
    with community engagement and government accountability. PEPFAR also
    partnered with UNAIDS to launch the development of Sustainability
    Roadmaps in all PEPFAR-supported countries.

**Advance HIV Research and Innovation**

-   **Temporary HIV Remission for Infants.** An NIH-supported clinical
    trial found that, infants who started antiretroviral therapy soon
    after birth were later able to pause treatment and remain free of
    detectable HIV for more than a year. Typically, without treatment
    HIV replication in infants is rapid and detectable within weeks.
    These findings suggest very early treatment enables the infant
    immune system to temporarily promote HIV remission.
-   **Long-Acting HIV Treatment Reduces Barriers.** NIH-funded research
    found long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapy can better
    maintain viral suppression in people with HIV who experience
    barriers to daily pill taking. This research builds on the 2021 FDA
    approval of long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapy that
    determined these drugs to be safe and effective—a drug development
    milestone underpinned by U.S. government supported basic science on
    HIV’s molecular structure.
-   **HIV Treatment During Pregnancy.** An NIH-sponsored study adds to
    the evidence-base that oral and long-acting injectable PrEP is safe
    before and during pregnancy. Multiple other studies have also
    confirmed the safety of oral, long-acting, and vaginal ring PrEP
    formulations during pregnancy.
-   **Bridging the Research to Practice Gap.** The use of implementation
    science is essential to test interventions in community settings and
    address specific challenges with appropriately tailored approaches.
    The NIH supported 265 implementation science projects that have
    paired researchers with community partners to test, evaluate, and
    adapt HIV-related interventions in the EHE jurisdictions.
-   **Innovative Models for Leveraging Pharmacies in HIV Services.**
    [Several](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/exploring-potential-pharmacies-increase-access)
    NIH-funded EHE
    [projects ](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-25-186.html)aim
    to identify innovative models to leverage pharmacies for HIV
    testing, prevention (including HIV PrEP), and care through
    partnerships between academic institutions and state and local
    leaders. This work includes advancing workforce training curricula
    to enable pharmacy students, pharmacists, pharmacies, and pharmacy
    systems to deliver the spectrum of needed HIV services with ease,
    equity, and effectiveness.
-   **Catalyzing Regional Manufacturing in Africa**. In 2022, PEPFAR
    announced bold manufacturing targets to procure 15 million HIV tests
    produced in Africa by 2025 and work alongside partners to shift two
    million patients on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) to
    African-produced products by 2030. Since 2023, PEPFAR procured
    nearly 100,000 HIV tests from Africa-based manufacturers and worked
    with partners to launch an Expert Review Panel for Diagnostics for
    African manufacturers of HIV rapid tests in order to accelerate the
    availability of HIV rapid tests produced across the continent.
