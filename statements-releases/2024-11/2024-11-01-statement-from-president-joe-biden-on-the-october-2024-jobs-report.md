title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the October 2024 Jobs\_Report"
---
 
In October, unemployment was unchanged at 4.1%, but the devastation from
Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and new strike activity, lowered job
growth. Job growth is expected to rebound in November as our hurricane
recovery and rebuilding efforts continue. In addition, I want to
congratulate the leadership of the Machinists and Boeing for negotiating
a new contract proposal that will be voted on by union members.
Machinists at Boeing have sacrificed over the years and deserve a strong
contract.

America’s economy remains strong, with 16 million jobs created since I
took office, including an average 180,000 jobs created each month over
the last year—more than the year before the pandemic. We have the lowest
average unemployment rate of any administration in 50 years, our economy
has grown more than any presidential term this century, incomes are up
$4,000 over prices, and inflation has fallen nearly to its 2% target.

There’s more work to do. We are working every day to lower costs for
working families on rent, prescription drugs, health insurance, and
child care. Congressional Republicans, however, are proposing a national
sales tax that would cost families nearly $4,000 a year, hurt American
manufacturing, and cut hundreds of thousands of jobs. They are fighting
for tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations—we are fighting to
grow the middle class.
