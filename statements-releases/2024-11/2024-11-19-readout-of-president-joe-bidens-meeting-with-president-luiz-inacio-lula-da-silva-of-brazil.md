President Joe Biden met today with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva
of Brazil on the margins of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro to discuss
the U.S.-Brazil strategic relationship, rooted in our strong support for
democracy.  President Biden congratulated President Lula on Brazil’s G20
host year and reaffirmed the United States’ support for President Lula’s
efforts to address hunger and poverty and their shared commitment to
ensure no one is left behind.  As part of their joint effort to promote
decent work, the leaders reviewed progress under the Partnership for
Workers’ Rights, including empowering workers to participate in climate
policy discussions and help ensure a just energy transition.  President
Biden reiterated U.S. commitment to digital inclusion, announcing U.S.
development financing to support the expansion of Brazil’s fiber optic
network to serve an additional 1 million homes and 4,000 schools by
2027.  
   
The two leaders underscored their commitment to democratic institutions
and the rule of law, both at home and abroad.  In the Americas, they
agreed to continue consulting on the situation in Venezuela and called
for the democratic will of the Venezuelan people to be respected and for
the end of political repression.  Noting the urgent security situation
in Haiti, the two leaders commended Kenya for its leadership role in
addressing the security situation in Haiti.  President Biden thanked
President Lula for Brazil’s commitment to support the people of Haiti
and underscored the need to transition the Multinational Security
Support mission to a United Nations peacekeeping operation.    
   
As Brazil assumes the Presidency of COP30, both leaders underscored the
need for urgent action to address the climate crisis.

Building on their commitment to addressing the climate crisis and
seizing the opportunity to promote decent work in essential industries,
the two leaders [announced a new Brazil-U.S. Partnership for the Energy
Transition](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/19/fact-sheet-new-brazil-u-s-partnership-for-the-energy-transition/). 
The Partnership will accelerate clean energy deployment, expand energy
and mineral supply chain development, and decarbonize the manufacturing
and industrial sectors.  President Biden expressed his confidence in the
durability of this partnership, which builds on longstanding bilateral
cooperation, such as the U.S.-Brazil Energy Forum and the Strategic
Minerals Dialogue.
