title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\_Anniversary"
---
 
To have the best economy in the world, you have to have the best
infrastructure in the world. That’s why three years ago, I was proud to
sign the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – the largest investment in our
nation’s infrastructure in a generation. And when the bill passed, we
showed that we can get big things done when we work together.

In just the three years since I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, my Administration has launched over 66,000 projects across the
country, repairing 196,000 miles of roads and 11,400 bridges, replacing
367,000 lead pipes, and expanding and modernizing ports and airports.
And today, we’re investing an additional $1.5 billion in funding for
rail investments along the Northeast Corridor – the most heavily
trafficked rail corridor in the United States, supporting 800,000 trips
per day – five times more passengers than all flights between Washington
and New York.

We’re doing all this with American workers and products that are made in
America. These investments are creating jobs, benefitting our
communities, and ushering in an infrastructure decade that is planting
the seeds for a better and more prosperous future.
