  \ Under the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration"

When I took office, the pandemic was raging and the economy was reeling.
From Day One, I was determined to not only deliver economic relief, but
to invest in America and grow the economy from the middle out and bottom
up, not the top down.

Over the last four years, that’s exactly what we’ve done. We passed
legislation to rebuild our infrastructure, build a clean energy economy,
and bring manufacturing back to the United States after decades of
offshoring. Today I’m proud to announce my Investing in America
agenda—the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and
the Inflation Reduction Act—has helped attract over $1 trillion in
announced private-sector investments. These investments in industries of
the future are ensuring the future is made in America, by American
workers. And they’re creating opportunities in communities too often
left behind.

Over 1.6 million construction and manufacturing jobs have been created
over the last four years, and our investments are making America a
leader in clean energy and semiconductor technologies that will protect
our economic and national security, while expanding opportunities in red
states and blue states.

Today, thanks to my Investing in America agenda, businesses around the
world are investing in America—which is good news for American workers
and American businesses—and we’re positioned to win the economic
competition for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
