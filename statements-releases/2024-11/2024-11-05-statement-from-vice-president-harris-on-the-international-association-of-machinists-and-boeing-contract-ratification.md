title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on the International Association of Machinists\
  \ and Boeing Contract\_Ratification"
---
 
Last night, the International Association of Machinists (IAM) ratified a
strong contract that recognizes the contribution of over 33,000 workers.
I want to congratulate Boeing and the IAM for reaching an agreement that
secures historic wage increases and benefits for these workers.  This
agreement represents a positive step for Boeing’s future as a leader in
the aerospace industry. As I always say: collective bargaining works.
