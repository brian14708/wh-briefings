title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on a Record 20 Million New Business\_\
  Applications"
---
 
I’ve always said that every new small business is an act of hope. As of
today, Americans have filed more than 20 million new business
applications since Vice President Harris and I took office. That’s 20
million acts of hope by the American people.

Under our Administration, we have had the three strongest years of new
business applications on record—and we are on track for a fourth. That’s
the best single Presidential term for new business applications in
history. Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs have been leaders of this
small business boom, with Black business ownership doubling and Hispanic
business ownership up by 40% since before the pandemic. The share of
women business owners is also on the rise.

Small businesses and entrepreneurs are powering our economic recovery
and contributing to stronger productivity growth—helping make us the
strongest economy in the world.
