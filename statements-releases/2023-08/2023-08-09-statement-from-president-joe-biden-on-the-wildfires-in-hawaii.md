Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families of those who
lost loved ones in the wildfires in Maui, and our prayers are with those
who have seen their homes, businesses, and communities destroyed. We are
grateful to the brave firefighters and first responders who continue to
run toward danger, putting themselves in harm’s way to save lives.

I have ordered all available Federal assets on the Islands to help with
response. The Hawaiian National Guard has mobilized Chinook Helicopters
to help with fire suppression and search and rescue on the Island of
Maui. The U.S. Coast Guard and Navy Third Fleets are supporting response
and rescue efforts. The Army is providing Black Hawk Helicopters to
fight the fires on the Big Island.  The Department of Transportation is
working with commercial airlines to evacuate tourists from Maui, and the
Department of the Interior and the United States Department of
Agriculture stand ready to support post fire recovery efforts.   
  
I urge all residents to continue to follow evacuation orders, listen to
the instructions of first responders and officials, and stay alert.
