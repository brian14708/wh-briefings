title: "FACT SHEET: Bidenomics at Work in 79 Metro Areas with Record Low Unemployment\_\
  Rates"
---
 
This morning, the latest metro area unemployment rates were released by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showing 79 metro areas at their lowest
rates on record including 41 that reached new record lows. The record
lows can be found in every corner of the country, from Scranton to
Spokane, from Manchester to Montgomery.

White House Press Secretary Jean-Pierre congratulated all of the
communities helping to drive the strength of our national economy:

“The heart of Bidenomics is growing our economy from the middle out and
bottom up, not the top down, and the 79 communities at record low
unemployment show Bidenomics in action. With wages and consumer
confidence going up, record numbers of Americans applying to start small
businesses, and new factories being built in every corner of the
country, America’s communities are being rebuilt around good jobs for
the long term.”

President Biden’s agenda has driven the strongest economic recovery
America has ever seen, with 13.2 million jobs added, a record number of
states with unemployment rates at or below 3%, and the national
unemployment rate below 4% for the longest stretch in more than 50
years. Economic growth has been strong even as annual inflation has
fallen for twelve straight months. At the same time, the President’s
Investing in America agenda is already taking hold, with more than $500
billion in new manufacturing and clean energy investments pouring in
across the country, while shovels hit the ground rebuilding every
state’s infrastructure.

President Biden will continue to invest in America’s communities, and
continue to be a president for all Americans. See the full lists of
metro areas with new record low unemployment rates and matching record
lows below:
