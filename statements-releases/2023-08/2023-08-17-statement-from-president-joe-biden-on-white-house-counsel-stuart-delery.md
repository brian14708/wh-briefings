title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on White\_House Counsel Stuart\_Delery"
---
 
Stuart Delery has been a trusted adviser and a constant source of
innovative legal thinking since Day One of my Administration.  From his
work during those early days on COVID-19 and efforts to get life-saving
vaccines to the American public to the implementation of major
legislative accomplishments such as the American Rescue Plan, the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, he has
been an integral part of my team and will be missed throughout the
Administration.  I extend my thanks to Stuart and his family for his
service.
