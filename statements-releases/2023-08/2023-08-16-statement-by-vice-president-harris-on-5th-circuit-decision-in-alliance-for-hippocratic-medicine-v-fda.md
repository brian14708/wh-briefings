title: "Statement by Vice President Harris on 5th Circuit Decision in Alliance for\
  \ Hippocratic Medicine v.\_FDA"
---
 
We strongly disagree with today’s decision from the Fifth Circuit in
*Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA,* which would impose medically
unnecessary barriers to safe and effective FDA-approved medication.
Despite this ruling, mifepristone remains broadly available due to the
Supreme Court’s stay.  
   
As I have continually said, this lawsuit is a threat to a woman’s
freedom to make decisions about her own body and another step towards
the ultimate goal of a nationwide abortion ban. It endangers our entire
system of drug approval and regulation by undermining the independent,
expert judgment of the FDA. Americans across the country should be able
look in their medicine cabinets and know that FDA-approved medication
prescribed by a doctor will remain available. This decision stands
between doctors and their patients.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration will continue our efforts to protect
access to abortion and defend the FDA in the courts. The President and I
remain committed to protecting a woman’s right to make decisions about
her own health care.
