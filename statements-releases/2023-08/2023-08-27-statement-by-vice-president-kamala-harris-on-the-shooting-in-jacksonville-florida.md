title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Shooting in Jacksonville,\_\
  Florida"
---
 
On Saturday, as Americans marked the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the
March on Washington, a gunman armed with an assault-style rifle and
handgun opened fire at a Jacksonville store just blocks away from a
Historically Black University, taking the lives of three Black
Americans.

Already, federal law enforcement has opened a civil rights investigation
into this attack and is treating it as a possible hate crime and act of
domestic violent extremism.

As we allow that investigation to proceed, let us continue to speak
truth about the moment we are in: America is experiencing an epidemic of
hate. Too many communities have been torn apart by hatred and violent
extremism. Too many families have lost children, parents, and
grandparents. Too many Black Americans live every day with the fear that
they will be victims of hate-fueled gun violenceâ€”at school, at work, at
their place of worship, at the grocery store.

Every person in every community in America should have the freedom to
live safe from gun violence. And Congress must help secure that freedom
by banning assault weapons and passing other commonsense gun safety
legislation.

Doug and I will keep the victims and their loved ones in our prayers.
