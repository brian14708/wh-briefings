title: "Statement from National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on the\
  \ 10 Year Anniversary of the Ghouta Chemical Weapons\_Attack"
---
 
Ten years ago today, the Assad regime conducted a gruesome chemical
attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed more than 1,400
people, many of them children. The horrifying images from that early
morning still haunt us to this day, and they drive this Administration’s
efforts to rid the world of chemical weapons and to secure a safer
future for all Syrians. No child, in Syria or anywhere else in the
world, should live in fear of these heinous weapons.  
   
On this somber date, we remember and honor all the victims and survivors
of the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons against its own people. We
continue to contribute to international work to verify the full
elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons program and document violations
of international law and human rights in Syria.  
   
The Assad regime, backed by Russia, is hoping the world will forget the
atrocities that have occurred in Syria. We will not. Syria and Russia
must comply with their international obligations and stop obstructing
the work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
And the global community will continue to seek justice for the victims
and survivors of atrocities in Syria and to promote accountability for
those responsible.
