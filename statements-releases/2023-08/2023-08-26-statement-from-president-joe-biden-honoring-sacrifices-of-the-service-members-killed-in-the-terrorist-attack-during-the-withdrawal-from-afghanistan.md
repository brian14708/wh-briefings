title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Honoring Sacrifices of the Service Members\
  \ Killed in the Terrorist Attack During the Withdrawal from\_Afghanistan"
---
 
We will forever honor the memory of the 13 service members who were
stolen far too soon from their families, loved ones, and brothers- and
sisters-in-arms, while performing a noble mission on behalf of our
nation. We can never repay the incredible sacrifice of any of the 2,461
U.S. service members who lost their lives over two decades of war in
Afghanistan or the 20,744 who were wounded. But we will never fail to
honor our sacred obligation to our service members and veterans, as well
as their families, caregivers, and survivors.  
  
Today, Jill and I remember and mourn these 13 brave American service
members and the more than 100 innocent Afghan civilians who were killed
in the horrific terrorist attack at Abbey Gate. Many more were injured
and will carry the impacts of their wounds and the horrors of that day
for the rest of their lives.  
  
We pray for the families of our fallen warriors. We grieve with them, we
honor them, and we will always continue to support them.
