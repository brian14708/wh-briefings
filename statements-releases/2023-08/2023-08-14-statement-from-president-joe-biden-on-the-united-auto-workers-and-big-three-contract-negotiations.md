title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the United Auto Workers and Big Three\
  \ Contract\_Negotiations"

The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. The
need to transition to a clean energy economy should provide a
win‑win opportunity for auto companies and unionized workers. It should
enable workers to make good wages and benefits to support their
families, while leading us into a future where America is leading the
way in reducing vehicle emissions and producing autos that will
successfully compete domestically and globally. Companies should use
this process to make sure they enlist their workers in the next chapter
of the industry by offering them good paying jobs and a say in the
future of their workplace.   
   
As the Big Three auto companies and the United Auto Workers come
together — one month before the expiration of their contract — to
negotiate a new agreement, I want to be clear about where I stand. I’m
asking all sides to work together to forge a fair agreement.  
   
I support a fair transition to a clean energy future. That means
ensuring that Big Three auto jobs are good jobs that can support a
family; that auto companies should honor the right to organize; take
every possible step to avoid painful plant closings; and ensure that
when transitions are needed, the transitions are fair and look to
retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities at
comparable wages, while giving existing workers the first shot to fill
those jobs. The UAW helped create the American middle class and as we
move forward in this transition to new technologies, the UAW deserves a
contract that sustains the middle class.
