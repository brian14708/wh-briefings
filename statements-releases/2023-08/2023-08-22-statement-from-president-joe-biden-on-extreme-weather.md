title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Extreme\_Weather"
---
 
Across the country, people are experiencing the devastating impacts of
extreme weather worsened by climate change. As peak hurricane season
approaches, my Administration continues taking action to bolster the
country’s preparedness, and support response and recovery efforts.  
   
I continue to be briefed on Tropical Storm Harold and its potential
impacts on South Texas. At my direction, FEMA pre-deployed personnel to
Texas to assist state and local officials and to coordinate on any
requests for resources should federal assistance be required. FEMA has
also made preparations to surge personnel and resources, if needed. I
urge people in the storm’s path to follow state and local guidance.  
   
I have also been briefed on Tropical Storm Franklin, and I directed FEMA
to pre-deploy personnel and resources to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands. We continue to monitor the storm’s path, and I urge people in
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to follow local guidance.
