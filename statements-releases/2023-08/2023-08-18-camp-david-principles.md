We, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, President Yoon Suk Yeol, and President
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., affirm a shared vision for our partnership as well
as for the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Our partnership is based on a
bedrock of shared values, mutual respect, and a unified commitment to
advance the prosperity of our three countries, the region, and the
globe. As we move forward, we intend our partnership to be guided by
these principles:  
   
As Indo-Pacific nations, Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and the
United States will continue to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific
based on a respect for international law, shared norms, and common
values. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status
quo by force or coercion.    
   
The purpose of our trilateral security cooperation is and will remain to
promote and enhance peace and stability throughout the region.  
   
Our commitment to the region includes our unwavering support for ASEAN
centrality and unity and the ASEAN-led regional architecture. We are
committed to partnering closely with ASEAN to advance implementation and
mainstreaming of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.    
   
We are determined to work closely with Pacific Island countries and the
Pacific Islands Forum as the region’s leading institution, consistent
with the Pacific Way.  
   
We stand united in our commitment to the complete denuclearization of
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with
relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. We remain
committed to dialogue with the DPRK with no preconditions. We seek to
address human rights and humanitarian issues, including the immediate
resolution of the issues of abductions, detainees, and unrepatriated
prisoners of war. We support a unified Korean Peninsula that is free and
at peace.  
   
We reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the
international community. Recognizing that there is no change in our
basic positions on Taiwan, we call for a peaceful resolution of
cross-Strait issues.  
   
As leading global economies, we seek continued opportunity and
prosperity for our peoples, the region, and the globe through open and
fair economic practices that promote financial stability as well as
orderly and well-functioning financial markets.  
   
Our technology cooperation will contribute to the vibrance and dynamism
of the Indo-Pacific as we cooperate towards open, accessible, and secure
technology approaches based on mutual confidence, trust, and respect for
relevant international law and standards. We will seek to develop
standard practices and norms between our countries and within
international bodies to guide the development, use, and transfer of
critical and emerging technologies.  
   
Our countries are committed to cooperation to address climate change and
will work together to provide leadership and solutions through relevant
international institutions. We are committed to enhancing our
development and humanitarian response cooperation to collectively
overcome global issues and the root causes of insecurity.  
   
We are unflinching in our commitment to uphold the principles of the UN
Charter, particularly those relating to sovereignty, territorial
integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the use of force. A
threat to these principles anywhere undermines respect for them
everywhere. As responsible state actors, we seek to promote the rule of
law and to ensure regional and international security so all can
flourish.   
   
Our countries are dedicated to honoring our commitments to
non-proliferation as parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons. We reaffirm that achieving a world without nuclear
weapons is a common goal for the international community, and we
continue to make every effort to ensure that nuclear weapons are never
used again.  
   
Our countries are only as strong as our societies. We reaffirm our
commitment to promoting the full and meaningful participation of women
in our societies and to human rights and dignity for all.  
   
We announce these shared principles at the start of our new chapter
together, with the belief that they will continue to guide our
trilateral partnership for years to come.  
   
Above all, we recognize that we are stronger, and the Indo-Pacific is
stronger, when Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States stand
as one.
