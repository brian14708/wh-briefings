title: "FACT SHEET: One Year after the CHIPS and Science Act, Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\
  \ Marks Historic Progress in Bringing Semiconductor Supply Chains Home, Supporting\
  \ Innovation, and Protecting National\_Security"
---
 
*Companies have announced $166 billion in investments in semiconductors
and electronics in the one year since President Biden signed CHIPS into
law*

One year ago, President Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act
(CHIPS), which makes a nearly $53 billion investment in U.S.
semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and workforce.
The law also creates a 25 percent tax credit for capital investments in
semiconductor manufacturing, and is helping to keep America at the
forefront of innovation and technological development. Semiconductors
were invented in the United States, but today we produce only about 10
percent of global supply—and none of the most advanced chips. Similarly,
investments in research and development have fallen to less than 1
percent of GDP from 2 percent in the mid-1960s at the peak of the space
race. The CHIPS and Science Act aims to change this by driving American
competitiveness, making American supply chains more resilient, and
supporting our national security and access to key technologies.  
  
In the one year since CHIPS was signed into law, companies
have announced over $166 billion in manufacturing in semiconductors and
electronics, and at least 50 community colleges in 19 states have
announced new or expanded programming to help American workers access
good-paying jobs in the semiconductor industry. In total, since the
beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, companies have announced
over $231 billion in commitments in semiconductor and electronics
investments in the United States. This week alone, the Department of
Commerce announced the first round of grants under CHIPS to support the
development of open and interoperable wireless networks, and the
National Science Foundation and Departments of Energy, Commerce, and
Defense announced progress toward establishing the National
Semiconductor Technology Center, which will help advance America’s
leadership in semiconductor research and development.

**<u>One Year of Progress on Semiconductor Manufacturing and
Innovation</u>**

Over the past year, agencies across the federal government have been
developing and executing on programs established under CHIPS to
encourage domestic semiconductor manufacturing, invest in research and
development, and support supply chain resilience and workforce
development. Key milestones in the Administration’s implementation of
CHIPS include:

*Supporting U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing*

-   The Department of Commerce launched the first [funding
    opportunity](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/06/23/CHIPS-Commercial%20Fabrication%20Facilities%20NOFO%20Amendment%201.pdf) for
    the $39 billion in semiconductor manufacturing incentives provided
    in the Act just six months after CHIPS was passed. This funding
    opportunity covers funding for projects to construct, expand, or
    modernize facilities producing semiconductors and for projects that
    are making large investments in facilities to produce semiconductor
    materials and manufacturing equipment. As the Department assesses
    applications, economic and national security considerations will be
    key factors and the program will, among other objectives, aim to
    provide a supply of secure, national-security relevant
    semiconductors.
-   Already, the Department of Commerce has received more than 460
    statements of interest from companies for projects across 42 states
    interested in receiving CHIPS funding to invest across the
    semiconductor value chain from manufacturing to supply chains to
    commercial R&D.
-   The Department of Commerce has also stood up CHIPS for America, a
    team of more than 140 people working to support implementation of
    all aspects of the CHIPS incentives program.
-   The Department of the Treasury released a [proposed
    rule](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1353) in March
    2023 to provide guidance on the Advanced Manufacturing Investment
    Credit, a 25% investment tax credit for companies engaged in
    semiconductor manufacturing and producing semiconductor
    manufacturing equipment. The Department of the Treasury also
    released a [proposed
    rule](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1534) in June
    2023 to allow companies to receive the full amount of the Advanced
    Manufacturing Investment Credit as a direct payment from the
    Internal Revenue Service.  
     

*Protecting National Security and Working with Allies and Partners*

The Department of Commerce issued a [proposed
rule](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/03/commerce-department-outlines-proposed-national-security-guardrails) in
March 2023 to implement the national security guardrails laid out in
CHIPS. These guardrails are intended to prevent technology and
innovation funded by the program from being misused by foreign countries
of concern. The Department of the Treasury’s [proposed
rule](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1353) in March
2023 implemented parallel guardrails for the Advanced Manufacturing
Investment Credit.

-   The Department of State announced in March 2023 its plans for
    implementing the [International Technology Security and Innovation
    Fund](https://www.state.gov/the-u-s-department-of-state-international-technology-security-and-innovation-fund/#:~:text=The%20International%20Technology%20Security%20and%20Innovation%20%28ITSI%29%20Fund%2C,and%20ensure%20semiconductor%20supply%20chain%20security%20and%20diversification.) to
    support semiconductor supply chain security and diversification, as
    well as adoption of trustworthy and secure telecommunications
    networks. The State Department has already announced partnerships

    supply chain.
-   The Department of Defense and Department of
    Commerce [signed](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/07/department-commerce-and-department-defense-sign-memorandum-agreement) an
    agreement to expand their collaboration to make sure that CHIPS
    investments will position the United States to manufacture
    semiconductors essential to national security and defense programs.
-   As it implements CHIPS, the Department of Commerce has been in close
    touch with a number of partners and allies including the Republic of
    Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union. The
    United States is engaging with partners and allies to coordinate
    government incentive programs, build resilient cross-border
    semiconductor supply chains, promote knowledge exchange and
    collaboration in developing next-generation technologies, and
    implement safeguards to protect national security.
