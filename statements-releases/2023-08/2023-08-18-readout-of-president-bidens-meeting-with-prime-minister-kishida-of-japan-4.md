President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of
Japan at Camp David today to discuss global and regional security issues
and to advance bilateral security and economic cooperation. 

Both leaders affirmed their resolve to continue supporting Ukraine for
as long as it takes as Ukraine defends itself from Russia’s brutal and
unlawful aggression. Recognizing the U.S. commitment to the defense of
Japan backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities, they committed to
work together closely to address regional security challenges. The
leaders expressed concern about the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC)
recent dangerous behavior in the South China Sea to assert its unlawful
maritime claims. They also reaffirmed the importance of maintaining
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

The two leaders also highlighted significant progress on defense
cooperation, including plans to pursue a Glide Phase Interceptor
cooperative development program to counter high-end hypersonic threats,
which will strengthen regional deterrence and build on long-standing
missile defense cooperation between the two countries to promote
stability.
