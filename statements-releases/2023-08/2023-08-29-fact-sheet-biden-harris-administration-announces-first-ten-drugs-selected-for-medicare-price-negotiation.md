  \ for Medicare Price\_Negotiation"

*This action is on top of progress previously made in reducing the cost
of insulin to $35 a month for people with Medicare*

For far too long, Americans have paid more for prescriptions drugs than
any major economy. But now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act,
Medicare can directly negotiate prescription drug prices to get a better
deal for seniors. Today, Medicare has for the first time selected 10
drugs for negotiation.  Seniors paid $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs
for these drugs in 2022.

Big Pharma has long fought this progress. Their profits grew as they
spent [more on stock buybacks and
dividends](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/DRUG%20PRICING%20REPORT%20WITH%20APPENDIX%20v3.pdf) than
they spent on research and development, even as nearly [three in
ten](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-july-2023-the-publics-views-of-new-prescription-weight-loss-drugs-and-prescription-drug-costs/) Americans
struggle to afford their medications because of cost.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering on another
significant milestone in implementing President Biden’s historic law to
lower health care and prescription drug costs and ushering in a new era
for American seniors. Over the next 4 years, Medicare will negotiate
prices for up to 60 drugs covered under Medicare Part D and Part B, and
up to an additional 20 drugs every year after that. 

**HHS Announces First Set of Drugs Selected for Medicare Price

These ten drugs are among those with highest total spending in Medicare
Part D. Millions of Part D enrollees depend on these vital treatments to
treat life-threatening conditions including diabetes, heart failure, and
cancer, but many struggle to access their medications because of
prohibitive costs.

Medicare drug price negotiation will result in lower out-of-pocket costs
for seniors and will save money for American taxpayers. Negotiations for
the first group of selected drugs will begin in 2023, with negotiated
prices going into effect in 2026.

**Out-of-Pocket Costs for Drugs Covered Under Part D Selected for Drug
Price Negotiation, by State**

Today HHS also released a report showing that 9 million Medicare Part D
enrollees took the drugs covered under Part D selected for negotiation
and paid a total of $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs for these drugs
in 2022.  For enrollees without additional financial assistance, average
annual out-of-pocket costs for these drugs were as high as $6,497 per
enrollee in 2022.

who use the prescription drugs selected for negotiation and their
out-of-pocket costs, visit [HHS’s

**Continuing to Lower Prescription Drug Costs**

Every day, millions of seniors are saving money on prescription drug
costs because of the Biden Administration’s actions. People with
Medicare are [saving an average of
$70](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/15/seniors-people-with-disabilities-likely-save-over-230-million-vaccines-thanks-inflation-reduction-act-according-new-hhs-report.html) in
out-of-pocket costs on vaccines like shingles and Tdap because President
Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act made recommended vaccines free for
beneficiaries starting this past January. Nearly four million seniors
and others on Medicare with diabetes started to see their insulin costs
capped at $35 per month this past January, [saving some seniors hundreds
of
dollars](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/24/new-hhs-report-finds-major-savings-americans-who-use-insulin-thanks-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html) for
a month’s supply. And some seniors taking drugs covered under Part B for
which manufacturers have hiked prices faster than inflation are saving
up to $449 in lower coinsurance this quarter thanks to the new Medicare
inflation rebates.

People with Medicare will continue to see their prescription drug costs
go down as more provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act go into effect
in the coming years. Part D enrollees will no longer pay 5% co-insurance
when they reach the catastrophic phase of their benefit starting in
2024. Nearly 19 million seniors and other Part D beneficiaries
are [projected to save $400 per
year](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/07/07/hhs-announces-actions-protect-consumers-and-lower-health-care-costs.html) on
prescription drugs when the out-of-pocket cap drops to $2,000 in 2025,
and 1.9 million enrollees with the highest drug costs will save an
average of $2,500 per year. And the lower prices negotiated for the
high-spend drugs selected today will go into effect in 2026.

The President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2024 builds upon the Inflation
Reduction Act to continue lowering the cost of prescription drugs. For
Medicare, this includes further expanding the newly established
negotiation authority by extending it to more drugs and bringing drugs
into negotiation sooner after they launch. The Budget also includes
proposals to curb inflation in prescription drug prices and cap the
prices of insulin products at $35 for a monthly prescription in the
commercial market to lower drug costs for all Americans.
