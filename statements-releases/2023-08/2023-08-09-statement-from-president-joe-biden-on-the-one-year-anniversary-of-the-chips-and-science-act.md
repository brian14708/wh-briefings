title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the One Year Anniversary of the CHIPS\
  \ and Science\_Act"
---
 
One year ago today, I signed into law the bipartisan CHIPS and Science
Act to revitalize American leadership in semiconductors, strengthen our
supply chains, protect our national security, and advance American
competitiveness.  
  
America invented semiconductors – and today, they power everything from
cell phones to cars to refrigerators. But over time, the United States
went from producing nearly 40% of the world’s chips to just over 10%,
making our economy vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions.  
  
The CHIPS and Science Act aims to change that.  
  
In the year since I signed this legislation into law, companies have
announced over $166 billion to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to
the United States. These investments are creating jobs and opportunities
in communities across the country – from Ohio to Arizona, Texas and New
York. And, in the last year alone, at least 50 community colleges have
announced new or expanded programs to help American workers access
good-paying jobs in the semiconductor industry.   
  
The CHIPS and Science Act is a key part of my Bidenomics agenda to bring
investment and opportunity to every corner of the country. Over the
coming months, my Administration will continue to implement this
historic law, make sure American union workers, small businesses, and
families benefit from investments spurred by the CHIPS and Science Act,
and make America once again a leader in semiconductor manufacturing and
less dependent on other countries for our electronics or clean energy
supply chains.
