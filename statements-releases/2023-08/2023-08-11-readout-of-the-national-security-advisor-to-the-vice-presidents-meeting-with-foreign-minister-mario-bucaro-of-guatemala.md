Ahead of Guatemala’s presidential runoff election on August 20, National
Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon met today with
Foreign Minister Mario Búcaro of Guatemala to underscore the importance
of a free, fair, and transparent process.  Dr. Gordon emphasized that a
peaceful transition between administrations is important and fundamental
to a democracy.  They discussed the United States and Guatemala’s work
to advance safe and legal pathways for migrants through continued
implementation of the Safe Mobility Office program, the implementation
of the U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration from
Central America, which Vice President Harris continues to oversee, the
$4.2 billion in private sector investments that the Vice President’s
leadership has helped generate to provide economic opportunity in
northern Central America, and regional issues, including support for a
multinational force in response to Haiti’s request for security
assistance.
