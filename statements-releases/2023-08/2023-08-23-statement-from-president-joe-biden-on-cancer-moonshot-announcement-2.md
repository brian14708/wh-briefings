title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Cancer Moonshot\_Announcement"
---
 
In my Unity Agenda I announced in my State of the Union address last
year, I called on Congress to establish and fund the Advanced Research
Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).  Members on both sides of the aisle
answered my call, and already, ARPA-H is meeting its mission to create
breakthroughs in how to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other
diseases. At a time when most people thought bipartisan action wasn’t
possible anymore, we’re proving that making progress on our toughest
health challenges like cancer is something every American can get
behind. That’s why I made it a central pillar of my Unity Agenda for the
nation, and why Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot, to end cancer
as we know it.  
   
Today, we’re taking an important step forward in achieving that
ambitious goal, with a new ARPA-H program to use mRNA technology to
train our own immune systems to fight cancer, autoimmune disorders, and
infectious diseases more effectively.  
   
Over the past few years, COVID-19 vaccines developed using mRNA
technology have saved millions of lives around the world. These
therapies, which were kickstarted by American scientists at the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), represent the power of
American ingenuity and innovation. Now, a skilled team at Emory
University in Atlanta will work to adapt these technologies to turn more
cancers into curable diseases. This is a bold endeavor that has the
potential to transform the fight against cancer and other difficult
diagnoses.  
   
I’ve long said that America can be defined by a single word:
Possibilities. My Unity Agenda is bringing both parties together in that
spirit — to get big things done for the American people. There is more
work to do, but there’s nothing we can’t do if we do it together.
