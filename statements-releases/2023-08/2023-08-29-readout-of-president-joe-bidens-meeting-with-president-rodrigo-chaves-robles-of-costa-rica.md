President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with President Rodrigo Chaves Robles
of Costa Rica at the White House today to expand the partnership between
the United States and Costa Rica.   
   
During the meeting, the leaders committed to drive inclusive, equitable,
and sustainable growth in the region through the [Americas Partnership
for Economic
Prosperity](https://www.state.gov/americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity/).
Within this context, they reiterated their commitment to build a more
resilient, diversified, secure, and sustainable global semiconductor
value chain in the Americas, including with support from a recently
announced [partnership](https://cr.usembassy.gov/chips/) under the CHIPS
Act. They also discussed ways to deepen our bilateral trade
relationship, with a view to promoting sustainable and resilient supply
chains.  
   
The two leaders reaffirmed our commitment to advance the goals outlined
in the [Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and
Protection](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/10/fact-sheet-the-los-angeles-declaration-on-migration-and-protection-u-s-government-and-foreign-partner-deliverables/).
In support of these efforts and to stabilize flows and offer
opportunities to migrants and refugees, the Department of State is
contributing more than $12 million through international organization
partners in Costa Rica. President Biden also recognized Costa Rica’s
continued cooperation in regional efforts to promote safe, orderly, and
regular migration, including through the Safe Mobility Office, which
aims to provide an alternative to migrants relying on smugglers by
facilitating access to lawful pathways to the United States and other
countries, reducing irregular migration. In addition, the Department of
Homeland Security
[announced](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-moves-closer-full-global-entry-partnership-costa-rica)
a Joint Statement of Cooperation establishing the framework to include
Costa Rica among the Global Entry foreign country partners.  
   
The Presidents also committed to deepen bilateral security cooperation
to combat organized crime and the accompanying rise in violence and
corruption. The United States, through the Department of State, will
support new projects to strengthen Costa Rica’s law enforcement and
justice sector institutions and combat transnational organized crime,
narcotics trafficking, and corruption. Key projects will include up to
$24 million in programmatic support for enhanced police and Coast Guard
stations; strengthening Costa Rica’s National Police Academy; expanding
the citizen security crime prevention program, *Sembremos Seguridad*;
and increasing support to Costa Rica’s Air Surveillance Service.  
   
President Biden and President Chaves also discussed bilateral
cybersecurity cooperation, including progress in Costa Rica’s building
of a national cybersecurity operations center, supported by U.S.
cybersecurity assistance, as announced in March. President Biden also
commended Costa Rica’s commitment to using trusted providers in its
upcoming 5G tender and auctions.  
   
Both Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to continuing
people-to-people ties. In support of these efforts, the State Department
will fund new programs for women entrepreneurs and access to higher
education for African-descendant and indigenous students in the province
of Limón, as well as English language programs across Costa Rica.
