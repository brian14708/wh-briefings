title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on July Consumer Price Inflation\_Report"
---
 
Today’s report shows that our economy remains strong. Annual inflation
has fallen by around two thirds since last summer, and inflation outside
of food and energy has fallen to its lowest level in any three-month
period since September 2021. We’ve made this progress while maintaining
the broad strength of our economy: unemployment remains near record
lows, a higher share of working age Americans are working now than in 20
years, real wages for the average American worker are growing and are
higher than they were before the pandemic—with lower wage workers seeing
the largest gains. We’re growing the economy from the middle out and
bottom up, lowering costs for hardworking families, and making smart
investments in America: that’s Bidenomics.
