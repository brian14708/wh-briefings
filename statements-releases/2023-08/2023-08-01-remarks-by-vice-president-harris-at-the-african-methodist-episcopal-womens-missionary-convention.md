Orlando, Florida*

2:15 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Please have a seat.  Good afternoon.  Good
afternoon.  Good afternoon.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  
  
Bishops, Episcopal <s>survivors</s> \[supervisors\], connectional
officers, and members of Congress: It is an honor to be with you here
today.   
   
Dr. Deborah Taylor King, thank you for your words and for that
introduction and for your leadership of this historic organization.   
   
To the members of the Women’s Missionary Society, including the 1,300
Life Members here with us today — (applause) — thank you all for
welcoming me so warmly.  And thank you for the work you do every day for
our nation.   
   
So, my pastor, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown, said to me recently, “As
people of faith, we are called to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with God.”   
   
Every day, the leaders of the Women’s Missionary Society live the truth
of these words.  You care for the sick and feed the hungry.  You
organize to stop the horror of gun violence.  You help Americans
register to vote so they can make their voices heard.  (Applause.)  And
like my dear, dear friend Val Demings, you have led our nation in
elected office as well.  (Applause.)  There’s Val.  So, I thank you all
for your service to our country.  
   
Standing with you today, I tell you, I feel at home.  As many of you
know, I was born in Oakland, California.  And — (applause) — and growing
up, I attended 23rd Avenue Church of God.  My sister Maya and I, we sang
in the choir; of course, went to Sunday School; and gathered with family
and friends in the basement of our church to eat food prepared by loving
hands.   
   
So, that to quickly say that, for so many of us, church is a place of
belonging, of community, and fellowship.  Church is a place where,
together, we find and share our faith.  As it says in Luke chapter 1,
verse 79, faith has the power to shine a light on those living in
darkness, to guide our feet in the path of peace.  
   
In moments of uncertainty and confusion, when the way is not clear, it
is faith that guides us forward — faith in what we often cannot see yet
know to be true.   
   
Such faith has always guided this church.  The United States and the AME
church were born in the same moment in time, and both were founded on a
set of fundamental principles: liberty, equality, and freedom. 
(Applause.)  
   
Now, as we all know, when our nation was established, these principles
did not apply equally to all Americans.  But significantly, the members
of this church saw what could be unburdened by what had been and, guided
by the light of their faith, fought to build a better nation.   
   
In the darkness of slavery, it was the faith of people like Sarah Allen
that lit the way north for the Underground Railroad.   
   
In the darkness of the Civil War, it was faith that led members of
Mother Bethel to address Fredrick Douglass’s call and join the 55th
Massachusetts all-Black infantry regiment in the fight for
liberation.   
   
In the darkness of segregation, it was faith that led the foot soldiers
for freedom to Brown Chapel to prepare for their march from Selma to
Montgomery.   
   
Generation after generation, members of this church — great Americans
like Roy Wilkins, Rosa Parks, and Assistant Leader Jim Clyburn —
(applause) — have shined a light on the path toward freedom.   
   
Sons and daughters of Richard and Sarah Allen, your history — and I say
this as Vice President of the United States — your history is American
history.  (Applause.)   
   
And through your faith, you have helped to make real the promise of our
founding principles not just for some but for all.   
   
And I am here, then, to say: Our nation needs your leadership once
again.  In this moment, across our country, hard-fought, hard-won
freedoms are under full-on attack.   
   
Just consider: In states across our nation, extremists attack the
freedom to vote.  They pass laws to ban drop boxes, to limit early
voting, to make it illegal to offer food and water to people who are
standing in line for hours to simply cast their ballot.  Bishops, what
ever happened to “love thy neighbor”?  (Applause.)  
   
In states across our nation, extremists pass laws that criminalize
doctors and take away the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her
own body.  (Applause.)  
   
\\And we are all clear: One does not have to abandon their faith or
deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her
what to do with her body.  (Applause.)  Let her make that decision with
her pastor or her priest or her rabbi but not her government telling her
what to do.   
   
In this moment, we see extremists attack our friends and neighbors
because of who they are and who they love.  And all the while, these
same extremists refuse to pass reasonable gun safety laws — (applause) —
to keep our children and places of worship safe — reasonable gun safety
laws, like the type Mother Emanuel has too long fought for.   
   
And on top of all of this, in this moment, we even see extremists ban
books and attempt to erase and even rewrite the ugly parts of our
history.   
   
Right here in Florida — (applause) — right here in Florida, they plan to
teach students that enslaved people benefited from slavery.  They insult
us in an attempt to gaslight us in an attempt to divide and distract our
nation with unnecessary debates.  And now they attempt to legitimize
these unnecessary debates with a proposal that most recently came in of
a politically motivated roundtable.   
  
Well, I’m here in Florida.  (Applause.)  And I will tell you, there is
no roundtable, no lecture, no invitation we will accept to debate an
undeniable fact: There were no redeeming qualities of slavery.
 (Applause.)    
   
 And as I said last week when I was again here in Florida: We will not
stop calling out and fighting back against extremist so-called leaders
who try to prevent our children from learning our true and full
history.  (Applause.)   
   
And so, in this moment, let us remember: It is in the darkness that the
candle shines most brightly.   
   
So, let us not be distracted.  Let us not be deterred.  And let us have
faith in who we are as a nation.  Let us agree that the true measure of
strength is not based on who you beat down but who you lift up. 
(Applause.)    
   
Let us agree that it is a sign of strength, not of weakness, for leaders
to have empathy, to be concerned about the suffering of others.  And let
us also agree that our faith requires action.  (Applause.)  It requires
that we fight for what we know to be true, for what we know to be good,
and for what we know to be right.   
   
And that is certainly what President Biden and I have been doing with
the support of so many of the leaders here.   
   
Consider that, for years, so many of our seniors had to choose between
either putting food on the table or filling their prescription.   
   
And so, President Biden and I did what is right and we capped the cost
of insulin at $35 a month for our seniors — (applause) — and made sure
no senior would pay more than $2,000 a year for their medicine.  
   
Consider: For years, parents and grandparents around our country have
cried out about the harm of lead pipes — about what lead pipes do to the
health and learning ability of their children.   
   
And so, when we took office, President Biden and I did what is right. 
And today, we are on track to remove every lead pipe in America. 
(Applause.)  
   
For years, our HBCUs have been underfunded, even though — and I know I’m
preaching to the choir here — even though our HBCUs centers of academic
excellence.  (Applause.)   
   
And so, when we took office — and I say this as a proud HBCU graduate
—  
   
AUDIENCE:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You know.  (Laughter.)  I made sure we did what is
right, and President Biden and I invested over $7 billion in our HBCUs —
(applause) — which, of course, is an investment in the future leaders of
our nation.   
   
For years, our nation has ignored the crisis of maternal mortality —
that before, during, and after childbirth, women in America die at a
higher rate than any other wealthy nation in the world and that Black
women are three times more likely to die.   
   
So, when President Biden and I took office, we did what is right and
made maternal health a national priority and expanded postpartum
coverage through Medicaid from 2 months to 12 months — (applause) — and
increased coverage from 3 states to now 35 states to the benefit of a
half a million more women.   
   
For far too long, far too many people in far too many communities have
lived in fear of violence.  And I believe the right to be safe in
school, at work, and in a place of worship should be thought of as a
civil right.   
   
So, when we took office, President Biden and I did what is right.  We
strengthened background checks to prevent gun violence and we invested
billions of dollars in job training, mental health resources, and our
communities.  Because we know when we invest in our communities, that is
what helps makes them safe.   
   
And because no one should have to live in fear of those sworn to protect
and serve, we restricted the use of chokeholds and no-knock warrants by
federal law enforcement.  (Applause.)  And we will continue to work with
civil rights leaders, law enforcement officials, and the leaders in this
room to make sure our justice system lives up to its name.   
   
And since coming into office, President Joe Biden and I — very proud to
report this — have appointed more Black women to be federal judges than
any administration in history — (applause) — including the first Black
woman ever to sit on the highest court in our land: Justice Ketanji
Brown Jackson.   
   
So, all of this work is guided by our faith in America.  We here today,
I know — we here today — we love our country and we believe — we truly
believe in the principles upon which our country was founded.  And I
believe the fight to preserve and protect these principles is one of the
truest forms of patriotism.   
   
The great Coretta Scott King, a woman of deep faith, once said, and I
will paraphrase: Freedom is never really won.  You earn it and win it in
every generation.  
   
So, at this moment in history, I say: We were born for a time such as
this.  (Applause.)   
   
So, let us shine a light on the path forward.  Let us fight toward a
future where every woman has the freedom to make decisions about her own
body, where every voter has the freedom to make their voice heard, where
every child can learn our true and full history, and where every family
can live free from violence and hate and every person — no matter where
they are or where they come from — has the opportunity to thrive.   
   
And as we do so, let us fight with optimism, with faith, and with hope. 
Because as the history of our nation and the history of this church
tells us: When we fight, we win.  (Applause.)  
   
Thank you.  May God bless you.  And may God bless the United States of
America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
