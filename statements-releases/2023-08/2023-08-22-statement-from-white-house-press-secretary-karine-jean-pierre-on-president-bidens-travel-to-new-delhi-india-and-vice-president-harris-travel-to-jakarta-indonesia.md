President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to New Delhi, India, from
September 7-10  to attend the G20 Leaders’ Summit. President Biden and
G20 partners will discuss a range of joint efforts to tackle global
issues, including on the clean energy transition and combatting climate
change, mitigating the economic and social impacts of Putin’s war in
Ukraine, and increasing the capacity of multilateral development banks,
including the World Bank, to better fight poverty, including by
addressing global challenges.  While in New Delhi, President Biden will
also commend Prime Minister Modi’s leadership of the G20 and reaffirm
the U.S. commitment to the G20 as the premier forum of economic
cooperation, including by hosting it in 2026.  
   
From September 4-7, Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Jakarta,
Indonesia to attend the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit and
engage with leaders from the Indo-Pacific. The Vice President and ASEAN
leaders will review the unprecedented expansion in U.S.-ASEAN relations
under the Biden-Harris Administration and the Vice President will
reaffirm the United States’ enduring commitment to Southeast Asia and
ASEAN centrality. Throughout these Summits and her additional
engagements, the Vice President will advance initiatives to promote our
shared prosperity and security, including by advancing our work on the
climate crisis, maritime security, infrastructure, economic growth,
efforts to uphold and strengthen international rules and norms in the
region, and other regional and global challenges.  
   
This visit builds on President Biden’s participation in the U.S.-ASEAN
Summit and the East Asia Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in November
2022, his virtual participation in the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and East Asia
Summit in November 2021, and the President’s and Vice President’s
engagements with ASEAN leaders at the historic May 2022 U.S.-ASEAN
Special Summit in Washington, D.C. This is the Vice President’s third
trip to Southeast Asia in the past two years, and builds on her August
2021 visit to Singapore and Vietnam and her November 2022 visit to
Thailand and the Philippines.  
    
Additional information, including about bilateral engagements and other
details on the trip, will be forthcoming — and we look forward to having
further details to share soon.
