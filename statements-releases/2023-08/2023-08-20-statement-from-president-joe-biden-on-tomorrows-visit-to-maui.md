title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Tomorrow\u2019s Visit to\_Maui"
---
 
My heart, my prayers, and my focus are on the victims of the Maui
wildfires and their families. I know how profoundly loss can impact a
family and a community and I know nothing can replace the loss of life.
I will do everything in my power to help Maui recover and rebuild from
this tragedy. And throughout our efforts, we are focused on respecting
sacred lands, cultures, and traditions.  
   
From day one we immediately authorized three Fire Management Assistance
Grants and as soon as Governor Green requested a Major Disaster
Declaration, I signed it. My Administration has mobilized a
whole-of-government response effort with more than 1,000 federal
personnel on the ground in Maui, including nearly 450 search and rescue
team members. Jill and I are eager to meet with the brave first
responders in Lahaina tomorrow, to spend time with families and
community members, and witness firsthand what will be required for the
community to recover. We will be here as long as it takes for Maui.  

  
**FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration’s Latest Actions to Support
Communities Impacted by Maui Wildfires**  
   
*More than 1,000 Federal personnel are on the ground in Maui*  
*to aid response efforts*

  
As soon as receiving the state’s request, President Biden
[signed](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/08/10/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-approves-hawaii-disaster-declaration-3/)
a Major Disaster Declaration for the state and launched a
whole-of-government effort to support residents and communities affected
by this unprecedented tragedy. On Monday, August 21, President Biden and
First Lady Jill Biden will travel to Maui to meet with survivors, first
responders and emergency personnel, and state and local officials. Our
entire nation stands with Hawaii in this time of grief and recovery.  
   
Since the onset of the fires in Maui, President Biden has remained in
close contact with Hawaii Governor Josh Green, affirming that the
Federal government will continue to provide whatever support is needed
to ensure the state’s recovery, however long it may take. The President
has also received regular briefings from FEMA Administrator Deanne
Criswell and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall.  
   
Dozens of Federal departments and agencies, including the Department of
Homeland Security through FEMA and the Coast Guard, the Department of
Defense through the Navy and Army, the Department of Health and Human
Services, the U.S. Forest Service, the Small Business Administration
(SBA), the Environmental Protection Agency, and more continue working
with state and local partners on the ground to assess ongoing needs and
provide resources and personnel to support response efforts.  
   
The Administration encourages individuals impacted by the disaster to
register for Federal assistance at
[www.disasterassistance.gov](http://www.disasterassistance.gov) or by
calling 1-800-621-3362 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week).  
   
Impacted individuals can also visit FEMA’s newly opened joint Disaster
Recovery Center at the University of Hawaii Maui College, located at 310
W. Ka’ahumanu Avenue, Kahului, Hawaii, to speak personally with FEMA
specialists, get assistance registering for disaster assistance, get in
touch with voluntary organizations offering additional support services,
and have access to other federal and state resources.  The doors are
open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. HST seven days a week.  
   
Here is an update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s coordinated
federal response:

-   As of Sunday, August 20, there are more than **1,000 federal
    personnel on the ground in Maui** assisting residents in their
    greatest time of need, including nearly **450 search and rescue team
    members**. FEMA’s Disaster Survivor Assistance teams are going to
    shelters and survivors’ homes to help people register for
    assistance.  
-   To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved more than **$8
    million in assistance** to nearly **2,500 households**, including
    nearly $3 million in initial rental assistance.   
-   FEMA has made available more than **50,000 meals**, **75,000 liters
    of water,** **5,000 cots** and **10,000 blankets** and shelter
    supplies to the county government for distribution.  
-   Thanks to the significant partnership between the Hawaii Fire Relief
    Housing program administered by the American Red Cross and funded by
    FEMA, the number of **survivors in congregate shelters was reduced
    by 50%** on Thursday. The Red Cross expects to move all survivors
    who are still in shelters into hotel rooms by next week. More than
    **300 Red Cross staff** are working with partners to ensure people
    receive help as quickly as possible.  
-   Last week, President Biden made [**additional disaster funding
    available**](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230816/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-increases-federal-cost-share-hawaii)
    to the state of Hawaii, unlocking the federal government’s ability
    to cover all eligible expenses for debris removal and emergency
    protective measures in Maui County and assistance for emergency
    protective measures for Hawaii County. The President authorized the
    federal cost share to be increased from 75% to 100% for 30 days that
    the Governor selects within the first 120 days.  
-   Nearly 650 personnel from the **Department of Defense** and 140
    members of the Coast Guard are actively participating in the
    coordinated response to the Western Maui Wildfire.  They are
    assisting with fire suppression, searching debris for remains,
    distributing fuel, and providing additional life-sustaining
    support.  
-   The **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** has deployed 62 responders, 16
    remote personnel, and 43 contractors who are assisting with public
    works and engineering support, which includes installing 15
    generators for temporary emergency power, planning for debris
    collection and removal, and scoping potential requirements for
    temporary construction of critical public facilities such as
    schools, fire and police stations.  
-   The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** has deployed nearly 50
    responders to Maui following the Hawaii wildfires and has a full
    incident command team on the ground working closely with FEMA and
    other federal, state, and local partners. The agency’s efforts are
    focused on identifying, removing, and safely disposing of household
    hazardous waste and disaster debris to protect residents from
    environmental and health hazards. This is the next step in the
    recovery process before the clearing of debris. EPA’s response
    efforts while on Maui will be guided by its cultural resources and
    historic properties plan that the agency is working to develop with
    the Hawaii State Historic Preservation Division. This plan will help
    responders identify, protect, and properly handle cultural
    resources, which were significantly impacted during the wildfire.  
-   The **Department of Energy (DOE)** has deployed emergency responders
    to support the Federal response to the wildfires in Maui. DOE is
    working closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Hawaii
    State Energy Office, and the Hawaii Office of Emergency Management
    and has been in contact with Hawaiian Electric to identify and
    address any unmet needs.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR)**
    deployed 95 responders from ASPR, including experts from the
    National Disaster Medical System’s Disaster Mortuary Operational
    Response Team and a Victim Identification Center team to assist Maui
    County with victim identification. Secretary Becerra [issued a
    Public Health
    Emergency](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/08/11/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-declares-public-health-emergency-hawaii-response-wildfires.html)
    shortly after the President’s disaster declaration, giving CMS
    health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting
    emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries on the
    ground. HHS’ Disaster Distress Helpline – 1-800-985-5990 – is
    available to provide immediate counseling to anyone affected by the
    wildfires.  
-   The **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)** has more than 30
    staff on the ground in Hawaii and are phasing in more. Survivors and
    businesses who register for FEMA assistance, will also be eligible
    for low-interest disaster loans. To be considered for all forms of
    disaster assistance, survivors must contact FEMA. Information and
    details on the location of business recovery centers is available by
    calling the SBA Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955.
    Additionally, SBA this week opened a Disaster Business Recovery
    Center (BRC) for survivors of the Maui wildfires – including
    homeowners, renters, and small business owners – to seek financial
    assistance. The SBA Recovery Center is located at Hawaii Technology
    Development Corporation, Maui Research Technology Center, Building
    \# A, Ste. 119 (Conference Room), 590 Lipoa Pkwy, Kihei, HI 
    96753.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service**
    [approved
    waivers](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/hawaii-disaster-nutrition-assistance), which
    will allow Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
    households in Hawaii, including on Maui, to purchase hot foods with
    SNAP benefits through September 14; allow package size flexibility
    for those using the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
    Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program through October 31 so
    they have more options to purchase what is available; and allow
    parents or guardians to pick up meals for children at grab ‘n go
    sites.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)** is
    providing a 90-day relief from foreclosures of Federal Housing
    Administration-insured mortgages and home equity conversion
    mortgages. Homeowners affected by the disaster should contact their
    mortgage or loan servicer immediately. They can also call the FHA
    Resource Center at 1-800-304-9320 for additional information and
    visit the [FHA Disaster
    Relief](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/nsc/qaho0121)
    site to learn more about disaster relief options for FHA homeowners.
    HUD also released [regulatory and administrative
    waivers](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/CPD/documents/Hawaii_Wildfires_Megawaiver_Signed_8-14-2023.pdf)
    to help communities accelerate their recovery. This includes funding
    for housing rehabilitation and reconstruction, homebuyer programs
    replacing disaster damaged residences, infrastructure improvements
    and assistance to people at risk of homelessness. HUD has assigned
    experienced Disaster Technical Assistance providers that will be
    available remotely and, on the ground, to support local leaders help
    communities and families that were experiencing homelessness before
    the devastating fires and those that may require homeless services
    because of the fires.  
-   The **U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau** has created a
    [disaster and emergencies
    guide](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/disasters-and-emergencies/)
    to handling finances, including resources to help impacted residents
    recover, such as tackling housing issues, protecting your finances,
    dealing with property damage, managing your bills, and asking for
    help from financial companies like banks, credit cards and other
    lenders. If residents are having trouble with a financial company,
    they can [submit a complaint
    online](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) or by
    calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).   
-   The **Heritage Emergency National Task Force (HENTF)**, a
    partnership between FEMA and Smithsonian Institution, is in contact
    with the National Heritage Responders: Hawaii cultural heritage
    emergency network. Working in partnership through the Hawaii
    Emergency Management Agency, HENTF is ensuring that museums and
    cultural heritage sites are incorporated into FEMA preliminary
    damage assessments to anticipate needs associated with long-term
    recovery planning.
