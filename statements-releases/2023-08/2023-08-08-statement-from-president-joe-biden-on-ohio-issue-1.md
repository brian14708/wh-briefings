title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Ohio Issue\_1"
---
 
Today, Ohio voters rejected an effort by Republican lawmakers and
special interests to change the state’s constitutional amendment
process. This measure was a blatant attempt to weaken voters’ voices and
further erode the freedom of women to make their own health care
decisions. Ohioans spoke loud and clear, and tonight democracy won.
