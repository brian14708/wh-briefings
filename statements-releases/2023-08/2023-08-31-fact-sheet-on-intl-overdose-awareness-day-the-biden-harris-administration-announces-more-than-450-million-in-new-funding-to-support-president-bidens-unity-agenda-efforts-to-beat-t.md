**Biden-Harris Administration hosting Families of Overdose Event today
at the White House**

Today, on International Overdose Awareness Day, the Biden-Harris
administration is recognizing all those who have lost someone to an
overdose. President Biden [declared August 27 through September 2 as
Overdose Awareness
Week](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/08/25/a-proclamation-on-overdose-awareness-week-2023/) to
focus the nation’s attention on the devastation caused by illicit
fentanyl and other drugs. During this week of recognition, we reaffirm
our commitment to beating this epidemic — in memory of those we have
lost and to protect the lives we can still save.  
  
Today, in support of President Biden’s [Unity Agenda efforts to beat the
overdose
epidemic](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/03/28/fact-sheet-president-bidens-budget-advances-a-bipartisan-unity-agenda/) and
save lives, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing more than $450
million to strengthen prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and
recovery support services and crack down on illicit drug trafficking.
Later today, the Biden-Harris Administration will host family members
from across the country at the White House who have lost loved ones to a
drug overdose. Families will have the opportunity to share their
personal stories, and discuss ways we can all work together to end the
overdose epidemic.  
  
Saving lives is the North Star of President Biden’s [National Drug
Control
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdf),
and [after a years-long period of rapid increases in the overdose death
rate from 2019 – 2021, the United States is now seeing continued
progress in flattening this
trend](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/08/17/white-house-ondcp-director-statement-on-flattening-overdose-death-rate-over-the-past-year/).
The latest CDC report released earlier this month marked 13 months
straight of leveling off of overdose deaths. The Biden-Harris
Administration is committed to building on this progress and doubling
down on all efforts to reduce drug overdose deaths, save lives, and make
our communities safer. These latest Biden-Harris administration-wide
efforts will:

**Strengthen Prevention Efforts**

-   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is
    announcing approximately $20.5 million to 164 new Drug-Free
    Communities (DFC) Support Program awards for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023.
    The new awards join 587 previously awarded continuation grant
    recipients, for a total of 751 funded community coalitions, the
    highest number in the program’s 25-year history. This represents a
    total FY 2023 investment by the Biden-Harris Administration of more
    than $93.8 million to support evidence-based prevention efforts
    locally.
-   ONDCP is investing an additional $1 million dollars into its Real
    Deal on Fentanyl campaign with the Ad Council. The campaign aims to
    reach young people, who are the fastest-growing age group to
    experience opioid overdose in the United States. Since launching in
    fall 2022, the campaign has garnered 946.9M impressions.

**Support State and Local Treatment and Recovery Efforts**

-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is awarding
    $279 million in Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) grants to states and
    localities to expand harm reduction strategies, link people to
    life-saving care, and make the latest data available so that we can
    get ahead of the constantly evolving overdose crisis. For the first
    time, in addition to funding state health departments to prevent
    drug overdose, CDC is providing funding to directly support city,
    county, and territorial health departments, filling a distinct gap
    in funding for local communities. Both the state and local efforts
    include a focus on collecting and using data to inform action,
    engaging people with lived experience, and addressing health
    disparities. CDC tailored these funding opportunities to best serve
    partners at state, local, and territorial levels. State health
    departments may be best equipped to serve state-level surveillance
    efforts, as well as state-wide Prescription Drug Monitoring Program
    (PDMP) practices. Local health departments can leverage proximity to
    local communities to better engage in harm reduction and linkage to
    and retention in care efforts. Funded recipients will be able to
    respond more quickly, more effectively, and more equitably to their
    constituents’ needs, using and translating data to drive action
    steps that reduce overdose deaths and related harms in communities
    as fast as possible.
-   The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is awarding
    more than $80 million to rural communities in 39 states to support
    key strategies to respond to the overdose risk from illicit fentanyl
    and other opioids. These awards will support interventions such as
    distributing the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone to
    prevent fatal overdose; creating and expanding treatment sites in
    rural areas to provide medications to treat opioid use disorder;
    expanding access to behavioral health care for young people in rural
    communities; and, caring for infants in rural areas who are at-risk
    for opioid exposure or experiencing symptoms related opioid
    exposure.
-   The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
    (SAMHSA) is awarding more than $57.6 million to connect Americans to
    substance use treatment and recovery support services, including:
    -   $1.7 million to the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers
        Program, which establishes or implements comprehensive treatment
        and recovery centers. These centers provide a full spectrum of
        treatment, harm reduction and recovery support services to
        address the opioid epidemic and ensure access to all three Food
        and Drug Administration-approved Medications for Opioid Use
        Disorder (MOUD). 
    -   $29.6 million to the Promoting the Integration of Primary and
        Behavioral Health Care Program, which promotes the improvement
        of integrated care models for behavioral health care and
        primary/physical health care to improve the overall wellness and
        physical health status of adults who have a serious mental
        illness (SMI); adults who have co-occurring mental illness and
        physical health conditions or chronic disease; children and
        adolescents with serious emotional disturbance (SED) who have
        co-occurring physical health conditions or chronic disease;
        individuals who have substance use disorders (SUD); or
        individuals who have co-occurring substance use and mental
        disorders (COD); and promotes the implementation and improvement
        of bidirectional integrated care services.
    -   $1.2 million to the Recovery Community Services Program, which
        provides peer recovery support services to individuals with SUD
        or COD, including those in recovery from these disorders. The
        program’s foundation is the value of lived experience of peers
        to assist others in achieving and maintaining recovery. These
        services, in conjunction with clinical treatment services, are
        an integral component of the recovery process for many people.
    -   $735,000 to the Recovery Community Services Program-Statewide
        Network Program, which strengthens community-based recovery
        organizations, their statewide networks of recovery stakeholders
        and specialty and general health care systems as key partners in
        the delivery of state and local recovery support services
        through collaboration, systems improvement, public health
        messaging and training conducted for or with key recovery
        groups.
    -   $6.6 million to the Rural Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
        Training Grant Program, which recruits and trains EMS personnel
        in rural areas with a particular focus on addressing SUD and
        COD. Recipients will be expected to train EMS personnel on SUD
        and COD, trauma-informed, recovery-based care for people with
        such disorders in emergency situations and, as appropriate, to
        maintain licenses and certifications relevant to serve in an EMS
        agency.
    -   $15.8 million to the Treatment for Individuals with Serious
        Mental Illness, Serious Emotional Disturbance, or Co-Occurring
        Disorders Experiencing Homelessness Program, which provides
        comprehensive, coordinated and evidenced-based services for
        individuals, youth, and families with SMI, SED, or COD who are
        experiencing homelessness or are at imminent risk of
        homelessness (e.g., people exiting jail or prison without a
        place to live).
    -   $2 million to the Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support
        Grant Program, which implements evidence-based programs to
        support individuals in SUD treatment and recovery to live
        independently and participate in the workforce. Award recipients
        will be expected to ascertain gaps in the workforce and
        coordinate statewide employment and training activities for
        participants enrolled in their program with SUD in treatment and
        recovery.

**Disrupt And Dismantle Illicit Drug Trafficking Operations**

-   ONDCP is announcing more than $18.9 million in FY 2023 discretionary
    funding for its [High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA)
    Program](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/grant-programs/hidta/),
    adding to the more than $275 million provided in base funding
    released earlier this year. This new allocation of funds will
    support discretionary projects in 33 regional HIDTAs and the
    National HIDTA Assistance Center. The funding includes $6.75 million
    for the creation and expansion of Crime Gun Intelligence Centers
    (CGICs) in 27 regional HIDTAs. These CGICs are operated in
    partnership with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
    Explosives, and are a critical part of addressing the violence that
    frequently accompanies illicit drug trafficking. Taken together,
    these measures will help save lives and make our communities safer.
