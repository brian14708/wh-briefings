title: "President Joe\_Biden Names Ed Siskel New White\_House\_Counsel"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced that Ed Siskel will serve as White
House Counsel. Siskel served for nearly four years in the White House
Counsel’s Office during the Obama-Biden Administration, ultimately
becoming Deputy Counsel. As White House Counsel, he will lead a team
serving the President with counsel on legal matters facing the White
House and the country – crafting policies and executive actions,
defending and advancing the President’s agenda, and pursuing progress
for the American people.  
   
*Statement from the President:* “Ed Siskel’s many years of experience in
public service and a career defending the rule of law make him the
perfect choice to serve as my next White House Counsel. For nearly four
years in the White House when I was Vice President, he helped the
Counsel’s Office navigate complex challenges and advance the President’s
agenda on behalf of the American people, and first as a federal
prosecutor and then as the top counsel for one of America’s biggest and
most vibrant cities, his hometown of Chicago, Ed has shown a deep
commitment to public service and respect for the law. His experience
will let him hit the ground running as a key leader on my team as we
continue making progress for the American people every day.”  
   
Siskel will replace Stuart Delery beginning in September.

Ed Siskel served for nearly four years in the Obama-Biden White House
Counsel’s Office, including as Deputy Counsel. In that role, he oversaw
the White House’s legal responses to congressional oversight and to
complex challenges such as the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. After
leaving the White House and a stint in private practice, he served for
two years as the top lawyer for his hometown of Chicago as Corporation
Counsel under Mayor Rahm Emanuel, where he oversaw hundreds of attorneys
and support staff, and most recently was chief legal officer for a
Chicago-based investment firm. He joined the Obama-Biden White House
after serving at the Justice Department as associate deputy attorney
general and, prior to that, senior counsel to the Deputy Attorney
General. He previously was a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s
Office in the Northern District of Illinois and a clerk for Justice John
Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court. A Chicago native, he graduated
from Wesleyan University and the University of Chicago Law School, where
he was Editor-in-Chief of the Law Review.
