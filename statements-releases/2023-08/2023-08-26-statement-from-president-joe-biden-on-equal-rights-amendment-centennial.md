title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Equal Rights Amendment\_Centennial"
---
 
One hundred years ago, a pioneering group of women proposed the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) which would definitively enshrine the principle
of gender equality in the Constitution. Now, a century later, our fight
continues to finish the job and codify women’s rights and gender
equality once and for all.  
   
I have long supported the ERA since I first ran for public office – and
it is long past time that we heed the will of the American people and
make this Amendment the law of the land. No one should be discriminated
against based on their sex—and we, as a nation, must affirm and protect
women’s full equality. As we mark Women’s Equality Day, I continue to
urge Congress to act swiftly to recognize ratification of the ERA and
affirm the fundamental truth that all Americans should have equal rights
and protections under the law.
