President Joe Biden spoke today with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva
of Brazil to continue joint efforts on priority global and regional
issues to our two countries.  
   
The two leaders spoke at length about cooperation on climate and
preparations for COP28, including President Biden’s commitment to
request $500 million from Congress over five years to support the Amazon
Fund and related activities, as well as ongoing efforts to help mobilize
up to $1 billion to support the restoration of degraded lands in Brazil
and the Amazon region through the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation. The President applauded Brazil’s regional and global
leadership on climate, including hosting the Amazon Summit and Amazon
Dialogues to articulate a common agenda for sustainable development,
combating deforestation, and addressing social and economic
inequalities, as well as previewed U.S. plans for an upcoming “green
trade mission” to Brazil in September to promote forest, land use, and
energy investments.  
   
President Biden and President Lula also committed to work together to
advance and protect workers’ rights, and to promote inclusive prosperity
for our two countries and the world. They also committed to maintain
active communication on the situation in Venezuela and Haiti.
