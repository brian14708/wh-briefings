*President Biden announces $95 million through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to harden Hawaiʻi’s* *power grid and position the
state to better withstand future storms*  
  
*More than 1,000 Federal personnel are on the ground on Maui*  
*to aid response efforts*

Since the onset of the unprecedented wildfires on Maui, Hawaiʻi,
President Biden launched a whole-of-government effort to support
survivors and affected communities, and as soon as Hawaiʻi Governor Josh
Green requested a Major Disaster Declaration, the
President [signed](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=9062e46def&e=ebcdb14f7c) it.
Today, as part of this commitment, President Biden is convening Cabinet
and Agency officials who are supporting long-term recovery and
rebuilding efforts on the ground – to discuss the work underway to
support the people of Maui as they heal, rebuild, and recover over the
long-term.  
  
As President Biden made clear during his visit to Maui last week, the
Biden-Harris Administration will do everything in its power to help Maui
recover and rebuild from this tragedy. And throughout these efforts, the
Administration will remain focused on respecting sacred lands, cultures,
and traditions. The Administration will be there as long as it takes to
complete response efforts.  
  
As part of this commitment, President Biden is today announcing the
Department of Energy is providing **$95 million through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to harden Hawaiʻi’s** **electric grid, **improve
service, limit damage during future events, and help prevent failures in
the future that could lead to severe events. The funding will help
strengthen critical transmission lines, including two on Maui; harden
poles supporting critical facilities such as hospitals, water
facilities, emergency response, and military; replace wooden poles with

fire-resistant material; deploy intelligent switches and materials to
help reduce wildfire risk; remove hazard trees; and, relocate the Maui
control center to a more secure and resilient location. This investment
will help reduce the likelihood of outages, reduce restoration times
following outages, reduce risk of wildfire events, and increase grid
operational resilience.    
  
Hundreds of personnel from across dozens of Federal departments and
agencies continue working with state and local partners on the ground to
assess ongoing needs and provide resources and personnel to support
response efforts.  
  
The Administration encourages individuals impacted by the disaster to
register for Federal assistance
at [www.disasterassistance.gov](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=8eafb9013b&e=ebcdb14f7c) or
by calling 1-800-621-3362 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Additionally,
as we work to provide communications to meet the needs of those impacted
by the Hawaiʻi wildfires, FEMA has [multiple language
translations](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=e093d3b1a2&e=ebcdb14f7c) available.  
  
Impacted individuals can also visit FEMA’s joint Disaster Recovery
Centers (DRCs) at the University of Hawaiʻi Maui College, located at 310
W. Ka’ahumanu Avenue, Kahului, Hawaiʻi or at the Mayor Hannibal Tavares
Community Center, located at 91 Pukalani St., Makawao, Hawaiʻi, to speak
personally with FEMA specialists, get assistance registering for
disaster assistance, get in touch with voluntary organizations offering
additional support services, and have access to other federal and state
resources.  The doors are open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. HST seven days a
week.

Here is an update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s coordinated
federal response:

-   More than **1,000 federal personnel are on the ground on
    Maui** assisting residents in their greatest time of need, including
    FEMA’s Disaster Survivor Assistance teams who are reaching people
    where they are to help survivors register for assistance.  
-   To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved more
    than **$16 million in assistance** to **4,200 households**.   
-   FEMA has made available more than **50,000 meals**, **75,000 liters
    of water,** **5,000 cots** and **10,000 blankets** and shelter
    supplies to the county government for distribution.  
-   Thanks to the significant partnership between the Hawaiʻi Fire
    Relief Housing program administered by the **American Red Cross and
    funded by FEMA**, all congregate shelters have been closed as more
    than 2,500 residents have successfully been moved into hotels. More
    than 350 Red Cross disaster responders are working in coordination
    with partners to ensure people receive help as quickly as
    possible.  
-   In the wake of the wildfires, President Biden made [additional
    disaster funding
    available](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=b61cc864f4&e=ebcdb14f7c) to
    the state of Hawaiʻi, unlocking the federal government’s ability to
    cover all eligible expenses for debris removal and emergency
    protective measures in Maui County and assistance for emergency
    protective measures for Hawaiʻi County. The President authorized the
    federal cost share to be increased from 75% to 100% for 30 days that
    the Governor selects within the first 120 days.  
-   More than 700 personnel from the **Department of Defense** and 119
    members of the Coast Guard are actively participating in the
    coordinated response to the Western Maui Wildfire.  They are
    assisting with fire suppression, searching debris for remains,
    distributing fuel, installing generators for emergency power,
    assisting portable water distribution support, providing grief
    counseling and emotional support, and providing additional
    life-sustaining support.  
-   The **Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Honolulu Division** is
    assisting the Maui Police Department with their efforts to locate
    and identify those who are missing or may be victims of the
    wildfires in Lahaina, Hawaii, by helping collect DNA samples from
    family members. Family members are encouraged to visit family
    assistance centers in Maui to provide a DNA sample or reach out to
    the FBI at (808) 566-4300 or to <HN-COMMAND-POST@ic.fbi.gov> for
    guidance.  
-   The **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** has deployed 48 responders, 25
    remote personnel, and 51 contractors who are assisting with public
    works and engineering support, which includes installing 20
    generators for temporary emergency power, planning to execute debris
    collection and removal, and scoping potential requirements for
    temporary construction of critical public facilities such as
    schools, fire and police stations.  
     
-   The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** has deployed more than
    130 responders to Maui following the Hawaiʻi wildfires and has a
    full incident command team on the ground working closely with FEMA
    and other federal, state, and local partners. The agency’s efforts
    are focused on monitoring air and water quality and identifying,
    removing, and safely disposing of household hazardous materials and
    disaster debris to protect residents from environmental and health
    hazards. This is the critical step in the recovery process before
    the clearing of non-hazardous debris. EPA’s response efforts while
    on Maui are guided by its cultural resources and historic properties
    plan that the agency developed with the Maui County cultural leaders
    and Hawaiʻi State Historic Preservation Division. This plan is
    helping responders across the entire federal family identify,
    protect, and properly handle cultural resources, which were
    significantly impacted during the wildfire.  
     
-   The **Department of the Interior (DOI)** is supporting firefighting
    and search and rescue operations while working to protect natural
    and cultural resources on Maui in coordination with federal and
    state partners. DOI personnel are also assisting with assessment and
    recovery operations, working to determine impacts to wildlife
    habitats — including coral reefs — as well as assessing the
    potential for debris-flow and ash sediment run-off. The Department
    is in close contact with Native Hawaiian leaders and organizations
    to coordinate the availability of services, information, and
    culturally sensitive opportunities for engagement and healing.  
     
-   The **Department of Energy (DOE)** is announcing a $95 million grant
    through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to harden Hawaiʻi’s
    electric grid. Additionally, DOE has deployed emergency responders
    to support the Federal response to the wildfires on Maui. DOE is
    working closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
    Hawaiʻi State Energy Office, and the Hawaiʻi Office of Emergency
    Management.  
     
-   The **Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA) **is providing enhanced monitoring of the
    areas affected by the wildfires using high-resolution monitoring
    tools to detect potential flood threats due to increased runoff
    potential from burn scar areas. Additionally, the Department of
    Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information
    Administration (NTIA), through FirstNet – a public-private
    partnership between the First Responder Network Authority and AT&T –
    is providing wireless high-speed Internet connectivity and voice
    communications for first responders and emergency management.
    FirstNet used its resilient deployable assets such as Cell on Light
    Trucks (COLTS) and other deployable assets to restore or enhance
    cellular coverage for 10 locations on Maui.  The Maui Police
    Department, Hawaii State agencies, and Federal and State Urban
    Search and Rescue teams are all using FirstNet for critical
    communications in response to this devastating wildfire.   
     
-   The **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR)** has
    deployed responders from ASPR, including experts from their Victim
    Identification Center team to assist Maui County with victim
    identification. ASPR also deployed a portable morgue unit to help
    with processing human remains and additional personnel to bolster
    mental health staff and resources available at Lahaina Comprehensive
    Health Center. In addition, ASPR activated the [Emergency
    Prescription Assistance
    Program](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=fead0babd2&e=ebcdb14f7c),
    a federal program that helps people in a federally-identified
    disaster area who do not have health insurance get the prescription
    drugs, vaccinations, medical supplies, and equipment that they
    need.  Secretary Becerra also [issued a Public Health
    Emergency](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=af3ac9ee7c&e=ebcdb14f7c) shortly
    after the President’s disaster declaration, giving CMS health care
    providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency
    health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries on the ground.
    HHS’ Disaster Distress Helpline – 1-800-985-5990 – is available to
    provide immediate counseling to anyone affected by the wildfires.  
     
-   The **U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA)** Office of
    Disaster Recovery and Resilience has 61 staff on the ground in
    Hawaiʻi and more are being phased in. Survivors and businesses who
    register for FEMA assistance will also be eligible for low-interest
    disaster loans. SBA has approved more than $13 million in federal
    disaster loans for Hawaiʻi businesses and residents impacted by
    wildfires. To be considered for all forms of disaster assistance,
    survivors must first register with FEMA. SBA continues to operate
    the Disaster Business Recovery Center (BRC) for survivors of the
    Maui wildfires and is part of the multi-agency presence at the DRCs.
    Information and details on the location of the business recovery
    center and disaster recovery centers are available by calling the
    SBA Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955. These Centers provide
    services to survivors including homeowners, renters, and small
    business owners seeking financial assistance. The SBA Disaster
    Business Recovery Center is located at Hawaiʻi Technology
    Development Corporation, Maui Research Technology Center, Building
    \#A, Ste. 119 (Conference Room), 590 Lipoa Pkwy, Kihei, HI  96753.  
      
    SBA is also conducting outreach to businesses throughout Maui County
    to take advantage of the Physical damage and Economic Injury
    Disaster Loan program, and staff are working with survivors where
    they are by conducting outreach in state-run Family Assistance
    Centers and door-to-door campaigns.  
     
-   The **U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition
    Service** [approved
    waivers](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=76b5787295&e=ebcdb14f7c), including
    those that will allow Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
    (SNAP) households in Hawaiʻi, including on Maui, to purchase hot
    foods with SNAP benefits through September 14; allow package size
    flexibility for those using the Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program through
    October 31 so they have more options to purchase what is available;
    and allow parents or guardians to pick up meals for children at grab
    ‘n go sites. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
    Forest Service has deployed a Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)
    team, as well as a National Incident Management Organization (NIMO)
    team to Hawaiʻi. The BAER team will analyze and map the impacts of
    the fire to watersheds, including the potential for runoff and
    debris flows to carry hazardous materials, and support state and
    local staff in assessing post-fire watershed conditions and
    post-fire slope stability issues. The NIMO team will be the central
    point of coordination for those implementing USDA response and
    recovery programs on the ground in Hawai’i.  
     
-   The **U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD) **announced last weeka $1.3 million funding allocation to help
    communities on Maui in the wake of the wildfires through the
    department’s new Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) program,
    a rapid response program to address homelessness by filling in
    federal assistance gaps in communities hit by disasters. RUSH
    funding is available to help communities provide outreach, emergency
    shelter, rapid re-housing, and other assistance to people
    experiencing or at risk of homelessness who are in a disaster
    affected area but who cannot access all services provided by FEMA
    programs.  
      
    Additionally, HUD is providing a 90-day relief from foreclosures of
    Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages and home equity
    conversion mortgages. Homeowners affected by the disaster should
    contact their mortgage or loan servicer immediately. They can also
    call the FHA Resource Center at 1-800-304-9320 for additional
    information and visit the [FHA Disaster
    Relief](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=ce9907e6fe&e=ebcdb14f7c) site
    to learn more about disaster relief options for FHA homeowners. HUD
    also released [regulatory and administrative
    waivers](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=9a58a6f86b&e=ebcdb14f7c) to
    help communities accelerate their recovery. This includes funding
    for housing rehabilitation and reconstruction, homebuyer programs
    replacing disaster damaged residences, infrastructure improvements
    and assistance to people at risk of homelessness. HUD has assigned
    experienced Disaster Technical Assistance providers that will be
    available remotely and, on the ground, to support local leaders help
    communities and families that were experiencing homelessness before
    the devastating fires and those that may require homeless services
    because of the fires.  
     
-   The **U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau **has created
    a [disaster and emergencies
    guide](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=82c0308801&e=ebcdb14f7c) to
    handling finances, including resources to help impacted residents
    recover, such as tackling housing issues, protecting your finances,
    dealing with property damage, managing your bills, and asking for
    help from financial companies like banks, credit cards and other
    lenders. If residents are having trouble with a financial company,
    they can [submit a complaint
    online](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=513ff4a3d0&e=ebcdb14f7c) or
    by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).  
     
-   The **U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)** has made available
    $3 million, the full amount of “quick release” Emergency Relief (ER)
    funds requested by the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation (HDOT),
    to offset costs associated with traffic management services in the
    wake of the wildfires. Additionally, DOT currently has three
    temporary flight restrictions in place to help facilitate search and
    rescue missions and has worked with major U.S. airlines that serve
    Kahului Airport to promote [flexible
    travel](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=75c3c2edca&e=ebcdb14f7c) policies.  
     
-   The **Heritage Emergency National Task Force (HENTF)**, a
    partnership between FEMA and Smithsonian Institution, is working
    through the Hawaiʻi Emergency Management Agency to ensure that
    museums and cultural heritage sites are incorporated into FEMA
    preliminary damage assessments to anticipate needs associated with
    long-term recovery planning.
