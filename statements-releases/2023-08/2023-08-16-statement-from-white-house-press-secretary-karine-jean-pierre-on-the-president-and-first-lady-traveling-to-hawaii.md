title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the President\
  \ and First Lady Traveling to\_Hawaii"

The President and First Lady will travel to Maui on Monday, August 21 to
meet with first responders, survivors, as well as federal, state, and
local officials, in the wake of deadly wildfires on the island.  
   
In Maui, the President and First Lady will be welcomed by state and
local leaders to see firsthand the impacts of the wildfires and the
devastating loss of life and land that has occurred on the island, as
well as discuss the next steps in the recovery effort. The President
continues to marshal a whole-of-government response to the deadly Maui
fires, and he has committed to delivering everything that the people of
Hawaii need from the federal government as they recover from this
disaster.  
   
Over the past week, President Biden has stayed closely in touch with
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, Hawaii Senators Mazie Hirono and
Brian Schatz, as well as Hawaii Governor Josh Green, who advised that
the search and recovery efforts are expected to be at a stage early next
week to allow for a presidential visit.
