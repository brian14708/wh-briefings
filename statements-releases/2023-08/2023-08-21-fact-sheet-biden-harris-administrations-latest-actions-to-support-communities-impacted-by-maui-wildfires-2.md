*President Biden to appoint FEMA Regional Administrator for Region 9 Bob
Fenton “Chief Federal Response Coordinator” for Maui to oversee the
long-term coordinated federal recovery as Hawaii rebuilds*  
  
*More than 1,000 Federal personnel are on the ground in Maui*  
*to aid response efforts*

Today, Monday, August 21, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will
travel to Maui to meet emergency responders, survivors, community
members, as well as federal, state, and local officials, and survey the
area devastated by the deadly wildfires. The President and First Lady
will affirm that our entire nation stands with Hawaii in this time of
grief and recovery.  
  
As the recovery moves into the next phase, President Biden, alongside
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, will announce that he is
**appointing FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton as the Federal
government’s “Chief Federal Response Coordinator”** for Maui. Mr. Fenton
is one of the nation’s most experienced disaster response-and-recovery
officials who has been on the ground in Hawaii from the day the
wildfires started. In this role, Fenton will oversee the Federal
government’s long-term recovery work on the ground for Maui. President
Biden is directing Chief Federal Response Coordinator Fenton to ensure
that every Federal asset is provided to help the community rebuild as
fast as possible in Maui.  
  
Since the onset of this unprecedented tragedy, President Biden launched
a whole-of-government effort to support residents and affected
communities – and as soon as Hawaii Governor Josh Green requested a
Major Disaster Declaration, the President
[signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/08/10/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-approves-hawaii-disaster-declaration-3/)
it. Dozens of Federal departments and agencies continue working with
state and local partners on the ground to assess ongoing needs and
provide resources and personnel to support response efforts.  
  
Below are updated statistics and actions from the Biden-Harris
Administration’s whole of government response, including a new U.S.
Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
**announcement of the immediate availability of $3 million, the full
amount of “quick release” Emergency Relief (ER) funds** requested by the
Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT), to offset costs associated
with traffic management services and repairs to infrastructure needed as
a result of damage caused by wildfires.  
  
The Administration encourages individuals impacted by the disaster to
register for Federal assistance at
[www.disasterassistance.gov](http://www.disasterassistance.gov) or by
calling 1-800-621-3362 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week).  
  
Impacted individuals can also visit FEMA’s newly opened joint Disaster
Recovery Center at the University of Hawaii Maui College, located at 310
W. Ka’ahumanu Avenue, Kahului, Hawaii, to speak personally with FEMA
specialists, get assistance registering for disaster assistance, get in
touch with voluntary organizations offering additional support services,
and have access to other federal and state resources.  The doors are
open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. HST seven days a week.  
  
Here is an update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s coordinated
federal response:

-   As of Sunday, August 20, there are more than **1,000 federal
    personnel on the ground in Maui** assisting residents in their
    greatest time of need, including nearly 450 search and rescue team
    members and 40 canines trained to identify remains. FEMA’s Disaster
    Survivor Assistance teams are going to shelters and survivors’ homes
    to help people register for assistance.  
-   To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved **$8.2 million
    in assistance** to over **2,700 households**, including **$3.4
    million** in initial rental assistance.   
-   FEMA has made available more than **50,000 meals**, **75,000 liters
    of water,** **5,000 cots** and **10,000 blankets** and shelter
    supplies to the county government for distribution.  
-   Thanks to the significant partnership between the Hawaii Fire Relief
    Housing program administered by the **American Red Cross and funded
    by FEMA**, all survivors previously housed in congregate shelters
    will be offered temporary emergency lodging in hotels by the end of
    day on Monday, August 21.  More than 350 Red Cross disaster
    responders are working in coordination with partners to ensure
    people receive help as quickly as possible.  
-   Last week, President Biden made [**additional disaster funding
    available**](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230816/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-increases-federal-cost-share-hawaii)
    to the state of Hawaii, unlocking the federal government’s ability
    to cover all eligible expenses for debris removal and emergency
    protective measures in Maui County and assistance for emergency
    protective measures for Hawaii County. The President authorized the
    federal cost share to be increased from 75% to 100% for 30 days that
    the Governor selects within the first 120 days.  
-   Nearly 650 personnel from the **Department of Defense** and 140
    members of the Coast Guard are actively participating in the
    coordinated response to the Western Maui Wildfire.  They are
    assisting with fire suppression, searching debris for remains,
    distributing fuel, and providing additional life-sustaining
    support.  
-   The **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** has deployed 62 responders, 16
    remote personnel, and 43 contractors who are assisting with public
    works and engineering support, which includes installing 15
    generators for temporary emergency power, planning for debris
    collection and removal, and scoping potential requirements for
    temporary construction of critical public facilities such as
    schools, fire and police stations.  
-   The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** has deployed nearly 50
    responders to Maui following the Hawaii wildfires and has a full
    incident command team on the ground working closely with FEMA and
    other federal, state, and local partners. The agency’s efforts are
    focused on identifying, removing, and safely disposing of household
    hazardous waste and disaster debris to protect residents from
    environmental and health hazards. This is the next step in the
    recovery process before the clearing of debris. EPA’s response
    efforts while on Maui will be guided by its cultural resources and
    historic properties plan that the agency is working to develop with
    the Hawaii State Historic Preservation Division. This plan will help
    responders identify, protect, and properly handle cultural
    resources, which were significantly impacted during the wildfire.  
-   The **Department of Energy (DOE)** has deployed emergency responders
    to support the Federal response to the wildfires in Maui. DOE is
    working closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Hawaii
    State Energy Office, and the Hawaii Office of Emergency
    Management.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR)** has
    deployed 95 responders from ASPR, including experts from the
    National Disaster Medical System’s Disaster Mortuary Operational
    Response Team and a Victim Identification Center team to assist Maui
    County with victim identification. In addition, Secretary Becerra
    [issued a Public Health
    Emergency](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/08/11/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-declares-public-health-emergency-hawaii-response-wildfires.html)
    shortly after the President’s disaster declaration, giving CMS
    health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting
    emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries on the
    ground. HHS’ Disaster Distress Helpline – 1-800-985-5990 – is
    available to provide immediate counseling to anyone affected by the
    wildfires.  
-   The **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)** has more than 30
    staff on the ground in Hawaii and are phasing in more. Survivors and
    businesses who register for FEMA assistance will also be eligible
    for low-interest disaster loans. To be considered for all forms of
    disaster assistance, survivors must contact FEMA. Information and
    details on the location of business recovery centers is available by
    calling the SBA Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955.
    Additionally, SBA this week opened a Disaster Business Recovery
    Center (BRC) for survivors of the Maui wildfires – including
    homeowners, renters, and small business owners – to seek financial
    assistance. The SBA Recovery Center is located at Hawaii Technology
    Development Corporation, Maui Research Technology Center, Building
    \# A, Ste. 119 (Conference Room), 590 Lipoa Pkwy, Kihei, HI 
    96753.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service**
    [approved
    waivers](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/hawaii-disaster-nutrition-assistance), including
    those that will allow Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
    (SNAP) households in Hawaii, including on Maui, to purchase hot
    foods with SNAP benefits through September 14; allow package size
    flexibility for those using the Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program through
    October 31 so they have more options to purchase what is available;
    and allow parents or guardians to pick up meals for children at grab
    ‘n go sites. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
    Forest Service has deployed a Burned Area Emergency Response team to
    analyze and map the impacts of the fire to watersheds, including the
    potential for runoff and debris flows to carry hazardous materials,
    and support state and local staff in assessing post-fire watershed
    conditions.  
-   The **U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)** is
    providing a 90-day relief from foreclosures of Federal Housing
    Administration-insured mortgages and home equity conversion
    mortgages. Homeowners affected by the disaster should contact their
    mortgage or loan servicer immediately. They can also call the FHA
    Resource Center at 1-800-304-9320 for additional information and
    visit the [FHA Disaster
    Relief](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/nsc/qaho0121)
    site to learn more about disaster relief options for FHA homeowners.
    HUD also released [regulatory and administrative
    waivers](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/CPD/documents/Hawaii_Wildfires_Megawaiver_Signed_8-14-2023.pdf)
    to help communities accelerate their recovery. This includes funding
    for housing rehabilitation and reconstruction, homebuyer programs
    replacing disaster damaged residences, infrastructure improvements
    and assistance to people at risk of homelessness. HUD has assigned
    experienced Disaster Technical Assistance providers that will be
    available remotely and, on the ground, to support local leaders help
    communities and families that were experiencing homelessness before
    the devastating fires and those that may require homeless services
    because of the fires.  
-   The **U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau** has created a
    [disaster and emergencies
    guide](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/disasters-and-emergencies/)
    to handling finances, including resources to help impacted residents
    recover, such as tackling housing issues, protecting your finances,
    dealing with property damage, managing your bills, and asking for
    help from financial companies like banks, credit cards and other
    lenders. If residents are having trouble with a financial company,
    they can [submit a complaint
    online](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) or by
    calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).

    decoding="async" alt="Anchor" />The **U.S. Department of
    Transportation (DOT)** is making available $3 million, the full
    amount of “quick release” Emergency Relief (ER) funds requested by
    the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT), to offset costs
    associated with traffic management services in the wake of the
    wildfires. Additionally, DOT currently has three temporary flight
    restrictions in place to help facilitate search and rescue missions
    and has worked with major U.S. airlines that serve Kahului Airport
    to promote [flexible
    travel](https://www.transportation.gov/resources/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/travel-alert-wildfires-maui-hawaii)
    policies.  
-   The **Heritage Emergency National Task Force (HENTF)**, a
    partnership between FEMA and Smithsonian Institution, is working
    through the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency to ensure that
    museums and cultural heritage sites are incorporated into FEMA
    preliminary damage assessments to anticipate needs associated with
    long-term recovery planning.
