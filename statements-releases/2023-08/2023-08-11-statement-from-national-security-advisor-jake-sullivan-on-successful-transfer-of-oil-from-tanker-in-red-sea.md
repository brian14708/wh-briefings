title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Successful Transfer\
  \ of Oil from Tanker in Red\_Sea"

Today, the UN completed the offloading of over one million barrels of
crude oil from the *FSO* *Safer, *an ageing supertanker moored off the
Yemeni coast in the Red Sea – averting an oil spill that would have
caused major environmental, economic, and humanitarian damage. Last year
the United States – spearheaded by U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim
Lenderking – mobilized an international coalition to fund the operation.
The United States thanks UN Resident Coordinator for Yemen David Gressly
and the UN Development Programme for their leadership and successful
execution of this complex mission. The *Safer* served as a floating
offshore terminal for Yemeni oil exports until 2014, when the Yemen
conflict halted exports and maintenance of the vessel. Years of neglect
put the ship at risk of an imminent spill that would have damaged the
entire Red Sea region and beyond. We urge donors to mobilize the
additional funds needed to complete the final steps of the full
operation to address all residual environmental threats.
