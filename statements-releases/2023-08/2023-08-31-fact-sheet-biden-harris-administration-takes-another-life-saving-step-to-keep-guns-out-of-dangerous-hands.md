title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Another Life-Saving Step\
  \ to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous\_Hands"
---
 
In March, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the
Attorney General to move as close to universal background checks as
possible within existing law. Today, as a result of the Executive Order
and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Justice is
taking life-saving action to reduce the number of guns sold without
background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  
  
**Why the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action**  
  
Since 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers
to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon.
These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more
than three million felons, convicted domestic abusers, and other
dangerous individuals. However, despite the law, individuals who should
be licensed dealers have refused to obtain a license, skirting the
background check requirement.  
  
Last year, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law
bipartisan legislation to help address this dangerous problem by
modifying the definition of who has to become a federally licensed
firearms dealer. Members of Congress—both Democrats and Republicans—made
clear that they intended for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to
better protect the American people from gun violence by clarifying when
someone is supposed to become a licensed firearms dealer.  
  
**New Action to Keep Guns Out of Dangerous Hands**  
  
Today, the Justice Department has announced a proposed rule to specify
what exactly the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
means on the ground. If finalized, this proposed rule would mean the
following for people who are not selling guns in order to make money: If
you have a gun you no longer need, and you want to sell it to your
family member, you do not need a license to sell it. If you buy and sell
curios or relics or “collectible” personal firearms as a hobby, again,
you do not need a license. But, if you are offering a firearm for sale
to make money, and telling a customer that you can purchase and sell him
additional firearms, you would presumptively need a license—and need to
run background checks. The same is true if you repetitively offer for
resale firearms within 30 days of when you purchased them. The proposed
rule includes a number of other situations where, in civil and
administrative proceedings and absent reliable evidence to the contrary,
it will be presumed that you need a license.  
  
Specifically, the proposed rule, if finalized, would clarify that an
individual would be presumed to be “engaged in the business” of dealing
in firearms—and therefore be required to become a licensed firearms
dealer and run background checks—if they meet certain conditions. For
example, under the proposed rule, a person would be presumed to be
required to become a licensed dealer and run background checks if they
meet one or more of the following criteria:

-   Offer for sale any number of firearms and also represents to
    potential buyers that they are willing and able to purchase and sell
    them additional firearms;  
-   Repetitively offer for sale firearms within 30 days after they were
    purchased;  
-   Repetitively offer for sale firearms that are like new in their
    original packaging;  
-   Repetitively offer for sale multiple firearms of the same make and
    model; or  
-   As a formerly federally-licensed firearms dealer, sell firearms that
    were in the business inventory and not transferred to a personal
    collection at least a year before the sale, addressing the so-called
    “fire sale loophole.”

The proposed rule would also clarify that, for civil or administrative
actions, an individual would be presumed to have the intent to
“predominantly earn a profit”—one of the elements of engaging in the
business of dealing firearms—if the person engages in activities such
as:

-   Creating a website or making business cards to advertise or market a
    firearms business;  
-   Maintaining records to document and track profits and losses from
    firearms purchases or sales; or  
-   Purchasing business insurance or renting space at a gun show.

The proposed rule would make clear that there is no “gun show loophole”
or “internet loophole” in federal law. Dealers who engage in the
business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run
background checks no matter where they engage in the business of buying
and selling firearms. That include at gun shows and over the Internet.  
  
The proposed rule is now open for public comment.  The Department of
Justice will consider the comments it receives in deciding on a final
rule.  
  
**Continuing to Call on Congress to Act**  
  
This rule is a significant step toward reducing the percentage of
firearms sold for profit without background checks. It builds on
previous Biden-Harris Administration actions to save lives and combat
the epidemic of gun violence.  
  
However, to fully address this problem, Congress must act. The President
continues to call on Congress to enact universal background checks
legislation, as well as other commonsense legislation to ban assault
weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and
end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. These are life-saving
measures that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support to
protect our Country from the threat of gun violence.
