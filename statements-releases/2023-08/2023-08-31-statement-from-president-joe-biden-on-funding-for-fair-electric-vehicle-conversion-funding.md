title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Funding for Fair Electric Vehicle Conversion\_\
  Funding"
---
 
As I’ve said before, under Bidenomics building a clean energy economy
can and should provide a win‑win opportunity for auto companies and
unionized workers who have anchored the American economy for decades.
This funding from my Investing in America agenda will further that goal
by creating auto manufacturing jobs here at home and helping companies
avoid painful plant closings — and to retool, reboot, and rehire in the
same factories and communities with high wages. This funding will help
existing workers keep their jobs and have the first shot to fill new
good jobs as the car industry transforms for future generations.
