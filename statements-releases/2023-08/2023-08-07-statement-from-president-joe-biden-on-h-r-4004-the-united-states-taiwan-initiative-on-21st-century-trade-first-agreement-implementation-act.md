title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on H.R. 4004, the United\_States-Taiwan\
  \ Initiative on 21st-Century Trade First Agreement Implementation\_Act"
---
 
     Today, I have signed into law H.R. 4004, the “United States-Taiwan
Initiative on 21st-Century Trade First Agreement Implementation Act”
(the “Act”).  Among other things, the Act would impose requirements on
the negotiations of certain further trade agreements between the United
States and Taiwan.

Section 7 of the Act includes requirements for the negotiation of
certain further trade agreements with Taiwan that raise constitutional
concerns.  Section 7(b) of the Act would require the United States Trade
Representative (USTR) to provide negotiating texts to congressional
committees in the midst of negotiations with a foreign partner, and
section 7(c) of the Act would preclude the USTR from transmitting United
States-proposed texts to Taiwan while the Congress is reviewing them. 
Section 7(c) of the Act would further, in violation of *INS v. Chadha*,
afford 2 members of the Congress the power to increase the required
waiting period before the USTR may provide texts to Taiwan.  Section
7(d) of the Act would require the inclusion of members of the Congress
as accredited members of the United States delegation who would be
entitled to daily briefings, including of tentative agreements.  In
cases where the requirements of section 7 of the Act would impermissibly
infringe upon my constitutional authority to negotiate with a foreign
partner, my Administration will treat them as non-binding.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
