  \ Fitch\_Ratings"

We strongly disagree with this decision. The ratings model used by Fitch
declined under President Trump and then improved under President Biden,
and it defies reality to downgrade the United States at a moment when
President Biden has delivered the strongest recovery of any major
economy in the world. And it’s clear that extremism by Republican
officials—from cheerleading default, to undermining governance and
democracy, to seeking to extend deficit-busting tax giveaways for the
wealthy and corporations—is a continued threat to our economy.
