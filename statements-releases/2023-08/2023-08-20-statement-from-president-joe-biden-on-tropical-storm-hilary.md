title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Tropical Storm\_Hilary"
---
 
As soon as Tropical Storm Hilary’s path became clear, my Administration
took immediate action to prepare. At my direction, FEMA deployed to
California federal personnel and supplies that can be surged to impacted
communities. The U.S. Coast Guard pre-positioned aircraft to allow for
rapid response and search-and-rescue efforts. My Administration also
deployed federal personnel to Nevada to ensure the state has additional
support, and we will continue to coordinate with California, Nevada, and
Arizona on any resources they might need.  
   
This afternoon I spoke to California Governor Gavin Newsom about the
emergency preparedness measures in place, and the initial response to
Tropical Storm Hilary. I continue to be briefed on our preparedness
efforts, and the storm’s potential impact – including flooding. My
Administration stands ready to provide additional assistance as
requested. I urge people to take this storm seriously, and listen to
state and local officials.  
   
We are also closely monitoring the earthquake that occurred in Southern
California, and any resulting impacts.
