  \ of the March on\_Washington"

Sixty years ago, nearly a quarter of a million people marched on
Washington to demand jobs and freedom. They came from every corner of
our country. Gathering on the National Mall, they listened as the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., shared his dream of an America that lives
up to its promise: A nation without segregation and discrimination, with
opportunity and equality for all. They heard from a young student
organizer, the great John Lewis, who spoke of the importance of fighting
to secure the sacred freedom to vote.

The March on Washington was a call to action for our nation. In the
years to come, inspired by the passion and purpose of that day,
Americans secured the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, and other landmark victories in the fight for
progress.   

The March on Washington was historic, but it was neither the beginning
nor the end of the movement for civil rights. The fight continued in the
years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, and the fight for
civil rights continues today. Today, as extremist so-called leaders
attempt to erase our history and roll back progress on voting rights,
reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ+ equality, Americans are fighting for
justice and equity.

Today, sixty years after that historic day, let us rededicate ourselves
to the fight for equity, opportunity, and justice. And let us continue
to work to secure our most foundational freedoms: the freedom to vote,
the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, and the
freedom to live free from hate and violence.
