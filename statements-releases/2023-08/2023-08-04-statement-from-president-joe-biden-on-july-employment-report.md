title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on July Employment\_Report"
---
 
Unemployment near a record low and the share of working age Americans
who have jobs at a 20-year high: that’s Bidenomics.   Our economy added
187,000 jobs last month, and we’ve added 13.4 million jobs since I took
office — more jobs added in two and a half years than during any
president’s four-year term. The unemployment rate is 3.5%, marking a
full year and half below 4%. This follows recent news that our economy
continues to grow, while inflation has fallen by nearly two thirds and
is at its lowest level in more than two years. We’re growing the economy
from the middle out and bottom up, lowering costs for hardworking
families, and making smart investments in America.
