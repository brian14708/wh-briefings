title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Fifth Circuit Court of\
  \ Appeals Decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v.\_FDA"
---
 
We strongly disagree with today’s ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, which undermines
FDA’s scientific, independent judgment and reimposes onerous
restrictions on access to safe and effective medication abortion. 

Due to the Supreme Court’s stay, mifepristone remains broadly available
for now. But if the Fifth Circuit’s ruling stands, it will significantly
roll back the ability for women in every state to get the health care
they need, and undermine FDA’s scientific, evidence-based process for
approving safe and effective medications that patients rely on.

As leaders in the biopharma industry, leading expert physicians and
medical organizations, former FDA and former DOJ officials, and patient
advocates have made clear: this lawsuit also poses an unprecedented
threat to the FDA’s authority to review, approve, and set evidence-based
requirements for a wide range of safe and effective drugs.

The Department of Justice announced that it will be seeking Supreme
Court review of the Fifth Circuit’s contrary decision.

  
As our fight continues in the courts, President Biden and Vice President
Harris remain firmly committed to defending reproductive health care,
and the Administration will continue to stand by FDA’s independent
approval of mifepristone as safe and effective. In the face of these
unprecedented attacks on women’s health, we will continue to fight for
women’s freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.
