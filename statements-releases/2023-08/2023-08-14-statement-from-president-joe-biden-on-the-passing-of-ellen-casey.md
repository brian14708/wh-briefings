title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Ellen\_Casey"
---
 
On the many trips I’ve taken home to Scranton over the decades, one of
the things I’ve looked forward to most was the chance to visit or talk
with Ellen Casey – I truly loved her.

I’ve often said that everything important I learned in life I learned in
Scranton and you didn’t have to look any further than Ellen Casey to
know why. To spend just a few minutes with Ellen was to get a lifetime’s
education in Scranton values. Honesty. Decency. Integrity. Character.
They were non-negotiable. It was who you were. Kindness was not a sign
of weakness – it was a sign of strength. And no one was more kind. Hard
work was expected. Family always came first. But life was about serving
others. Public service was a public trust – an opportunity to help
others and change lives for the better.

She and Bob raised their eight children with those values, passing along
a devotion to family and serving others.

Growing up just a few blocks from the big Irish Catholic Casey household
on Washington Avenue, I admired them from a young age. I got to know
Ellen as an adult when I became a Senator, and I came to respect her
even more. I watched the resolute and loving support she offered her
husband, Pennsylvania’s former governor. I saw the work as she did as
First Lady in literacy and breast cancer. And later, I saw the
extraordinary young man she raised, my friend Bobby, become one of the
most effective and respected members of the United States Senate.

Ellen Casey lived a life of extraordinary dignity and grace. Jill and I
will miss her dearly, never more so than on our trips back to Scranton.
We’re grateful to her and Bob for giving the world so many wonderful
children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, to carry on the Casey
family legacy and values. Our hearts are with them today.
