title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on Protecting Americans from Harmful Data\
  \ Broker\_Practices"
---
 
On Tuesday, the White House convened a roundtable with civil society
leaders, researchers, and policymakers on how the data broker industry
monetizes personal information and actions the Administration is taking
to address potential  harms to American consumers. The session was
hosted by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the
National Economic Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the
Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Justice.

Earlier that day, the CFPB announced that it plans to propose rules to
ensure all data companies comply with the law and prevent brokers from
selling certain data, limit the disclosure of sensitive “credit header”
contact information, and give consumers the right to obtain data about
themselves from brokers and dispute inaccuracies. Administration
officials pledged in Tuesday’s session to continue using their
authorities to subject data brokers to greater regulation and oversight,
and to curb the harms they cause.

Participants shared stories, insights, and concerns about the harms and
risks that data brokers’ practices create for everyday Americans. Issues
raised include the surreptitious collection, use and sale of detailed
sensitive data; data-driven scoring that limits access to housing and
economic opportunities for Black and brown communities; predatory scams
targeting individuals with cognitive vulnerabilities; increased risks to
personal safety, including gender-based violence; and insufficient
oversight of brokers under existing law.

Participants explained how data brokers purchase or acquire large
volumes of exceedingly detailed data about people including geolocation
and health information—often without their knowledge or consent. Recent
advancements in artificial intelligence, attendees cautioned, have
rapidly expanded data brokers’ abilities to draw inferences about
individuals’ lifestyles, desires, and weaknesses, and are incentivizing
rampant data collection to fuel their development. Participants also
discussed the many different parties to whom brokers sell data—including
advertisers, financial institutions, employers, landlords, and
fraudsters—and the harms those sales have caused individuals and
communities. Many shared stories of people who saw applications for
credit and housing denied after reviewers purchased sensitive
information about them—including data that was inaccurate, outdated, or
not fit for purpose. Participants underscored how the data broker
economy enables discriminatory practices in credit underwriting,
insurance, housing, employment, and advertising, continuing patterns of
exclusion that disproportionately harm underserved and vulnerable
groups. Participants also described how data brokers have sold
geolocation data to people who have used it to stalk and harass women,
and interfere with women’s access to healthcare.
