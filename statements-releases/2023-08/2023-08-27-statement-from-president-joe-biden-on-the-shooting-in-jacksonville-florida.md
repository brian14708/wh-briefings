title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Shooting in Jacksonville,\_Florida"
---
 
On Saturday, our nation marked the 60<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the
March on Washington — a seminal moment in our history and in our work
towards equal opportunity for all Americans. But this day of remembrance
and commemoration ended with yet another American community wounded by
an act of gun violence, reportedly fueled by hate-filled animus and
carried out with two firearms.

Yesterday in Jacksonville, Florida a white gunman went on a shooting
rampage at a store near a Historically Black University and killed three
Black individuals. While we still need to learn more about the
motivation for Saturday’s shooting, law enforcement has opened a federal
civil rights investigation and is treating this incident as a possible
hate crime and act of domestic violent extremism.

Even as we continue searching for answers, we must say clearly and
forcefully that white supremacy has no place in America. We must refuse
to live in a country where Black families going to the store or Black
students going to school live in fear of being gunned down because of
the color of their skin. Hate must have no safe harbor. Silence is
complicity and we must not remain silent.

Jill and I are praying for the victims and their families, and we grieve
with the people of Jacksonville.
