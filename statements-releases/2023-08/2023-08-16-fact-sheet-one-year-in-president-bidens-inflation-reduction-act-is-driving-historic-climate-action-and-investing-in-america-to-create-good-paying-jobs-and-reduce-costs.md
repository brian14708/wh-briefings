title: "FACT SHEET: One Year In, President\_Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act is\
  \ Driving Historic Climate Action and Investing in America to Create Good Paying\
  \ Jobs and Reduce\_Costs"
---
 
One year ago, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation
Reduction Act into law – the largest investment in clean energy and
climate action ever. The Inflation Reduction Act is a transformative law
that is helping the United States meet its climate goals and strengthen
energy security, investing in America to create good-paying jobs,
reducing energy and health care costs for families, and making the tax
code fairer.  
  
Just twelve months after the law was signed, it is already having a
significant impact on American workers and families, and is delivering
for underserved communities and those that have been too often left
behind. Outside groups estimate the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean
energy and climate provisions have [created more than 170,000 clean
energy
jobs](https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2023/07/Clean-Energy-Boom-Anniversary-Report-1.pdf)
already, companies have announced over $110 billion in clean energy
manufacturing investments in the last year alone, the law is delivering
billions of dollars to protect communities from the impacts of climate
change, and millions of seniors are saving money because their insulin
is capped at $35 per month.  
  
Today, to mark the anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, the
Biden-Harris Administration is releasing a new feature on
[Invest.gov](http://www.invest.gov) that highlights stories of how the
Inflation Reduction Act and Bidenomics are making a difference for
Americans in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Bidenomics is the
President’s vision for growing the economy from the middle out and
bottom up, including by investing in America, creating good-paying union
jobs, and lowering cost for American families.  
  
In the 12 months since the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law:

-   The private sector has announced more than $110 billion in new clean
    energy manufacturing investments, including more than $70 billion in
    the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain and more than $10 billion in
    solar manufacturing. Since the President was elected, the private
    sector has announced approximately $240 billion in new clean energy
    manufacturing investments.  
-   Investments in clean energy and climate since the Inflation
    Reduction Act was signed into law have created more than 170,000
    jobs, and the law is projected to [create more than 1.5 million
    additional
    jobs](https://laborenergy.org/fact-sheets/lep-analysis-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-key-findings-on-jobs-inflation-and-gdp/)
    over the next decade according to estimates by outside groups.  
-   Public and private sector investments driven by the Inflation
    Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are expected to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1 billion tons in
    2030.  
-   The Administration has already awarded over a billion dollars to
    help communities become more resilient and protect them from the
    disastrous impacts of climate change, including drought, heat, and
    extreme weather.  
-   American families are projected to save $27-38 billion on their
    electricity bills from 2022-2030 relative to a scenario without the
    Inflation Reduction Act, according to new data released by the
    Department of Energy today.  
-   Nearly 15 million people are saving an average of $800 per year on
    their health insurance premiums, the nation’s uninsured rate has
    reached an historic low, and millions of seniors on Medicare are
    paying less in out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs—including
    insulin, which is capped at $35 per month.  
-   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is strengthening enforcement
    against wealthy tax cheats and increasing recoveries from delinquent
    millionaires—while improving customer service for law-abiding
    taxpayers, including cutting phone wait times from 28 minutes last
    tax season to 3 minutes this year.

**<u>LARGEST CLIMATE INVESTMENT IN HISTORY</u>**  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act is the most ambitious investment in
combating the climate crisis in world history.  
  
Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) released an [updated
study](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/investing-american-energy-significant-impacts-inflation-reduction-act-and)
affirming the transformative climate progress driven by the Inflation
Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. DOE estimates that
the two laws will cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 41 percent
below 2005 levels by 2030.  
  
Together with additional actions being taken by federal, state, and
local governments as well as the private sector, the United States is
now on a path to achieve President Biden’s ambitious goal of cutting
emissions 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and reaching net-zero
emissions by no later than 2050. This is consistent with external
researchers, who project that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will fall
[43-48 percent](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3781)
below 2005 levels by 2035 thanks to laws already on the books.  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act is accelerating progress to meet America’s
climate goals, build a clean energy economy, and strengthen energy
security:

-   The Department of Energy has
    [estimated](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/8.18%20InflationReductionAct_Factsheet_Final.pdf)
    that the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    will lead to greenhouse gas emissions reductions of approximately 1
    billion tons in 2030.  
-   The Department of Energy
    [found](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/investing-american-energy-significant-impacts-inflation-reduction-act-and)
    that the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    are driving significant new clean electricity generation, enabling
    the United States to potentially reach 80 percent clean electricity
    by 2030.  
-   U.S. electricity generation from wind is expected to triple and
    solar generation is expected to increase seven- to eight-fold by
    2030, according to Department of Energy estimates. Over the next
    seven years, we expect twice as much wind, solar, and battery
    deployment as there would have been without the Inflation Reduction
    Act.  
-   EV sales have tripled since President Biden took office, spurred in
    part by investments in the Inflation Reduction Act to boost clean
    energy manufacturing and lower EV costs for American families.  
-   Federal agencies have worked to embed equity and environmental
    justice into their grant programs to ensure low-income and
    disadvantaged communities will benefit from the Inflation Reduction
    Act, in alignment with the President’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).
    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) alone has made $650
    million available for environmental justice projects to reduce
    pollution and build the capacity of community-based organizations
    and local governments to plan and implement projects in their
    neighborhoods. And two-thirds of EPA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas
    Reduction Fund will flow to low-income and disadvantaged
    communities.    
-   Philanthropic organizations, impact investing organizations, and
    intermediaries have committed at least $1.6 billion to support the
    implementation of the clean energy and climate provisions of the
    Inflation Reduction Act, ensuring more direct access to critical
    technical assistance for underserved communities so that they can
    realize the full benefits of the law.

In addition to building America’s clean energy future, the Inflation
Reduction Act will strengthen the resilience of communities across the
country and protect them from dangerous and disastrous impacts of the
climate crisis. 

-   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    [awarded](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/04/biden-harris-administration-recommends-562-million-investment-make)
    $562 million, jointly funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, for nearly 150 projects across 30
    coastal states and territories to make communities and local
    economies more resilient to climate change.  
-   NOAA also launched an innovative $575 million competition, the
    [Climate Resilience Regional
    Challenge](https://coast.noaa.gov/funding/ira/resilience-challenge/),
    to support projects that build the resilience of coastal and Great
    Lakes communities to extreme weather and other impacts of climate
    change.  
-   DOI’s Bureau of Reclamation has announced more than $514 million to
    [address the historic
    drought](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-continues-commitment-protect-stability-sustainability)
    in the Colorado River Basin.  
-   The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) [has
    awarded](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/04/12/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-funding-expand)
    $250 million to states and territories to provide urban communities
    with equitable access to trees and the benefits they provide,
    including protections from extreme heat. The USFS will soon award up
    to $1 billion in grants to increase equitable access to trees and
    green spaces in urban and community forests where more than 84
    percent of Americans live, work, and play.  
-   DOI unveiled a new [Restoration and Resilience
    Framework](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/interior-department-to-take-action-to-restore-lands-and-waters.pdf)
    to guide $2 billion in investments from the President’s Investing in
    America agenda to restore and protect our nation’s lands and waters.
    As part of this effort, the Bureau of Land Management [has
    allocated](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/biden-harris-administration-announces-161-million-landscape-restoration)
    an initial $161 million through the Inflation Reduction Act to
    restore ecosystems and revitalize local economies. The National Park
    Service [has
    dedicated](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1207/inflation-reduction-act-restoration-resilience-fy23-projects.htm)
    $44 million from the Inflation Reduction Act to national parks in 39
    states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The U.S.
    Fish and Wildlife Service also
    [awarded](https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2023-03/over-120m-inflation-reduction-act-advances-resilience)
    more than $120 million to rebuild, restore, and increase the climate
    resilience of the National Wildlife Refuge System.

**<u>INVESTING IN AMERICA TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS</u>**  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act aims to boost domestic manufacturing, create
good-paying union jobs, and build more resilient, secure, and trusted
supply chains. Together with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
CHIPS and Science Act, the law [has helped spur over $500 billion in
private sector manufacturing
investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/08/16/the-economics-of-public-investment-crowding-in-private-investment/)
since President Biden and Vice President Harris took office, including
approximately $240 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments.
The law is driving investment to places too often left out and left
behind through bonus tax credits for building clean energy projects in
traditional [energy
communities](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1538) and
[low-income
communities](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1688), and
is creating good-paying and union jobs through incentives for using
[domestic
content](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-initial-guidance-for-the-domestic-content-bonus-credit)
and paying [prevailing wages and hiring registered
apprentices](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1128) to
build America’s clean energy future.  
  
In just the twelve months since the Inflation Reduction Act became law:

-   Companies have announced more than $110 billion in new clean energy
    manufacturing investments, including more than $70 billion in the EV
    supply chain and more than $10 billion in solar manufacturing.  
-   According to estimates by outside groups, the Inflation Reduction
    Act’s clean energy and climate provisions have already [created more
    than 170,000 clean energy
    jobs](https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2023/07/Clean-Energy-Boom-Anniversary-Report-1.pdf)
    and could [create 1.5 million additional
    jobs](https://laborenergy.org/fact-sheets/lep-analysis-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-key-findings-on-jobs-inflation-and-gdp/)
    over the next decade.  
-   Project developers have also planned investments worth at least $122
    billion across more than 800 clean energy generation
    projects—including wind, solar, battery storage, nuclear,
    hydroelectricity, biomass, and geothermal projects—totaling over 80
    gigawatts (GW), enough to power 13.7 million homes for a year,
    according to [Energy Information Administration
    data](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_07_b).  
-   Inflation-adjusted spending on private manufacturing and industrial
    construction in America is at its highest point since the Census
    started tracking the data in 1964—27 percent higher than the
    previous peak in 1966.  
-   Today, the Department of Treasury is releasing a new report showing
    that investments that have been announced in the clean energy,
    electric vehicles, and battery sectors are concentrated in
    relatively disadvantaged communities with lower wages, lower college
    graduation rates, and lower employment rates.  
-   The Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest investment in rural
    electrification since the New Deal—nearly $11 billion for rural
    electric co-ops—by [funding rural
    co-ops](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/electric-programs/empowering-rural-america-new-era-program)
    to build clean, affordable, and reliable energy, which will create
    jobs and lower energy costs. The investment also provides
    [forgivable
    loans](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/electric-programs/powering-affordable-clean-energy-pace-program)
    for renewable energy projects located in or serving rural
    communities. The Department of Agriculture has also made available
    more than $1.3 billion in additional funding from the Inflation
    Reduction Act to provide agricultural producers and small rural
    businesses with the financing and funding they need to invest in
    clean energy and make energy efficiency improvements.

**<u>LOWERING ENERGY COSTS</u>**  
  
DOE
[estimates](https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/investing-american-energy-significant-impacts-inflation-reduction-act-and)
that the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will
cut electricity rates by as much as 9 percent and lower gas prices by as
much as 13 percent by 2030—putting tens of billions of dollars back in
the pockets of Americans.  
  
Because of the historic investments driven by the Inflation Reduction
Act that are building a clean energy economy and leading to greater
access to clean power, Americans across the country are already seeing
savings on their home energy costs. For example:

-   Florida Power & Light (FPL) will refund its **5.8M customers**
    [**~$400M in
    savings**](https://newsroom.fpl.com/2022-09-23-FPL-proposes-plan-to-refund-customers-nearly-400-million-in-federal-corporate-tax-savings)
    as result of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Production Tax Credit for
    solar energy. FPL continues to build solar projects across Florida
    as part of nation’s largest solar expansion that today includes 50
    operational sites.   
-   Xcel in Minnesota estimated that the Inflation Reduction Act could
    lead to [**$1.4B in consumer
    savings**](https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/38445-xcel-energy-sees-1-4b-in-cost-savings-through-inflation-reduction-act/)
    through 2034 for its Minnesota customers.  
-   WEC Energy Group in Wisconsin added $2.4 billion to its 5-year
    capital plan thanks in part to the Inflation Reduction Act. The
    company had 2,400 MW of new renewables in its 2022-2026 plan; now
    it’s targeting approximately 3,300 MW.  The company projects
    long-term [**customer savings of approximately
    $2B**](https://ieefa.org/articles/citing-new-us-law-wisconsin-utility-adds-24-billion-capital-plan)
    from investment in renewables.

DOE launched an [Energy Savings Hub](https://www.energy.gov/save) to
help consumers, renters, and homeowners find ways to save money on their
energy bills by tapping into the programs in the Inflation Reduction
Act. Already:

-   Families who install an efficient electric heat pump for heating and
    cooling can
    [receive](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/frequently-asked-questions-about-energy-efficient-home-improvements-and-residential-clean-energy-property-credits-energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit-qualifying-expenditures-and-credit-amount)
    a [tax

    and up to 30 percent off the cost of new insulation—a total of up to
    $1,200 per year in tax credits.  
-   Families who install [rooftop solar or battery
    storage](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics)

    vehicle. Drivers can browse qualifying vehicles easily by visiting
    [fueleconomy.gov](https://fueleconomy.gov/). 

In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration is awarding grants to
states and other entities to help consumers save money on their energy
bills by making their homes more energy efficient. DOE has [opened
applications](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-opens-applications-states-and-territories-implement-85-billion)
for states to implement $8.5 billion in home energy rebate programs,
which will provide rebates for low- and middle-income families to buy
and install cost-saving electric appliances and to make energy
efficiency improvements to their homes. And the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD)
[announced](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_23_093)
$837 million in grant and subsidy funding and $4 billion in loan
commitment authority through the [Green and Resilient Retrofit
Program](https://www.hud.gov/grrp), which will improve the energy and
water efficiency and climate resilience of HUD-assisted multifamily
properties serving low-income residents.  
  
**<u>LOWERING HEALTH CARE COSTS</u>**  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act advances President Biden, Vice President
Harris, and Congressional Democrats’ longstanding commitment to making
health care more affordable for American families and seniors. The law
is bringing down health care costs and thanks to President Biden, Vice
President Harris, and the Inflation Reduction Act’s continuation of
important improvements on the Affordable Care Act, the nation’s
uninsured rate has reached an historic low, and nearly 15 million people
are saving an average of $800 per year on their insurance premiums. In
addition:

-   For the first time, Medicare will have the power to negotiate
    prescription drug prices. Americans pay more for prescription drugs
    than in any other country in the world. By September 1 of this year,
    the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will announce the
    list of ten drugs for which they will negotiate prices with drug
    companies in order to lower prescription drug costs.  
-   Monthly insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries are now capped at
    $35—providing certainty and critical cost savings for seniors who in
    some cases were paying as much as $400 for a month’s supply of
    insulin. If the Inflation Reduction Act had been in effect in 2020,
    Medicare beneficiaries who use insulin pumps would have saved [an
    average of $866 per
    year](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/24/new-hhs-report-finds-major-savings-americans-who-use-insulin-thanks-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html).
    After the insulin cap for seniors went into effect, the top three
    insulin manufacturers also reduced their prices for all Americans.  
-   As of January 1, 2023, seniors on Medicare and adults with Medicaid
    coverage can get all recommended vaccines for free, saving [$70 on
    average](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/15/seniors-people-with-disabilities-likely-save-over-230-million-vaccines-thanks-inflation-reduction-act-according-new-hhs-report.html)
    for these vaccines.  
-   Drug companies that increase prices faster than inflation now have
    to pay a rebate to Medicare—which is translating into lower
    out-of-pocket costs for seniors, as Medicare has begun directly
    lowering co-pays for drugs whose price has increased beyond
    inflation. This past quarter, [43
    drugs](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/06/09/biden-administration-announces-savings-43-prescription-drugs-part-cost-saving-measures-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html)
    used by thousands of Medicare beneficiaries increased their prices
    too fast. Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, some seniors are
    saving up to $449 per dose on those drugs.  
-   Starting in 2025, prescription drug costs for Medicare recipients
    will be capped at $2,000 per year. That means one in three Medicare
    beneficiaries—18.7 million people—will save an average of [$400 per
    year](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/07/07/hhs-announces-actions-protect-consumers-and-lower-health-care-costs.html).
    And the 1.8 million seniors with the highest drug costs, including
    seniors being treated for cancer and other serious diseases, will
    save an average of $2,500 per year.

**<u>MAKING THE WEALTHY AND BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR
SHARE</u>**  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act raises $300 billion over a decade by
requiring large corporations to pay a 15 percent minimum tax on their
profits and by enacting a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks and
redemptions. The Treasury and the IRS have already issued
[initial](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2023-03_IRB#NOT-2023-2)[guidance](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2023-03_IRB#NOT-2023-7)
on these tax provisions, which go into effect this year.  
  
The Inflation Reduction Act also makes a historic investment in
modernizing the IRS, providing funding to hire more staff and upgrade
critical technology infrastructure. Thanks to these investments, the IRS
has already:

-   Improved services for law-abiding taxpayers. This spring, [during
    the 2022 tax
    season](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/building-on-filing-season-2023-success-irs-continues-to-improve-service-pursue-high-income-individuals-evading-taxes-modernize-technology),
    the IRS answered 3 million more phone calls than last year, cut
    phone wait times to three minutes from 28 minutes, and served
    140,000 more taxpayers in person.  
-   Digitized almost 225 times more returns than the previous year
    thanks to the adoption of new scanning technology, cleared the
    backlog of unprocessed 2022 individual tax returns with no errors,
    launched two new digital tools, and enabled a new direct-deposit
    refund option for taxpayers with amended returns.

Over the next decade, these investments will enable the IRS to collect
at least $150 billion in taxes already owed by wealthy people and big
corporations.   
  
Going forward, the IRS is on track to implement additional improvements
for customer service, including a direct-file pilot for a free,
voluntary, IRS-run electronic filing system beginning in 2024;
additional in-person services in rural and underserved areas; a
processing initiative that will expedite refunds by several weeks; and
new online account tools and mobile-friendly tax forms.
