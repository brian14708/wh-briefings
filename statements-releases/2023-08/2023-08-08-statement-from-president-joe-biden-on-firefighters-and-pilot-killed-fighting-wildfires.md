title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Firefighters and Pilot Killed Fighting\_\
  Wildfires"
---
 
Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families of the
helicopter pilot, and the brave California firefighters, who tragically
lost their lives Sunday. Every day, firefighters run toward danger,
while everyone else runs the other way, because being a firefighter is
not what they do — it’s who they are.  This tragedy is yet another
example, of their incredible bravery. As wildfires have intensified in
recent years, more and more firefighters have put themselves in harm’s
way to defend our families and communities from out-of-control fires.
That’s why my administration has invested historic funding to address
the underlying causes of wildfires — like record droughts caused by
climate change. We owe it to our firefighters and their families to do
everything we can to prevent these dangerous fires in the first place.
Three families of three brave Americans have an empty seat around the
dinner table tonight, and our hearts go out to them.
