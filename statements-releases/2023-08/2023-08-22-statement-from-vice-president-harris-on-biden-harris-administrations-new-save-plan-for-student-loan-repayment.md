  s new SAVE Plan for Student Loan\_Repayment"
---
 
Every American deserves the opportunity to pursue a college education
without the burden of unmanageable student loan debt. President Joe
Biden and I are committed to delivering relief to student
loan borrowers. Today, we are announcing the new SAVE Plan – a new
repayment plan that will save the typical borrower around $1,000 a year.

Tens of millions of Americans will be eligible to save money by
enrolling at [www.studentaid.gov/save](http://www.studentaid.gov/save),
lowering their monthly plans in advance of payments resuming later
this fall.

The SAVE plan upholds the promise we make to those seeking a quality
education. Monthly payments will be based on income, rather than their
total student loan balance. In addition, as long as you make the monthly
payments required under your plan, your loan balance will no longer grow
because of unpaid interest – making sure that you make progress on
paying down your debt. 

As President Biden announced in June, we are continuing to pursue an
alternative path to deliver student debt relief to as many Americans as
possible as quickly as possible. Just last week, over 800,000 Americans
with student debt who have been in repayment for over 20 years began to
see those debts cancelled. Our Administration has already approved more
than $116 billion in debt cancellation for 3.4 million Americans, and we
will keep fighting. We will continue to fight to make sure Americans can
access high-quality postsecondary education without taking on the burden
of unmanageable student loan debt.
