title: "Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Launches New Efforts to Strengthen America\u2019\
  s K-12 Schools\u2019 Cybersecurity"
---
 
*Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions and private
commitments to bolster the nation’s cyber defense at schools and protect
hard-working American families*  
  
*Administration leaders, school administrators, educators, and education
technology providers will convene at the White House to discuss how to
strengthen the nation’s schools’ cybersecurity amidst growing ransomware
attacks*

The United States has experienced an increase in cyberattacks that have
targeted the nation’s schools in recent years.  In the 2022-23 academic
year alone, at least eight K-12 school districts throughout the country
were impacted by significant cyberattacks – four of which left schools
having to cancel classes or close completely.  Not only have these
attacks disrupted school operations, but they also have impacted
students, their families, teachers, and administrators.  Sensitive
personal information – including, student grades, medical records,
documented home issues, behavioral information, and financial
information – of students and employees were stolen and publicly
disclosed. Additionally, sensitive information about school security
systems was leaked online as a result of these attacks. **Today,
Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Secretary of Homeland Security
Alejandro Mayorkas, joined First Lady Jill Biden, to convene school
administrators, educators and private sector companies to discuss best
practices and new resources available to strengthen our schools’
cybersecurity, protect American families and schools, and prevent
cyberattacks from disrupting our classrooms.**  
  
According to a [2022 U.S. Government Accountability Office
report](https://www.gao.gov/blog/cyberattacks-increase-k-12-schools-here-whats-being-done),
the loss of learning following a cyberattack ranged from three days to
three weeks, and recovery time can take anywhere from two to nine
months.  Further, the monetary losses to school districts following a
cyber incident ranged from $50,000 to $1 million. That is why the
Biden-Harris Administration has [had a relentless focus on securing our
nation’s critical
infrastructure](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)
since day one, and continues to work tirelessly to [provide
resources](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/07/quad-joint-statement-on-cooperation-to-promote-responsible-cyber-habits/)
that enable the U.S.’s more than 13,000 school districts to better
protect and defend their students and employees against cyberattacks.  
  
The Administration is taking additional action and committing resources
to strengthen the cybersecurity of the nation’s K-12 school systems,
including: 

-   [Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel is
    proposing establishing a pilot
    program](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-395069A1.pdf)
    under the Universal Service Fund to provide up to $200 million over
    three years to strengthen cyber defenses in K-12 schools and
    libraries in tandem with other federal agencies that have deep
    expertise in cybersecurity.  
-   The U.S. Department of Education will
    [establish](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-of-education-announces-k-12-cybersecurity-resilience-efforts)
    a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) that will coordinate
    activities, policy, and communications between, and amongst,
    federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial education leaders to
    strengthen the cyber defenses and resilience of K-12 schools. By
    facilitating formal, ongoing collaboration between all levels of
    government and the education sector, the GCC will be a key first
    step in the Department’s strategy to protect schools and districts
    from cybersecurity threats and for supporting districts in preparing
    for, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity attacks.  
-   The U.S. Department of Education and the Cybersecurity and
    Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly released [*K-12
    Digital Infrastructure Brief: Defensible &
    Resilient*](https://tech.ed.gov/infrastructure/)*,* the second in a
    series of guidance documents to assist educational leaders in
    building and sustaining core digital infrastructure for learning.
     Additional briefs released by the U.S. Department of Education
    include [*Adequate and
    Future-Proof*](https://tech.ed.gov/infrastructure/) and
    [*Privacy-Enhancing, Interoperable and
    Useful*](https://tech.ed.gov/infrastructure/)*.*  
-   CISA is committing to providing tailored assessments, facilitating
    exercises, and delivering cybersecurity training for 300 new K-12
    entities over the coming school year.  CISA plans to conduct 12 K-12
    cyber exercises this year, averaging one per month, and is currently
    soliciting exercise requests from government and critical
    infrastructure partners, including the K-12 community.  
-   The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Guard
    Bureau are releasing updated resource guides to ensure state
    government and education officials know how to report cybersecurity
    incidents and can leverage the federal government’s cyber defense
    capabilities.

Additionally, several education technology providers are committing to
providing free and low-cost resources to school districts, including:

-   Amazon Web Services (AWS) is committing the following: $20 million
    for a K-12 cyber grant program available to all school districts and
    state departments of education; free security training offerings
    tailored to K-12 IT staff delivered through AWS Skill Builder; and
    no-cost cyber incident response assistance through its Customer
    Incident Response Team in the event a school district experiences a
    cyberattack.  AWS will also provide free well-architected security
    reviews to U.S. education technology companies providing
    mission-critical applications to the K-12 community.  
-   Cloudflare, through its Project Cybersafe Schools, will offer a
    suite of free Zero Trust cybersecurity solutions to public school
    districts under 2,500 students, to give small school districts
    faster, safer Internet browsing and email security.  
-   PowerSchool, a provider of cloud-based K-12 software in the United
    States for 80% of school districts, will provide new free and
    subsidized “security as a service” courses, training, tools and
    resources to all U.S. schools and districts.  
-   Google released an updated “[K-12 Cybersecurity
    Guidebook](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/k12cybersecurityguide.pdf)”
    for schools on the most effective and impactful steps education
    systems can take to ensure the security of their Google hardware and
    software applications.  
-   D2L, a learning platform company, is committing to: providing access
    to new cybersecurity courses in collaboration with trusted
    third-parties; extending its information security review for the
    core D2L integration partners; and pursuing additional third-party
    validation of D2L compliance with security standards.

The commitments made today will help ensure the nation’s schools are in
the best position to secure their networks to keep their students,
educators, and employees safe. This is the latest example of President
Biden’s commitment to ease the everyday concerns facing Americans – from
[strengthening confidence in the safety of the devices brought into
homes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/18/biden-harris-administration-announces-cybersecurity-labeling-program-for-smart-devices-to-protect-american-consumers/)
and classrooms to securing the cyber infrastructure of our nation’s
schools.
