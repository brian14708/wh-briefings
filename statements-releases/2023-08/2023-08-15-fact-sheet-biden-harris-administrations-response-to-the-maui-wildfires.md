  Wildfires"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a robust
whole-of-government response effort to support immediate and long-term
rescue and recovery efforts in Maui, Hawaii. Since the onset of the
horrific fires in Maui, dozens of Federal departments and agencies,
including the Department of Homeland Security through FEMA and the Coast
Guard, the Department of Defense through the Navy and Army, the
Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Forest Service, and
the Small Business Administration (SBA) have been working with state and
local partners on the ground to assess ongoing needs and providing
resources and personnel to support response efforts.  
  
Last Thursday, within hours of the devastating fires, President
Biden [signed](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/08/10/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-approves-hawaii-disaster-declaration-3/) a
Major Disaster Declaration for Hawaii, and as President Biden told
Governor Josh Green, the Federal Government stands ready to provide
additional assistance to ensure the state recovers. This weekend, FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell, U.S. Fire Administrator Dr. Lori
Moore-Merrell and U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator
Isabella Casillas Guzman surveyed catastrophic damage on the island and
hosted a local press conference to reiterate the Administration’s
commitment to supporting impacted communities, however long it may
take.   
  
The Administration continues to encourage individuals impacted by the
disaster to register for Federal assistance
at [www.disasterassistance.gov](http://www.disasterassistance.gov/) or
by calling 1-800-621-3362.  
  
More on the coordinated federal response:

-   There are almost 500 Federal personnel deployed to Maui to assist
    residents in their greatest time of need.
-   In the immediate aftermath of the fires, the U.S. Coast Guard and
    U.S. Navy supported maritime search and rescue operations, and U.S.
    Army helicopters supported fire suppression efforts on the Big
    Island.
-   As fire containment efforts continue, FEMA and its Federal partners
    continue response efforts. FEMA has deployed more than 140 Urban
    Search and Rescue personnel who have integrated with the Maui Fire
    Department to help conduct rescue operations.

    5,000 cots and 10,000 blankets and shelter supplies to the county
    government for distribution.
-   FEMA has also authorized Critical Needs Assistance (CNA) which
    provides a onetime payment of $700 per household to applicants who
    were displaced from their homes and have critical needs. CNA
    provides for lifesaving and life-sustaining items such as water,
    food, prescriptions, personal hygiene items, and fuel for
    transportation.
-   The Small Business Administration has dozens of staff on the island
    and has begun making [low-interest Federal disaster
    loans](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/08/10/sba-stands-ready-assist-hawaii-businesses-residents-affected-wildfires) available
    to Hawaii businesses, homeowners, renters, and nonprofits.

    approved Hawaii’s request for impacted Child Nutrition Programs and
    Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.
-   The American Red Cross and Maui County continue to staff and support
    six shelters where food, water, hygiene kits and other essential
    resources are provided to survivors who are unable to return home.
    FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance Team members are deploying to
    shelters and helping people register for Federal assistance. Those
    affected by the fires may visit a Red Cross shelter to get a hot
    meal, charge their phone and access other essential support.
-   Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier
    Becerra [approved](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/08/11/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-declares-public-health-emergency-hawaii-response-wildfires.html) a
    Public Health Emergency effective retroactively from August 8
    through November 6, 2023.
-   In addition, 17 specialists from the Department of Health and Human
    Services’ Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team are on Maui,
    with additional teams en route to assist the state.
-   Local and national Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters
    (VOADs) are providing emergency assistance to survivors. Those
    seeking to donate to the recovery efforts, can do so by
    visiting [www.hawaiistatevoad.org](http://www.hawaiistatevoad.org/).
-   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is helping clear roads, stabilizing
    electric service and working with the Environmental Protection
    Agency on the removal of hazardous waste essential to recovery work
    in the affected areas.
-   The U.S. Forest Service Incident Management Teams and Wildfire
    Liaisons integrated with the State to help identify resources,
    equipment, and additional personnel needed to fully extinguish the
    fires and prevent flare-ups.
-   The U.S. Fire Administration is also working with local fire
    departments to identify what support is needed for firefighting
    personnel and their families who were also affected by this
    disaster, as they continue to heroically battle these blazes.
-   The Department of Defense, through U.S. INDOPACOM, is actively
    supporting the Federal response by helping move supplies across the
    State and is providing assistance with fire suppression activities.
-   U.S. INDOPACOM is also taking actions to move their response command
    and control personnel forward to the island of Maui.
