title: "Statement from National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on the\
  \ Status of Unjustly Detained Americans in\_Iran"
---
 
We have received confirmation that Iran has released from prison five
Americans who were unjustly detained and has placed them on house
arrest. While this is an encouraging step, these U.S. citizens – Siamak
Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad Shargi, and two Americans who at this time
wish to remain private – should have never been detained in the first
place. We will continue to monitor their condition as closely as
possible. Of course, we will not rest until they are all back home in
the United States.  
   
Until that time, negotiations for their eventual release remain ongoing
and are delicate. We will, therefore, have little in the way of details
to provide about the state of their house arrest or about our efforts to
secure their freedom.
