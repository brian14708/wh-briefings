  \ Launch of ARPA-H\u2019s CUREIT Project Led by Emory University to Develop New\
  \ Tools to Strengthen the Immune System and Save\_Lives"

*New ARPA-H project aims to improve patient outcomes across cancer and a
broad range of diseases, using mRNA technology to train our immune
systems to be more effective*

Today, the Biden Cancer Moonshot is announcing the launch of *“Curing
the Uncurable via RNA-Encoded Immunogene Tuning”* (CUREIT), a project
that aims to develop generalizable mRNA platforms that can be harnessed
to train the immune system to more effectively fight cancer and other
diseases, ultimately saving lives. CUREIT will be led by a team at Emory
University in Atlanta, Georgia, with up to $24 million in new funding
from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).  
  
Last year, as part of his Unity Agenda, President Biden worked with
Democrats and Republicans in Congress to establish and fund ARPA-H to
drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other
diseases. Through CUREIT, ARPA-H is now moving aggressively to deliver
on their mission, and to advance the goals of the Biden Cancer Moonshot
and the President’s Unity Agenda.  
  
The goal of CUREIT is to create a toolbox of mRNA and related
technologies that could be used to “turn on” helpful immune responses,
like prompting immune cells to target and attack tumors. Other
applications could extend to autoimmune disorders, transplants, and
infectious diseases. COVID-19 vaccines developed using mRNA technology
platforms have saved millions of lives in the United States and around
the world. A toolbox of mRNA platforms offers the potential to transform
the fight against cancer and other difficult diseases.  
  
Today’s award builds on important progress ARPA-H has made this summer.
Last month, ARPA-H announced the launch of its first program targeting
cancer – the Precision Surgical Interventions Program – to develop novel
technologies that will allow surgeons to remove cancerous tumors with
more precision and accuracy, resulting in better health outcomes for
Americans facing cancer. ARPA-H also recently announced the Novel
Innovations for Tissue Regeneration in Osteoarthritis (NITRO) program to
develop new ways of helping the human body repair its own joints, with
the goal of revolutionizing treatment for osteoarthritis — a common and
often very painful condition where bones and cartilage break down.  
  
CUREIT is the first award from the [ARPA-H Open Broad Agency
Announcement](https://arpa-h.gov/engage/baa/), which seeks
transformative ideas for health research breakthroughs and technological
advancements. The application period is open until March 2024 and future
projects will be funded on a rolling basis.
