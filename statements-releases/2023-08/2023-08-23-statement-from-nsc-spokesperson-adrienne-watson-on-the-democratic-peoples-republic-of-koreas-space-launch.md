  s Republic of Korea\u2019s Space\_Launch"

The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK) for its launch using ballistic missile technology, which
despite its failure, is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security
Council resolutions, raises tensions, and risks destabilizing the
security situation in the region and beyond.  This space launch involved
technologies that are directly related to the DPRK intercontinental
ballistic missile program.  The President’s national security team is
assessing the situation in close coordination with our allies and
partners.  We urge all countries to condemn this launch and call on the
DPRK to come to the table for serious negotiations.  The door has not
closed on diplomacy but Pyongyang must immediately cease its provocative
actions and instead choose engagement.  The United States will take all
necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and
the defense of our Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
