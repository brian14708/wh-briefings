**HIGH-LEVEL TRILATERAL CONSULTATIONS**

Today’s Summit is the fourth meeting between President Biden, Prime
Minister Kishida, and President Yoon over the fourteen months. The
Summit is the culmination of numerous meetings between Foreign
Ministers, Defense Ministers, National Security Advisors, and other
senior officials across the three governments. Today, the three Leaders
reaffirmed the critical importance of regular, high-level consultations
between our countries.

-   **Commitment to Consult: **The Leaders announced their governments’
    commitment to consult with each other in an expeditious manner to
    coordinate their responses to regional challenges, provocations, and
    threats that affect their collective interests and security. 
-   **Annual Leaders’ Meeting**: The Leaders decided to meet in-person
    at least annually to build on the momentum of the Camp David
    Trilateral Leaders’ Summit. At these meetings, Leaders will share
    assessments on a range of geostrategic issues and discuss
    opportunities for further trilateral cooperation.
-   **Annual Meetings Between Foreign Ministers, Defense Ministers,
    Commerce and Industry Ministers, and National Security
    Advisors: **At least annually, foreign ministers from the United
    States, Japan, and the ROK will meet trilaterally with their
    counterparts; defense ministers will meet trilaterally with their
    counterparts; commerce and industry ministers will meet trilaterally
    with their counterparts; and national security advisors will meet
    trilaterally with their counterparts. The three countries will
    rotate hosting responsibilities of these separate, annual meetings,
    all focused on strengthening the trilateral relationship across
    domains. The three countries will also hold the first trilateral
    meeting between finance ministers.
-   **Annual Trilateral Indo-Pacific Dialogue: **The Leaders decided
    that their governments would initiate an annual Assistant
    Secretary-led Indo-Pacific Dialogue focused on coordinating
    implementation of their respective Indo-Pacific approaches, with a
    particular emphasis on partnership with Southeast Asian and Pacific
    Island countries.

**STRENGTHENING SECURITY COOPERATION**

The United States, Japan, and the ROK are committed to further
strengthening trilateral security cooperation, including through
enhanced trilateral defense exercises, improved information sharing, and
increased cooperation on ballistic missile defense, including against
the DPRK’s missile threat. The three Leaders affirmed ongoing progress
to regularize defensive exercises that contribute to strengthening
trilateral responses to DPRK threats, resume maritime interdiction
exercises and anti-piracy exercises, and expand trilateral cooperation
in other areas, including disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.

-   **Multi-year Trilateral Exercise Plan: **Building upon the
    understandings reached by Defense Ministers in June 2023 at
    Shangri-La, as well as the recent successful trilateral ballistic
    missile defense and anti-submarine warfare exercises, the United
    States, Japan, and the ROK decided on a multi-year trilateral
    framework that includes annual, named, multi-domain trilateral
    exercises, which will constitute an unprecedented level of
    trilateral defense cooperation.

-   **Improved Cooperation on Ballistic Missile Defense**: The United
    States, Japan, and the ROK affirmed the decision to activate a
    data-sharing mechanism to exchange real-time missile warning data
    that would improve the detection and assessment of DPRK missile
    launches, building upon the commitment made by Leaders at their
    meeting in Phnom Penh last year. The three leaders committed to
    operationalizing this mechanism by the end of 2023. This cooperation
    will strengthen our data sharing and enable all three countries to
    establish enhanced capabilities that will contribute to peace and
    stability across the Indo-Pacific.
-   **Trilateral Working Group on DPRK Cyber Activities:** The United
    States, Japan, and the ROK decided to establish a new trilateral

    Japanese, and ROK interagencies to coordinate efforts to counter
    DPRK illicit revenue generation and malicious cyber activities.  The
    Working Group will focus on sharing intelligence; coordinating
    responses to the DPRK’s cryptocurrency use, theft, and laundering;
    addressing the DPRK’s use of IT workers for revenue generation
    through diplomatic and industry engagement; and disrupting malicious
    cyber actor operations.
-   **Enhanced Information Sharing and Coordination:** The three Leaders
    affirmed the importance of increased information sharing, including
    the utilization of the 2014 U.S.-Japan-ROK Trilateral Information

    continue building and institutionalizing respective communication
    channels.

    increased threat posed by foreign information manipulation and the
    misuse of surveillance technology, the United States, Japan, and the
    ROK will discuss ways to coordinate efforts to counter
    disinformation.

    (Korea Eximbank) – are signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
    to strengthen their cooperation to mobilize financing for quality
    infrastructure, including information and communications technology
    (ICT); carbon neutrality; and resilient supply chains in the
    Indo-Pacific region and beyond.  
-   **Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation Framework**: The United
    States, Japan, and the ROK are establishing a trilateral maritime

    regions across the globe, including the Indo-Pacific. To bridge
    policy and practice, USAID the Japan International Cooperation
    Agency (JICA), and Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA)
    will also collaboratively assist the development of partner
    countries by focusing on their needs.

    mechanisms such as with the European Union, and additional
    mechanisms being considered as part of the Indo-Pacific Economic
    Framework for Prosperity.  They will identify priority products and
    materials—such as critical minerals, and rechargeable batteries—and
    establish mechanisms to rapidly share information on disruptions to
    crucial supply chains.
-   **Trilateral National Laboratories Cooperation: **The United States,
    Japan, and the ROK will drive new trilateral cooperation between the
    U.S. Department of Energy’s National Laboratories and counterpart

    knowledge, strengthen scientific collaboration, and spearhead
    innovation in support of the three countries’ shared interests. 
    Scientists and innovators from the three countries will advance
