title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Clarence\_\
  Avant"
---
 
Clarence Avant was a legend. He was always focused on who he could bring
to the table and who he could lift up. From the music industry to the
civil rights movement, he brought people together so we could all move
forward.  
  
Often operating behind the scenes, Clarence, affectionately called “the
Godfather of Black Music”, spent his career sharing advice, making
connections, and widening the path for generations of others to follow.
He mentored and molded hundreds of legendary Black artists, athletes,
and producers, whose signature styles and songs of triumph and tragedy
continue to move millions across our nation and throughout the world.  
  
Clarence supported community leaders through some of the toughest
moments of the civil rights movement, and helped open doors for elected
officials – from those at city hall and in the halls of Congress, to the
White House.  
  
He was generous, he was funny, and he was full of heart.  
  
He was my friend.  
  
Today, Doug and my prayers are with Nicole, Alex, Ted, and all those who
loved him.
