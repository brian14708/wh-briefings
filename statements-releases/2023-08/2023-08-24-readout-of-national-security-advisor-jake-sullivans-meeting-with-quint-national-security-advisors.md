National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan convened the Quint national
security advisors of France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom at
the White House today.  Noting that it is also Ukraine’s Independence
Day, participants reiterated their enduring commitment to supporting
Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression for as long as it
takes, and to aiding it in its reconstruction.  The national security
advisors stressed that Russia’s sovereign assets in their nations’
jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage
it has caused to Ukraine, and examined further ways to hold Russia
accountable for the destruction it has brought in its illegal war.  The
national security advisors also reaffirmed the importance of putting
Niger back on a path to constitutional order, and support for the
Economic Community of West African states’ leadership role in resolving
this crisis.  They discussed a range of other strategic issues,
including an exchange of views on the Indo-Pacific region and the Middle
East.

In addition, National Security Advisor Sullivan convened the national
security advisors and senior G20 representatives of the Quint and the
European Union at the White House to discuss the upcoming G20 Leaders’
Summit in New Delhi, India.  Participants discussed their unified
support for the G20 and India’s G20 Presidency, as well as their
commitment to ensuring strong outcomes in New Delhi, including
demonstrating the G20’s role as the premier forum for economic
cooperation, driving an affirmative and ambitious agenda for developing
and emerging countries, and making progress on evolving the multilateral
development banks to be more responsive to shared global challenges.
