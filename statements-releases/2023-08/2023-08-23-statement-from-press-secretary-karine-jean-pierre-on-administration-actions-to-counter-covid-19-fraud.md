  \ to Counter COVID-\u206019\_Fraud"

When President Biden came into office, he inherited unprecedented fraud
from pandemic relief programs. The President made clear the watchdogs
are back. The Department of Justice has taken action against thousands
of criminals who stole billions of taxpayer dollars meant for
hard-working Americans and small businesses coping with the pandemic. In
his State of the Union address this year, President Biden promised to
double down on the work of the COVID-19 fraud strike forces he called
for and also called for the creation of additional anti-fraud strike
forces. Today, the Department of Justice announced enforcement actions
and charges for crimes related to an additional $836 million in alleged
COVID-19 fraud, with federal charges against more than 300 additional
defendants. The Justice Department has now recovered over $1.4 billion,
and more than 3,000 defendants have been charged. The Justice
Department’s announcement of two new COVID-19 fraud strike forces will
enable it to further ramp up its efforts. Congress should act on the
President’s full proposal to triple such strike forces, invest more in
fraud and identity-theft prevention efforts, and double the statute of
limitations on these crimes. As the President has said about those who
defrauded the American people during the pandemic: ‘You can’t hide.’
