Jill and I send our warmest wishes to Christians around the world
celebrating Easter Sunday. Easter reminds us of the power of hope and
the promise of Christ’s Resurrection.

As we gather with loved ones, we remember Jesus’ sacrifice. We pray for
one another and cherish the blessing of the dawn of new possibilities.
And with wars and conflict taking a toll on innocent lives around the
world, we renew our commitment to work for peace, security, and dignity
for all people.

From our family to yours, happy Easter and may God bless you.
