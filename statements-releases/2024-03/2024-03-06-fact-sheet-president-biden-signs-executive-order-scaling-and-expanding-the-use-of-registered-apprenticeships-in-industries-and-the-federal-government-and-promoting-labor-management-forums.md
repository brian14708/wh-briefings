*Vice President Harris to travel to Wisconsin to highlight Biden-Harris
Administration’s investments in Registered Apprenticeships and pipelines
to good jobs*

Today, Vice President Harris will travel to Madison, Wisconsin, to
announce the Biden-Harris Administration’s Executive Order to Expand
Registered Apprenticeships, which will help create more Registered
Apprenticeship programs in the federal workforce, encourage agencies to
provide preferences on projects to recipients that hire individuals who
have participated in Registered Apprenticeship programs, and increase
worker voice for federal programs and contracts.

The Executive Order implements a key recommendation of the White House
Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, which is chaired by the
Vice President.

Registered Apprenticeships are a proven strategy to expand equitable
training pathways to good-paying jobs, including union jobs. Since
taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested more than
$440 million to expand the capacity of the Registered Apprenticeship
system, supporting the education and training needs of more than 1
million apprentices across the country. The new efforts announced today
will help ensure Americans have the skills and training they need for
the good jobs created by the President’s Investing in America agenda,
which includes the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. Vice President
Harris will highlight the announcements in the Executive Order while
meeting with registered apprentices at the construction site of the
future Madison Metro Transit facility.

The Scaling and Expanding the Use of Registered Apprenticeships in
Industries and the Federal Government and Promoting Labor-Management
Forums Executive Order would:

-   Expand Registered Apprenticeships (RAs) in the Federal
    Workforce: The EO directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),
    Department of Labor, and other Federal agencies to explore
    opportunities to reduce barriers and create pathways into and up
    through Federal employment using Registered Apprenticeships. The EO
    directs OPM and DOL to issue a report within 180 days detailing
    potential occupations for expanding Federal RAs and further
    authorities that OPM should consider to expand Federal RAs.  
     
-   Promote and Expand the Use of Registered Apprenticeships through
    Grants and Contracts: The EO directs Federal agencies to identify
    where they could include requirements or incentives for grant
    recipients or contractors to employ workers who are or were
    participating in RA programs, and, in appropriate cases, directs
    those agencies to require, incentivize, or encourage those
    requirements or incentives.  
     
-   Re-Establish Labor Management Forums (LMFs): LMFs are a tool used by
    union members and management, acting together, to jointly improve
    their workplaces. This Executive Order will re-establish labor
    management forums within the federal government to ensure workers
    have a voice.

The EO builds upon nearly $200 million in funding opportunities the
Administration recently [made
available](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20240221) to
expand, diversify and strengthen Registered Apprenticeships nationwide.
In February, the Department of Labor announced availability of $95
million in competitive grants through the Apprenticeship Building
America, as well as $100 million for the State Apprenticeship Expansion
Formula Grants.  
The new EO also complements existing White House Investing in America
workforce initiatives, including:

-   **Workforce Hubs.** In May, the White
    House [designated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strategies-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/) five
    Workforce Hubs—Augusta, Baltimore, Columbus, Phoenix, and
    Pittsburgh— where the Investing in America agenda is catalyzing
    historic private and public investments and creating good-paying
    jobs. In these regions, the Administration partnered with state and
    local officials, employers, unions, community colleges, and other
    stakeholders to ensure a skilled and diverse workforce to meet the
    demand for labor driven by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS
    and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. The Workforce Hubs
    catalyzed thousands of new union construction jobs and hundreds of
    new Registered Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship spots, and are
    providing a replicable model for other areas around the country.  
     
-   **Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint.** The President’s
    Investing in America agenda creating strong demand for skilled
    advanced manufacturing workers in clean energy, biotechnology,
    semiconductors, and more. To help meet this demand, the
    Administration led the Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint, an
    intensive drive to build a diverse, skilled pipeline of workers for
    good advanced manufacturing jobs, including union jobs, many of
    which do not require a four-year college degree. In January, the
    White
    House [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-new-commitments-toward-equitable-workforce-development-in-advanced-manufacturing/) new
    commitments to the Sprint, including 150 new advanced
    manufacturing-related Registered Apprenticeship programs and
    occupations have been created or are newly under development, and
    more than 4,700 new apprentices hired in advanced manufacturing
    occupations.
