title: "The American Rescue Plan (ARP): Top Highlights from 3 Years of\_Recovery"
---
 
1.  ***Led to the Strongest Jobs Recovery on Record and the Strongest
    Recovery in the World: When President Biden came into office, there
    was tremendous economic uncertainty.*** *Unemployment was at 6.4%
    when President Biden took office. Unemployment was not projected to
    drop below 4% until the end of 2025 in CBO’s February 2021 (Pre-ARP)
    Forecast. Instead, unemployment was below 4% for the past 25 months
    in a row – the strongest record in more than five decades. *

-   ***ARP drove historic 3-year job growth*** *with* *15 million jobs
    added since President Biden took office.*
-   ***Not only recovered all the lost jobs but added an additional 5.5
    million more jobs versus pre-Covid.***
-   ***Powered the strongest recovery in the world:*** *After the
    American Rescue Plan passed, the U.S. saw by far the fastest
    recovery in the G7, with significantly higher real wage growth. US
    has lower apples to apples core inflation than all major European
    allies.*

1.  ***Powered the Most Equitable Recovery in Memory:*** *In past
    recessions, persistent high long-term and youth unemployment as well
    as high numbers foreclosures and evictions led to long-term harms –
    “scarring” for millions of Americans and hard, long roads back for
    Black and Latino Americans.* *<u>President Biden’s Rescue Plan
    ensured that didn’t happen this time:</u>*

-   ***Historic drops in unemployment for Black and Latino workers:***
    *With the strong recovery powered by ARP, Black unemployment saw its
    largest 1-year drop since the early 1980s and reached its
    lowest-ever annual rate in 2023; Hispanic unemployment saw its
    fastest 1-year drop and reached its lowest 2-year rate ever in 2022
    & 2023.  *
-   ***Least scarring in any recovery in memory:*** *The American Rescue
    Plan led to the fastest drop in long-term and youth unemployment
    ever. It kept foreclosures historically low and evictions 20% below
    historic avgs.*
-   ***Led to dramatic reduction in inequality:*** *Economists have
    found that the strong post-ARP labor market’s wage increases for
    middle-income and lower-income workers erased nearly 40% of the rise
    in wage inequality increases from the previous four decades.*
-   ***Lowest women’s annual unemployment rate since 1953:*** *This
    recovery has seen a dramatic decline in women’s unemployment to an
    average of 3.5% in 2023, the lowest annual average since 1953.*
-   ***Strong recovery for Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native
    Hawaiian communities:*** *Asian American unemployment averaged 2.9%
    over the last two years and AA NHPI small business formation surged.
    Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander unemployment also fell by half
    from a 9% avg. in 2020 to 4% in 2022-2023.*

1.  ***Led to the Largest Federal Investments in Preventing Crime,
    Reducing Violence, and Investing in Public Safety in History.***

    funding.*

    and reducing violence,*** *with investments by over 1,000 state and
    local governments to avoid cuts to police budgets, hire more police
    officers for safe, effective, and accountable community policing,
    ensure first responders have the equipment they need to do their
    jobs, and expand evidence-based community violence intervention and
    prevention programs.*
-   ***That includes $1.2 billion for Medicaid Mobile Crisis
    Intervention Services**** – the American Rescue Plan included $1.2
    billion to fund mobile crisis intervention units staffed with mental
    health professionals & trained peers. *
-   ***It also includes $1 billion in Family Violence Prevention and
    Services Program**** to reduce domestic violence with immediate
    crisis intervention, health supports, and safety.*

1.  ***American Rescue Plan’s Expansion of the Affordable Care Act Led
    to Record-Breaking Health Care Enrollment and Savings:*** *ARP
    substantially increased consumer subsidies, eligibility to
    middle-income families and provided strong incentives for states to
    expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. <u>Result:</u>*

    extended permanent.*
