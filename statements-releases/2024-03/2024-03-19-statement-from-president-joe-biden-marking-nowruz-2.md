Today, Jill and I send our best wishes to the millions of people around
the world celebrating Nowruz—a time of reflection, renewal, and rebirth.

Generations of Americans have spread the hope of this holiday across
every part of our nation. We see it in the pastries and presents
exchanged between family and friends. We hear it in the sound of
children banging pots, and in the laughs of families who’ve come
together around the Haft-Sin table. And we feel it as communities gather
to make this celebration such a joyous part of American culture—one that
reflects the soul of who we are as a nation, and reminds us that hope
lies ahead.

This year, Nowruz comes at a difficult time for many—when this hope is
needed more than ever. The United States will continue to stand with the
courageous women of Iran, who are fighting for their freedoms. And
together with our partners, we will hold Iranian officials to account
for denying fundamental human rights. The war in Gaza has also inflicted
terrible suffering on the Palestinian people, and we will continue to
lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to
them—including urgently needed food, water, medicine and shelter.

We have decorated our Haft-Sin table at the White House to reflect our
hopes, and the potential and promise of the new year. And, as we mark
the start of Spring, we honor the diverse diaspora communities across
our nation, who have adapted old traditions anew to tell the ongoing
story of America. To all who celebrate: Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak—we wish you
a peaceful and joyous new year.
