title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on the UN General Assembly Resolution\
  \ on Artificial\_Intelligence"
---
 
The United States welcomes the UN General Assembly’s adoption of a
resolution setting out principles for the deployment and use of
artificial intelligence (AI). President Biden and I are committed to
establishing and strengthening international rules and norms on emerging
technology – because technology with global impact, such as AI, requires
global action, and when it comes to the challenges of the 21st century,
we believe all nations must be guided by a common set of understandings.
This resolution proposed by the United States and co-sponsored by more
than 100 nations, is a historic step toward establishing clear
international norms for AI and for fostering safe, secure, and
trustworthy AI systems.  
  
As I said in London last year, AI must be in the public interest – it
must be adopted and advanced in a way that protects everyone from
potential harm and ensures everyone is able to enjoy its benefits.  And
we must also address the full spectrum of risk, from catastrophic risks
to all of humanity to the harms felt by individuals and communities,
such as bias. Too often, in past technological revolutions, the benefits
have not been shared equitably, and the harms have been felt by a
disproportionate few. This resolution establishes a path forward on AI
where every country can both seize the promise and manage the risks of
AI.  
  
This resolution reflects extensive consultation and input from countries
all around the world. Together we have set a path whereby AI can be
harnessed for sustainable development, all nations gain access to AI
resources and expertise, and all nations understand the need to protect
the safety, privacy, and human rights of their citizens. And the
resolution makes clear that protecting human rights and fundamental
freedoms must be central to the development and use of AI systems.  
  
As this technology continues to evolve, the United States will continue
to lead and work with partners throughout the international community to
build on the important foundational principles adopted by the UN General
Assembly today.
