title: "Readout of Women\u2019s History Month Labor Roundtable with the\_AFL-CIO"
---
 
This week, Trade Representative Katherine Tai, Director of the White
House Gender Policy Council Jennifer Klein, Deputy Undersecretary of
International Labor Affairs Thea Lee, Deputy Assistant to the President
Samantha Silverberg and the White House Office of Public Engagement
hosted a group of women labor leaders and organizers at the White House.
The event, held in partnership with the AFL-CIO and moderated by White
House Senior Labor Advisor Erika Dinkel-Smith, was a celebration of
women in labor in honor of Women’s History Month and highlighted how the
Biden-Harris Administration is putting women and girls at the heart of
the Administration’s economic agenda, and promoting and defending women
workers’ rights both domestically and abroad.

Since President Biden took office, the economy has created nearly 15
million jobs and women have seen the lowest unemployment rate in more
than five decades. President’s Investing in America Agenda is
prioritizing increased access in sectors where women have historically
been underrepresented, like manufacturing, construction, and clean
energy, and is championing equal pay and ensuring women have access to
the resources they need to enter and remain in the workforce, including
high-quality, affordable child care.

Participants included AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler, AFL-CIO State
Federation and Central Labor Council leaders, as well as young women
organizers on the front lines of organizing new workplaces and expanding
the benefits of unionization to women in their states. Collectively,
attendees represented union members in the 14 states they represent.
