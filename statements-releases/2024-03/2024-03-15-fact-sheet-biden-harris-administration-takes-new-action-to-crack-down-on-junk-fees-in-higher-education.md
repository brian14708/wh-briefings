title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes New Action to Crack Down\
  \ on Junk Fees in Higher\_Education"
---
 
*Reforms would save students and borrowers billions in unnecessary fees
and improve the college and loan repayment experience.*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps to crack
down on hidden junk fees as part of President Biden’s agenda to lower
costs for students and families paying for college. Junk fees are hidden
costs or surprise fees that companies and institutions include on
customer or student bills, increasing their costs. 

Each year, students—including Federal student loan borrowers—incur
billions in fees or additional unseen costs for unused meal account
funds, using a college-sponsored credit card or banking account, paying
for textbooks, or simply taking out a loan to pay for school.
Additionally, students aren’t always provided clear and upfront
opportunities to avoid fees for services they do not want. Obscured
costs and misleading practices aren’t just frustrating—they cost
millions of students and borrowers money.

The fees targeted in today’s announcement may be imposed multiple times
during the college or graduate school experience. 

For example, when students first take out their federal student loans to
go to college, they incur a “loan origination” fee that ranges from 1
percent for undergraduate loans to 4 percent for graduate and parent
loans. This can tack on hundreds or thousands of dollars onto their
debts.

Additionally, many colleges directly offer students financial products
through affiliated banks, like student banking accounts and credit
cards. Students trust and rely on their schools’ offering of these
products; in some cases, these products help students receive student
aid. However,
[reports](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-finds-many-college-sponsored-financial-products-charge-high-and-unusual-fees/)
have found that these products often assess high and unusual fees that
are more costly than widely available options and can erode the
purchasing power of students’ financial aid. 

Colleges are also currently allowed to automatically charge students for
textbooks if the charge meets certain criteria. Students are often
unaware of this hidden cost or their ability to decline the charge,
preventing them from shopping around for a better price. Further, some
colleges keep unspent student meal plan credit balances, instead of
providing students with a refund.

The actions announced today are part of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s strategy to lower costs and make higher education more
affordable and accessible for students by creating more transparent and
student-friendly policies. These actions include:  

-   **Eliminating the Student Loan Origination Fees:** The President’s
    Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Proposal calls on Congress to end student
    loan origination fees.  According to the Office of Management and
    Budget, approximately 7 million undergraduate, graduate, and parent
    borrowers pay origination fees of 1 to 4 percent of the total amount
    each federal student loan is charged to every borrower who takes out
    federal money to help get an education. These fees are a relic of an
    era when the government compensated private lenders to issue these
    loans.  Today, this fee is nothing more than a tax imposed on
    students by the government, costing consumers [more than $1 billion
    annually](https://www.nasfaa.org/issue_brief_origination_fees).
    Adding insult to injury, these fees are added to loan balances and
    subject to interest for the life of the loan.  A typical teacher or
    nurse taking out federal loans for undergraduate and graduate
    degrees will pay $1,000 or more over the life of their loan because
    of these fees. Parents often fare even worse, with the average
    parent borrower paying out an additional $2800 or more because of
    these fees. The Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress
    to pass the President’s 2025 Budget proposal and eliminate it.

-   **Putting an End to College Banking Junk Fees: ** The Department of
    Education (ED) is undergoing negotiated rulemaking to clarify that
    college banking products that provide students access to their
    financial aid cannot include harmful fees.  A recent
    [report](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_college-banking-and-credit-card-agreements-report.pdf)
    by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) highlighted how
    banks are imposing millions in high and unusual fees on more than
    650,000 student account holders with college banking accounts, with
    account holders at Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
    for-profit colleges, and Hispanic-servicing institutions paying
    higher-than-average fees. The report found that these junk fees no
    longer reflect prevailing market practices as more banks have phased
    them out – contributing to the [$5.5 billion
    decrease](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/data-spotlight-overdraft-nsf-revenue-in-q4-2022-down-nearly-50-versus-pre-pandemic-levels/)
    in overdraft and bounced check fees for all consumers since 2019.
     To address the problem, the Department is formally considering
    regulations that would prohibit entities that contract with
    institutions of higher education for the disbursement of Title IV
    funds from charging particular fees that harm students, such as
    insufficient funds fees or maintenance and closure fees.  These
    changes, if proposed and finalized, would be included under ED’s
    cash management regulations, which are currently in rulemaking.
-   **Eliminating Automatic Charges for Textbooks:** The Department is
    undergoing negotiated rulemaking to reduce costs incurred by
    students in addition to tuition in higher education by ending the
    practice of automatic billing on tuition for textbooks. Under the
    draft proposal, students would now need to authorize a charge on
    their tuition bill for course materials. Competitive markets provide
    consumers choice and value, but automatic charges for textbooks and
    course materials leave students with little ability to meaningfully
    shop around for better prices or to utilize free and open-source
    textbooks. These changes, if proposed and finalized, would provide
    students with real choice and the ability to use the best textbooks
    at the most affordable price.
-   **Stopping Colleges from Pocketing Students’ Leftover Meal Plan
    Dollars:** The Department is formally considering regulations to
    require institutions of higher education to return any unused funds
    from Federal financial aid recipients’ meal plans back to students.
    Students are often required to purchase meal plans from
    institutions, and institutions can credit financial aid funds toward
    meal plan expenses that can be used like cash to also cover expenses
    at campus grocery stores and food courts, often referred to as “flex
    dollars.” At the end of a term, institutions can take any remaining
    funds without returning unused funds. This can create a financial
    penalty for students as they either lose the money they are entitled
    to, or are forced to spend remaining funds at the end of the term on
    items they might not otherwise feel they need.

These actions build upon important steps to increase transparency and
improve the experience for students through [final
regulations](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2021/non-ge-final-rules-fact-sheet.pdf)
issued in late 2023 that go into effect on July 1, 2024. Recently
finalized student- and borrower-friendly policies include:

-   **Increasing College Cost Transparency:** The Department issued
    [final
    regulations](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2021/non-ge-final-rules-fact-sheet.pdf)
    to require that institutions provide the most detailed information
    ever about the cost of college, including costs that students and
    families are likely to pay out-of-pocket, before students enroll in
    a college and accept financial aid. The Department is also requiring
    that institutions provide adequate financial aid communications and
    counseling to students. This will help to increase cost transparency
    and decision-making for students and families. Under this rule,
    institutions of higher education may have their participation in
    Federal student aid programs limited, suspended, or terminated if
    they fail to administer their programs consistently with these new
    rules.
-   **Preventing Schools from Withholding Student’s Transcripts:**
    Recently issued final
    [regulations](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-releases-final-rules-strengthen-accountability-colleges-and-consumer-protection-students)
    also restrict colleges from withholding course credits paid for with
    Federal money. Previously, institutions of higher education could
    withhold transcripts from students until their accounts were fully
    paid. Withholding transcripts can keep students from transferring to
    another institution, enrolling in another program upon graduation,
    and securing a job. Under the Department’s new rule, colleges will
    no longer be allowed to withhold transcripts over unpaid debts if
    the student paid for some of their courses with Federal student
    loans or other Federal financial aid.
-   **Holding Schools Accountable as Lenders.** CFPB clearly
    communicated to institutions that when they act as lenders by
    offering tuition payment plans and other credit to students, they
    will be held accountable if they violate federal consumer financial
    protection laws. A recent CFPB report found some colleges charging
    late fees over $200, using troubling debt collection practices
    including transcript withholding, removal from campus meal plans,
    and providing unclear and inconsistent product disclosures.
-   **Reducing the price of textbooks by investing in freely available
    textbooks.** The Department’s Open Textbooks Pilot Program provides
    grants for institutions to create and use their own free textbooks
    and other open-source course materials. In fiscal year 2021 through
    2023, the Department awarded slightly under $30 million to 17
    grantees for this purpose. The total federal investment in the Open
    Textbooks Pilot Program through 2023 is $47 million. The President’s
    Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Proposal calls for funding the Open
    Textbooks Pilot Program.
-   **Establishing the most effective safeguards ever against
    unaffordable debt or insufficient earnings for postsecondary
    students**. This includes [landmark
    regulations](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-landmark-final-rules-protect-consumers-unaffordable-student-debt-and-increase-transparency)
    finalized in fall 2023 to hold for-profit colleges and career
    education programs accountable for failure to deliver for students.
    Approximately 700,000 students a year will now be protected from
    career training programs that leave graduates with high debts, low
    earnings, and poor career prospects.
-   **Establishing** **a new framework holding student loan servicers
    accountable.** The Department has returned student loan borrowers to
    repayment following the pandemic-era pause on payments and has
    worked to ensure borrowers are not harmed by servicer errors in
    doing so, including by errors identified in a recent
    [report](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-uncovers-illegal-junk-fees-on-bank-accounts-mortgages-and-student-and-auto-loans/)
    released by the CFPB.

These actions build upon the Administration’s efforts to protect
students and borrowers. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue
its efforts to make higher education more affordable and accessible, as
well as to eliminate hidden, surprise, and junk fees and put cash back
in the pockets of Americans.
