title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable with Survivors on Guns and Domestic\_Violence"
---
 
Today, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy
Council Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Office of Gun Violence Prevention Stefanie Feldman, and Deputy Assistant
to the President and Counsel to the Vice President Erica Songer met with
survivors to hear first-hand accounts of the devastating impact of
gun-related domestic violence. The group also discussed how the
Biden-Harris Administration can continue its fight to ensure that all
Americans, including those vulnerable to gender-based violence, are safe
from gun violence.

Gender-based violence and gun violence are deeply—and often
fatally—interconnected, impacting millions of individuals, particularly
women of color, LGBTQI+ individuals, and women with disabilities, as
well as whole families and communities. The presence of firearms
significantly increases the risk of death or serious injury for
survivors of domestic or dating violence.

Senior Administration officials underscored the President and Vice
President’s deep commitment to ending gender-based violence and gun
violence—as well as actions that the Administration has already taken to
address its intersections. Nearly thirty years ago, as a United States
Senator, President Biden championed the original Violence Against Women
Act (VAWA). Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has:
strengthened VAWA in its 2022 reauthorization; enacted the President’s
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which narrowed the so-called
“boyfriend loophole” by prohibiting dating partners convicted of
domestic violence from purchasing or possessing firearms; supported the
enactment of extreme risk protection orders; and assisted efforts to
remove firearms from individuals convicted of domestic abuse or subject
to domestic violence protection orders. Last year, the Administration
also released the first-ever [U.S. National Plan to End Gender-Based
Violence](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/National-Plan-to-End-GBV.pdf)
to prevent and address domestic violence, sexual violence, intimate
partner violence, stalking, and other forms of gender-based violence,
including effective strategies to strengthen efforts to reduce
gun-related violence.

Survivors—who were joined by representatives of advocacy organizations
fighting to end both gender-based violence and gun violence—shared their
stories of surviving violence at this lethal intersection, the harm
caused by access to firearms, and ways that they, and other leaders in
the field, can work together, alongside the White House, to end
gun-related domestic violence. Participants also discussed current needs
to ensure every survivor can access safety, healing, and justice. The
roundtable was held as the Supreme Court is considering the
constitutionality of a federal law that helps keep guns out of the hands
of individuals subject to domestic violence protective orders—a
commonsense gun safety law that has been on the books for nearly 30
years.

The following survivors provided remarks during the roundtable:

-   Mayor Sheng Thao, Oakland, CA
-   Ruth Glenn, Survivor Justice Action
-   T. Christian Heyne, Brady: United Against Gun Violence
-   Penny Page
-   Lisette Johnson

In addition, representatives from the following organizations
participated in the meeting:

-   National Network to End Domestic Violence
-   National Domestic Violence Hotline
-   Ujima, Inc., The National Center on Violence Against Women in the
    Black Community
-   Esperanza United
-   Battered Women’s Justice Project
-   Brady: United Against Gun Violence
-   Everytown for Gun Safety
-   Jewish Women International
-   Community Justice Action Fund
