*President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda Will Save
3-Million-Acre-Feet of Water by 2026, Enhancing Drought Resilience and
Strengthening Water Security*

The Biden-Harris Administration is leading a comprehensive effort to
make Western communities more resilient to climate change and address
the ongoing megadrought across the region by harnessing the full
resources of President Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda. As
climate change has accelerated over the past two decades, the Colorado
River Basin experienced the driest period in the region in over one
thousand years. Together, the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law provide the largest investment in climate resilience
in our nation’s history, including $15.4 billion for western water to
enhance the West’s resilience to drought and deliver unprecedented
resources to protect the Colorado River System for all whose lives and
livelihoods depend on it.  
  
Following extensive engagement with states, Tribes, and water users, and
leveraging the resources from the President’s Investing in America
agenda, [**today the Administration is taking historic
action**](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-major-milestone-protect-short-term-stability)
**to conserve at least 3 million-acre-feet of water in the Colorado
River Basin through the end of 2026**.  
  
The Colorado River Basin provides water for more than 40 million people,
fuels hydropower resources in eight states, supports agriculture and
agricultural communities across the West, and is a crucial resource for
30 Tribal Nations. With this significant milestone, unprecedented
conservation investments, and improved hydrology, the Biden-Harris
Administration has staved off the immediate threat facing the Colorado
River System, water deliveries, and power production throughout the
region, making the region’s water resources more secure and sustainable
since President Biden took office.  
  
Today **the Administration is also announcing three new conservation
agreements in California** that will yield hundreds of thousands of
acre-feet of water savings in Lake Mead. These System Conservation
Implementation Agreements, totaling nearly $160 million in funding from
the Inflation Reduction Act, build upon 21 previous agreements in the
Basin. Together, these 24 agreements **have provided approximately
$670.2 million to the region and will secure more than 1.58 million
acre-feet of water conservation** in the Basin through 2026.  
  
The conservation agreements announced today include:

-   **A second agreement with Coachella Valley Water District,** which
    commits up to 30,000 acre-feet of conserved water through 2026;
-   **An agreement with Palo Verde Irrigation District in cooperation
    with Metropolitan Water District,** which commits up to 351,063
    acre-feet of conserved water through 2026; and
-   **An agreement with Bard Water District in cooperation with
    Metropolitan Water District**, which commits up to 18,090 acre-feet
    of conserved water through 2026.

These announcements build on [a series of historic investments and
actions](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/06/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-investments-to-protect-the-colorado-river-system/)
taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to protect communities across
the West from drought, now and into the future.  
  
**<u>Biden-Harris Administration’s Whole-of-Government Commitment to
Drought Resilience in the Colorado River Basin and Across the
West</u>**  
  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $8.3 billion over five years
for the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation to support
water infrastructure projects, including water purification and reuse,
water storage and conveyance, desalination, and dam safety.
**Reclamation has already provided more than $2.9 billion to fund 425
Western water projects through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
Inflation Reduction Act.** Such projects include:

-   $825 million to 131 aging infrastructure projects. In 2023 alone,
    Reclamation announced [$585 million for 83 projects in 11
    states](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-585-million-bipartisan-infrastructure-law),
    including $22 million for repairs to the Friant Kern canal and $8.24
    million for repair and replacement projects at the Imperial Dam All
    American Canal Desilting Basin. Reclamation will announce a third
    round of investments to repair and replace aging infrastructure
    later this spring.  
-   $362 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for eight water
    storage and conveyance projects, including [$187 million for three
    water storage projects in
    California](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/Sep-23/DWR-Awards-187-Million-to-Improve-Sustainable-Groundwater-Use-and-Storage-Statewide)
    and [$160 million for the Arkansas Valley Conduit in
    Colorado](https://www.usbr.gov/gp/ecao/avc/). The projects will
    enhance water supply reliability and climate resiliency. In April
    2023, Reclamation and partners celebrated the start of construction
    on the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a project that has been more than 60
    years in the making. Reclamation will announce additional
    allocations in the coming months.  
-   Six funding opportunities—currently open for application—with
    approximately $230 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    available for [large scale recycling
    projects](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-launches-new-large-scale-water-recycling-program-180),
    [desalination
    construction](https://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/title/desalination.html),
    [Title XVI](https://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/title/titlexvi.html),
    [cooperative watershed
    management](https://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/cwmp/index.html), and
    [planning and project
    design](https://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/projectdesign/index.html).  
-   $763 million to seven rural water projects across the West. Last
    fall, Reclamation announced [$65 million for six rural water
    projects already under
    construction](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-65-million-rural-water-funding-presidents)
    or in planning in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota
    and South Dakota. The projects will bring clean, reliable drinking
    water to rural communities.  
-   Up to [$50 million available in
    2024](https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/news-release/4677) through the
    WaterSMART Program from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for water
    and energy efficiency projects aimed at enhancing the resilience of
    western states to impacts of drought and climate change.  
-   $83 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure and annual
    appropriations to the Gila River Community’s [Reclaimed Water
    Pipeline
    Project](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-233-million-water-conservation-funding-gila),
    which will expand water reuse and conservation. When completed, the
    project will provide up to 20,000 acre-feet annually for Colorado
    River System conservation with a minimum of 78,000 acre-feet
    committed to remain Lake Mead.  
-   Up to [$5.6 million for the Gila River Indian Community
    Solar-Over-Casa Blanca Canal
    Project](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-6-million-innovative-solar-panel)
    to construct canal-spanning solar panels over the Casa Blanca Canal
    within the Gila River Indian Reservation. The project will cover
    2,782 feet of canal with approximately 2,556 solar panels. It is
    expected to conserve an estimated 201 acre-feet of water and produce
    2,258 MWh of power annually over the panels’ 25-year life cycle.
    Reclamation will announce funding to additional solar-over-canal
    projects across the West in the near future.

**The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has invested in the West to
increase water availability, increase resilience, and reduce water
use**, including in the Colorado River Basin:

-   [Funded $92 million Environmental Infrastructure
    projects](https://usace.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getfile/collection/p16021coll6/id/2249)
    in the seven Colorado River Basin states through the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. These projects include reclaimed water
    pipelines, brackish groundwater desalination facilities, and repairs
    of existing infrastructure.   
-   [Increasing groundwater recharge projects throughout the
    West](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/2746875/new-trial-for-using-advanced-weather-forecasts-to-retain-more-water-proves-succ/).
    Through Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations, USACE has been
    leading a multi-agency research and development initiative that is
    focused on aquifer recharge throughout the West. Preliminary results
    in Orange County, California indicate that an average increase of
    7,000 acre-feet of water per year may be available for recharging
    local underground aquifers. USACE is in the process of completing
    assessments on 85 sites in the West.  
-   Increasing ecosystem resilience within the Colorado River Basin and
    connected watersheds. USACE has [invested $1.5
    million](https://www.spl.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Releases/Article/2906718/corps-la-district-to-receive-funding-for-several-projects-under-infrastructure/)
    of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for [evaluating restoration
    solutions in the Salton
    Sea](https://www.spl.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Projects-Studies/Imperial-Streams-Salton-Sea/).

**The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has invested billions of
dollars in projects that aim to conserve, reuse, and enhance water
resources in the West.** This support includes:

-   USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) announced the
    [Western Water and Working Lands Framework for Conservation Action
    (Western Water
    Framework)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/water/western-water-and-working-lands-framework-for). The
    Western Water Framework provides a roadmap for how NRCS assistance
    can be used to conserve and enhance water resources in 17 Western
    States and helps producers and communities conserve water, address
    climate change, and build drought resilience through voluntary
    programs and science-based solutions. This work includes leveraging
    the funding available from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
    Inflation Reduction Act.  
-   [Nearly $1.1 billion in Regional Conservation Partnership Program
    Projects
    (RCPP)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/news/fact-sheet-usda-streamlines-regional-conservation-partnership-program-invests-unprecedented),
    leveraging both Farm Bill and Inflation Reduction Act funds.  The
    Colorado River Basin is one of eight Critical Conservation Areas
    (CCA) designated by the Secretary for drought and water
    conservation. RCPP funded projects included over $60 million in the
    Colorado River Basin CCA and another $67 million in the Western
    Waters CCA.

**The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has leveraged more than $9
billion in the last two years alone to communities across the West and
in particular to the Colorado River Basin states.** This support
includes EPA’s (SRFs) [EPA’s State Revolving Funds
(SRFs)](https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf), [Water Infrastructure Finance and
Innovation Act (WIFIA) program](https://www.epa.gov/wifia), and other
grants to provide drought relief, water supply diversification, and
other infrastructure improvements to communities:

-   More than [$2.5 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
    annual funding to the SRFs provided to the seven Colorado River
    Basin
    states](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-2-billion-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funding)
    for a range of infrastructure needs, including aquifer storage and
    recovery, water reuse, green infrastructure, flood diversion and
    storage, water loss audits, meter replacement, groundwater
    replenishment, and nature-based solutions. Over time, these
    activities will reduce withdrawals from the Colorado River and other
    rivers in the region.  
-   Leveraged approximately $7 billion, for 24 projects, from EPA’s
    [WIFIA program](https://www.epa.gov/wifia) to support Colorado River
    Basin drought initiatives. These projects include efforts to recycle
    wastewater, increase water storage, install water meters, and
    prevent saltwater intrusion in aquifers. EPA is reviewing
    applications to support another dozen drought-related initiatives
    totaling billions of dollars.  
-   [$19 million in grant funding to address natural hazards, like
    drought, in underserved and small or disadvantaged
    communities](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-launches-new-19-million-grant-program-improve-climate).
    In September 2023, EPA announced $19 million in new grant funding
    that will work to improve the climate resilience of the nation’s
    water infrastructure. EPA’s [Drinking Water System Infrastructure
    Resilience and Sustainability Grant
    Program](https://www.epa.gov/dwcapacity/grant-overview-drinking-water-system-infrastructure-resilience-and-sustainability)
    will support drinking water systems in underserved, small, and
    disadvantaged communities that are working to prepare for and reduce
    vulnerability to impacts from climate change, ranging from extreme
    drought to extreme flooding.  
-   Convened EPA leadership and state environmental secretaries to
    identify strategies to expand the SRF drought mitigation project
    pipeline. In May 2023, EPA convened a dialogue with key state
    funding partners and the environmental and infrastructure
    secretaries from the seven Colorado River Basin states to discuss
    strategies to maximize long-term withdrawal reductions using
    SRF-eligible projects, and opportunities to build the pipeline of
    drought mitigation projects on states’ Intended Use Plans.
