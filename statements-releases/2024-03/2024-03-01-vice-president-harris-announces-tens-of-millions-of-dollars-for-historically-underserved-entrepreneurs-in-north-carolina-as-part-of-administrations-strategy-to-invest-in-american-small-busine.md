  \ to Invest in American Small\_Businesses"

*Vice President to announce American Rescue Plan-funded awards to ten
firms in Durham’s Historic Black Wall Street to help historically
underserved entrepreneurs launch and scale their businesses*

  
To close out the Biden-Harris Administration’s fourth Investing in
America tour, Vice President Harris and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury
Wally Adeyemo will join Governor Roy Cooper to announce $32 million
awarded through the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to
women- and minority-led venture capital funds to support historically
underserved small businesses and entrepreneurs. The investment will
catalyze an additional $60 million in private investment, totaling more
than $90 million to primarily support and scale women- and
minority-owned businesses in the state. This is part of an
Administration effort to ensure that not just loans, but also equity
capital investments are available across all of America to entrepreneurs
– including Black-, Hispanic-, veteran- and women-led businesses, as
well as those in rural areas – that have typically been shut out of
these opportunities. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’
leadership, we have seen the three strongest years in history for new
small business applications, and Black business ownership has grown at
the fastest pace in 30 years.  
  
**Today’s announcement is part of American Rescue Plan funding that is
leveraging over $30 billion in equity-based financing for small
businesses.** Forty-six states and territories are committing nearly $3
billion from the Treasury Department’s SSBCI to equity-based financing
programs, including over $1.4 billion through partnerships with private
venture capital funds – the single largest infusion of federal funding
for equity participation in early-stage small businesses in history.
These investments are expected to catalyze over $30 billion in
additional private investment and follow-on funding over the decade that
will help underserved entrepreneurs tap into a critical source of
capital for business development and wealth creation that has
traditionally suffered from some of the most restrictive barriers to
access.  
  
**Today, Vice President Harris is announcing awards to ten minority and
women-led venture capital firms in North Carolina that will direct more
than $90 million to early-stage small businesses in the state.** Today’s
awardees have committed to raising and investing at least an additional
$60 million alongside the $32 million from the American Rescue Plan, for
a total of more than $90 million directed to promising early-stage small
businesses in the state. North Carolina has selected ten women- and
minority led [venture capital
firms](https://www.ncruralcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC-Invest-Event-Investor-Info-Sheet-030124v3.pdf)
with a focus on supporting underserved founders including:

-   **Nex Cubed**, which has a Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCU) Founders Fund that helps to launch and scale
    entrepreneurial endeavors led by alumni, students, and faculty from
    HBCUs. Nex Cubed makes an initial investment of $120,000 in each
    selected start-up and provides dedicated executive-level support
    from a paid advisor.
-   **RevTech Labs**, a majority female and Latina owned
    entrepreneurship center, accelerator, and venture fund that
    prioritizes supporting and elevating traditionally underrepresented
    founders in financial, health, and insurance technologies. RevTech
    will invest in over 200 early-stage companies and provides support
    as an accelerator, with 350 mentors and subject matter experts
    available to support success.
-   **LaVert Ventures**, a woman-owned AgTech fund that focuses on
    investing in precision agriculture, crop protection, and indoor
    agriculture, ensuring that venture capital supports strong and
    equitable growth in rural America. These technologies will help to
    address the food production demands and environmental pressures that
    are set to increase in the coming decades.
-   **Latimer Ventures** is an early-stage venture capital fund that
    seeks to help Enterprise Founders build great companies and Fortune
    1000 Companies make diverse acquisitions. Latimer is focused on
    deploying its investment model to build the next generation of Black
    and Hispanic enterprise software companies.

Venture funding has been concentrated in just a few parts of the
country, with 70% of venture capital investment over the past decade
going to just three states – California, New York, and Massachusetts.
Venture investors have also struggled to reach a diverse set of
entrepreneurs. Black-founded companies have typically received less than
1% of venture capital funding annually, while women-only-founded
businesses receive just about 2%. The investments announced today
support those historically excluded from these types of capital and
reflect President Biden and Vice President Harris’ commitment to invest
in all of America by helping underserved entrepreneurs launch and scale
businesses in the communities in which they live.  
  
Today’s announcement is just one more way the Biden-Harris
Administration is delivering for small businesses as part of the
President and Vice President’s historic nearly $10 billion SSBCI, which
alone could leverage up to $100 billion in private financing for 100,000
small businesses over the next decade. Through an expansion that Vice
President Harris fought for as a Senator, the Biden-Harris
Administration delivered another $12 billion in funding to Community
Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Deposit
Institutions to expand access to capital to small businesses and
consumers including through the Emergency Capital Investment Program
(ECIP), the CDFI Rapid Response Program, and the CDFI Equitable Recovery
Program.  
  
Thanks to the historically strong and equitable recovery and investing
in America strategy that the President and Vice President have led,
we’ve seen a record 16 million new business applications in just three
years thanks to this historic recovery and support through the American
Rescue Plan. Small business growth has been particularly strong among
Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs, with Black business ownership doubling
and Hispanic business ownership up 40% since 2019. Black and Hispanic
families real median wealth have risen to all-time highs during the
Biden-Harris Administration. The President and Vice President have made
historic investments in access to capital a lynchpin of their Investing
in America strategy and have taken critical action to ensure small
businesses in traditionally underserved communities can access the
resources they need to scale and grow their businesses, including
quickly reversing policies under the previous administration that locked
less-well-connected small businesses out of needed pandemic supports.  
  
**Today’s actions also build on historic investment steps the
Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to support small
businesses, particularly those who are seeking equity and financing
investments:**

-   **Reversing the previous Administration’s policies and made small
    business supports more equitable.** When the last Administration
    gave out pandemic aid to small businesses, they designed it to favor
    the well-off and the well-connected who had concierge service with
    big banks, while underserved entrepreneurs like women-, veteran-,
    and minority-owned small businesses were put at the back of the line
    or even out the door. Just one month into office, the Biden-Harris
    Administration changed that, instituting a 14-day period during
    which only businesses with fewer than 20 employees could apply for
    relief.   Research shows these
    reforms [helped](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/11/fact-sheet-new-data-show-progress-on-biden-harris-commitment-to-equity-in-emergency-small-business-relief/) increase
    loans to small businesses in low to moderate income communities by
    62 percent and expanded lending to the smallest businesses by 35
    percent. About two-thirds of Restaurant Revitalization Funds went to
    restaurants and bars owned by women, veterans, and other
    traditionally underserved individuals.
-   **Delivering historic support to minority-supporting community
    financial institutions to improve access to capital for historically
    underserved small businesses: **Stemming from funding Vice President
    Harris secured during her time in the Senate,  Treasury has awarded
    over $1.7 billion in grants to more than 600 CDFIs across the
    country through the competitive CDFI Equitable Recovery Program,
    approximately $1.25 billion in grants through the CDFI Rapid
    Response Program and another $9 billion in low-cost investments to
    CDFIs and Minority Deposit Institutions through the Emergency
    Capital Investment Program (ECIP). This includes over $730 million
    in ECIP investments in six CDFIs and MDIs headquartered in North
    Carolina. Based on preliminary analysis, Treasury projects that
    investments across the entire ECIP portfolio may increase lending in
    Hispanic communities by nearly $58 billion and in Black communities
    by up to $80 billion over the next decade.
-   **Vice President Harris has led Administration efforts to help drive
    greater levels of private and philanthropic investments in
    underserved communities, financial institutions, and businesses,
    including increasing their role in domestic supply chains:** Vice
    President Harris helped to launch the Economic Opportunity Coalition
    (EOC), a coalition of private sector companies and foundations
    working to make historic investments in underserved communities,
    that has already surpassed over $1 billion in increased member
    company deposits into underserved community finance institutions.
    The Vice President has also called on companies in Investing in
    America sectors—semiconductor manufacturing, clean energy
    manufacturing, transportation, heavy industry, and
    biomanufacturing—to strengthen and diversify domestic supply chains
    by committing at least 15% of their U.S.-based contract spending on
    outside goods and services from small and underserved businesses by
    2025.
-   **Small Business Administration-backed investment funds are
    providing equity investment to thousands of businesses.** The Small
    Business Administration’s (SBA) Small Business Investment Company
    (SBIC) program licenses privately managed investment funds to make
    debt and equity investments in small businesses using SBA-guaranteed
    funds. In just the last year alone, SBICs have created or sustained
    more than 130,000 net new jobs and delivered over $8 billion in
    financing to small businesses, building on major investments the
    Biden-Harris Administration has made to support small businesses,
    spur record job growth and create high quality jobs in critical
    industries of the future. This past year, financing to women-owned,
    minority-owned, and veteran-owned small businesses from the SBIC
    program totaled nearly $670 million, over a 25% increase from the
    year prior. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the number of
    jobs supported by underserved small businesses financed by SBICs
    increased by 75% to 35,0000 between FY2020 and FY2023.
-   **SBA set records in increased lending to underserved small
    businesses**. SBA made critical reforms to its loan programs in 2023
    that supported significant progress in addressing barriers to
    capital facing small business owners. In FY 2023, SBA made record
    gains in lending to Black, Latino, Native, AAPI, women, and veteran
    entrepreneurs – including $1.5 billion in loans to Black-owned and
    $3 billion to Latino-owned businesses. Total loans and total loan
    dollars to Black-owned businesses more than doubled under the
    Biden-Harris Administration, and total loans to Latino-owned
    businesses doubled with total loan dollars increasing by over 80%.

-   **Investing in programs to help innovative startups take on equity
    investment –** providing capital, technical assistance, and
    connections for small businesses to make them equity-ready:
    -   **The Minority Business Development Agency’s (MBDA) Capital
        Readiness Program is investing in small business incubators and
        accelerators.** Last year, Vice President Harris announced that
        the MBDA’s Capital Readiness Program awarded $125 million to[ 43
        non-profit community-based
        organizations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/04/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-to-announce-support-to-help-historically-underserved-entrepreneurs-tap-into-bidenomics-fueled-small-business-boom/) to
        help underserved entrepreneurs launch and scale their small
        businesses, including by preparing them to seek equity capital
        and connect to venture capital opportunities. This American
        Rescue Plan-funded program is the largest-ever direct federal
        investment in small business incubators and accelerators of its
        kind.
    -   **Investing federal research and development funds in innovative
        small businesses.** The Small Business Innovation Research
        (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
        programs fund small businesses to develop and commercialize
        innovations that meet federal research and development (R&D)
        needs. In FY2022, the 11 federal agencies that participate in
        these programs obligated $4.7 billion to small businesses and
        innovative startups, a 17% increase from FY2020. In FY 2022,
        SBIR/STTR contract and grant awards provided nearly 34 percent
        of its awards to women-owned, minority-owned, veteran-owned, and
        rural small businesses.
    -   **Preparing small businesses for SBIR and STTR opportunities.**
        The Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program is
        designed to provide critical and direct assistance to
        underserved innovation-based entrepreneurs, with the goal of
        increasing their success in obtaining SBIR and STTR funding.
        Today, SBA has FAST resource partners in 43 states and 1
        territory. In FY2023, the SBA counseled over 16,900 innovative
        startups through the FAST program, a 19% increase from FY2020.
    -   **Expanding Regional Innovation Clusters.** Regional Innovation
        Clusters (RICs) are geographically concentrated groups of
        interconnected businesses, suppliers, service providers, and
        associated institutions in a particular industry or field across
        the United States that deliver support directly to technology
        and high-growth small businesses. In October 2023, the Biden
        Administration announced the awards of new RICs contracts,
        expanding the program’s reach to 9 of the 10 SBA regions.
    -   **Injecting funding into accelerators and incubators.** The
        Growth Accelerator Fund Competition (GAFC) stimulates innovation
        and entrepreneurship by infusing accelerators and incubators
        with $50,000 to $200,000 in prize awards across two stages. The
        competition seeks strengthen the nation’s innovation ecosystem
        and build local partnerships among accelerators, incubators,
        co-working communities, makerspaces, and other organizations
        that provide support, mentorship, and commercialization
        assistance to STEM/R&D entrepreneurs. In FY2022, the Biden
        Administration announced that SBA expanded the number of small
        businesses in GAFC Cohorts to 6,400, a 17% increase over FY2020.
-   **SBA expanded its lending program focused on underserved
    communities for the first time in 40 years**. Last fall, the
    SBA [issued new
    licenses](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/11/01/biden-harris-administration-takes-historic-step-expanding-access-capital-filling-lending-gaps) to
    lenders in the Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) program [for
    the first time in 40
    years](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/11/01/biden-harris-administration-takes-historic-step-expanding-access-capital-filling-lending-gaps).
    The lenders in this program have a track record of strong lending to
    traditionally underserved communities, as do the three new licenses
    lenders brought into the program last year. Arkansas Capital
    Corporation is a community development financial institution (CDFI)
    serving Arkansas and the bordering states, and since 2019 has
    delivered more than half of their lending to counties with at least
    a 20% poverty rate for over 30 years. Alaska Growth Capital is a
    certified Native CDFI with more than 60% of activities dedicated to
    serving Alaska Native, Native American, and Native Hawaiian
    businesses and communities. Funding Circle is an online lending
    platform that has seen 33% of current loans going to small
    businesses in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods and 40% going to
    small businesses in rural areas**.**
