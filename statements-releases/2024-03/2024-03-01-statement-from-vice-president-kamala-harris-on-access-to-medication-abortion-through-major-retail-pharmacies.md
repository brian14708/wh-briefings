title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Access to Medication Abortion\
  \ Through Major Retail\_Pharmacies"
---
 
Today, two major retail pharmacy chains announced they are certified to
dispense mifepristone, a medication that has been proven safe and
effective for over two decades. Many women in America will soon have the
choice to pick up their prescription at a local pharmacy. This is an
important step to ensure women have access to the health care they
need.  
  
The President and I stand with the majority of Americans who believe
women should have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and
their own lives. We remain committed to defending access to reproductive
health care, including medication abortion. Our Administration will not
waver in our dedication to preserving access to essential medication and
defending the FDA’s independent, evidence-based approval and regulation
of safe and effective drugs.
