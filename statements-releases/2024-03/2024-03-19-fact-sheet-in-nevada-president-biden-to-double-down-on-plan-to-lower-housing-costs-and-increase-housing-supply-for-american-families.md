title: "FACT SHEET: In Nevada, President\_Biden to Double Down on Plan to Lower Housing\
  \ Costs and Increase Housing Supply for American\_Families"
---
 
*President Biden’s American Rescue Plan has already invested $1 billion
in Nevada to deliver affordable housing and housing assistance*

President Biden is working to lower housing costs and increase the
housing supply to address the large shortage of affordable homes
inherited from his predecessor. In President Biden’s State of the Union
address, he called on Congress to support the construction and
rehabilitation of two million additional homes, lower costs for renters,
and help first time homebuyers and families seeking to trade up or
downsize.

Today in Las Vegas, Nevada, President Biden will detail his agenda to
bring down the cost of housing. He will discuss the investments the
Biden-Harris Administration has already made through the American Rescue
Plan (ARP). The ARP provided $1 billion in Nevada to help boost
affordable housing, lower housing costs, and keep homeowners and renters
in their homes. This includes $700 million invested in affordable
housing supply that includes major investments in senior housing. As a
result, Clark County has several major 200-unit affordable housing
developments coming, and about 1,000 new senior apartments on the way
thanks to the ARP.

The President’s Fiscal Year 2025
[Budget](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=15f6719aa4&e=26006ec432)
includes a historic $258 billion in housing investments to give working
families a fair shot, including an historic expansion in rental
assistance for low-income families, while reducing the deficit by asking
corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share. These new
proposals build on his [Housing Supply Action
Plan](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=e94fd3af4f&e=26006ec432),
major investments provided by the
[ARP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/), and actions the
Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to increase the housing
supply and lower housing costs for American families, including reducing
mortgage insurance premiums by $800 per year for hundreds of thousands
of homeowners, expanding rental assistance to more than 100,000
additional households, and building tens of thousands of affordable
housing units. These actions have contributed to a record high of nearly
1.7 million homes currently under construction nationwide.

[**President Biden’s Plan to Lower Housing Costs and Build Two Million
Homes**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-cuts-housing-costs-boosts-supply-and-expands-access-to-affordable-housing/)

*<u>Reduce Barriers to Homeownership  
</u>*For many Americans, owning a home is the cornerstone of raising a
family, building wealth, and joining the middle class. Too many working
families feel locked out of homeownership and are unable to compete with
investors for a limited supply of affordable for-sale homes. President
Biden is calling on Congress to enact legislation to enable more
Americans to purchase a home, including:

-   **Mortgage Relief Credit. **President Biden is calling on Congress
    to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide middle-class
    first-time homebuyers with a tax credit of $10,000 over two years.
    This is the equivalent of reducing the mortgage rate by more than
    1.5 percentage points for two years on the median home, saving
    families $400 per month on their mortgage payments. It will help
    more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase their first
    home over the next two years. The President’s plan also calls for a
    new credit to unlock inventory of affordable starter homes, while
    helping middle-class families move up the housing ladder and empty
    nesters right size. The President is calling on Congress to provide
    a one-year tax credit of up to $10,000 to middle-class families who
    sell their starter home, defined as homes below the area median home
    price in the county, to another owner-occupant. This proposal is
    estimated to help nearly 3 million families.
-   **Down Payment Assistance for First-Generation Homeowners. **The
    President continues to call on Congress to provide up to $25,000 in
    down payment assistance to first-generation homebuyers whose
    families haven’t benefited from the generational wealth building
    associated with homeownership. This proposal would help about
    400,000 families purchase their first home.

<!-- -->

-   **Lowering Closing Costs.** The Federal Housing Finance Agency has
    approved policies and pilots to reduce closing costs for homeowners,
    including a pilot to waive the requirement for lender’s title
    insurance on certain refinances. This would save thousands of
    homeowners up to $1500, and an average of $750, and the lower
    upfront fees will unlock substantial savings for homeowners as
    mortgage rates continue to fall and more homeowners are able to
    refinance. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will also pursue
    rulemaking and guidance to address anticompetitive closing costs
    imposed by lenders on homebuyers and homeowners.  These
    charges—which benefit the lender but not the borrower—can add
    thousands to the upfront costs of a mortgage.  **
-   **Promoting Competition in the Housing Market.** In his State of the
    Union Address, the President discussed the importance of boosting
    competition and lowering housing costs, and the Department of
    Justice has made those goals a priority. Last week’s settlement
    reached by the National Association of Realtors is an important step
    toward boosting competition in the housing market. It could save as
    much as $10,000 on the median home sale. Now, the Administration is
    calling on realtors and lenders to offer more choices and lower
    costs, while promoting access to homeownership for first-time,
    low-income, and low-wealth homebuyers.

*<u>Lowering Costs by Building and Preserving 2 Million Homes</u>*  
America needs to build more housing in order to lower rental costs and
increase access to homeownership. That’s why the President is calling on
Congress to pass legislation to build and renovate more than [2 million
homes](https://www.novoco.com/notes-from-novogradac/biden-harris-administrations-proposed-2025-budget-to-include-several-housing-proposals-that-combined-could-finance-as-many-as-2-million-affordable-homes),
which would close the housing supply gap and lower housing costs for
renters and homeowners.

-   **Tax Credits to Build More Housing. **President Biden is calling
    for an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to build or
    preserve 1.2 million more affordable rental units. Renters living in
    these properties save hundreds of dollars each month on their rent
    compared with renters with similar incomes who rent in the
    unsubsidized market. The President is also calling for a new
    Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, the first tax provision to build or
    renovate affordable homes for homeownership, which would lead to the
    construction or preservation of over 400,000 starter homes in
    communities throughout the country.
-   **Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion.** The President is
    unveiling a new $20 billion competitive grant fund as part of his
    proposed Budget to support communities across the country to build
    more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. This fund would
    support the construction of affordable multifamily rental units;
    incentivize local actions to remove unnecessary barriers to housing
    development; pilot innovative models to increase the production of
    affordable and workforce rental housing; and spur the construction
    of new starter homes for middle-class families. According to
    independent analysis, this will create hundreds of thousands of
    units which will help lower rents and housing costs.
-   **Increasing Banks’ Contributions Towards Building Affordable
    Housing. **The President is proposing that each Federal Home Loan
    Bank double its annual contribution to the Affordable Housing
    Program – from 10 percent of prior year net income to 20 percent –
    which will raise an additional $3.79 billion for affordable housing
    over the next decade and assist nearly 380,000 households. These
    funds would support the financing, acquisition, construction, and
    rehabilitation of affordable rental and for-sale homes, as well as
    help low- and moderate-income homeowners to purchase or rehabilitate
    homes.
-   **Bolstering Efforts to Prevent and End Homelessness**. The
    President is calling for $8 billion for a new grant program to
    rapidly expand temporary and permanent housing strategies for people
    experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Funds from this proposal
    would support non-congregate emergency shelter solutions, interim
    housing, rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, and rental
    housing for extremely low-income households experiencing housing
    instability or homelessness. 

*<u>Lowering Costs for Renters</u>*  
President Biden is also taking actions to lower costs and promote
housing stability for renters. The White House [Blueprint for a Renters
Bill of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights.pdf) lays
out the key principles of a fair rental market and has already catalyzed
new federal actions to make those principles a reality. Today, President
Biden is announcing new steps to crack down on unfair practices that are
driving up rental costs:

-   **Fighting Rent Gouging by Corporate Landlords**. The Biden-Harris
    Administration is taking action to combat egregious rent increases
    and other unfair practices that are driving up rents. Corporate
    landlords and private equity firms across the country have been
    accused of illegal information sharing, price fixing, and inflating
    rents. As part of the President’s Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal
    Pricing, he is calling on federal agencies to root out and stop
    illegal corporate behavior that hikes prices on American families
    through anti-competitive, unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent business
    practices. In [a recent
    filing](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/418053a.pdf), the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) made clear its position that inflated
    rents caused by algorithmic use of sensitive nonpublic pricing and
    supply information violate antitrust laws. Earlier this month, the
    Federal Trade Commission and DOJ [filed a joint
    brief](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/03/price-fixing-algorithm-still-price-fixing) further
    arguing that it is illegal for landlords and property managers to
    collude on pricing to inflate rents – including when using
    algorithms to do so.
-   **Cracking Down on Rental Junk Fees**. Millions of families incur
    burdensome costs in the rental application process and throughout
    the duration of their lease, from “convenience fees” simply to pay
    rent online to fees charged to sort mail or collect trash. These
    fees are often more than the actual cost of providing the service,
    or are added onto rents to cover services that renters assume are
    included—or that they don’t even want. Last fall, the FTC proposed a
    rule that if finalized as proposed would ban misleading and hidden
    fees across the economy, including in housing rental agreements. HUD
    has released
    a [summary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-boost-housing-supply-and-lower-housing-costs/) of
    banned non-rent fees within their rental assistance programs. These
    actions build on
    voluntary [commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-on-junk-fees-in-rental-housing-to-lower-costs-for-renters/) the
    President announced last summer from major rental housing platforms
    to provide customers with the total, upfront cost on rental
    properties on their platform.
-   **Expanding Housing Choice Vouchers**. Over the last three years,
    the Administration has secured rental assistance for more than
    100,000 additional households. The President is calling on Congress
    to further expand rental assistance to more than half of a million
    households, including by providing a voucher guarantee for
    low-income veterans and youth aging out of foster care – the first
    such voucher guarantees in history. Receiving a voucher would save
    these households hundreds of dollars in rent each month.

**The ARP Provides $1 Billion to Boost Housing Supply and Provide
Housing Help in Nevada:**

-   *<u>Nevada is a national leader in investing ARP funding in
    affordable housing:</u>* In Nevada, the ARP has provided over $1
    billion for housing investments, including helping to fund the
    construction of thousands of new units in Clark County, making them
    one of the national leaders in using this money to expand supply of
    affordable housing.
-   *<u>Investing in Down-Payment Assistance to help Nevadans buy
    homes:</u>* The state also used ARP funds to provide 500 Nevadans
    with $15,000 in down-payment assistance to purchase a home. 
-   *<u>Nevada State and local governments have used</u>* *<u>$700
    million through the ARP to support major affordable housing
    projects.</u>*
-   *<u>About 1,000 ARP-supported Senior Affordable Apartments on the
    way in Clark County today</u>*, including, for example:
    -   195 Units of affordable housing at Pebble and Eastern Senior
        Apartments in Clark County currently under construction.
    -   125 Units of affordable housing at Nevada HAND’s Buffalo and
        Cactus Senior Apartments in Clark County currently under
        construction.

**The ARP Has Invested Billions of Dollars to Support Affordable
Housing:**

-   Through the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, over 940 state and
    local governments have invested more than $18 billion for housing
    assistance, homelessness, and affordable housing initiatives,
    including over $6 billion to build and preserve housing.
-   State and local governments are using an additional $5 billion in
    funding through the ARP’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program to
    build or rehabilitate at least 20,000 units of affordable housing
    and support an additional 23,000 households with rental assistance,
    non-congregate shelter, or supportive services. 
-   New data released today shows that since the ARP’s passage, states,
    Tribal governments, and territories have distributed $6.6 billion
    HAF award funds to over 500,000 homeowners for past due mortgage
    payments, utility expenses, and property taxes, as well as other
    housing related expenses. As a result of this program and the strong
    economic recovery, foreclosure starts are well below pre-pandemic
    levels.
