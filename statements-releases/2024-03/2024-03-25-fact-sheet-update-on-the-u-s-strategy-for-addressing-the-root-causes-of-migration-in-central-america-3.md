title: "FACT SHEET: Update on the U.S. Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of\
  \ Migration in Central\_America"
---
 
*March 2024*

Vice President Harris continues to lead the implementation of the [Root
Causes
Strategy,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Root-Causes-Strategy.pdf)
which tackles the drivers of irregular migration by improving conditions
in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras so people do not feel compelled
to leave their homes.  This includes addressing economic, governance,
and security challenges through five pillars: 1) Addressing economic
insecurity and inequality; 2) Combating corruption and strengthening
democratic governance; 3) Promoting human rights and labor rights; 4)
Countering and preventing violence; and 5) Combating sexual and
gender-based violence.  These efforts provide hope and opportunity to
the people of Central America, affirming that a secure and prosperous
future lies in their home communities.  

The Administration is on track to meet its commitment in the 2021 Root
Causes Strategy to provide $4 billion to the region over four years. 
Through new and ongoing programming, the Strategy is having far-reaching
impacts throughout the region. 

Highlights of Biden-Harris Administration initiatives include:

-   **Creating Opportunities:**  U.S. government support for as many as
    23,000 private sector firms in northern Central America has helped
    create and sustain up to an estimated 250,000 jobs.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Education:**  The U.S. government has reached as many
    as 3 million youth through support for primary and secondary
    education in areas of high out-migration in El Salvador, Guatemala,
    and Honduras.

<!-- -->

-   **Investing in Entrepreneurs to Create Jobs:**  Since July 2021, the
    U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has
    invested over $325 million in 19 projects in Guatemala, El Salvador,
    and Honduras across sectors, including financial inclusion,
    healthcare, climate finance, and affordable housing.  This includes
    a $45 million loan to a financial institution to increase lending to
    small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a focus on women and
    rural borrowers; an $80 million loan to financial institutions to
    expand financing for SMEs, particularly for women entrepreneurs in
    Honduras; a $60 million loan to a financial institution in El
    Salvador to increase lending to small businesses and expand its
    climate finance portfolio; and a $7.5 million equity investment in a
    fund that will provide growth capital to sustainable agribusiness,
    digital connectivity, and health businesses, with an emphasis on
    women-owned and managed businesses in Guatemala, El Salvador, and
    Honduras.

<!-- -->

-   **Enhancing Food Security, Agricultural Productivity, and
    Finance: ** Through USAID’s Feed the Future programs, an estimated
    63,000 farmers in Guatemala and Honduras utilized innovative
    technologies intended to increase production and income on more than
    75,000 acres of farmland. The U.S. government helped unlock more
    than $57 million in private sector agricultural finance. This helps
    create greater income security and resilience to environmental and
    economic shocks. 

<!-- -->

-   **Ensuring Labor Rights:**  Since 2021, 11 Department of Labor
    projects totaling $76 million supported labor capacity-building and
    training programs across El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. These
    projects increased the capacity of approximately 2,800 labor rights
    actors, including government officials, employers, workers, and
    civil society, and provided training on the topics of child labor,
    forced labor, collective bargaining, safety and health, and other
    labor rights. 

<!-- -->

-   **Combating Migrant Smuggling and Human Trafficking:**  Since Vice
    President Harris announced Joint Task Force Alpha, led by the
    Department of Justice, in June 2021, interagency efforts have led to
    over 220 U.S. convictions of members of human trafficking
    organizations; more than 275 arrests, including against leaders,
    organizers, and significant facilitators; more than 150 U.S.
    defendants sentenced, including significant jail sentences imposed;
    substantial seizures and forfeiture of assets and contraband
    including hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, real property,
    vehicles, firearms and ammunition, and drugs; multiple indictments
    and successful extradition requests against foreign leadership
    targets; as well as myriad indictments, arrests, and convictions in
    El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to make progress
on new and existing initiatives across all five pillars of the Root
Causes Strategy.

**<u>Pillar I: Addressing economic insecurity and inequality.</u>**

-   **Investing in Entrepreneurs in the Region: ** DFC will provide an
    equity investment of up to $2.5 million in a $10 million venture
    capital fund investing in early-stage technology entrepreneurs that
    provide solutions to underserved populations and to micro and small
    businesses in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  Additionally,
    DFC will provide an additional equity investment of up to $4 million
    to a woman-led $20 million venture capital fund investing across the
    Western Hemisphere, including Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.

-   **Launching a Textiles and Apparel Supply Chain Directory:  **The
    Office of theU.S. Trade Representative and Central American Trade
    Agencies and textiles and apparel industry stakeholders will work
    together under the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade
    Agreement (CAFTA-DR), with support from the Inter-American
    Development Bank, to build a directory with detailed profiles of
    manufacturing and sourcing companies in the region, including
    information on business practices and production capabilities, to
    facilitate transparent sourcing, and bolster the region’s supply
    chain.  This will support inclusive trade to strengthen the
    U.S.-Central America supply chain, promote resiliency and
    nearshoring, and bolster labor and environment standards in the
    region’s textiles and apparel sector. 

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthening Food Security**:  The Department of State will
    launch two $6 million soil mapping projects through the UN Food and
    Agriculture Organization in Guatemala and Honduras to boost efforts
    to address degraded soils by providing on the ground tools for
    farmers to grow crops more efficiently and improve soil health to
    support regional food security and climate resilience.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Repatriated Migrants**:  USAID supported national
    governments to receive and support nearly 150,000 returned migrants
    in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which promotes sustainable
    reintegration of these migrants into their communities, helping to
    reduce repeat migration.  USAID also provided post-arrival
    humanitarian assistance (such as hygiene kits, food, clothing, and
    transportation) to nearly 78,000 returned migrants, and
    reintegration services (such as training, job placement, and
    psychosocial support) for nearly 27,000 returned migrants.

<!-- -->

-   **Empowering Women Entrepreneurs:**  Through the Academy of Women
    Entrepreneurs (AWE) exchange program, the Department of State is
    helping women build sustainable businesses and strengthen the
    entrepreneurship ecosystem across Central America, where there are
    now well over 1350 AWE alumni.  The Department of State also
    supported the establishment of a Women’s Business Resource Center in
    the Western Highlands of Guatemala, reaching more than 550 women
    entrepreneurs with entrepreneurship-support services, including
    information on their legal rights.  The Center provided 3,500+ hours
    of individual business advisory services, daycare services for over
    100 children of women entrepreneurs, and supported the launch of 30
    new businesses. 

<!-- -->

-   **Increasing Access to Quality Education and Vocational Skills:**
     USAID helped more than 3,600 teachers successfully transition from
    pandemic-era remote learning in 2021 to in-person schooling in
    2023.  Since 2021, about 30,000 youth from high out-migration
    municipalities have completed USAID-supported vocational training
    programs that reflect local labor market needs.  More than 12,000
    young people from the program were employed in new jobs after
    completing their vocational training.

**<u>Pillar II: Combating corruption, strengthening democratic
governance, and advancing rule of law.</u>**

-   **Imposing Consequences for Corrupt Actors:**  Since 2021, the U.S.
    Government has promoted accountability through visa restrictions for
    over 1,200 individuals involved in acts of corruption or undermining
    democracy in Central America, rendering them generally ineligible
    for visas to the United States.  In addition, the Department of the
    Treasury has sanctioned 16 individuals and entities in El Salvador
    and Guatemala for their role in, among other things, serious human
    rights abuse and corruption.

<!-- -->

-   **Training Justice Sector and Government Personnel:**  From FY 2021
    to 2023, the Department of State and USAID conducted trainings for
    up to 27,000 justice sector personnel, government officials, and NGO
    staff aimed at strengthening partner governments’ judicial systems
    to more effectively manage accountability systems and processes,
    take action against corrupt acts, and raise awareness of ethical
    standards and legal obligations.

**<u>Pillar III: Promoting respect for human rights, labor rights, and a
free press</u>.**

-   **Organizing a Good Jobs Summit:**  In summer 2024, the Department
    of Labor will organize a Central America Good Jobs Summit to
    reinforce the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to protecting
    labor rights, respect for the rule of law, and economic inclusion
    while creating high quality jobs in the region.  The Summit will
    include worker organizations, private sector participation from
    U.S., multinational, and Central America companies, and civil
    society stakeholders.

<!-- -->

-   **Building Civil Society Capacity for Inclusive Growth: ** For FY
    2024, the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) plans to announce new
    funding of $6 million, matched by grantee co-investment of $5.2
    million, for a total value of $11.2 million.  These funds will
    develop the capacity of organizations to address the drivers of
    migration.  IAF grants in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have
    benefitted more than 800,000 people since FY 2022 via community-led
    initiatives that each focus on multiple drivers of migration by
    creating economic opportunities, improving food security, protecting
    human rights, preventing and recovering from violence, and improving
    government accountability through civic engagement. IAF currently
    supports 107 organizations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
     

<!-- -->

-   **Defending Civil Society:**  Since 2021, Department of State
    assistance helped nearly 500 members of civil society in Central
    America return to work following threats and attacks on them for
    their civic work.  The Department of State also supported over 140
    journalists and more than 25 news outlets from Central America to
    improve investigative reporting on issues of public interest.
     Separately, USAID also supported more than 500 human rights
    defenders to report human rights violations and advocate for their
    protection.

**<u>Pillar IV: Countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other
crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and other
organized criminal organizations</u>.**

-   **Countering Firearms Trafficking:**  In El Salvador, Guatemala, and
    Honduras, the U.S. government has provided $7.5 million to improve
    security and disrupt the diversion and illicit trafficking of small
    arms and light weapons resulting in the destruction of over 17
    metric tons of unserviceable ammunition and over 4,000 small arms
    and light weapons since July 2021.

<!-- -->

-   **Imposing Consequences for Narcotics Trafficking:**  U.S.-supported
    narcotics and asset seizures in Central America remain at historic
    highs.  Since 2021, more than $11 billion in illegal drugs and $472
    million in illegal assets were seized through support from the
    Departments of Justice and State. 

<!-- -->

-   **Training Police:**  Since 2021, the Department of State provided
    professional training for up to 18,000 civilian police across
    Central America.

<!-- -->

-   **Preventing Youth Violence:**  Through USAID support, more than
    90,000 at-risk youth in northern Central America accessed training
    and services, including leadership coaching, psychosocial support,
    conflict management, and employment and livelihoods training.

**<u>Pillar V: Combating sexual, gender-based, and domestic
violence</u>.**

-   **Assisting Victims of Gender-Based Violence:**  With State
    Department support, the Guatemalan Police Department of Victim’s
    Attention significantly expanded its reach by inaugurating 19 new
    Offices of Victims Attention in the Western Highlands, a region home
    to several vulnerable indigenous communities.  This expansion
    already enabled the provision of culturally sensitive services to
    over 1,000 domestic and gender-based violence victims.

<!-- -->

-   **Increasing Awareness of Gender-Based Violence in the Region:**  In
    FY 2023, USAID reached more than 27,000 through programs that help
    prevent or combat gender-based violence in northern Central America.
     USAID supported a multi-media anti-violence campaign in Guatemala
    that reached more than 10 million people through posters, videos,
    and comic books.
