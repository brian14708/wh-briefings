title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Is Taking Action to Lower Costs for Families\
  \ and Fight Corporate\_Rip-Offs"
---
 
President Biden is fighting to lower costs for American consumers—and he
is taking action to address corporate price gouging. Congressional
Republicans have no plan to lower costs for Americans and have instead
proposed giveaways to the wealthy, big corporations, and Big Pharma that
will increase the cost of prescription drugs, utility bills, health
insurance premiums, and student loan payments for millions.

American families went through a lot as prices surged due to supply
chain disruptions during the pandemic and Putin’s energy and food price
shock. The Administration took action to get supply chains back to
normal and inflation has declined by two-thirds from its peak. Wage
growth since pre-pandemic has outpaced inflation, and prices have fallen
over the past year for key household purchases like a gas, milk, eggs,
toys, appliances, car rentals, and airfares over the last year.  
  
But some companies are keeping prices high even though input costs are
falling and supply chains are back to normal. President Biden is calling
on corporations to pass along savings to consumers by bringing prices
down. He is cracking down on corporate rip-offs, including junk fees,
price gouging and shrinking packages to hide price
increases—“shrinkflation.” The Administration has taken on Big Pharma to
lower prescription drug costs and cap insulin at $35 a month, Big Banks
to bring down overdraft fees from $35 to $4, and major airlines to
eliminate family seating fees.  
  
**Lowering Costs for Working Families**

President Biden is taking on corporate price gouging by banning hidden
junk fees and calling on corporations to pass the savings from their
reduced costs onto consumers. Instead of supporting efforts to lower
costs for consumers, Republicans are [defending junk
fees](https://newrepublic.com/article/170818/house-republicans-defend-junk-fees)
and seeking to eliminate and defund federal consumer watchdogs and the
antitrust
[enforcement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/25/fight-is-brewing-congress-over-antitrust-funding/)
agencies.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is protecting consumers by:

-   **Cracking down on unfair pricing.** President Biden is tired of
    seeing corporations rip off consumers, especially when they break
    the law while at the same time keeping prices high. It’s wrong, and
    that’s why the President announced this week the launch of a new
    Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing co-chaired by the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
    This Strike Force, which will also include other agencies, will
    strengthen work to root out and end illegal corporate behavior that
    raises prices for Americans through anti-competitive, unfair,
    deceptive, or fraudulent business practices. The members of the
    Strike Force will focus their collaborative efforts on critical
    sectors including housing, prescription drugs and health care, food
    and grocery, transportation, financial services, and more.  
-   **Saving Americans more than $20 billion annually in junk fees**.
    Americans pay [$90 billion each
    year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/03/05/the-price-isnt-right-how-junk-fees-cost-consumers-and-undermine-competition/#_ftn1)
    in junk fees. These hidden fees are everywhere, making it
    [harder](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/10/26/the-presidents-initiative-on-junk-fees-and-related-pricing-practices/)
    to comparison shop and leading consumers to pay up to [twenty
    percent more](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25186). The President is
    using every tool available to combat these fees. The Administration
    has banned bait-and-switch marketing tactics in the car buying
    process and cut credit card late fees from the current average of
    $32 down to $8. And, the Administration is on track to finalize
    rules to [reduce bank overdraft
    fees](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-close-bank-overdraft-loophole-that-costs-americans-billions-each-year-in-junk-fees/);

    and [ban hidden and misleading fees and require up front pricing
    across the
    economy](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees).
    The President has secured [enforceable
    commitments](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/usdot-unveils-dashboard-highlights-progress-help-parents-avoid-family-seating-junk)
    by the biggest airlines to compensate travelers for preventable
    delays and cancellations. According to the Council of Economic
    Advisers, the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions to date and
    going forward will save consumers more than $20 billion annually.  
-   **Reducing the biggest junk fees in the banking industry by
    two-thirds**. In 2019, the banking industry collected nearly $30
    billion annually in overdraft, bounced check, and credit card late
    fees. Since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
    [announced](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-cfpb-director-rohit-chopra-overdraft-press-call/)
    increased scrutiny of banks that are heavily dependent on junk fees
    in late 2021, many banks have eliminated these kinds of fees,
    resulting in [a decline of $5.5
    billion](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/data-spotlight-overdraft-nsf-revenue-in-q4-2022-down-nearly-50-versus-pre-pandemic-levels/full-report/)
    in these rip-offs annually—that’s $170 in annual savings for the
    tens of millions of households that pay them each year. The agency’s
    recently proposed rule on [overdraft
    fees](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-close-bank-overdraft-loophole-that-costs-americans-billions-each-year-in-junk-fees/)
    would save consumers another $3.5 billion, and its [final
    rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-bans-excessive-credit-card-late-fees-lowers-typical-fee-from-32-to-8/)
    on credit card late fees will slash fees to $8, reducing overall
    late fees by more than $10 billion, translating into $220 in annual
    savings for the more than 45 million Americans who pay these fees
    each year. Together, these actions will cut these banking junk fees
    by nearly $20 billion annually—a two-thirds reduction from
    pre-pandemic levels. Congressional Republicans have sided with the
    big banks every step of the way, defending these junk fees while
    working to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  
-   **Taking on exploitative practices with branded credit cards,
    points, and miles.** Branded retailer and airline credit cards too
    often rely on late fee revenue and adopt other questionable
    practices, like devaluing points and miles and luring in consumers
    with misleading deferred interest products that cause charges later.
    Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the CFPB is protecting
    consumers by slashing credit card late fees, making it easier to
    shop for cards free from self-dealing, and taking additional actions
    to crack down on other exploitative practices with branded credit
    cards, points, and miles.  
-   **Standing up for consumers against shrinkflation**. Shrinkflation
    occurs when companies hide increases in unit prices from consumers
    by reducing the amount of the product in a package while maintaining
    or increasing its price. According to the [Bureau of Labor
    Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-12/measuring-shrinkflation-and-its-impact-on-inflation.htm),
    this sneaky practice is common in consumer goods, including potato
    chips, paper towels, cereal, cleaning supplies, diapers, and candy.
    For some products, it is responsible for over 25% of price increases
    compared to 2019. Even as inflation comes down, companies continue
    to shrink product sizes to hide price inflation while padding
    profits. President Biden supports the [Shrinkflation Prevention Act
    of
    2024](https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/stop-shrinkflation-casey-introduces-legislation-to-crack-down-on-big-corporations-shrinking-products-without-reducing-prices),
    which would direct the FTC to act against companies that engage in
    shrinkflation.  
-   **Countering middlemen who raise prescription drug prices.** The
    Administration will work to lower drug prices by addressing the
    practices of middlemen who influence which drugs are covered by
    insurance plans and purchased by healthcare providers and how much
    they cost. Although middlemen can play a role in keeping costs down,
    a few dominant firms have the power to collect big payouts,
    sometimes going so far as to drive patients away from generic or
    biosimilar drugs and toward more expensive options at the pharmacy.
    The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal
    Trade Commission are [seeking
    information](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/ftc-hhs-seek-public-comment-generic-drug-shortages-competition-amongst-powerful-middlemen)
    on how pharmaceutical drug middlemen may affect generic drug
    shortages, innovation, and prices. HHS will also work to increase
    access to lower-cost generic drugs, including in the Medicare Part D
    program.  
-   **Promoting competition in healthcare.** Lack of competition in
    healthcare can leave patients with fewer choices and higher costs,
    while also limiting medical professionals’ employment options. This
    week, the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and the
    Department of Health and Human Services released a new request
    seeking information and recommendations with respect to growing
    trend of anti-competitive acquisitions that raise drug and
    healthcare costs. This will inform the Administration’s ongoing work
    to make healthcare markets more competitive across the
    board—improving opportunities for patients, doctor, and nurses.  
-   **Working with companies to provide millions of consumers with the
    full price up front.** Following the President’s calls to action, a
    number of private sector companies have taken voluntary actions to
    address junk fees in their sectors. Private sector companies in
    the [live event ticketing, short-term

    sectors have changed how they display prices so that the all-in
    price is more readily available to consumers. DOT [published a
    dashboard](https://www.inc.com/melissa-angell/inc-exclusive-kamala-harris-says-sbas-ban-box-rule-could-help-millions-of-would-be-entrepreneurs.html)
    of airline policies when flights are delayed or cancelled due to
    issues under the airlines’ control, leading 9 airlines to change
    policies to guarantee coverage of hotels and 10 airlines to
    guarantee coverage of meals, none of which was guaranteed before.
    And, since the President called out family seating fees, [four
    airlines](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard)
    now guarantee fee-free family seating. In addition, [major rental
    housing
    platforms](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-action-to-protect-renters/)
    have launched tools to help providers with the total upfront cost
    information on rental properties.  

**Reducing the Cost of College and Eliminating Student Debt**

As Congressional Republicans oppose student debt relief, President Biden
is working to fix the student loan system and make sure higher education
is a pathway to the middle class, and not a barrier to opportunity, by:

-   **Cracking down on junk fees in higher education**. Each year,
    college students incur millions in fees or additional unseen costs
    for unused meal account funds and using a college-sponsored credit
    card or banking account. These fees and unnecessary practices cost
    real money and are a source of major frustration for millions of
    students and borrowers. The Department of Education is developing
    proposed regulations that would put an end to harmful fees,
    including nonsufficient funds, maintenance, and closure fees for
    college banking products, and stop colleges from pocketing students’
    unused meal plan dollars at the end of the school year.  
-   **Launching the most affordable loan repayment program ever**. Last
    year, President Biden launched the Saving on a Valuable Education
    (SAVE) plan—the most affordable repayment plan ever. Under the SAVE
    plan, monthly payments are based on a borrower’s income and family
    size, not their loan balance. The SAVE plan ensures that if
    borrowers are making their monthly payments, their balances cannot
    grow because of interest. Starting in July, undergraduate loan
    payments will be cut in half, capping a borrower’s loan payment at
    5% of their discretionary income. Already, 7.5 million borrowers are
    enrolled in the SAVE Plan, and 4.3 million borrowers have a $0
    monthly payment. Congressional Republicans are working to repeal the
    SAVE program, which would raise monthly debt payments for 7.5
    million borrowers.  
-   **Forgiving nearly $138 billion in student debt for nearly 3.9
    million Americans**. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris
    Administration has approved debt cancellation for nearly 3.9 million
    Americans, totaling nearly $138 billion in debt relief through
    various actions. These actions including fixing administrative
    errors and flaws in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness and
    Income-Driven Repayment programs that prevent millions from
    receiving the relief that they had earned. This also includes relief
    to borrowers whose schools suddenly closed or who were defrauded by
    an institution. This relief has given borrowers critical breathing
    room in their daily lives, allowing them to afford other expenses,
    buy homes, start businesses, or pursue dreams they had to put on
    hold because of the burden of student loan debt. President Biden
    remains committed to providing debt relief to as many borrowers as
    possible, and won’t stop fighting to deliver relief to more
    Americans.  
-   **Pursuing a path to deliver student debt relief to as many
    borrowers as possible.** Following the Supreme Court’s decision to
    invalidate the President’s original student debt plan, the President
    directed the Department of Education to launch new efforts to
    provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible. Last month,
    the Department of Education released proposed regulatory text to
    cancel student debt for borrowers who are experiencing hardship
    paying back their student loans. And last year, the Department also
    put forward proposals to provide student debt relief for borrowers
    whose balances have grown because of runaway interest; borrowers who
    first entered repayment 20 or 25 years ago; borrowers who attended
    low quality programs; and borrowers who would be eligible for loan
    forgiveness through income-driven repayment programs like SAVE but
    have not applied.
