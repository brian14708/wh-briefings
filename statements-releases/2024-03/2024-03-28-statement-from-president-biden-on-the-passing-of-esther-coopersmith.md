title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Passing of Esther\_Coopersmith"
---
 
Esther Coopersmith shaped history. A skilled diplomat, committed
advocate, and genuine bridge-builder, she helped forge a ground-breaking
peace accord and energetically strengthened international organizations
dedicated to human equality. She was a dedicated public servant and
legendary hostess. And as Jill and I knew firsthand, she was a wonderful
friend.

Growing up in Wisconsin and the child of immigrants, Esther’s character
was forged by the values of decency and hard work. She deeply understood
the power of bringing people together for the common good; often, she
did that literally around her dinner table. She dedicated her
considerable diplomacy skills to the work of peace, supporting the Camp
David Accords and working to foster dialogue and understanding between
people of different cultures and faiths, especially in the Middle East.
For that, she was the second woman to receive the United Nations Peace
Prize.

Under both Democratic and Republican administrations, Esther worked
tirelessly to advance women’s rights, including as the U.S.
Representative to the United Nations and as an advisor to the U.S.
Commission to the United Nations Status of Women Commission. She
remained committed to the cause of building peace and understanding
until the very end, joining Jill this past summer in Paris to mark the
United States’ reentry into the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

When Esther believed in something – or someone – she would often go to
great lengths to show her support. I saw this up close as a 29-year-old
candidate for Senate. Esther was one of my early boosters, and her
belief in me meant the world. Over the years, our conversations
inspired, challenged, delighted, and energized me.

Jill and I are keeping Esther’s family—including her four children and
eight grandchildren—close to our hearts. We will miss her dearly.
