---
 
Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden and U.S. Deputy Secretary of
Education Cindy Marten met with members of the Council of Chief State
School Officers (CCSSO) to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration’s
education agenda; hear from K-12 state education chiefs from across the
country on academic achievement and acceleration efforts and how to
sustain high-impact programs established with American Rescue Plan
funds; and discuss the Administration’s historic investments in
education.  
   
In the meeting, Director Tanden and Deputy Secretary Marten reaffirmed
President Biden’s commitment to improving student achievement and
ensuring that children are equipped to compete in the 21st century.
Earlier this year, the Administration announced its [Improving Student
Achievement
Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-improving-student-achievement-agenda-in-2024/)
using all of its tools—including accountability, reporting, grants, and
technical assistance—to intensify and sustain State and local adoption
of three evidence-based strategies that improve student learning: (1)
increasing student attendance; (2) providing high-dosage tutoring; and
(3) increasing summer learning and out-of-school time learning.   
   
Also today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) highlighted
that it issued a [Dear Colleague
Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/secletter/240322.html),
sharing more ideas and resources on improving student attendance and
engagement.  
   
Director Tanden noted that President Biden and the entire Administration
have been laser focused on academic achievement and acceleration since
coming into office. And school systems around the nation are focused on
improving academic outcomes and accelerating results from the
disruptions students faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
   
Deputy Secretary Marten highlighted the Department’s efforts to secure
historic investments in Title I funding, increase access to mental
health services for students, invest in Full-Service Community Schools,
expand pathways to college and careers, and make access to higher
education more affordable and accessible.  
   
During the discussion, state chiefs and CCSSO Chief Executive Officer
Carissa Moffat Miller addressed the important investments that ARP funds
have had in schools across the country, including but not limited to,
high-dosage tutoring, extended learning programming in literacy and
mathematics, and programs to increase educator recruitment and
retention. In addition, state leaders highlighted ways in which they
plan to sustain high-impact programs beyond September 2024.

    Domestic Policy Council
