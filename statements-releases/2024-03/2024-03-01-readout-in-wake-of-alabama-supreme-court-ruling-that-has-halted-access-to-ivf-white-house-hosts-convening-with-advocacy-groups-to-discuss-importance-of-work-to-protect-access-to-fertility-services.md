title: "Readout: In Wake of Alabama Supreme Court Ruling That Has Halted Access to\
  \ IVF, White\_House Hosts Convening with Advocacy Groups to Discuss Importance of\
  \ Work to Protect Access to Fertility\_Services"

Yesterday, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy
Council Jennifer Klein and Assistant and Senior Advisor to the President
and Director of the Office of Public Engagement Stephen Benjamin
convened a roundtable discussion on the importance of ensuring access to
fertility services—including in vitro fertilization (IVF)—in the wake of
a devastating Alabama Supreme Court ruling that has halted access to IVF
in much of the state. Participants included leaders of national advocacy
organizations dedicated to improving access to fertility services,
including fertility preservation, and health care provider associations.

Participants discussed the devastating fall-out of this decision and the
ongoing impact on women and families on the ground in Alabama—including
for patients who rely on fertility preservation services ahead of and
after treatments for cancer and sickle cell disease as well as LGBTQI+
families. They also spoke to the continued threats and risks to health
care providers, who now face criminal penalties for providing the care
they have been trained to provide. And they highlighted the importance
of eliminating barriers for families in need of a wide range of
high-quality, affordable fertility services.

White House officials reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s
commitment to fighting to protect access to reproductive health care,
including IVF, in the wake of relentless attacks by Republican elected
officials following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn *Roe v.
Wade*. They underscored the importance of President Biden’s [actions to
protect access to reproductive health

and urgency around his call for Congress to restore the protections of
*Roe v. Wade* into federal law to ensure that every woman in this
country has the freedom to make the decision to have a child, as a
matter of basic reproductive freedom.

Participants in yesterday’s discussion included representatives from:

-   Alliance for Fertility Preservation
-   American Cancer Society
-   American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
-   American Society for Reproductive Medicine
-   Family Equality
-   Leukemia & Lymphoma Society
-   National Center for Lesbian Rights
-   RESOLVE: the National Infertility Association
-   Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive
