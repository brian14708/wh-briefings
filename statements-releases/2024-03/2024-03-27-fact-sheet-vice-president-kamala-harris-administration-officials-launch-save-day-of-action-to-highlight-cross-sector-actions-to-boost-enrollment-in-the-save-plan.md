  \ \u201CSAVE Day of Action\u201D to Highlight Cross-Sector Actions to Boost Enrollment\
  \ in the SAVE\_Plan"

*Vice President Harris highlights: “President Biden and I know that far
too many people in our nation are struggling with student loan debt.
That is why we have forgiven nearly $144 billion for almost four million
Americans while also creating the SAVE Plan so that millions of people
can cut their payments in half or entirely,” said Vice President Harris.
“On SAVE Day of Action, I am urging people across the nation to visit
StudentAid.Gov/Save to apply as the President and I continue fighting to
address the burden of student debt and lower costs throughout the
country.”*

From Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to fix
the broken student loan system and provide debt relief to as many
borrowers as possible. Last fall, President Biden launched the Saving on
a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, a key pillar of these efforts and the
most affordable repayment plan in history. More than 7.7 million Federal
student loan borrowers are enrolled in the SAVE Plan. This includes 4.5
million borrowers who have a monthly payment of $0 and over 1 million
additional borrowers have a monthly payment less than $100. Under SAVE,
a single borrower who makes roughly $16 or less an hour will not have to
make any payments. To date, more than 150,000 borrowers have also had
their loans cancelled under the SAVE Plan.

Today, the White House will launch a **SAVE Day of Action** to promote
the SAVE Plan and increase enrollment over the coming months and leading
into Summer 2024, beginning with a kick-off event led by Secretary of
Education Miguel Cardona, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, Director
of the Office of Public Engagement Stephen Benjamin, and other senior
administration officials at the White House. This event builds on the
launch of the [SAVE on Student Debt](https://saveonstudentdebt.org/)
campaign last fall. For the SAVE Day of Action,Vice President Harris
[released a video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XuPCo6E_3GQ)
highlighting the impact of the SAVE Plan and how it can benefit millions
of Americans by keeping more money in their pockets, especially among
those most struggling under the burden of student loan debt – low and
middle-income earners, women, and borrowers of color.

As part of the SAVE Day of Action,more than 40 entities, including
Federal agencies, private sector institutions, non-profit and member
organizations, labor unions, philanthropic organizations, and benefits
managers, are making commitments to promote the SAVE Plan to their
employees, members, and customers. **The commitments announced today –
ranging from social media engagement to in-person events – <u>could
reach over 100 million Americans</u>.** These actions will help to
ensure that those carrying student loan debt can find affordable
repayment options and a pathway toward forgiveness.

Additionally, on this SAVE Day of Action, the Council of Economic
Advisors is [releasing a new
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/03/27/real-world-examples-of-the-benefits-of-save/)
highlighting how the SAVE Plan will help low- and middle-income
borrowers, those in public service, and community college graduates,
among other borrowers. This report showcases how the SAVE Plan will
drastically lower – and in many cases, eliminate – monthly payments for
millions of Americans, prevent balance growth, and potentially shorten
time to forgiveness.

**<u>SAVE Day of Action Enlists Commitments from Public, Private, and
Other Sectors.</u>**

Businesses and business associations, unions, nonprofit organizations,
and government agencies have made commitments to amplify the SAVE Plan
so millions of Americans can learn more about its benefits. Types of
commitments include hosting in-person events or webinars to distribute
information about SAVE; sending out push notifications, emails, or text
messages to share information about SAVE; posting about SAVE on social
media; and publishing a blog or op-ed about SAVE.

More than 10 businesses and business associations have committed to
promoting the SAVE Plan to their employees, customers, and membership,
from financial services companies and trade associations to employee
benefits managers and firms focused on student debt and financial
literacy. In addition, more than 15 public and other sector entities
have committed to promoting SAVE to their membership and networks,
including labor unions, nonprofit organizations, philanthropies,
government agencies, and institutions of higher education.

    members and working with employers to find other opportunities to
    educate employees on how to manage student loan and other debt.

<!-- -->

-   **Credit Karma** will review information regarding their members
    with student loans and leverage their app and notification channels
    to highlight savings opportunities through Federal programs,
    including the SAVE Plan and will make connections to enrollment
    experiences easier.

<!-- -->

-   **Hart House**, with an estimated social media reach of over 200
    million people, will publish content on their social media channels
    about the benefits of the SAVE Plan.

<!-- -->

    Benefits website and share with all new and existing US employees.

<!-- -->

-   The **American Federation of Teachers** and the **National Education
    Association** will host a virtual town hall on April 1 about the
    SAVE Plan where the audience will hear from AFT and NEA member
    borrowers who have personally had their debt forgiven or
    significantly reduced through SAVE. Additionally, NEA and AFT will
    each respectively host student debt clinics for their members on
    March 27 and March 28 focusing on SAVE and Public Service Loan

    has hosted over 120 events to educate and enroll borrowers in the
    SAVE Plan.

    sharing information on SAVE in their weekly newsletter and
    highlighting the program with key partners, including its nearly
    60,000 individual members of the early childhood community and 52
    affiliates.

**<u>Federal Agency Action</u>**

Fifteen federal agencies have committed to promoting SAVE to their
employees, including the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce,
Education, Energy, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation,
Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. Examples of commitments include:

-   The **U.S. Department of Education** will co-host a public webinar
    series for borrowers the week of April 22nd, which will highlight
    the benefits of the SAVE Plan.

<!-- -->

-   The **U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs** published a blog about
    the SAVE Plan and will send information on SAVE to over 14 million
    newsletter subscribers.

**<u>The SAVE Plan helps student loan borrowers by:</u>**

-   **Protecting more income from payments.** The SAVE Plan bases
    monthly payments on income and family size. Compared to earlier
    income-driven repayment plans, SAVE increases the amount of income
    exempted from payment calculations, from 150% to 225% of the federal
    poverty line.

<!-- -->

-   **Cutting monthly payments in half.** Starting in July, monthly
    payments on undergraduate loans will be cut in half from 10% to 5%
    of discretionary income.

<!-- -->

-   **Providing forgiveness faster.** Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE
    Plan who originally took out $12,000 or less in student loans can
    reach forgiveness after being in repayment for as few as 10 years.
    For each additional $1,000 above this amount, an extra year of
    payments is added to this timeline, with a maximum period of 20
    years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for graduate loans. Just
    last month, the Administration
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-cancels-student-debt-for-more-than-150000-student-loan-borrowers-ahead-of-schedule/)
    $1.2 billion in student debt relief for almost 153,000 low-balance
    borrowers enrolled in SAVE who qualified for forgiveness.

<!-- -->

-   **Stopping balances from growing.** Unlike other IDR plans,
    borrowers on the SAVE Plan who make timely payments will never see
    their balances increase if their payment does not cover all the
    interest accumulating each month.

<!-- -->

-   **Excluding Spousal Income.** The SAVE Plan further reduces costs
    for borrowers by allowing those who are married and file taxes
    separately to exclude their spouse’s income from any monthly payment
    calculations.

**<u>While SAVE helps most borrowers, those who will benefit especially
include:</u>**

-   **Borrowers with Lower Incomes.** Those with incomes less than
    $32,800 per year, or $67,500 for a family of four, will qualify for
    a $0 monthly payment. Currently more than half of all SAVE enrollees
    have $0 payments.

<!-- -->

-   **Community College Borrowers.** Due to the early forgiveness
    granted to those borrowing $12,000 or less on the SAVE Plan, an
    estimated 85% of future community college borrowers will be
    **debt-free** within 10 years.

<!-- -->

-   **Public Service Workers.** Borrowers eligible to enroll in the
    [Public Service Loan Forgiveness](https://studentaid.gov/pslf/)
    (PSLF) program must be enrolled in an IDR Plan such as the SAVE
    Plan. Teachers, nurses, firefighters – and other public servants,
    can enroll in SAVE to benefit from lower monthly payments and will
    never see their balance increase while working toward forgiveness.
