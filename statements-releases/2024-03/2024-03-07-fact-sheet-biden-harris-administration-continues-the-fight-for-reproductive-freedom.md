title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Continues the Fight for Reproductive\_\
  Freedom"
---
 
Nearly two years after the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade* and
the constitutional right to choose, millions of Americans are living
under extreme state abortion bans. These dangerous laws are putting
women’s health and lives at risk and threatening doctors with jail time,
including life in prison, for providing the health care they have been
trained to provide. And Republicans’ extreme out-of-touch agenda has put
access to fertility treatments at risk for families who are desperately
trying to get pregnant.  
  
Tonight, Kate Cox and Latorya Beasley will join the First Lady as her
guests at the State of the Union. Kate, a mother of two from Texas, has
experienced the devastating consequences of state abortion bans and
courageously spoke out about her experience seeking the care she needed
to preserve her health—becoming one of the first women in 50 years to
have to turn to the courts to ask permission to receive the abortion
that her doctor recommended. She, like too many other women across the
country, was ultimately forced to travel out of state for care that she
would have been able to receive if *Roe v. Wade* were still the law of
the land.  
  
After a ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court put access to in vitro
fertilization (IVF) on pause in much of the state, Latorya and her
husband, who had been preparing for another round of IVF, learned that
their embryo transfer was abruptly canceled. This heartbreaking setback
in her and her husband’s journey to have their second child through IVF
is yet another example of how the overturning of *Roe v. Wade* has
disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families
across the country.  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that stories like
Kate’s and Latorya’s should never happen in America. But Republican
elected officials want to impose this reality on women nationwide. They
are doubling down on their assault on fundamental freedoms by proposing
ever-more extreme bans in states and three national abortion bans in
Congress. And, just last week, Senate Republicans blocked a vote to
safeguard nationwide access to IVF. Their ongoing disregard for women’s
ability to make these decisions for themselves and their families is
outrageous and unacceptable.  
  
Tonight, President Biden will again call on Congress to restore the
protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law so women in every state have
the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions. And the
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to take executive action to
protect access to reproductive health care, including through ongoing
implementation of the President’s three Executive Orders and a
Presidential Memorandum issued since the Court overturned *Roe v. Wade*.
To date, the Administration has taken action to:

-   Protect access to abortion, including FDA-approved medication
    abortion;
-   Defend access to emergency medical care;
-   Support the ability to travel for reproductive health care;
-   Strengthen access to high-quality, affordable contraception;
-   Safeguard the privacy of patients and health care providers; and
-   Ensure access to accurate information and legal resources.

**Protect Access to Abortion, Including FDA-Approved Medication
Abortion**  
  
*The Administration will continue fighting to protect a woman’s ability
to access abortion care, including by defending access to FDA-approved,
safe and effective medication abortion. The Administration will continue
to:*

-   **Protect Access to Safe and Legal Medication Abortion.**  On what
    would have been the 50th anniversary of *Roe v. Wade*, President
    Biden issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-presidential-memorandum-on-ensuring-safe-access-to-medication-abortion/#:~:text=The%20Presidential%20Memorandum%20directs%20the,or%20provide%20mifepristone%E2%80%94no%20matter) directing
    agencies to consider further efforts to support patients, providers,
    and pharmacies who wish to legally access, prescribe, or provide
    medication abortion. This Presidential Memorandum followed
    independent, [evidence-based
    action](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/information-about-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation) taken
    by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow mifepristone to
    be prescribed by telehealth and sent by mail as well as to enable
    interested pharmacies to become certified to dispense the
    medication. As a result of the new pathway established by FDA, many
    pharmacies across the country—including major retail pharmacy
    chains—are now certified to dispense medication abortion. This new
    option gives many women the option to pick up their prescription for
    medication abortion at a local, certified pharmacy just as they
    would for any other medication.  
-   **Defend FDA Approval of Medication Abortion in Court.**  FDA and
    the Department of Justice (DOJ) are defending access to
    mifepristone—a safe and effective drug used in medication abortion
    that FDA first approved more than twenty years ago—and FDA’s
    independent, expert judgment in court, including in a lawsuit before
    the Supreme Court that attempts to curtail access nationwide. The
    Administration will [continue to stand
    by](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/21/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-in-alliance-for-hippocratic-medicine-v-fda/) FDA’s
    decades-old approval and regulation of the medication as well as
    FDA’s ability to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of
    prescription medications. Efforts to impose outdated restrictions on
    mifepristone would limit access to this critical medication in every
    state in the country.  
-   **Partner with State Leaders on the Frontlines of Abortion Access.**
     The White House continues to
    [partner](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dobbs-Anniversary-States-Report-6.22.23.pdf)
    with leaders on the frontlines of protecting access to abortion—both
    those fighting extreme state legislation and those advancing
    proactive policies to protect access to reproductive health care,
    including for patients who are forced to travel out of state for
    care. The Vice President has led these efforts, traveling to 20
    states and meeting with more than 250 state legislators, health care
    providers, and advocates in the past year. And, on what would have
    been the 51st anniversary of *Roe*, the Vice President launched her
    nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour to continue fighting
    back against extreme attacks throughout America.  
-   **Provide Access to Reproductive Health Care for Veterans.  **The
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) [issued a final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-04275/reproductive-health-services)
    to allow VA to provide abortion counseling and, in certain
    circumstances, abortion care to veterans and VA beneficiaries. Under
    this rule, VA provides abortion services when the health or life of
    the patient would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to
    term or when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. When
    working within the scope of their federal employment, VA
    employees [may
    provide](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2022-11/2022-09-21-va_immunity_for_abortion_services.pdf) abortion
    services as authorized by federal law regardless of state
    restrictions.   
-   **Support Access to Care for Service Members.**  The Department of
    Defense (DoD) has [taken
    action](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3195298/dod-looks-to-ensure-access-to-reproductive-health-care/) to
    ensure that Service members and their families can access
    reproductive health care and that DoD health care providers can
    operate effectively. DoD [released
    policies](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3301006/dod-releases-policies-to-ensure-access-to-non-covered-reproductive-health-care/) to
    support Service members and their families’ ability to travel for
    lawful reproductive health care, including abortion care and
    assisted reproductive technology services, and to bolster Service
    members’ privacy and afford them the time and space needed to make
    personal health care decisions.

**Defend Access to Emergency Medical Care**  
  
*All patients, including women experiencing pregnancy loss and other
pregnancy-related emergencies, must be able to access the emergency
medical care required by federal law. The Administration will continue
to:*

-   **Defend Access to Emergency Abortion Care.**  Republican elected
    officials have put women’s lives at risk by banning abortion even
    when a doctor determines that an abortion is necessary to prevent
    serious health consequences. The Administration is committed to
    ensuring that women who are experiencing pregnancy loss and other
    pregnancy-related emergencies have access to the full rights and
    protections for emergency medical care afforded under the Emergency
    Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)—including abortion care
    when that is the stabilizing treatment required. The Department of
    Health and Human Services (HHS) [issued
    guidance](https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/reinforcement-emtala-obligations-specific-patients-who-are-pregnant-or-are-experiencing-pregnancy-0) and
    Secretary
    Becerra [sent](https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUQs-2BN3jQcVLX1PF2KeT0WHpjKuEGg9HmpTkm0U662e5MZPUxFHTPmAUcFbW4j1MvV724tEggkjCEA2ZX3gi-2FNyPGJFj8gYazBcTjCojRcpqq8BsK2ApNp1RFmFOQsiu6fA-3D-3DCFjw_gatHLOXVnjS-2Fys-2B7qAyVd81zv1Wap8yT25fZboq0-2BiJx32YthI2zl6rLINVJW-2BIntQ2xHKXC9-2BG6LAj91HsUVwh1AxFPJdA27CeTtZ70weukMTYQr8WctKfx-2BmGuVXIt7NBdKdc5BSZ0vWWNOejTWPEy2AgckfSiYxFle46ealnje2B4V4C0QYRTkcLdfsRU56JahbxdQ2uRxCBEsIaevThQ0x69QHjdNvp4laljWEcd4M0qNQNSgcwU24FhZ1w96ALZQHFywHGvRhge-2F9zNwNaJPGFGZQxR7GEUSGFO-2FX9y-2B1RcBuCXkeyu-2BDztuqiWbfnn1up39qkzdr48HwOg9C6DCFMqDsFLHFH4tFzwcYk-3D) [letters](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/01/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-statement-on-emtala-enforcement.html) to
    providers affirming the Administration’s view that EMTALA preempts
    conflicting state law restricting access to abortion in emergency
    situations. The DOJ has taken action defend and enforce that
    interpretation before the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule
    by June.  
-   **Educate Patients and Health Care Providers on Their Rights and
    Obligations for Emergency Medical Care.** To increase awareness of
    EMTALA and improve the procedures for ensuring that patients facing
    all types of medical emergencies receive the care to which they are
    entitled, HHS issued [a comprehensive
    plan](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-new-actions-help-hospitals-meet-obligations-under-emtala)
    to educate all patients about their rights and to help ensure
    hospitals meet their obligations under federal law. This effort
    included the launch of [new accessible and understandable
    resources](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/your-patient-rights/emergency-room-rights)
    about rights and protections for patients under EMTALA and the
    process for submitting a complaint. HHS will also disseminate
    training materials for health care providers and establish a
    dedicated team of experts who will increase the Department’s
    capacity to support hospitals and providers across the country in
    complying with federal requirements—to help ensure that every
    patient receives the emergency medical care required under federal
    law.

**Support the Ability to Travel for Reproductive Health Care**  
  
*Women must be able to cross state lines to access legal reproductive
health care. In the face of threats to the constitutional right to
travel, the Administration will continue to:*

-   **Defend the Right to Travel.**  On the day the Supreme Court
    overturned *Roe v. Wade*, President
    Biden [reaffirmed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/) the
    Attorney General’s statement that women must remain free to travel
    safely to another state to seek the care they need. In November
    2023, DOJ filed a [statement of
    interest](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-statement-interest-case-right-travel-access-legal-abortions)
    in two lawsuits challenging the Alabama Attorney General’s threat to
    prosecute people who provide assistance to women seeking lawful
    out-of-state abortions. DOJ explained that the threatened Alabama
    prosecutions infringe the constitutional right to travel and made
    clear that states may not punish third parties for assisting women
    in exercising that right. DOJ continues to monitor states’ efforts
    to restrict the constitutional right to travel across state lines to
    receive lawful health care.    
-   **Support Patients Traveling Out of State for Medical Care.**  HHS
    [issued](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hhs-letter-to-governors-reproductive-health-care.pdf) a
    letter to U.S. governors inviting them to apply for Section 1115
    waivers to expand access to care under the Medicaid program for
    women traveling from a state where reproductive rights are under
    attack and women may be denied medical care. HHS continues to review
    pending waiver applications and encourage state leaders to develop
    new waiver proposals that would support access to reproductive
    health care services.

**Strengthen Access to High-Quality, Affordable Contraception**  
  
*Contraception is an essential component of reproductive health care and
has only become more important in the wake of the overturning of* Roe v.
Wade*. In addition to FDA’s approval of the first daily oral
contraceptive for over-the-counter use, the Administration will continue
to:*

-   **Strengthen Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception.**
     Ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision
    to overturn *Roe v. Wade*, the President [issued an Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/) directing
    agencies to consider actions to improve access and affordability for
    women with private health insurance; bolster access across Federal
    health programs; promote access to over-the-counter contraception;
    and further support access for Service members, veterans, Federal
    employees, and college students. Recent actions taken to implement
    this Executive Order include:  
    -   The Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS issued [new
        guidance](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/faqs-part-64.pdf)
        to clarify standards and support expanded coverage of a broader
        range of FDA-approved contraceptives at no cost under the
        Affordable Care Act. This action builds on [guidance
        issued](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/28/hhs-dol-treasury-issue-guidance-regarding-birth-control-coverage.html)
        in July 2022 to clarify protections for contraceptive coverage
        under the Affordable Care Act.
    -   The Office of Personnel Management [strengthened access to
        contraception](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/carriers/fehb/2024/2024-03.pdf)
        for federal workers, retirees, and family members by issuing
        guidance to insurers participating in the Federal Employee
        Health Benefits Program that incorporates the Departments’
        guidance. OPM has also newly required insurers that participate
        in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program to take
        additional steps to educate enrollees about their contraception
        benefits.
    -   The Secretary of HHS [issued a
        letter](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/01/22/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-announces-new-actions-increase-contraceptive-care-coverage-51st-anniversary-roe-v-wade.html)
        to private health insurers, state Medicaid programs and state
        Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and Medicare plans about
        their obligations to cover contraception for those they serve.
        The letter targets a wide range of payers to advance compliance
        with existing standards and underscore the Administration’s
        commitment to ensuring that women across the country can access
        affordable contraception.
    -   The Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS [issued a
        Request for
        Information](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/29/hhs-requests-public-input-coverage-over-the-counter-preventive-services-including-contraception-tobacco-cessation-breastfeeding-supplies.html)
        to solicit public input on how to best ensure coverage and
        access to over-the-counter preventive services, including
        contraception, at no cost and without a prescription from a
        health care provider.
    -   Vice President Harris and the Department of Education
        [convened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/05/readout-of-vice-president-kamala-harriss-participation-at-the-department-of-educations-convening-on-access-to-contraception-for-college-students/)
        representatives from 68 college and university leaders in 32
        states to hear promising strategies from leaders of
        postsecondary institutions for protecting and expanding access
        to contraception for their students and on campus.
    -   The Gender Policy Council, Domestic Policy Council, and leaders
        from the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS
        [called](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/27/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-increasing-contraception-access-and-affordability/)
        on private sector leaders to take robust additional actions to
        further expand access to contraception.
    -   The Gender Policy Council and the Department of Health and Human
        Services joined a
        [convening](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2024/02/29/strengthening-access-to-contraception-at-pharmacies/)
        focused on strategies to expand the role of pharmacies and
        pharmacists in promoting access to contraception and breaking
        down barriers for consumers.  
-   **Expand Access to More Women Under the Affordable Care Act. ** The
    Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS [proposed a
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/30/biden-harris-administration-proposes-new-rules-expand-access-birth-control-coverage-under-affordable-care-act.html) to
    help ensure that all women with private health coverage who need and
    want contraception can obtain it without cost sharing as guaranteed
    under the Affordable Care Act. Millions of women have already
    benefited from this coverage, which has helped them save billions of
    dollars on contraception.  
-   **Support Access to Family Planning Services Through Title X
    Clinics.**  HHS has strengthened access to care through Title X
    clinics, which have played a critical role in ensuring access to a
    broad range of high-quality family planning and preventive health
    services for more than 50 years. HHS provided funds to help these
    safety net clinics deliver equitable, affordable, client-centered,
    and high-quality family planning services and provide training and
    technical assistance for Title X clinics. Last year, HHS provided
    $263 million to over 4,000 Title X clinics across the country to
    provide a wide range of voluntary, client-centered family planning
    and related preventive services. The Title X Family Planning Program
    remains a critical part of the nation’s safety net, providing free
    or low-cost services for 2.6 million clients in 2022.  
-   **Promote Access to Contraception for Service Members and Their
    Families and Certain Dependents of Veterans.**  To improve access to
    contraception at military hospitals and clinics, DoD
    [expanded](https://tricare.mil/WalkinContraceptiveServices) walk-in
    contraceptive care services for active-duty Service members and
    other Military Health System beneficiaries, and
    [eliminated](https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/3174941/tricare-offers-contraceptive-care-to-support-you-your-family-and-your-readiness#:~:text=Yes.,many%20retailers%20at%20no%20cost.)
    TRICARE copays for certain contraceptive services. And VA proposed
    [a
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/24/2022-22905/champva-coverage-of-audio-only-telehealth-mental-health-services-and-cost-sharing-for-certain)
    to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for certain types of contraception
    through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of
    Veterans Affairs.

**Safeguard the Privacy of Patients and Health Care Providers**  
  
*The Administration is committed to safeguarding sensitive health
information and strengthening privacy protections for women and health
care providers. The Administration will continue to:*

-   **Strengthen Reproductive Health Privacy under HIPAA.**  HHS [issued
    a proposed
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/regulatory-initiatives/hipaa-reproductive-health-fact-sheet/index.html)
    to strengthen privacy protections under the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As proposed, this rule
    would prevent an individual’s information from being disclosed to
    investigate, sue, or prosecute an individual, a health care
    provider, or a loved one simply because that person sought,
    obtained, provided, or facilitated legal reproductive health care,
    including abortion. By safeguarding sensitive information related to
    reproductive health care, the rule will strengthen patient-provider
    confidentiality and help health care providers give complete and
    accurate information to patients. Prior to the proposed
    rule*, *HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/phi-reproductive-health/index.html) reaffirming
    HIPAA’s existing protections for the privacy of individuals’
    protected health information.  
-   **Take Action Against Illegal Use and Sharing of Sensitive Health
    Information.**  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
    has [committed](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/location-health-and-other-sensitive-information-ftc-committed-fully-enforcing-law-against-illegal) to
    enforcing the law against illegal use and sharing of highly
    sensitive data, including information related to reproductive health
    care. Consistent with this commitment, the FTC has taken several
    [enforcement
    actions](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-order-prohibits-data-broker-x-mode-social-outlogic-selling-sensitive-location-data)
    against companies for disclosing consumers’ personal health
    information, including [highly sensitive reproductive health
    data](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/05/ftc-says-premom-shared-users-highly-sensitive-reproductive-health-data-can-it-get-more-personal),
    without permission.  
-   **Help Consumers Protect Their Personal Data.**  The Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) [launched a guide for
    consumers](https://www.fcc.gov/protecting-your-personal-data) on
    best practices for protecting their personal data, including
    geolocation data, on mobile phones. The guide follows a [proposed
    rule](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-22-102A1.pdf) that
    would strengthen data breach rules to provide greater protections to
    personal data. Separately, HHS issued a how-to guide for consumers
    on steps they can take to better protect their data on personal cell
    phones or tablets and when using mobile health apps, like period
    trackers, which are generally not protected by HIPAA.  
-   **Protect Students’ Health Information.**  The Department of
    Education (ED) [issued guidance to over 20,000 school
    officials](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-guidance-school-officials-student-health-records)
    to remind them of their obligations to protect student privacy under
    the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. The guidance helps
    ensure that school officials—at federally funded school districts,
    colleges, and universities—know that, with certain exceptions, they
    must obtain written consent from eligible students or parents before
    disclosing personally identifiable information from students’
    educational records, which may include student health information.
    The guidance encourages school officials to consider the importance
    of student privacy, including health privacy, with respect to
    disclosing student records. ED also [issued a know-your-rights
    resource](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/know-your-rights-ferpa-protections-student-health-records) to
    help students understand their privacy rights for health records at
    school.   
-   **Safeguard Patients’ Electronic Health Information.**  HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/information-blocking/information-blocking-regulations-work-in-concert-with-hipaa-rules-and-other-privacy-laws-to-support-health-information-privacy) and
    a final rule affirming that doctors and other medical providers can
    take steps to protect patients’ electronic health information,
    including their information related to reproductive health care. HHS
    makes clear that patients have the right to ask that their
    electronic health information generally not be disclosed by a
    physician, hospital, or other health care provider. The guidance
    also reminds health care providers that HIPAA’s privacy protections
    apply to patients’ electronic health information.

**Ensure Access to Accurate Information and Legal Resources**  
  
*The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn* Roe v. Wade *has led to chaos
and confusion. To help ensure that Americans have access to accurate
information about their rights, the Administration will continue to:*

-   **Ensure Easy Access to Reliable Information.**  HHS launched and
    maintains [ReproductiveRights.gov](https://reproductiverights.gov/),
    which provides timely and accurate information on people’s right to
    access reproductive health care, including contraception, abortion
    services, and health insurance coverage, as well as [how to file a
    patient privacy or nondiscrimination
    complaint](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html). DOJ also
    launched justice.gov/reproductive-rights,
    a [webpage](https://www.justice.gov/reproductive-rights?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) that
    provides a centralized online resource on the Department’s ongoing
    work to protect access to reproductive health care services under
    federal law.
