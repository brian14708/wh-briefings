title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Russia\u2019s Attacks on\
  \ Ukraine\u2019s Energy Infrastructure"
---
 
Overnight, Russia launched one of its largest aerial assaults against
Ukraine’s energy grid since the war began—depriving many people across
the country of heat, water, and electricity in the still cold days of
early spring. This bombardment—part of a series of Russian attacks on
Ukraine’s critical infrastructure— is a terrible reminder of Vladimir
Putin’s efforts to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people and plunge
them into darkness. To help Ukraine protect against these ongoing
attacks, we need the House of Representatives to pass the bipartisan
national security supplemental bill so we can send Ukraine more air
defenses. Ukraine’s need is urgent, and we cannot afford any further
delays.
