title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Nex\_Benedict"
---
 
Jill and I are heartbroken by the recent loss of Nex Benedict. Every
young person deserves to have the fundamental right and freedom to be
who they are, and feel safe and supported at school and in their
communities. Nex Benedict, a kid who just wanted to be accepted, should
still be here with us today. 

Nonbinary and transgender people are some of the bravest Americans I
know. But nobody should have to be brave just to be themselves. In
memory of Nex, we must all recommit to our work to end
discrimination and address the suicide crisis impacting too many
nonbinary and transgender children. Bullying is hurtful and cruel, and
no one should face the bullying that Nex did. Parents and schools must
take reports of bullying seriously. My prayers are with Nex’s family,
friends, and all who loved them – and to all LGBTQI+ Americans for whom
this tragedy feels so personal, know this: I will always have your back.

To LGBTQI+ young people across the country – you are loved exactly as
you are. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or alone, you can call or text
988, the National Crisis Hotline, and dial the number ‘3’ to talk to a
counselor who has been specifically trained to support LGBTQI+ youth.
