title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Major Retail Pharmacies Becoming Certified\
  \ to Dispense Safe and Effective Medication\_Abortion"
---
 
Today is an important milestone in ensuring access to mifepristone, a
drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe
and effective for more than 20 years. With major retail pharmacy chains
newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon
have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified
pharmacy—just as they would for any other medication. I encourage all
pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification.  
   
The stakes could not be higher for women across America. In the face of
relentless attacks on reproductive freedom by Republican elected
officials, Vice President Harris and I will continue to fight to ensure
that women can get the health care they need, to defend the Food and
Drug Administration’s independent and evidence-based approval and
regulation of mifepristone, and to restore the protections of *Roe v.
Wade* in federal law.
