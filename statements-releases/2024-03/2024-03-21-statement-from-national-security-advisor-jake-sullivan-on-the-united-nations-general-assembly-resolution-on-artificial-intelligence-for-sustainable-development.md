title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the United Nations\
  \ General Assembly Resolution on Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable\_Development"
---
 
Today, the UN General Assembly in New York adopted by consensus a
resolution establishing principles for the deployment and use of
artificial intelligence (AI). This resolution, proposed by the United
States and co-sponsored by more than 120 countries, is a historic step
in fostering safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems.  
   
The resolution adopted today lays out a comprehensive vision for how
countries should respond to the opportunities and challenges of AI. It
lays out a path for international cooperation on AI, including to
promote equitable access, take steps to manage the risks of AI, protect
privacy, guarding against misuse, prevent exacerbated bias and
discrimination. Developed in consultation with civil society and private
sector experts, the resolution squarely addresses the priorities of many
developing countries, such as encouraging AI capacity building and
harnessing the technology to advance sustainable development.
Critically, the resolution makes clear that protecting human rights and
fundamental freedoms must be central to the development and use of AI
systems.  
   
From the time he took office, President Biden has prioritized restoring
our American leadership at the United Nations and on the world stage.
For this reason, the United States turned to the UN General Assembly to
have a truly global conversation on how to manage the implications of
this fast-advancing technology. While it took nearly four months and
countless hours of negotiations, the world now has a baseline set of
principles to guide next steps in AI’s development and use.  
   
We now look forward to building off of this landmark achievement. As
this technology swiftly evolves, we will continue to strengthen
international cooperation and respond to the far-reaching implications
of AI.
