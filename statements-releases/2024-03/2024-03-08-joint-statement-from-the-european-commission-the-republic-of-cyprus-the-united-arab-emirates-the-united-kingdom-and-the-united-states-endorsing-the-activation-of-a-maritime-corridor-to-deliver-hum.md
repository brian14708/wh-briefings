  \ Activation of a Maritime Corridor to Deliver Humanitarian Assistance to\_Gaza"

The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with
innocent Palestinian families and children desperate for
basic necessities.  That is why today, the European Commission, Germany,
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Cyprus, the United Arab
Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States announce our intent
to open a maritime corridor to deliver much-needed additional amounts of
humanitarian assistance by sea.

Cyprus’ leadership in establishing the Amalthea Initiative—which
outlines a mechanism for securely shipping aid from Cyprus to Gaza via
sea—was integral to enabling this joint effort to launch a maritime
corridor.  Together, our nations intend to build on this model to
deliver significant additional aid by sea, working in coordination with
UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza
Sigrid Kaag — who is charged
with facilitating, coordinating, monitoring, and verifying the flow of
aid into Gaza under UN Security Council Resolution 2720.  The dedicated
efforts of the UAE to mobilize support for the Initiative will result in
the initial shipment of food by sea to the people of Gaza. 

Cyprus will soon convene senior officials to discuss how we can
accelerate this maritime channel supporting those in need, supplementing
land and air routes, including from Egypt and Jordan.  The United States
announced an emergency mission led by the U.S. military to establish
a temporary pier in Gaza, in coordination with humanitarian partners and
other countries, to enable the delivery of significant quantities of
assistance by sea. These efforts will be closely coordinated with the
Government of Israel.  

The delivery of humanitarian assistance directly to Gaza by sea will be
complex, and our nations will continue to assess and adjust our efforts
to ensure we deliver aid as effectively as possible.  This maritime
corridor can—and must—be part of a sustained effort to increase the flow
of humanitarian aid and commercial commodities into Gaza through all
possible routes.  We will continue to work with Israel to expand
deliveries by land, insisting that it facilitate more routes and open
additional crossings to get more aid to more people.  We affirm that
protecting civilian lives is a key element of international humanitarian
law that must be respected. And together, we must all do more to ensure
aid gets to people who desperately need it.
