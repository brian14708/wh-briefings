title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Former Prime Minister\
  \ Brian Mulroney of\_Canada"

Jill and I join Canada in grieving the loss of former Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney.

A tireless advocate for Canada, Mulroney worked with President Reagan to
advance the Acid Rain Treaty, which has helped protect our waterways,
and negotiated the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. To guard our shared
borders from defense threats, Mulroney signed the modern North American
Air Defense Command (NORAD) agreement.Â  Mulroney was fearless and not
afraid to stand up for causes he cared about like advocating against
racial apartheid in South Africa.

I got to know the prime minister when I served on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. I saw firsthand his commitment to the friendship
between our two nations, as well as his abiding love for Canada and its
people. Jill and I send our deepest condolences to former First Lady
Mila Mulroney, their four children, his family, and all those mourning
his loss.
