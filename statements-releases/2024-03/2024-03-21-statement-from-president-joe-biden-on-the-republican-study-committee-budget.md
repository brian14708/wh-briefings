title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Republican Study Committee\_Budget"
---
 
My dad had an expression, “Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your
budget, and I’ll tell you what you value.” The Republican Study
Committee budget shows what Republicans value. This extreme budget will
cut Medicare, Social Security, and the Affordable Care Act. It endorses
a national abortion ban. The Republican budget will raise housing costs
and prescription drugs costs for families. And it will shower giveaways
on the wealthy and biggest corporations. Let me be clear: I will stop
them.

My budget represents a different future. One where the days of
trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and biggest corporations
no longer get all the breaks. A future where we restore the right to
choose and protect other freedoms, not take them away. A future where
the middle class finally has a fair shot, and we protect Social Security
so the working people who built this country can retire with dignity. I
see a future for all Americans and I will never stop fighting for that
future.
