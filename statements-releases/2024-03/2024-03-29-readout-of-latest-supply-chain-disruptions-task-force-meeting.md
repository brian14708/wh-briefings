title: "Readout of Latest Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force\_Meeting"
---
 
Today, the National Economic Council (NEC) re-convened the Supply Chain
Disruptions Task Force to continue coordination of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s response to supply chain impacts stemming from the
collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and partial closure of the Port
of Baltimore. This is the second convening of the Task Force since the
collapse of the Bridge.

During the meeting, agencies shared insights from engagement with
impacted stakeholders and communities. The Department of
Transportation provided a readout of yesterday’s [stakeholder listening
session](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/readout-secretary-buttigiegs-meeting-supply-chain-disruptions-port-baltimore) led
by Secretary Buttigieg, where ports, labor groups, and industry
partners offered strategies for navigating shipping and transportation
diversions on a temporary basis. The Department of
Agriculture discussed today’s convening of federal, state, agricultural,
and food industry stakeholders to assess potential short-term impacts to
the agriculture and food sectors.

Agency participants discussed progress made by shippers, businesses, and
ocean carriers to successfully divert cargo to alternative ports with
excess capacity and mitigate impacts on consumers.

Finally, the Federal Maritime Commission discussed active efforts
to ensure that carriers and marine terminal operators follow just and
reasonable practices relating to demurrage and detention fees, in
line with recent rulemaking to codify provisions included in the [Ocean
Shipping Reform Act of
2022](https://www.fmc.gov/fmc-publishes-final-rule-on-detention-and-demurrage-billing-practices/).

The NEC reaffirmed the President’s commitment to “move heaven and earth”
to fully reopen the Port as soon as possible and to support the people
of Baltimore. The NEC will continue to convene the Supply Chain
Disruptions Task Force over the coming weeks to coordinate
Federal support for impacted industries, workers, and communities.
