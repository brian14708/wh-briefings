title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on Lowering Healthcare Costs and Bringing\
  \ Transparency to Prescription Drug\_Middlemen"

President Biden believes that every American deserves access to
affordable, high-quality health care.   It’s unacceptable that Americans
pay two to three times more than people in other countries for the same
prescription drugs. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration has made
it a priority to bring down prices across the pharmaceutical drug supply
chain.  
  
Yesterday, senior officials from across the Administration including
National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera
Tanden, Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, and Chair
of the Federal Trade Commission Lina Khan convened a listening session
with leaders from across state government, the private sector, and
community pharmacies to discuss President Biden’s work to lower health
care costs and hear ideas for bringing  transparency to prescription
drug middlemen. The participants highlighted reforms that could promote
transparency and competition in pharmaceutical markets, support
independent pharmacies, and lower drug costs.   
  
Participants discussed a range of approaches that have been used to
bring down costs across states and private employers. Governor Beshear
of Kentucky described his work to bring down prescription drug costs in
Kentucky, saving Kentucky $300 million in pharmaceutical expenditures.
Participants also highlighted how PBM transparency can provide tangible
benefits for communities. For example, Dr. Dared Price, who runs a
transparent PBM in Kansas, explained that transparency enabled one local
employer to save $450,000 annually.  
   
Participants also discussed flaws in the current marketplace. Mark Cuban
and Dr. Alex Oshmyansky, co-founders of Cost-Plus Drugs, discussed the
importance of transparency and described ways in which some middlemen
may markup drug prices and distort market competition. Sandra Clarke of
Blue Shield California explained why more transparency is needed in the
market and how some dominant middlemen block lower-priced drugs,
including generics and biosimilars, from reaching patients.  
   
Several participants also highlighted how middlemen can affect
independent pharmacies. Dr. Chichi Ilonzo Momah explained how she and
many other community pharmacists get squeezed, putting businesses that
many folks depend on at risk of closing. Drs. Price and Momah also
explained the personal toll this takes on the patients they serve.  
   
President Biden has taken a number of steps to lower health care costs.
As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare now for the first
time has the authority to negotiate drug prices which could save
millions of seniors and people with disabilities money on some of the
most expensive prescription drugs on the market. New, negotiated prices
for the first set of prescription drugs selected for the negotiation
program are scheduled to be announced in September, and all companies
are participating in negotiation. Additionally, millions of Medicare
recipients with diabetes are already benefitting from the $35 cap for a
month’s supply of insulin. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are saving
about $800 annually on their health insurance premiums. And seniors that
took the 47 drugs covered by Medicare Part B that hiked prices faster
than inflation in 2023 had [lower

with some enrollees saving as much as $618 per dose. As part of its
ongoing work, the Administration will continue to move quickly to lower
drug prices; increase transparency in drug pricing, including around
middlemen; and promote competition in healthcare markets.
