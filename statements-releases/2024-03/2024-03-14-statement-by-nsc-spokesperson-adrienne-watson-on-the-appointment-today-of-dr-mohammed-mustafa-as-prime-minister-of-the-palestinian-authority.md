We welcome the appointment today of Dr. Mohammed Mustafa as Prime
Minister of the Palestinian Authority, and we urge the formation of a
reform cabinet as soon as possible.  The United States will be looking
for this new government to deliver on policies and implementation of
credible and far-reaching reforms. A reformed Palestinian Authority is
essential to delivering results for the Palestinian people and
establishing the conditions for stability in both the West Bank and
Gaza.
