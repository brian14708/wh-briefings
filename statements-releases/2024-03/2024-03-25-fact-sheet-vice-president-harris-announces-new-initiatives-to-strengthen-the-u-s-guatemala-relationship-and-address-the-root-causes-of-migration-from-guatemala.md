  \ the U.S.-Guatemala Relationship and Address the Root Causes of Migration from\_\
  Guatemala"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris will welcome President Bernardo Arévalo of
Guatemala to the White House on March 25, 2024 to recognize the enduring
friendship and strategic partnership between Guatemala and the United
States. During the visit, the leaders will take stock of the progress we
have made to address the drivers of irregular migration, including
creating good jobs, responsive governance, and opportunities for
Guatemalans to invest in their own communities. In demonstrating U.S.
support to the people of Guatemala, the Vice President is announcing the
United States pledges to provide an additional $170 million for
development, economic, health, and security assistance, subject to
congressional notification.   
  
As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment under
the [Root Causes
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Root-Causes-Strategy.pdf),
the Vice President is also announcing the following:

-   **Transforming Security and Justice Institutions:** Through a $50
    million “Guatemala Se Transforma” Initiative, the Department of
    State’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement
    Affairs (INL) will partner with Guatemala to bolster the rule of law
    in security and justice institutions.  Working with Congress, INL
    intends to commit funds now and additional resources in the future
    to this new initiative.

-   **Central American Service Corps:**  Vice President Harris announced
    the creation of the Central American Service Corps (CASC) at the
    Summit of Americas in 2022. After a successful pilot in Guatemala,
    the CASC program will expand in May, during an event featuring
    Guatemalan First Lady Lucrecia Peinado. This expanded program,
    funded by USAID, and partnering with the Peace Corps, and the
    Inter-American Foundation, will reach 2,800 young people in the
    first year who are most at risk of migrating by engaging them with
    volunteer, training, and employment opportunities in Guatemala. CASC
    could reach up to 25,000 young people in Guatemala over the next
    five years. 

<!-- -->

-   **Technical Assistance for Regulatory Reforms:**  The Commerce Law
    Development Program (CLDP) will support legal and regulatory reforms
    to facilitate new infrastructure and public-private partnerships.
    These reforms will also promote workers’ rights. CLDP will provide
    technical assistance to improve Guatemala’s proposed port authority
    law, which would counter extortion and the use of maritime ports and
    airports by organized criminal organizations.  

<!-- -->

-   **Building Trade and Customs Capacity for Secure Textiles and
    Apparel Trade**:  The Office of the United States Trade
    Representative and U.S. Customs and Border Protection will launch a
    Trade Capacity Building program to advance secure trade in textiles
    and apparel between the United States and Guatemala by encouraging
    engagement, including with existing government-to-industry
    stakeholder partnerships such as CBP’s Customs Trade Partnership
    Against Terrorism Program and the Superintendence of Tax
    Administration of Guatemala’s Authorized Economic Operator Program.

<!-- -->

-   **Investment Facilitation Team Visit:**  A United States Investment
    Facilitation Team, composed of relevant U.S. government agencies,
    will visit Guatemala in the next six months to support clean energy
    and infrastructure development, facilitate private sector
    operations, and promote sustainable economic development. 

<!-- -->

-   **Scaling of Agricultural Technologies:**  USAID will implement a
    new Feed the Future program that will strengthen the capacity of
    existing research and education entities and based on their
    priorities, opportunities, and commitments, mainly to scale
    agricultural technologies. It will support research, education,
    extension, and advice related to “Climate Smart” agriculture.

<!-- -->

-   **Guatemala Biodiversity Conservation**:  USAID will implement this
    new program to promote the conservation of biodiversity and
    strengthen the Guatemalan System of Protected Areas focusing on the
    Maya Biosphere Reserve, Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve, and
    areas of ecological importance along the Pacific Coast.

<!-- -->

-   **Women’s Economic Empowerment Legal Reform Fund Project:**  This
    project in Guatemala will support key congressional, governmental,
    and civil society partners to advance legislation and policy that
    reduces barriers to women competing in the workforce, while
    enhancing protection of women’s access and rights in the workplace. 

<!-- -->

-   **Indigenous and Civil Society Engagement:**  The Department of
    State intends to provide $1.5 million to support multi-stakeholder
    engagements among the Government of Guatemala, private sector
    actors, civil society, and people from marginalized communities,
    including indigenous leaders, to ensure public policies are
    inclusive and to promote greater accountability to public
    interests. 

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing Women, Peace, and Security Opportunities Globally:**  In
    2024, the Department of State will add Guatemala as a focus country
    for the Supporting Her Empowerment Women for Inclusive New Security
    (SHE WINS) project. The effort will focus on advancing indigenous
    women’s meaningful civic participation through targeted capacity
    building and support for community initiatives through Plataforma de
    Mujeres Indígenas. Launched in 2022, SHE WINS supports the U.S.
    Strategy and National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security
    Strategy by advancing the leadership of local women leaders and
    women-led civil society organizations to address peace and security
    challenges in areas of conflict and crisis.  

These new programs will build upon the success of the early stages of
the Root Causes Strategy in Guatemala.  Some of these successes include:

-   **Guatemala Entrepreneurship Development Initiative (GEDI):** 
     Launched by Vice President Harris in 2021, GEDI is fostering a
    robust business ecosystem in Guatemala by supporting over 3,500
    entrepreneurs (including over 1,600 women and 1,700 indigenous
    people) through investment readiness and technical services.  In its
    first two years, GEDI facilitated $30 million in new investments, of
    which $4 million is for clean energy investments. GEDI has also
    directly created 1,500 new jobs and generated $7.5 million in new
    sales for small and growing businesses. This strategic collaboration
    with the private sector is instrumental in amplifying business
    growth, and includes notable partners PriceSmart, MasterCard,
    Argidius Foundation, Pomona Impact, Cargill, and many others.

-   **Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative (YWEI):**  Launched by Vice
    President Harris, YWEI has enhanced women’s employment opportunities
    and conditions, reducing gender-based violence, and closing the
    gender gap across sectors. Since 2021, nearly 19,000 youth have
    increased their capacity through re-engaging in secondary education
    and strengthening their soft skills, over 9,000 young women
    completed workforce training programs, and 27,000 young women have
    gained jobs and experienced better employment conditions. Just over
    1,500 women have received support services after experiencing
    gender-based crimes. More than 32,000 women have improved their
    agricultural management and 29,000 women have increased access to
    economic resources such as credit, assets, and income.  

<!-- -->

-   **Creating Jobs**:  In fiscal year 2023, Guatemalan businesses
    created more than 26,000 jobs in areas of high out-migration through
    U.S. support, helping thousands to build wealth for themselves and
    their families close to home.

<!-- -->

-   **Enhancing the Agriculture Sector:**  Through extensive support
    from the United States government, more than 35,000 Guatemalan
    farmers have utilized innovative technologies to increase production
    and income on more than 33,000 acres of farmland, creating greater
    income security and resilience to shocks, including environmental
    shocks.

<!-- -->

-   **Boosting Education:**  USAID reached nearly 69,000 learners in
    high out-migration municipalities in Guatemala, with programs aiming
    to improve math and reading skills, keep youth in school, and boost
    completion rates. 

<!-- -->

-   **Countering Gender-Based Violence:**  Nearly 1,200 survivors of
    gender-based violence have received access to protection services in
    Guatemala, allowing them to put an end to the violence, and begin
    the healing process, and retake control of their lives.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Labor Pathways:**  More than 13,000 Guatemalans were
    issued employment-based visas through the H-2 visa program to work
    temporarily in the United States, providing them with increased
    economic opportunity while supporting the demands of the U.S. labor
    market.

<!-- -->

-   **Reuniting Families: ** More than 5,000 invitations have been
    issued on behalf of eligible Guatemalans that would allow those with
    a pending family-based immigration visa to travel to the United
    States and reunite with their family in a safe, orderly, and lawful
    way.
