title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on S.B.\_4"
---
 
We fundamentally disagree with the Supreme Court’s order allowing Texas’
harmful and unconstitutional law to go into effect. S.B. 4 will not only
make communities in Texas less safe, it will also burden law
enforcement, and sow chaos and confusion at our southern border. S.B. 4
is just another example of Republican officials politicizing the border
while blocking real solutions. We remained focused on delivering the
significant policy changes and resources we need to secure the border –
that is why we continue to call on Congressional Republicans to pass the
bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of
border reforms in decades.
