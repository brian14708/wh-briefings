title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on Fourth Quarter 2023\
  \ GDP and March Consumer\_Sentiment"

Today’s reports show continued progress delivering on President Biden’s
agenda to lower costs and grow the economy from the middle out and the
bottom up. Consumer sentiment has turned a corner and is up nearly 30%
over the last four months, the fastest increase in 30 years. The
turnaround in consumer sentiment comes as consumers expect lower
inflation and report feeling good about their personal finances. In the
second half of 2023, GDP grew faster than any point from 2015 through
the pandemic.

Challenges remain, but working families are starting to see the results
of President Biden’s economic plan, with wages rising faster than
inflation, record wealth and business creation, and the strongest job
market in more than 50 years. We have more work to do to lower costs for
American families—building on the progress we’ve made to lower costs for
health care, prescription drugs, and housing. With corporate profits
still elevated, President Biden will continue to call on companies to
pass their savings on to consumers.
