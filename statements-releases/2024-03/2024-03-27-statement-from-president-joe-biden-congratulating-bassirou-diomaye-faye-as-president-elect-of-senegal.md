title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Congratulating Bassirou Diomaye Faye as\
  \ President-elect of\_Senegal"
---
 
I congratulate Bassirou Diomaye Faye on his election as the next
president of Senegal. And, I send warm wishes to the Senegalese people,
who have demonstrated that the right to vote—and have that vote
counted—remains democracy’s threshold liberty.   

Over more than six decades, Senegal and the United States have deepened
our partnership, including standing together to counter terrorism,
address food insecurity, combat the climate crisis, fight corruption,
and ensure that democracy delivers for all of our people. In the years
ahead, I look forward to strengthening these ties even further as we
continue working together to forge a more peaceful and prosperous future
for all.
