  Violence"
---
 
This week, on the heels of the United States’ participation in the
[third Summit for
Democracy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/20/fact-sheet-delivering-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-commitment-to-democratic-renewal-at-the-third-summit-for-democracy/),
the Biden-Harris Administration hosted a roundtable conversation focused
on countering a threat to our democracy here at home: the rise of
hate-fueled violence. When Americans cannot freely participate in the
basic activities of life—like going to school, shopping at the grocery
store, or attending their house of worship—without fear of being
targeted based on who they are or what they believe, the very fabric of
our society is at risk.  
  
During the roundtable, participants discussed the Biden-Harris
Administration’s extensive efforts to counter hate-fueled violence, as
well as a range of strategies that community leaders are pursuing to
foster unity across differences and disrupt the normalization of
hate-fueled violence. The convening also provided an opportunity to hear
from the diverse, bipartisan members of the Bedrock National Leadership
Council, who are united by the shared goal of countering hate-fueled
violence. Bedrock is one of several nongovernmental and private sector
initiatives that were announced at President Biden’s [United We Stand
Summit](https://unitedwestand.gov/) in September 2022.  
   
From the day President Biden was sworn into office, the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken [numerous
steps](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-counter-hate-fueled-violence/)
to counter hate-fueled violence, from signing the bipartisan COVID-19
Hate Crimes Act, to releasing the first-ever National Strategy for
Countering Domestic Terrorism. In December 2022, the Administration
established an interagency policy committee to counter Antisemitism,
Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination. In May 2023,
the Administration
[released](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/25/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-first-ever-u-s-national-strategy-to-counter-antisemitism/)
the first-ever [U.S. National Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/U.S.-National-Strategy-to-Counter-Antisemitism.pdf),
which it is implementing. The Administration is also drafting the
first-ever National Strategy to Combat Islamophobia and Related Forms of
Bias and Discrimination. All of these efforts advance the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to work with partners to prevent, respond
to, and recover from hate-fueled violence. Hate must have no safe harbor
in America.
