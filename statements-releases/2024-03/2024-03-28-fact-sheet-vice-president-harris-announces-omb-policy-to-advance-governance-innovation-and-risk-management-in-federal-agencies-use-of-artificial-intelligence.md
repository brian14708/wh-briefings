*Administration announces completion of 150-day actions tasked by*
*President Biden’s landmark Executive Order on AI*

Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the White House
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is issuing [OMB’s first
government-wide
policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf)
to mitigate risks of artificial intelligence (AI) and harness its
benefits – delivering on a core component of the President Biden’s
[landmark AI Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/). 
The Order directed sweeping action to strengthen AI safety and security,
protect Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up
for consumers and workers, promote innovation and competition, advance
American leadership around the world, and more. Federal agencies have
reported that they have completed all of the 150-day actions tasked by
the E.O, building on their previous success of [completing all 90-day
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-key-ai-actions-following-president-bidens-landmark-executive-order/).

This multi-faceted direction to Federal departments and agencies builds
upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s record of ensuring that America
leads the way in responsible AI innovation. In recent weeks, OMB
announced that the President’s Budget invests in agencies’ ability to
responsibly develop, test, procure, and integrate transformative AI
applications across the Federal Government.

In line with the President’s Executive Order, [OMB’s new
policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf)
directs the following actions:

**Address Risks from the Use of AI**

This guidance places people and communities at the center of the
government’s innovation goals. Federal agencies have a distinct
responsibility to identify and manage AI risks because of the role they
play in our society, and the public must have confidence that the
agencies will protect their rights and safety.

By December 1, 2024, Federal agencies will be required to implement
concrete safeguards when using AI in a way that could impact Americans’
rights or safety. These safeguards include a range of mandatory actions
to reliably assess, test, and monitor AI’s impacts on the public,
mitigate the risks of algorithmic discrimination, and provide the public
with transparency into how the government uses AI. These safeguards
apply to a wide range of AI applications from health and education to
employment and housing.

For example, by adopting these safeguards, agencies can ensure that:

-   When at the airport, travelers will continue to have the ability to
    opt out from the use of TSA facial recognition without any delay or
    losing their place in line.
-   When AI is used in the Federal healthcare system to support critical
    diagnostics decisions, a human being is overseeing the process to
    verify the tools’ results and avoids disparities in healthcare
    access.
-   When AI is used to detect fraud in government services there is
    human oversight of impactful decisions and affected individuals have
    the opportunity to seek remedy for AI harms.

If an agency cannot apply these safeguards, the agency *must cease using
the AI system*, unless agency leadership justifies why doing so would
increase risks to safety or rights overall or would create an
unacceptable impediment to critical agency operations.   

To protect the federal workforce as the government adopts AI, OMB’s
policy encourages agencies to consult federal employee unions and adopt
the Department of Labor’s forthcoming principles on mitigating AI’s
potential harms to employees. The Department is also leading by example,
consulting with federal employees and labor unions both in the
development of those principles and its own governance and use of AI.

The guidance also advises Federal agencies on managing risks specific to
their procurement of AI. Federal procurement of AI presents unique
challenges, and a strong AI marketplace requires safeguards for fair
competition, data protection, and transparency. Later this year, OMB
will take action to ensure that agencies’ AI contracts align with OMB
policy and protect the rights and safety of the public from AI-related
risks. The RFI issued today will collect input from the public on ways
to ensure that private sector companies supporting the Federal
Government follow the best available practices and requirements.

**Expand Transparency of AI Use**

The policy released today requires Federal agencies to improve public
transparency in their use of AI by requiring agencies to publicly:

-   Release expanded [annual inventories of their AI use
    cases](https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/), including identifying use
    cases that impact rights or safety and how the agency is addressing
    the relevant risks.
-   Report metrics about the agency’s AI use cases that are withheld
    from the public inventory because of their sensitivity.
-   Notify the public of any AI exempted by a waiver from complying with
    any element of the OMB policy, along with justifications for why.
-   Release government-owned AI code, models, and data, where such
    releases do not pose a risk to the public or government operations.

Today, OMB is also releasing [detailed draft
instructions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DRAFT-Guidance-for-Agency-Artificial-Intelligence-Reporting-per-EO14110.pdf)
to agencies detailing the contents of this public reporting.

**Advance Responsible AI Innovation**

OMB’s policy will also remove unnecessary barriers to Federal agencies’
responsible AI innovation. AI technology presents tremendous
opportunities to help agencies address society’s most pressing
challenges. Examples include:

-   **Addressing the climate crisis and responding to natural
    disasters**. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is using AI to
    quickly review and assess structural damage in the aftermath of
    hurricanes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    is developing AI to conduct more accurate forecasting of extreme
    weather, flooding, and wildfires.
-   **Advancing public health.** The Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention is using AI to predict the spread of disease and detect
    the illicit use of opioids, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services is using AI to reduce waste and identify anomalies in drug
    costs.
-   **Protecting public safety.** The Federal Aviation Administration is
    using AI to help deconflict air traffic in major metropolitan areas
    to improve travel time, and the Federal Railroad Administration is
    researching AI to help predict unsafe railroad track conditions.

Advances in generative AI are expanding these opportunities, and OMB’s
guidance encourages agencies to responsibly experiment with generative
AI, with adequate safeguards in place. Many agencies have already
started this work, including through using AI chatbots to improve
customer experiences and other AI pilots.

**Grow the AI Workforce**

Building and deploying AI responsibly to serve the public starts with
people. OMB’s guidance directs agencies to expand and upskill their AI
talent. Agencies are aggressively strengthening their workforces to
advance AI risk management, innovation, and governance including:

-   By Summer 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration has committed to
    hiring 100 AI professionals to promote the trustworthy and safe use
    of AI as part of the National AI Talent Surge created by Executive
    Order 14110 and will be running a [career
    fair](https://ai.gov/apply) for AI roles across the Federal
    Government on April 18.
-   To facilitate these efforts, Office of Personnel Management has
    issued
    [guidance](https://www.chcoc.gov/content/pay-flexibility-incentive-pay-and-leave-and-workforce-flexibility-programs-artificial)
    on pay and leave flexibilities for AI roles, to improve retention
    and emphasize the importance of AI talent across the Federal
    Government.
-   The Fiscal Year 2025 President’s Budget includes an additional $5
    million to expand General Services Administration’s government-wide
    AI training program, which last year had over 4,800 participants
    from across 78 Federal agencies.  

**Strengthen AI Governance**

To ensure accountability, leadership, and oversight for the use of AI in
the Federal Government, the OMB policy requires federal agencies to:

-   Designate Chief AI Officers, who will coordinate the use of AI
    across their agencies. Since December, OMB and the Office of Science
    and Technology Policy have regularly convened these officials in a
    new Chief AI Officer Council to coordinate their efforts across the
    Federal Government and to prepare for implementation of OMB’s
    guidance.
-   Establish AI Governance Boards, chaired by the Deputy Secretary or
    equivalent, to coordinate and govern the use of AI across the
    agency. As of today, the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs,
    Housing and Urban Development, and State have established these
    governance bodies, and every [CFO Act
    agency](https://www.cio.gov/handbook/it-laws/cfo-act/) is required
    to do so by May 27, 2024.

In addition to this guidance, the Administration announcing several
other measures to promote the responsible use of AI in Government:

-   **<u>OMB will issue a request for information (RFI) on Responsible
    Procurement of AI in Government</u>**, to inform future OMB action
    to govern AI use under Federal contracts;
-   **<u>Agencies will expand 2024 Federal AI Use Case Inventory
    reporting,</u>** to broadly expand public transparency in how the
    Federal Government is using AI;
-   **<u>The Administration has committed to hire 100 AI professionals
    by Summer 2024</u>** as part of the National AI Talent Surge to
    promote the trustworthy and safe use of AI.

With these actions, the Administration is demonstrating that Government
is leading by example as a global model for the safe, secure, and
trustworthy use of AI. The policy announced today builds on the
Administration’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management
Framework, and will drive Federal accountability and oversight of AI,
increase transparency for the public, advance responsible AI innovation
for the public good, and create a clear baseline for managing risks.

It also delivers on a major milestone 150 days since the release of
Executive Order 14110, and the table below presents an updated summary
of many of the activities federal agencies have completed in response to
the Executive Order.
