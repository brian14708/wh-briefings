*During a visit to North Carolina, the President and Vice
President will lay out their plan to make health care more affordable*

For years, Republican elected officials—including the previous
Administration—have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which gives
millions of Americans access to quality, affordable health coverage.
Just last week, House Republicans released another extreme budget that
would rip coverage away from millions of Americans while doing Big
Pharma’s bidding to drive up prescription drug costs.

The budget from the Republican Study Committee—which represents 100% of
House Republican leadership and 80% of House Republicans—would:

-   **Slash $4.5 trillion from the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and
    the Children’s Health Insurance Program.** These devastating cuts
    would take health care away from millions of Americans.

<!-- -->

-   **Ripping away coverage for more than 45 million people enrolled in
    ACA coverage and Medicaid expansion.** The Republican budget
    completely strips funding from the Affordable Care Act’s Marketplace
    and Medicaid expansion—programs that cover 45 million people.

<!-- -->

-   **Turning Medicaid into block grants that would threaten coverage
    and care for an additional over 60 million Americans with
    Medicaid.**  States would be forced to make it harder to qualify and
    enroll in coverage, cut critical benefits, or both, threatening
    coverage for millions of children and families.

<!-- -->

-   **Threatening care for seniors and people with disabilities.** Over
    seven million seniors and people with disabilities relying on
    Medicaid home care services could see it cut or taken away
    altogether, with ballooning wait lists for those who still need
    care. Hundreds of thousands of nursing home residents would be at
    risk of lower quality care if Medicaid had to cut nursing home
    payments.

<!-- -->

-   **Eliminate critical consumer protections.** Millions of consumers
    are protected from insurance company abuses by the ACA, but the
    Republican budget sides with insurance companies to roll back these
    critical protections.

<!-- -->

-   **Over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions could be
    denied or charged more for coverage**.

<!-- -->

-   **Older adults could face higher premiums.** Health insurance
    premiums would skyrocket, especially for people in their 50s and
    60s.

<!-- -->

-   **Insurance companies would be allowed to rip off Americans with
    junk insurance products.** The Republican budget promotes the sale
    of junk insurance products, which can scam consumers and leave on
    them on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars in expenses.

<!-- -->

-   **Slash Medicare by turning it into a “premium support” program**.
    In contrast with the President’s plan to protect and strengthen
    Medicare by lowering drug prices and making the wealthy pay their
    fair share, the House Republican budget would convert Medicare to a
    “premium support” program that would raise premiums for millions of
    seniors.

<!-- -->

-   **Raise prescription drug prices for seniors and give massive
    handouts to Big Pharma.** The Republican Budget would side with Big
    Pharma to increase drug prices and seniors’ out-of-pocket costs by
    repealing the Inflation Reduction Act.

<!-- -->

-   **Medicare would no longer be able to negotiate lower drug prices.**
    Big Pharma would once again be allowed to set whatever price they
    want, leaving seniors and taxpayers on the hook and facing higher
    prices.

<!-- -->

-   **Big Pharma would no longer pay Medicare back when they increase
    drug prices faster than inflation**, allowing them to jack up prices
    with no accountability.

<!-- -->

-   **Seniors would go back to paying up to $400 for insulin**, instead
    of the $35 price cap per monthly insulin prescription they have
    today.

<!-- -->

-   **Seniors would face higher costs if the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on
    drug costs is eliminated.**

If Republican elected officials get their way, these proposals would
become the law of the land and Americans would pay the price.

**<u>President Biden and Vice President Harris have a different vision,
which they will lay out in North Carolina today. They believe that
health care is a right, not a privilege, and that we must protect and
strengthen the Affordable Care Act to continue lowering health care and
prescription drug costs and expanding coverage to more Americans.</u>**

Under the President and Vice President’s leadership, more Americans have
health insurance than ever before, with a record-breaking 21 million
Americans signing up for ACA coverage this year—9 million more than when
they took office. The President and Vice President have fought to
protect and strengthen the ACA and Medicaid with critical health care
protections, like free preventative care and guaranteed coverage
regardless of health status or gender.

President Biden and Vice President Harris have also made health care
under the ACA more affordable than ever, saving millions of Americans an
average of $800 per year on health insurance premiums. And after decades
of failed attempts, and without a single Republican vote in Congress,
President Biden beat Big Pharma by passing the Inflation Reduction
Act—which for the first time in history is giving Medicare the power to
negotiate lower prescription drug costs, capping insulin at $35 per a
month per prescription for seniors and people with disabilities, and
capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare enrollees at
$2,000 a year starting in 2025.

The President and Vice President are not done lowering health care costs
and improving health care for the American people. They want to build on
the progress they have made to further lower prescription drug costs and
health insurance premiums; expand access to care, especially mental
health care; and protect Americans from getting ripped off by
corporations. While Republicans officials try to rip Americans’ health
care away, President Biden and Vice President Harris are fighting to:

-   Lower Health Insurance Premiums Permanently. Make permanent the
    expanded premium tax credits that were last extended by the
    Inflation Reduction Act so millions of Americans do not see their
    net health insurance premiums spike by hundreds or thousands of
    dollars starting in 2026.

<!-- -->

-   Close the Coverage Gap. Provide Medicaid-like coverage to people in
    the 10 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion.

<!-- -->

-   Keep Kids Covered. Provide States the option to avoid children
    losing coverage due to red tape from birth through age 6, and cut
    red tape for families on Medicaid.

<!-- -->

-   Make Home Care More Available. Invest billions more in home care so
    the hundreds of thousands of older adults and individuals with
    disabilities on Medicaid home care waiting lists get the care they
    need in their homes.

<!-- -->

-   Ensure Access to Mental Health Care. Increase access to mental
    health care by expanding coverage in Medicare and private insurance,
    applying the mental health parity requirements to Medicare
    beneficiaries, and extending Medicare incentive programs to address
    mental health provider shortages.

<!-- -->

-   **Prevent More Surprise Medical Bills.** Protect consumers by
    applying surprise billing protections to ground ambulance providers
    so people do not have to worry about an unexpected bill for their
    ambulance ride.

<!-- -->

-   **Crack Down on Junk Facility Fees.** Eliminate unwarranted
    “facility” fees on telemedicine and other outpatient health care
    services for consumers.

<!-- -->

-   **Let Medicare Negotiate Drug Prices for at least 50 Drugs Every
    Year.** Expand the number of drugs Medicare can negotiate from 20 to
    at least 50 per year, cutting prices for major drugs that seniors
    rely on, like those used to treat heart disease, cancer, and
    diabetes. Alongside other reforms, this will reduce the deficit by
    an additional $200 billion over the next ten years.

<!-- -->

-   **Cap Out-of-Pocket Prescription Drug Costs for Everyone.** Expand
    the $2,000 out-of-pocket prescription drug cap to people with
    private insurance so that all Americans have the peace of mind that
    comes with not being forced to choose between filling their
    prescription or putting food on the table.

<!-- -->

-   **Cap Medicare Cost-Sharing at $2 for Common Generic Drugs.**
    Establish a new permanent Medicare benefit limiting monthly Medicare
    Part D cost-sharing for certain high-value generic drugs to $2, such
    as for those used to treat hypertension and high cholesterol.

<!-- -->

-   **Protect and Strengthen Medicare for Generations.** The President
    will block Republican efforts to dismantle Medicare and instead will
    extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for generations by making
    the wealthy pay their fair share toward Medicare and dedicating
    savings from Medicare prescription drug reforms to the Hospital
    Insurance trust fund.
