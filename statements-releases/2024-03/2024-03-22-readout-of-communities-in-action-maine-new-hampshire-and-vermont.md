On March 14, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the
Office of Public Engagement hosted 35 local elected officials and
community leaders from across the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and
Vermont as part of its “Communities in Action” event series.

During the half-day forum, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials
highlighted the impacts of the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act on communities across
Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.

Participants included local elected officials, educators, businesses
owners, disability advocates, and community organizers who work to
leverage the historic investments from the President’s Investing in
America vision to create and expand opportunities for working families.

The forum was the twenty-eighth in a series of “Communities in Action”
events that the White House hosts with state and local leaders to
demonstrate how the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering critical
progress for the American people.

Administration officials included Second Gentlemen of the United States
Doug Emhoff, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra,
Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough, Vermont Senator Peter Welch,
Implementation Coordinator of the American Rescue Plan Gene Sperling,
Deputy Assistant to the President for Infrastructure Implementation
Samantha Silverberg, Deputy Directors of Gun Violence Prevention Greg
Jackson and Rob Wilcox.
