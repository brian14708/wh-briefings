title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Is Fighting to Reduce the Deficit, Cut Taxes\
  \ for Working Families, and Invest in America by Making Big Corporations and the\
  \ Wealthy Pay Their Fair\_Share"
---
 
President Biden is fighting to make the tax system fairer while
Republicans continue to push tax cuts for the wealthy and big
corporations. The President’s plan delivers tax cuts for families with
children and working Americans, invests in America, and reduces deficits
by trillions of dollars by enacting a new billionaire minimum tax and
cracking down on multinational companies shifting jobs and profits
overseas.  
  
Since taking office, President Biden has fought to build a fairer tax
system that rewards work, not wealth; asks big corporations and the
wealthy to pay their fair share; and requires all Americans to play by
the same rules and pay the taxes they owe. Despite Republican
opposition, President Biden
[secured](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/19/fact-sheet-the-inflation-reduction-act-supports-workers-and-families/)
historic legislation to make our tax code fairer—from enacting a 15%
corporate minimum tax so that billion-dollar companies can’t get away
with paying $0 in federal income taxes to giving the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) the tools it needs to make wealthy tax cheats pay the
taxes they owe.  
  
President Biden will fight to stop Republican plans to add trillions to
the deficit with tax cuts skewed to big corporations and the
wealthy—doubling down on their failed trickle-down tax cuts that already
increased the nation’s debt by trillions of dollars. Republicans have
[proposed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/976#:~:text=TCJA%20Permanency%20Act%20This%20bill%20makes%20permanent%20provisions,reductions%20in%20individual%20and%20capital%20gain%20tax%20rates.)
making all of President Trump’s tax cuts permanent, while refusing to
pay for them by increasing taxes on big corporations or the wealthy.
Instead, they would rather add trillions to the national debt than take
back even one dollar of the $150 billion annual rate cut corporations
received under President Trump. Their plan would
[add](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59169#_idTextAnchor008) more than
$3 trillion to deficits over 10 years, while
[providing](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/make-individual-income-tax-and-estate-tax-provisions-2017-tax-act-permanent-1)
tax cuts worth $175,000 per year to the top 0.1 percent of Americans
that have incomes over $4.5 million. President Biden supports continuing
tax cuts for families making less than $400,000, but opposes extending
tax cuts or restoring tax breaks for those making more than $400,000 per
year. And he believes that any extensions should be paid for by asking
big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share.  
  
While big corporations and the wealthy will pay more in taxes under
President Biden’s policies, President Biden opposes tax increases on
middle-class families. He has pledged that under his Administration, no
one earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal
taxes—not one penny.  
  
**Making Big Corporations Pay Their Fair Share**  
  
President Biden has secured major reforms to crack down on big
corporations paying little or nothing in taxes and on stock buybacks
that provide large, low-tax payouts to wealthy investors and CEOs.
President Biden’s tax plan would build on this progress by finally
making big corporations pay their fair share in taxes:  

-   **Raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum
    tax to 21%.** President Biden believes large corporations should pay
    their fair share, and is committed to reversing the massive tax
    giveaway to big corporations that Republicans enacted in 2017.
    President Biden would raise the corporate tax rate to 28%. He would
    also ensure that billion-dollar corporations pay at least 21% of
    their income in taxes, building on the Inflation Reduction Act’s
    (IRA) corporate minimum tax.  
-   **Cracking down on tax avoidance by large multinationals and Big
    Pharma.** For too long, big multinationals have moved jobs overseas
    and stashed their profits in tax havens. The 2017 Republican tax
    giveaway failed to fix these problems, instead giving
    [windfalls](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-releases-new-findings-in-ongoing-pharma-tax-investigation)
    to Big Pharma. President Biden negotiated a historic
    [agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/08/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-the-unprecedented-oecd-agreement-for-a-global-minimum-tax/)
    with over 130 countries that would enable the U.S. and its partners
    to ensure Big Pharma and other multinationals pay at least a minimum
    tax rate. He is calling on Congress to implement the agreement with
    a 21% rate on multinationals, with almost one-fifth of the revenue
    coming from Big Pharma, according to
    [analysis](https://www.phrma.org/-/media/Project/PhRMA/PhRMA-Org/PhRMA-Org/PDF/PWC-FY2022-Budget-Revenue-Effects-20210909.pdf)
    it funded.  
-   **Denying corporate tax breaks for multi-million-dollar executive
    compensation.** Executive pay has skyrocketed in recent decades,
    with CEO pay
    [averaging](https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2022/) more
    than 300 times that of a typical worker in 2022. The corporate tax
    cuts in the 2017 Republican tax law only made this problem worse,
    giving executives huge raises
    [while](https://patrick-kennedy.github.io/files/TCJA_KDLM_2023.pdf)
    doing nothing for low- and middle-income workers. When corporations
    give huge pay packages to their executives, President Biden believes
    they don’t deserve a tax break. That’s why he’s proposing to deny
    corporations a tax deduction when they pay over $1 million to any
    employee.  
-   **Quadrupling the stock buyback tax**. In response to the surge in
    corporate stock buybacks after the Trump tax cuts, President Biden
    signed into law a surcharge on stock buybacks that encourages
    businesses to invest in their growth and productivity as opposed to
    funneling tax-preferred profits to wealthy and foreign shareholders.
    President Biden would quadruple the stock buyback tax from one
    percent to four percent to address the continued tax advantage for
    buybacks and encourage corporations to invest in productivity and
    the broader economy rather than windfalls for investors.  
-   **Cracking down on corporate jet loopholes.** President Biden
    believes corporations and wealthy people who use corporate and
    private jets should pay their fair share. That’s why he would
    eliminate a tax break that gives preferential treatment to corporate
    jets, compared to commercial aircraft. He would also increase the
    fuel tax on corporate and private jet travel, so that corporate
    executives and other wealthy Americans pay their fair share for the
    use of airspace and other public services related to air travel.

**Making the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share**  
  
President Biden has already secured funding for the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) that is enabling it to crack down on wealthy and big
business tax cheats. The IRS has used this funding to
[collect](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-has-already-collected-more-than-500-million-in-back-taxes-from-delinquent-millionaires-b70fe240)
more than $500 million in unpaid taxes from fewer than 2,000 delinquent
millionaires,
[launch](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-launches-new-effort-aimed-at-high-income-non-filers-125000-cases-focused-on-high-earners-including-millionaires-who-failed-to-file-tax-returns-with-financial-activity-topping-100-billion)
enforcement action against 25,000 millionaires who have not filed a tax
return since 2017, and crack down on high-end tax evasion like deducting
personal use of [corporate
jets](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-begins-audits-of-corporate-jet-usage-part-of-larger-effort-to-ensure-high-income-groups-dont-fly-under-the-radar-on-tax-responsibilities)
as a business expense. In total, the IRS is
[projected](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2079) to
collect hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over the
next decade thanks to this investment. President Biden’s tax plan would
build on this progress with reforms that will finally make the
wealthiest Americans pay their fair share:  

-   **Requiring billionaires to pay at least 25 percent of income in
    taxes.** Billionaires make their money in ways that are often taxed
    at lower rates than ordinary wage income, or sometimes not taxed at
    all, thanks to giant loopholes and tax preferences that
    disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. As a result,
    many of these wealthy Americans are able to
    [pay](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/09/23/new-omb-cea-report-billionaires-pay-an-average-federal-individual-income-tax-rate-of-just-8-2/)
    an average income tax rate of just 8 percent on their full incomes—a
    lower rate than many firefighters or teachers. To finally address
    this glaring inequity, the President is proposing to levy a 25
    percent minimum tax on the wealthiest 0.01 percent, those with
    wealth of more than $100 million.  
-   **Requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share toward Medicare to
    extend Medicare solvency.** President Biden has a plan to protect
    Medicare for future generations by making the wealthy pay their fair
    share instead of cutting benefits or raising costs for
    beneficiaries. He would modestly increase the Medicare tax rate on
    income above $400,000, close loopholes in existing Medicare taxes
    that allow some high-paid professionals and wealthy business owners
    to avoid the tax, and direct all Medicare tax revenue into the
    Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund as was originally
    intended. These reforms would help extend the life of the Medicare
    HI Trust Fund.  
-   **Ensuring that the IRS can continue to collect taxes owed by
    wealthy tax cheats.** After years of chronic underfunding, President
    Biden’s IRA provided the IRS with the resources it needs to finally
    crack down on wealthy tax cheats and corporations who too often
    avoided paying their lawfully owed taxes. The IRS is already using
    these resources to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid
    taxes from delinquent millionaires, recoup taxes from thousands of
    millionaires who did not fulfill their basic civic duty by filing a
    tax return, and crack down on high-end tax evasion like deducting
    personal use of corporate jets as a business expense. At the same
    time, the IRS is
    [improving](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1421)
    customer service, modernizing IT, and protecting small businesses
    and taxpayers earning less than $400,000 from increased audit risk.
    President Biden would raise hundreds of billions of dollars by
    protecting IRA funding from Republican cuts and extending it after
    it is exhausted so that the IRS can continue to build on this
    progress and crack down on wealthy tax cheats.

**Cutting Taxes for Working Families and the Middle Class**  
  
President Biden’s tax cuts
[cut](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/09/record-drop-in-child-poverty.html#:~:text=Related%20Statistics&text=The%20Current%20Population%20Survey%20Annual,not%20statistically%20different%20from%202020.&text=The%20majority%20of%20America%27s%2072.6,with%20two%20parents%20(70%25).)
child poverty in half in 2021 and are saving millions of people an
average of about $800 per year in health insurance premiums today. Going
forward, in addition to honoring his pledge not to raise taxes on
families earning less than $400,000 annually, President Biden’s tax plan
would cut taxes for middle- and low-income Americans by $765 billion
over 10 years, including by:  

-   **Increasing the Child Tax Credit for 66 million children.**
    President Biden’s expansion of the Child Tax Credit cut child
    poverty nearly in half to a historic low and narrowed racial
    disparities in access to the credit in 2021, but Congressional
    Republicans insisted on raising taxes on families with children by
    letting it expire. The President would restore the expanded Child
    Tax Credit, lifting 3 million children out of poverty and cutting
    taxes by an average of $2,600 for 39 million low- and middle-income
    families that include 66 million children. President Biden would
    also permanently ensure that the kids of parents earning low wages
    receive the full Child Tax Credit, making 18 million children newly
    eligible for the full credit. The Child Tax Credit expansion would
    support 2 million children living with a caregiver who is at least
    60 years old. It would also provide breathing room for day-to-day
    expenses by allowing families to receive their tax credit through
    monthly payments.  
-   **Cutting taxes for 19 million working-class Americans.** By
    strengthening the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-paid workers who
    aren’t raising a child in their home, the President’s plan would cut
    taxes by an average of $800 per year for 19 million working
    individuals or couples. That includes 2 million older workers age 65
    and older and 5 million young adults age 18 to 24 who would be newly
    eligible for the credit.  
-   **Making lower health insurance premiums permanent**. With
    enrollment in affordable health coverage at an [all-time
    high](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/historic-213-million-people-choose-aca-marketplace-coverage),
    the President is committed to building on the remarkable success of
    the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and IRA by making permanent his
    expansion of the premium tax credit, which is saving millions of
    people an average of about $800 per year in health insurance
    premiums this year.

In addition, President Biden’s plan will extend all middle-class tax
cuts; as the President has repeatedly promised, he will not raise taxes
on anyone making less than $400,000 per year. He will fully pay for
these extensions with additional reforms to make the wealthy and
corporations pay their fair share, so that they do not add to the debt.
And he opposes extending tax cuts or restoring tax breaks for those
making more than $400,000 per year.  
  
**The Congressional Republican Plan: Adding Trillions to Deficits With
Tax Cuts Skewed to the Wealthy and Big Corporations**  
  
Republicans are working to make all of former President Trump’s tax cuts
permanent, adding more than $3 trillion to the debt over the next 10
years with unpaid-for tax cuts that are skewed to the wealthy and large
corporations. On top of extending the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and
protecting tax cuts for big corporations, the Congressional Republican
tax plan would:

-   **Allow the wealthy and big corporations to avoid paying their fair
    share.** Congressional Republicans have
    [consistently](https://climatepower.us/research-polling/inflation-reduction-act-repeal-votes-tracker/)
    tried to repeal President Biden’s policies that are making big
    corporations pay at least 15 percent of income in tax and ensuring
    wealthy tax cheats pay the taxes they owe. By repealing President
    Biden’s corporate minimum tax, Congressional Republicans would
    [enable](https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-trump-tax-law/)
    some billion-dollar corporations to go back to paying no federal
    income tax at all. And by gutting President Biden’s investment in
    enforcing our tax laws, Congressional Republicans would take us back
    to a two-tiered tax system where hard-working Americans pay the
    taxes they owe, and wealthy tax cheats are able to evade their tax
    obligations under the law.  
-   **<u>Raise</u>** **taxes on millions of middle-class and working
    families.** Republican efforts to repeal President Biden’s
    improvements to the ACA premium tax credits would increase taxes by
    an average of about $800 for millions of Americans, especially older
    people and self-employed people. The Republican plan would also
    repeal the IRA’s clean energy tax credits, which would raise taxes
    by thousands of dollars for families installing a heat pump or solar
    panels.  
-   **Give windfall tax cuts to billionaires.** Congressional
    Republicans have
    [proposed](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ac9edc48-b9fd-42af-9ef5-ffc7f032093a/08A6777A69CFF6531F3C534E524DEA10.death-tax-repeal-act-of-2023.pdf)
    legislation to give a new tax cut skewed to billionaires by allowing
    the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans—those with assets worth more than
    $13.6 million per person ($27.2 million per couple)—to pass on
    wealth to their heirs entirely tax free. Congressional Republicans
    are fighting to repeal the estate tax—even though it does not apply
    to middle-class families—in order to give more tax relief to
    billionaire families.
