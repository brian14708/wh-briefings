  \ Cabinet\_Gantz"

Vice President Kamala Harris met today with Israeli War Cabinet Member
Benny Gantz at the White House. The Vice President again condemned the
brutal October 7th terrorist attack by Hamas and the taking of hostages,
including American citizens. She reiterated U.S. support for Israel’s
right to defend itself in the face of ongoing Hamas terrorist threats,
and underscored our unwavering commitment to Israel’s security. The Vice
President expressed her deep concern about the humanitarian conditions
in Gaza and the recent horrific tragedy around an aid convoy in northern
Gaza. The Vice President discussed the urgency of achieving a hostage
deal and welcomed Israel’s constructive approach to the hostage talks. 
She called on Hamas to accept the terms on the table whereby the release
of hostages would result in an immediate six-week ceasefire and enable a
surge of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza.  The Vice President
and Minister Gantz discussed the situation in Rafah and the need for a
credible and implementable humanitarian plan prior to contemplating any
major military operation there given the risks to civilians.  She urged
Israel to take additional measures in cooperation with the United States
and international partners to increase the flow of humanitarian
assistance into Gaza and ensure its safe distribution to those in need.
