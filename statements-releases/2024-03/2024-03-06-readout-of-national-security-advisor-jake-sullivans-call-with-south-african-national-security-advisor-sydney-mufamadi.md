National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke on the phone yesterday

two National Security Advisors reaffirmed the strong partnership between
South Africa and the United States, and discussed a wide range of
topics, including a shared commitment to providing humanitarian aid to
Palestinian civilians in Gaza; upcoming opportunities for effective
multilateral cooperation, such as through our respective G20
presidencies in 2025 and 2026; and our support for a just and durable
peace in Ukraine. The two leaders confirmed the need for continued
bilateral dialogue on issues of interest and concern; and noted their
appreciation for the important work our two countries are doing
together.
