  \ Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani of\_Qatar"
---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Prime Minister Sheikh
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani of Qatar to discuss efforts
to secure the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas.  They
underscored that the release of sick, wounded, elderly, and women
hostages would result in an immediate ceasefire in Gaza over a period of
at least six weeks. This first phase of a ceasefire would also enable a
surge of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza, and provide time
and space to secure more enduring arrangements and sustained calm. They
agreed to stay in regular contact over the coming days as talks
proceed.
