title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Itay\_Chen"
---
 
Today, our hearts are heavy. Jill and I are devastated to learn that
American Itay Chen was killed by Hamas during its brutal terrorist
assault on October 7.  
   
In December, Itay’s father and brother joined me at the White House, to
share the agony and uncertainty they’ve faced as they prayed for the
safe return of their loved one. No one should have to endure even one
day of what they have gone through. At the end of our meeting, they gave
me a menorah—a solemn reminder that light will always dispel the
darkness, and evil will not win.  
   
Today, as we join Itay’s parents, brothers, and family in grieving this
tragic loss, we keep this reminder close to our hearts. And I reaffirm
my pledge to all the families of those still held hostage: we are with
you. We will never stop working to bring your loved ones home.
