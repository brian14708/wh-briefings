title: "FACT SHEET: On Equal Pay Day, the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces\
  \ Actions to Continue Advancing Pay Equity and Women\u2019s Economic\_Security"
---
 
Today, on Equal Pay Day, we celebrate how far we have come—and how far
we have yet to go—in closing the gender pay gap.  Under the Biden-Harris
Administration, America has seen an unprecedented—and equitable—economic
recovery, building back an economy that is the strongest in the world.
Women’s labor force participation is the highest it has been in decades,
and the gender pay gap is the narrowest it has ever been on record.  
  
At the same time, President Biden recognizes we still have work left to
do. Women workers are still paid on average only 84 cents for every
dollar paid to men. And the disparities are even greater for many women
of color. These inequities cost women more than $1 trillion every year,
and add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost over the course of a
career for individual workers.  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris remain committed to closing
gender and racial wage gaps and ensuring all people have a fair and
equal opportunity to participate in the labor force and support their
families. Closing wage gaps is critical to strengthening and growing the
economy. This Equal Pay Day, the Biden-Harris Administration reaffirms
its commitment to tackling pay gaps and announces new efforts to
continue to build our understanding of pay disparities, address
inequities, and support women’s economic security.

These actions will:

-   **Promote equitable access to good-paying jobs. **Last week, the
    President signed the [Executive Order on Scaling and Expanding the
    Use of Registered
    Apprenticeships](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-scaling-and-expanding-the-use-of-registered-apprenticeships-in-industries-and-the-federal-government-and-promoting-labor-management-forums/),
    which will expand and diversify Registered Apprenticeship programs,
    benefitting women and other underrepresented workers by increasing
    access to high-quality pathways to good-paying, family-sustaining
    jobs.
-   **Support equal pay and further understanding of pay
    inequities.** Today, [for the first
    time](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-releases-data-dashboard-2017-2018-pay-data-collection),
    the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is [making
    available](https://www.eeoc.gov/data/2017-and-2018-pay-data-collection) aggregate
    pay data from 2017 and 2018—collected from private employers and
    Federal contractors with 100 or more employees—via a user-friendly
    interactive tool, allowing researchers, stakeholders, and the public
    to better understand pay disparities based on sex, race/ethnicity,
    geography, industry, job category, and more.
-   **Address occupational segregation.** Today, the Department of Labor
    (DOL) is issuing
    an [update](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/media/BearingTheCostReport2024.pdf) to
    the *Bearing the Cost *report, analyzing the impact of “occupational
    segregation” on women’s economic security, particularly for Black
    and Hispanic women. Occupational segregation—the overrepresentation
    of women and people of color in occupations and industries that pay
    less, and their underrepresentation in occupations and industries
    that pay more—is a key contributor to pay inequity. DOL found that,
    over the course of a year, Black women lost $42.7 billion and
    Hispanic women lost $53.3 billion in wages compared to white men due
    to the impacts of occupational segregation.

Today’s announcements follow recent actions the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken to further pay equity and transparency. On
Equal Pay Day 2022, the President issued an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/15/executive-order-on-advancing-economy-efficiency-and-effectiveness-in-federal-contracting-by-promoting-pay-equity-and-transparency/) that
committed to eliminate discriminatory pay practices in the Federal
government and Federal contracting workforces. In January 2024, the
Administration made good on that promise by committing to:

-   **Advance pay equity for Federal workers.** The Office of Personnel
    Management (OPM) published a [final
    rule](https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2024/01/release-opm-finalizes-regulation-to-prohibit-use-of-non-federal-salary-history/#:~:text=The%20gender%20pay%20gap%20for,from%2024.5%25%20to%205.6%25.) ensuring
    that more than 80 Federal agencies will no longer consider an
    individual’s non-Federal current or past pay when determining the
    salaries of Federal employees.  Ending the consideration of salary
    history in pay-setting decisions is a proven way to curb pay
    discrimination that often follows workers from job to job.
-   **Promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in Federal
    contracting by advancing pay equity and pay transparency laws.** The
    Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council issued
    a [proposal](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-01343/acquisition-regulation-pay-equity-and-transparency-in-federal-contracting) to
    prohibit Federal contractors and subcontractors from seeking and
    considering information about job applicants’ compensation history
    for employment decisions for personnel working on or in connection
    with a government contract. In addition, the proposal would require
    Federal contractors and subcontractors to disclose expected salary
    ranges in job postings, a policy shown to reduce pay inequities.
    These proposals will also help Federal contractors recruit,
    diversify, and retain talent; improve job satisfaction and
    performance; and reduce turnover—all factors associated with
    promoting the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Federal
    contractor workforce.
-   **Affirm equal pay obligations for Federal contractors.** DOL’s
    Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) issued
    new [guidance](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/faqs/compensationhistory) clarifying
    existing protections against discrimination in hiring or pay
    decisions. The guidance will help Federal contractors and employees
    understand when reliance on an individual’s compensation history for
    hiring or pay decisions may result in unlawful discrimination.

These efforts build upon actions the Biden-Harris Administration has
taken to close gender and racial wage gaps and strengthen women’s
economic security, which has led to the lowest unemployment rate among
women since 1953. These include:

-   **Ensuring women have access to good-paying jobs being created by
    the President’s Investing in America agenda**. The Biden-Harris
    Administration’s investments through the American Rescue Plan (ARP),
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), CHIPS and Science Act, and
    Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have created thousands of good-paying
    jobs in industries of the future. The Administration has taken steps
    to ensure increased access to these jobs, including for women,
    people of color, and members of other communities currently
    underrepresented in these growing sectors have equitable access to
    these careers. These steps include:  
    -   **Launching the Good Jobs Initiative**. DOL’s [Good Jobs
        Initiative](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs) provides
        critical information to workers, employers, and government
        agencies to improve job quality, empower workers, and ensure
        workers, especially those from underserved communities, can
        access good union jobs free from discrimination and harassment.
        The Initiative is dedicated to advancing the Departments of
        Labor and Commerce’s [Good Jobs
        Principles](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/principles),
        which address recruitment and hiring; diversity, equity,
        inclusion, and accessibility; and pay. Key implementing agencies
        have signed [memoranda of
        understanding](https://www.dol.gov/general/good-jobs/about-us) with
        DOL to support the Good Jobs Initiative, promote equitable
        workforce development, and ensure workers have what they need to
        deliver on the President’s once-in-a-generation Investing in
        America agenda. 
    -   **Expanding access to good-paying construction jobs**. To ensure
        women can access the almost 200,000 new construction jobs
        expected from the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic
        investments, the Department of Commerce launched the [Million
        Women in
        Construction](https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/10/secretary-raimondo-calls-more-women-construction-industry-nabtu-tradeswomen-build) initiative,
        which calls on chip manufacturers, construction companies and
        unions to bring one million women into the construction industry
        over the next decade, roughly doubling women’s representation in
        the industry. DOL also launched the [Mega Construction Project
        (Megaproject)
        Program](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/Mega-Construction-Project-Program),
        which fosters equal employment opportunity on designated BIL-
        and CHIPS-funded construction projects through intensive
        on-the-ground assistance to remove hiring barriers and promote
        consideration of a diverse pool of qualified workers, including
        women, people of color, veterans, and people with disabilities.
    -   **Improving access to child care for the semiconductor workforce
        through CHIPS and Science Act implementation requirements**. The
        Department of
        Commerce’s [implementation](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/02/biden-harris-administration-launches-first-chips-america-funding) of
        the CHIPS and Science Act included a historic requirement that
        applicants requesting over $150 million in direct funding submit
        plans to provide accessible, affordable, high-quality child
        care. 
-   **Increasing access to affordable care and supporting
    caregivers**. Access to affordable, high-quality care is essential
    to ensuring parents, especially moms, can participate fully in the
    workforce. From day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has focused
    on ways to lower child care costs for hardworking families and
    improve wages for child care workers. The ARP Child Care
    Stabilization program delivered historic support to over 225,000
    child care programs serving as many as 10 million children across
    the country. Over 90% of the child care programs that have received
    assistance are women-owned. The Council of Economic
    Advisors [found](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/07/fact-sheet-historic-biden-harris-administration-investments-in-child-care-recovery-lowered-costs-for-millions-of-families-helped-speed-the-return-to-work-of-hundreds-of-thousands-mothers-and-grew-t/) that
    this stabilization funding supported savings for families with young
    children, raised the real wages of child care workers, and helped
    hundreds of thousands of women with young children enter or re-enter
    the workforce.

In addition, in April 2023, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/) with
more than 50 directives to nearly every cabinet-level agency to increase
access to affordable, high-quality care and boost job quality for early
educators and long-term care workers, who are disproportionately women
of color. Among the many actions agencies have taken, the Department of
Health and Human
Services [finalized](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/29/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-action-to-lower-child-care-costs-for-more-than-100000-families/) a
rule strengthening the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG)
program and lowering child care costs for more than 100,000 families. 

-   **Increasing the minimum wage**. The President issued [Executive
    Orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-an-executive-order-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-15-for-federal-contractors/) directing
    the Administration to work toward ensuring that employees working on
    Federal contracts and Federal employees earned at least a $15 per
    hour minimum wage. Those directives went into effect in January
    2022, raising the wages of about 370,000 Federal employees and
    employees of Federal contractors. In addition to helping the
    government do its work more efficiently, these directives take a
    step towards narrowing racial and gender disparities in income, as
    many low paid workers are women and people of color. The order also
    eliminates the subminimum wage for workers with disabilities on
    Federal contracts. The President has called on Congress to raise the
    Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, so that American workers can
    have a job that delivers dignity and to make greater strides towards
    pay equity.
-   **Supporting women-owned businesses and entrepreneurs**. Under the
    Biden-Harris Administration, Small Business Administration-backed
    loans to women-owned small businesses are up more than 60 percent,
    totaling $5.1 billion in lending to women-owned businesses in FY23.
    And a
    new [report](https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-details/2024/New-Report-Finds-Growth-of-Women-Business-Owners-Outpaces-the-Market/default.aspx#:~:text=From%202019%20to%202023%2C%20women,in%20revenue%20to%20the%20economy.) found
    that from 2019 to 2023, women’s small business formation surged,
    substantially outpacing overall formation. This Administration has
    invested $70 million in the [Women Business
    Centers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-resources-to-support-women-small-businesses-owners-continued-commitment-to-supporting-americas-entrepreneurs/) (WBC)
    network, expanding it for the first time into all 50 states and
    tripling the number of WBCs at Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and other
    minority-serving institutions. President Biden is also investing $10
    billion through the ARP [State Small Business Credit
    Initiative](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/small-business-programs/state-small-business-credit-initiative-ssbci) (SSBCI)
    to help States, territories, and Tribal governments leverage tens of
    billions more in matching public and private dollars to support
    small businesses across the United States, with a particular focus
    on historically underserved entrepreneurs, including women business
    owners. The ARP Restaurant Revitalization Fund helped over 40,000
    women-owned restaurants and bars—thanks in part to steps taken by
    the Administration to ensure that women-owned and socially and
    economically disadvantaged businesses were able to access
    assistance.
