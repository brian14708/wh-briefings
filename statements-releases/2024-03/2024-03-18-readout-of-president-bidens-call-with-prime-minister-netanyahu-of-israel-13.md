President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this morning with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.  The President and the Prime Minister
discussed ongoing hostage negotiations taking place in Qatar.  They also
discussed the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  The President stressed the
urgent need to significantly increase the flow of lifesaving aid
reaching those in need throughout Gaza, with special emphasis on the
north.  The President reiterated his deep concerns about the prospect of
Israel conducting a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than one
million displaced civilians are currently seeking shelter after fleeing
fighting in the north.  The President affirmed the need to defeat Hamas
in Gaza while also protecting the civilian population and facilitating
the safe and unhindered delivery of assistance throughout Gaza.  The
President and Prime Minster agreed to have their teams meet soon in
Washington to exchange views and discuss alternative approaches that
would target key elements of Hamas and secure the Egypt-Gaza border
without a major ground operation in Rafah.
