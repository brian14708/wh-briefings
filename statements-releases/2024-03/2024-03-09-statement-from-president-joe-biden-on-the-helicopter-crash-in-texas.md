title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Helicopter Crash in\_Texas"
---
 
Yesterday, Jill and I learned of the tragic deaths of two National
Guardsmen and one U.S. Border Patrol agent whose helicopter crashed
while they were conducting routine operations near Rio Grande City,
Texas. A third Guardsman was badly injured in the crash and is
hospitalized.   
   
These brave Americans dedicated their lives to protecting our nation.
They signed up knowing the risks and believing in the mission of serving
their fellow Americans by keeping our nation safe. Our gratitude is
profound, and their sacrifice will never be forgotten.   
   
We extend our deepest condolences to their families and loved ones, as
well as their colleagues in the National Guard and U.S. Border Patrol.
We pray for the injured Guardsman’s swift recovery.  
   
As we investigate the circumstances of this crash, we continue to stand
with our service members, border agents, and their families, whose
contributions to our nation are vital to our security.
