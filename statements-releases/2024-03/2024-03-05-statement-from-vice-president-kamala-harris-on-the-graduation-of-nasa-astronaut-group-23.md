title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris On the Graduation of NASA Astronaut\
  \ Group\_23"
---
 
For decades, America has led the world in space exploration due, in no
small part, to our courageous astronauts.

As Chair of the National Space Council, I congratulate the ten
outstanding Americans who make up NASAâ€™s latest class of astronauts. Our
nation is grateful for their service and honors their commitment to our
shared vision of exploration. Their determination, incredible skill, and
training will help expand our understanding of the universe.

This diverse group of leaders from across our country will become a part
of the next generation of space explorers who will break new barriers,
including walking on the Moon as part of the Artemis campaign and
traveling to Mars. They understand that, in this new era of space
exploration, we must harness the many ways in which space can benefit
the American people, all of humanity, and Earth.

I also want to extend my congratulations to the two astronauts from the
United Arab Emirates who graduated alongside their NASA classmates
today. This represents a concrete reminder that the United States is
committed to strengthening our work in space through partnerships around
the world.

As we celebrate this latest class of astronauts, the United States will
continue to lead the return to the Moon with our commercial and
international partners for scientific discovery, economic and societal
benefits, and inspiration for a new generation of explorers.
