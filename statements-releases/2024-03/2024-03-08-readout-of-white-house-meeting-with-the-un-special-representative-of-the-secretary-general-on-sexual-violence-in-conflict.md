Yesterday, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer,
Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy Council
Jennifer Klein, and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor to the
Vice President Dr. Rebecca Lissner, and other senior National Security
Council and Gender Policy Council officials met with the UN Special
Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) on Sexual Violence in
Conflict Pramila Patten.  During the meeting, SRSG Patten detailed the
scope and methodology of her team’s January 29 – February 14 mission to
Israel and the West Bank and her report on the findings of this travel. 
White House officials conveyed President Biden and Vice President
Harris’s deep concern about the horrific reports of sexual
violence committed by Hamas terrorists on October 7 and reports of
ongoing acts of gender-based violence against those in captivity. 
Attendees also discussed the need for all credible allegations to be
investigated and steps taken, as appropriate, to hold accountable those
responsible.

White House officials underscored the importance of preventing harm to
Israeli and Palestinian civilians, and shared deep concern about the
loss of innocent life in this conflict and about the disturbing reports
of sexual violence. They emphasized steps the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken to promote accountability for conflict-related
sexual violence around the world, including President Biden’s November
2022 Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual
Violence.
