This week, the White House Office of Public Engagement convened a
roundtable on President Biden’s efforts to support Black men’s mental
health. This event was moderated by Charisse Jones of USA Today and
featured actor, Courtney B. Vance; recording artist, Raheem DeVaughn;
actor, Lamman Rucker; Best-Selling Author and Licensed Psychologist, Dr.
Robin L. Smith; and Public Health Analyst from the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, Dr. Walker Tisdale.

Since the beginning of his Administration, President Biden has
prioritized tackling the mental health crisis in America, including
advancing health equity in communities of color. In 2022, he released a
comprehensive mental health strategy designed to strengthen system
capacity, connect more people to care, and create healthier
environments. To support this work and help advance how we transform
mental health in the United States, the Administration launched 988,
expanded community mental health centers, and established new Centers of
Excellence to help promote mental health with a goal to provide
culturally competent and quality care.

The Biden-Harris Administration has and will continue to invest critical
resources to expand mental health and substance use support to
Americans, including through the President’s proposed budget for Fiscal
Year 2025.
