title: "Readout of White\_House Convening with Regional Commissions on Supporting\
  \ an Economic Comeback in Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
This week, National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard convened White House
officials and the Federal Co-Chairs of six Regional Commissions: the
Appalachian Regional Commission, Denali Commission, Delta Regional
Authority, Northern Border Regional Commission, Southeast Crescent
Regional Commission, and Southwest Border Regional Commission.
Participants discussed the importance of Regional Commissions to
President Biden’s commitment to investing in all of America and all
Americans; helping rural and distressed communities make a comeback —
which the President spoke about in his State of the Union address.

Structured as federal-state partnerships dedicated to different regions
of the country, Regional Commissions make place-based investments in
technical assistance, capacity building, economic development,
workforce, and infrastructure. Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the six Regional Commissions received over $1
billion in additional funding to help local economies and distressed
communities attract historic public and private investments in
manufacturing, infrastructure, and clean energy.

Federal Co-Chairs discussed priorities and success stories in their
regions. To date, Regional Commissions have used Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funding to support more than 300 projects in 19
states. For example: the Delta Regional Authority funded infrastructure
projects to support a $5.6 billion investment by Ford in a new electric
truck and battery plant in West Tennessee; the Denali Commission
provided technical assistance to an Alaska Native Tribal consortium to
help secure over $90 million in federal grants for broadband projects in
remote communities; the Northern Border Regional Commission awarded a $3
million grant to construct and expand child care facilities in Lewis
County, New York; and the Appalachian Regional Commission expanded its
[ARISE program](https://www.arc.gov/grants-and-opportunities/arise/) to
build capacity across multi-state regional partnerships. The Southeast
Crescent Regional Commission also launched its inaugural $20 million
[State Economic and Infrastructure Development grant
program](https://scrc.gov/state-economic-and-infrastructure-development-seid-grant-program/).
