title: "FACT SHEET: 80% of House Republicans Release Plan Targeting Medicare, Social\
  \ Security, and the Affordable Care Act, Raising Costs, and Cutting Taxes for the\_\
  Wealthy"

In his State of the Union Less than two weeks ago, President Biden laid
out his vision for an economy that gives the middle class a fair shot.
He also warned that congressional Republicans “will cut Social Security
and give more tax cuts to the wealthy,” that they continue to oppose the
Affordable Care Act, and that they are siding with Big Pharma over
hardworking families.     

On Wednesday, Republican Study Committee – which represents 100% of
House Republican leadership and nearly 80% of their members – just
proposed yet another budget that would cut Medicare, Social Security,
and the Affordable Care Act , as well as increase prescription drug,
energy, and housing costs – all while forcing tax giveaways for the very
rich onto the country. Their plan would even raise the Social Security
retirement age.

Like President Biden promised in the Capitol, “If anyone here tries to
cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop
them.”

He’s keeping that promise by standing against this new House Republican
budget. He knows the last thing we should do is raid Medicare and Social
Security while giving more giant tax cuts to the wealthy and big
corporations.

What’s more, House Republicans’ plan would raise energy costs and send
our new manufacturing jobs back overseas by gutting other crucial
elements of the Inflation Reduction Act, raise housing costs, and allow
big companies to rip off consumers with junk fees.  

President Biden has a different vison for how we move into the future:
make the wealthy, big corporations, and special interests pay their fair
share while protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security.
Extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits he delivered to lower
health care costs and cover more Americans than any time in history.
Making the economy work for the middle class by investing in America and
the industries of the future, while lowering key costs that working
families face. And expanding Medicare’s ability to negotiate lower drug
costs.

***80% of House Republicans released a Budget that***:

Cuts Medicare and Social Security while putting health care at risk for
millions

1.  Calls for over $1.5 trillion in cuts to **Social Security**,
    including an increase in the retirement age to 69 and cutting
    disability benefits.
2.  Raises **Medicare** costs for seniors by taking away Medicare’s
    authority to negotiate prescription drug costs, repealing $35
    insulin, and the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap in the Inflation Reduction
    Act
3.  Transitions **Medicare** to a premium support system that CBO has
    found would raise premiums for many seniors.
4.  Cuts **Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health
    Insurance Program** by $4.5 trillion over ten years, taking coverage
    away from millions of people, eroding care for seniors, children,
    and people with disabilities, and taking us back to the days where
    people could be denied care for pre-existing conditions and charged
    more for health insurance simply for being a woman.   

Rigs the economy for the wealthy and large corporations against middle
class families

1.  Passes $5.5 trillion in **tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and large
    corporations**, including permanently extending tax cuts in the
    Trump tax law, repealing the minimum tax on billion-dollar
    corporations the President signed into law, eliminating the estate
    tax for the wealthiest Americans, providing a massive tax cut for
    billionaire investors, and making it easier for the wealthy and
    large corporations to get away with cheating on their taxes.
2.  Kills jobs and investment in communities throughout the country –
    including Red States – by eliminating the **clean energy tax credits
    in the Inflation Reduction Act**.
3.  Makes it easier for companies and banks to rip consumers off with
    unfair and hidden junk fees by eliminating the **Consumer Financial
    Protection Bureau**.
4.  **Raises housing costs** by cutting funding for rental assistance,
    cutting funding for programs that help build housing, and raising
    mortgage costs for first-time homebuyers.
