The great American comeback continues.

Last night, I put forward my vision for America’s future: one where we
build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, where we invest
in all Americans, and where the middle class has a fair shot and we
leave no one behind.

Three years ago, I inherited an economy on the brink. Now, our economy
is the envy of the world. We added 275,000 jobs last month—nearly 15
million since I took office. Unemployment has been under 4% for the
longest stretch in more than 50 years. Wages keep going up. Inflation
keeps coming down. And I’m taking action to continue lowering costs by
taking on Big Pharma, getting rid of hidden junk fees, and making
housing more affordable.

Across the country, the American people are writing the greatest
comeback story never told. The days of trickle-down are over.
