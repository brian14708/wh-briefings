My top economic priority is lowering costs and today’s report shows we
continue to make progress on that front. Inflation is down two-thirds
from its peak and annual core inflation is the lowest since May 2021.
Wages are rising faster than prices over the last year and since the
pandemic. Prices for key household purchases like gas, milk, eggs, and
appliances are lower than a year ago. Inflation is down while
unemployment has remained below 4% for the longest stretch in more than
50 years.

But as I said in my State of the Union, we have more to do to lower
costs and give the middle class a fair shot. The Budget I put forward
yesterday would take on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug costs. It
would lower rents by building or preserving two million homes. It would
lower costs for health care, child care, and education. And it would cut
taxes for hardworking families while making billionaires pay their fair
share. Congressional Republicans have no plan to lower costs—their only
plan is more tax giveaways for big corporations and the wealthy while
cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I won’t let them.
