Vice President Harris will welcome President Bernardo Arévalo of
Guatemala to the White House on March 25. The visit underscores the
United States’ commitment to supporting good governance and democracy in
Guatemala, following President Arévalo’s inauguration in January 2024.
The Vice President’s meeting with President Arévalo will strengthen the
U.S.-Guatemala bilateral relationship and advance joint ongoing efforts
to promote development, bolster democracy, and address the root causes
of migration.  The Vice President and President Arévalo will discuss
additional efforts to address the drivers of irregular migration from
northern Central America while continuing the implementation of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Root Causes Strategy, including in the
areas of: civilian security, good governance, human rights and labor
protections, gender-based violence, and economic opportunity. During the
visit of President Arévalo, the Vice President will convene leaders from
government, the private sector, and civil society as part of Central
America Forward, the public-private partnership that has mobilized more
than $4.2 billion in commitments and continues generating private sector
investments in northern Central America to create jobs and economic
opportunities.
