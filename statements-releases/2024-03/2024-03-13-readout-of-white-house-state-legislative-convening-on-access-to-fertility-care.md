title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Access to Fertility\_\
  Care"
---
 
In the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that halted access to in
vitro fertilization (IVF) in the state, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the
President and Director of the Gender Policy Council, and Tom Perez,
Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President and Director of the White
House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, convened legislative leaders
to discuss their efforts to protect access to fertility care across the
country.

Legislative leaders spoke about the devastating impact that the Alabama
Supreme Court decision had on women and families across the state, as
well as its implications for other states. Legislators discussed
strategies to combat extreme legislation restricting reproductive
freedom, including  access to IVF and other fertility services, and also
discussed efforts to improve access to fertility care, including through
comprehensive insurance coverage.

White House senior officials thanked the legislators for their
leadership and reaffirmed the importance of state partners in responding
to attacks on reproductive freedom, as well as the President and Vice
President’s ongoing commitment to protecting access to reproductive
health care, including IVF, and calling on Congress to restore the
protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law.

Speakers at the convening included:

-   Alabama State House Democratic Leader Anthony Daniels
-   Florida State Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book
-   Minnesota State Senator Erin Maye Quade
-   Washington State Senator Noel Frame
