On March 15, President Joe Biden will host Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of
Ireland, for a bilateral meeting, followed by a St. Patrick’s Day
Celebration at the White House on March 17, continuing a longstanding
St. Patrick’s Day tradition. The leaders will reaffirm the close and
enduring partnership between the United States and Ireland and the
extraordinary bonds between our people. They will discuss our countries’
shared commitment to continue supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s
brutal aggression, as well as our coordination on a range of other
global issues, including the Middle East. They will reaffirm their
steadfast support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement as we welcome
the recent restoration of Northern Ireland’s Executive and Assembly.
Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will
host the Taoiseach and Mr. Matthew Barrett for a breakfast at the Naval
Observatory on March 15.
