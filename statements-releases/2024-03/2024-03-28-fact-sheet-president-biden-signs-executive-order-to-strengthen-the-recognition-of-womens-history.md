title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs Executive Order to Strengthen the Recognition\
  \ of Women\u2019s\_History"
---
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris recognize that throughout
history, the vision and achievements of women have strengthened our
nation and opened the doors of opportunity wider for all of us. To
better tell these stories, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/03/27/executive-order-on-recognizing-and-honoring-womens-history/)
to strengthen the National Park Service’s recognition of women’s
history. This Executive Order, which comes during Women’s History Month,
will increase the representation of women’s history in sites across
America and help honor the legacy and contributions of women and girls
to our country.

Women’s stories and service to our nation have too often gone untold.
While the National Park Service has honored trailblazing women—from
Harriet Tubman and Eleanor Roosevelt, to Rosie the Riveter and Mamie
Till-Mobley—women remain underrepresented in our national parks,
monuments, and in historic sites that the federal government helps
preserve. By highlighting the role that women and girls have played in
shaping the American story, we will tell a more complete account of
American history and help create a more equal future.

To strengthen the recognition of women’s history and the achievements of
women and girls from all backgrounds, President Biden is directing the
Department of the Interior to:

-   **Assess the state of women’s representation in the National Park
    Service.** This assessment will determine which existing sites are
    significant to women’s history, identify potential new historic
    sites, and offer recommendations to improve the recognition of
    women’s contributions to our country across the National Park
    Service, including through the National Historic Landmark program.

<!-- -->

-   **Conduct the first-ever comprehensive review of women’s history by
    the National Park Service** to identify a diverse group of prominent
    women and girls in key periods throughout U.S. history who merit
    consideration for recognition in existing federal historic sites,
    including the American Revolution, the abolition and suffrage
    movements, World War II and post-war, and the civil rights and
    women’s rights movements. This review, called a theme study, will
    include consideration of women from different backgrounds and
    communities and reflect diversity on the basis of race, ethnicity,
    religion, age, geography, income, socioeconomic status, and other
    factors. 

<!-- -->

-   **Solicit recommendations from the National Park System Advisory
    Board**, working with historians and experts, on opportunities to
    improve the recognition of women and girls across the National Park
    System.

The Executive Order builds on actions the Biden-Harris Administration
has taken to advance gender equity and equality and improve gender
parity in representation and leadership, including the
[designation](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-designates-emmett-till-and-mamie-till-mobley-national-monument/)
of the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in July 2023.
The Executive Order also adds to the President’s historic record of
conserving places that help tell a more complete story of America – from
designating the [Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National
Monument](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-designates-baaj-nwaavjo-itah-kukveni-ancestral-footprints-of-the-grand-canyon-national-monument/)
that protects lands and historic sites near the Grand Canyon that are
sacred to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples to signing legislation
to designate [Camp
Amache](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/president-biden-designates-amache-national-historic-site-americas-newest-national-park#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20President%20Biden%20signed%20the,of%20the%20National%20Park%20System.)
– a site that was used to unjustly incarcerate Japanese Americans during
World War II – as a new unit in the National Park System.
