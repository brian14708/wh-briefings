title: "FACT SHEET: Delivering on the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Commitment\
  \ to Democratic Renewal at the Third Summit for\_Democracy"
---
 
President Biden launched the historic Summit for Democracy in 2021 to
strengthen democratic institutions, protect human rights, and accelerate
the fight against corruption, both at home and abroad.  

At the first Summit, approximately 100 participating governments made
over 750 commitments on a wide array of deliverables, including in the
areas of advancing technology for democracy, media freedom, countering
the misuse of technology, and improving financial transparency, gender
equity and equality, and rule of law.  The second Summit built on these
efforts, convening government stakeholders, youth voices, civil society,
and the private sector to demonstrate the power of cross-sectoral
collaboration and amplify the importance of including diverse voices in
these spaces.  This year, the Republic of Korea hosted the third Summit
for Democracy in Seoul under the theme “Democracy for Future
Generations.”  

The U.S. delegation in the ROK, led by Secretary of State Antony
Blinken, highlighted U.S. efforts to strengthen democratic resilience,
respect for human rights, and good governance globally.  The
Biden-Harris Administration has requested $11.8 billion in Democracy,
Human Rights and Governance (DRG) foreign assistance, of which $5.8
billion has already been appropriated for Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023. 
The Administration intends to provide the remaining $6 billion over the
next two years, subject to the availability of appropriations.  During
the Summit, the United States held a high-level, multi-stakeholder event
on combatting the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, which
not only threatens democratic institutions but also poses risks to
global security.

Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States has taken concrete
steps to advance previous commitments and initiatives launched over the
past three years, which include:

**Advancing Technology for Democracy:**

-   In March 2023, President Biden signed the ground-breaking [Executive
    Order Prohibiting the Use of Commercial Spyware that Poses Risks to
    National
    Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/27/executive-order-on-prohibition-on-use-by-the-united-states-government-of-commercial-spyware-that-poses-risks-to-national-security/) to
    prohibit U.S. Government use of commercial spyware that poses risks
    to national security and has been misused by foreign actors to
    enable human rights abuses.

<!-- -->

-   In July 2023, the Department of Commerce imposed export controls
    on [<u>four commercial spyware
    entities</u>](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-adds-foreign-companies-to-entity-list-for-malicious-cyber-activities-2/), building
    on an [<u>initial tranche of Entity List designations in November
    2021</u>](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list).

<!-- -->

-   In October 2023, the U.S. Government worked with 59 other countries
    at the Human Rights Council in Geneva to issue a joint statement
    on [*<u>Heightened Risks Associated with Surveillance Technologies &
    the Importance of
    Safeguards</u>*](https://geneva.usmission.gov/2023/10/04/joint-statement-on-surveillance-technologies-hrc54/).

<!-- -->

-   In February 2024, the State Department announced a [<u>new visa
    restriction
    policy</u>](https://www.state.gov/announcement-of-a-visa-restriction-policy-to-promote-accountability-for-the-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/) for
    individuals involved in or financially benefiting from the misuse of
    commercial spyware.

<!-- -->

-   In February 2024, the Department of Commerce imposed export controls
    on [<u>a
    company</u>](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-adds-sandvine-to-the-entity-list-for-enabling-human-rights-abuses/) that
    has enabled foreign governments to conduct mass web-monitoring,
    censorship, and surveillance of perceived political opponents and
    human rights defenders.

<!-- -->

-   In February 2024, the United States joined the United Kingdom and
    France-led [<u>Pall-Mall
    Declaration</u>](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-pall-mall-process-declaration-tackling-the-proliferation-and-irresponsible-use-of-commercial-cyber-intrusion-capabilities/the-pall-mall-process-tackling-the-proliferation-and-irresponsible-use-of-commercial-cyber-intrusion-capabilities),
    which brought together international partners and stakeholders to
    address the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber
    intrusion tools and services.

<!-- -->

-   In March 2024, the Treasury
    Department [<u>imposed</u>](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2155) unprecedented
    financial sanctions targeting five commercial spyware entities and
    their leadership that have enabled the misuse of commercial spyware.
    This was the first time that the U.S. Government sanctioned actors
    involved in the misuse of commercial spyware.

<!-- -->

-   In March 2024, the U.S. Government convened members of the investor
    community – during which the investors revealed voluntary principles
    and commitments – to discuss the role of trusted capital in
    advancing technology while promoting the values of free and open
    societies, including guarding against the misuse of commercial
    spyware and encouraging safe AI development.  
-   Since its launch at the first Summit for Democracy, the U.S.
    Government has contributed more than $46 million to the Surge and
    Sustain Fund for Anti-Censorship Technology, including $31 million
    in 2023 alone, to support 30 million users of circumvention tools
    such as virtual private networks (VPNs) each month.

**Supporting Free and Independent Media**

-   USAID’s International Fund for Public Interest Media – announced at
    the second Summit for Democracy – has committed nearly $9 million in
    32 grants across 16 countries to independent media outlets in urgent
    need of support and to strengthen their long-term sustainability. 
    The U.S. Government’s initial seed funding of $20 million has
    leveraged an additional $32 million from 15 governments,
    philanthropies, and corporate entities.
-   The State Department launched two programs under its Journalism
    Protection Platform to combat impunity for violence against
    journalists and strengthen holistic security for journalists and
    independent media outlets, including those operating in exile.

**Fighting Corruption**

-   In December 2023, the United States assumed the presidency of the UN
    Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) Conference of the States
    Parties (COSP).  At COSP, the United States secured consensus to
    adopt the U.S.-led Atlanta Declaration, which holds governments
    accountable to their UNCAC obligations and announced a new
    Presidential Proclamation restricting entry into the United States
    for those who enable corruption.
-   In 2023, the Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on more
    than 130 individuals and entities engaged in corruption, spanning 17
    countries, while the State Department issued public visa
    restrictions on more than 90 individuals from around the world for
    their involvement in significant corruption. 
-   USAID kickstarted implementation of the Countering Transnational
    Corruption Grand Challenge for Development, with an initial focus on
    reducing corruption in the supply of green minerals. USAID also
    initiated new activities to seed a new investigative journalism
    network in Southeast Asia, strengthen public accountability in
    Zambia, and address Kremlin-backed strategic corruption in Eastern
    and Central Europe.
-   In September 2023, the State Department expanded its Transnational
    Anticorruption Partnership with the Federal Bureau of
    Investigations’ International Corruption Unit, which places regional
    anticorruption advisors in the field to build partners’ capacities
    to investigate and prosecute transnational corruption cases.  This
    program, part of the U.S. Democracies against Safe Havens initiative
    to tackle kleptocracy, has upskilled law enforcement agencies in
    over 30 countries, resulting in dozens of new actionable leads,
    cases initiated, and instances of cross-border cooperation to hold
    kleptocrats and money launderers accountable.    
-   In the past year, the United States has made historic strides in
    preventing corrupt and other illicit actors from laundering funds
    through anonymous companies and advancing rulemaking processes to
    guard against dirty money in the residential real estate sector and
    investment advising industry.

**Bolstering Human Rights and Democratic Reformers**

-   Since the first Summit, USAID’s Partnership’s for Democratic
    Development (PDD) has allocated $53 million to deepen relationships
    with democratic reformers and accelerate democratic development in
    nine countries.  PDD will provide up to $52 million in additional
    funding in the coming year, subject to availability of funds, to
    expand democratic reform and ensure PDD partner countries are given
    the support they need to make their democratic transformation a
    reality.

<!-- -->

-   Since announcing the Advancing Women’s and Girls’ Civic and
    Political Leadership Initiative at the first Summit, USAID has
    allocated over $15 million in nine focus countries to build and
    sustain women’s participation in political and civic engagement.
    USAID will provide up to $10 million in additional funding this
    year, subject to availability of funds.
-   The Community of Democracies (CoD) is working towards the 2024
    launch of the global Youth Democracy Network, announced by the
    United States at the second Summit for Democracy.  Ahead of the
    launch, the CoD YouthLeads, who will serve as the inaugural advisory
    board for the Network, are driving discussion on youth engagement in
    elections, including a new series of articles, “A Blueprint for
    Youth Electoral Engagement,” to showcase effective strategies and
    policies from around the globe that enhance youth participation in
    electoral processes.  
      
    **Defending Free and Fair Elections**
-   Following a commitment made at the first Summit for Democracy, USAID
    has worked with more than 30 leading international organizations and
    elections networks to launch the Global Network for Securing
    Election Integrity (GNSEI) to promote electoral integrity in the
    face of critical threats to democracy.  In 2024, GNSEI intends to
    develop and promote two electoral integrity priorities: one on
    principles to support democratic electoral reform processes and the
    other on safeguarding election management bodies’ independence in
    their interactions with other domestic agencies.

<!-- -->

-   In 2023, USAID launched the Defending Democratic Elections Fund,
    which is helping to pilot and scale up approaches to addressing
    critical long-standing and emerging electoral integrity issues —
    including on strengthening information integrity and resilience –
    particularly during the period in between elections, when resources
    have often been scarce. This past year, USAID provided nearly $16
    million in additional support across 17 countries to tackle issues
    like campaign finance reform, and barriers to women’s political
    participation.  
-   The State Department contributed $25 million in new funding under
    the Political Accountability, Inclusivity, and Resiliency Support
    mechanism to promote political competition by building stronger
    connections between political parties and citizens.  

At the third Summit for Democracy, the United States reiterated and
expanded upon its commitment to bolstering democratic resilience and
advancing human rights at home and abroad.  Specifically, the U.S.
delegation announced several new commitments and initiatives to further
progress in the years ahead: 

-   On March 18, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of
    Korea, and Poland signed the [<u>Joint Statement on Efforts to
    Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial
    Spyware</u>](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/18/joint-statement-on-efforts-to-counter-the-proliferation-and-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/),
    which was launched by an initial group of 11 like-minded countries
    at the second Summit for Democracy, expanding the coalition of
    countries committed to implementing robust guardrails against misuse
    of commercial spyware. The Joint Statement affirms the threat posed
    by the misuse of commercial spyware and countries commit to working
    within their domestic systems to establish robust guardrails to
    counter the proliferation and misuse of this sophisticated
    surveillance technology.
-   The Biden-Harris Administration aims to provide financial support,
    working with Congress and subject to appropriated funds, to
    committed partners like the Platform for the Engagement of Civil
    Society, to coordinate the ongoing work of the Summit, including
    future convenings, and to build networks among the existing
    democratic renewal architecture.

<!-- -->

-   The United States, led by USAID, will convene a meeting to galvanize
    momentum for the next Summit gathering and to show our continued
    commitment to democratic renewal around the world on the margins of
    the United Nations General Assembly session in September 2024. 

<!-- -->

-   On March 17, USAID launched the Advancing Digital Democracy (ADD)
    Academy, building upon the ADD initiative announced at the second
    Summit for Democracy.  In partnership with multinational technology
    firms, the ADD Academy will offer essential skills training in
    cybersecurity, data privacy, cloud computing, and responsible AI,
    among other topics.   In the initial phase, ADD Academy intends to
    work with technology partners Cloudflare, Google, and Microsoft. 
-   On March 18, the State Department released U.S. Guidance for Online
    Platforms on Protecting Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) Online, which
    highlights best practices online platforms can take to prevent,
    mitigate, and provide remedy for actions targeting HRDs online,
    building on [<u>joint
    guidance</u>](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/HRD-Guidance_Joint_Updated-_-Accessible-3.8.24.pdf) recently
    released by the U.S. and the EU through the U.S.-EU Trade and
    Technology Council.

<!-- -->

-   Through the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online
    Harassment and Abuse, which was announced during the first Summit,
    the United States and UK are developing a response framework for
    coordinated, evidence-informed action to prevent, disrupt, and
    reduce the spread of targeted online campaigns against women
    political and public figures and human rights defenders, which will
    be informed through a first-of-its-kind global conference on
    countering gendered disinformation held in Kenya on March
    25-27, 2024. Complementing the goals of this framework, in January
    2024 the State Department announced a new Global
    Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TFGBV) Rapid Response
    Fund for women politicians, political candidates, and civil society
    leaders who have experienced extreme forms and/or threats of TFGBV
    and need urgent access to flexible resources to meet their immediate
    needs.   

<!-- -->

-   On March 20, the United States released its second National Action
    Plan on Responsible Business Conduct, which outlines efforts to
    expand U.S. government guidance to and coordination with external
    stakeholders on responsible business conduct, strengthen federal
    procurement processes related to human rights, and promote access to
    remedy for those harmed by irresponsible business conduct.
