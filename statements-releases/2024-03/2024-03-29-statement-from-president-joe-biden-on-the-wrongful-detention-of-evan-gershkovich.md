title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Wrongful Detention of Evan\_Gershkovich"
---
 
Today we mark a painful anniversary: one year of American journalist
Evan Gershkovich’s wrongful detention in Russia.  
  
Journalism is not a crime, and Evan went to Russia to do his job as a
reporter —risking his safety to shine the light of truth on Russia’s
brutal aggression against Ukraine. Shortly after his wholly unjust and
illegal detention, he drafted a letter to his family from prison,
writing: “I am not losing hope.”  
  
As I have told Evan’s parents, I will never give up hope either. We will
continue working every day to secure his release. We will continue to
denounce and impose costs for Russia’s appalling attempts to use
Americans as bargaining chips. And we will continue to stand strong
against all those who seek to attack the press or target journalists—the
pillars of free society.  
  
To Evan, to Paul Whelan, and to all Americans held hostage or wrongfully
detained abroad: We are with you. And we will never stop working to
bring you home.
