title: "WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: As Part of the Cancer Moonshot, First Lady Jill\_Biden,\
  \ Leading Health Insurers & Oncology Practices Nationwide Highlight New Actions\
  \ to Expand Patient\_Navigation"
---
 
Today, as part of the Biden Cancer Moonshot, a key pillar of the
President’s Unity Agenda, First Lady Jill Biden convened executives from
leading health insurance companies, community health plans, and health
plan professional associations to highlight [recent
commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/03/08/fact-sheet-biden-cancer-moonshot-announces-commitments-from-leading-health-insurers-and-oncology-providers-to-make-navigation-services-accessible-to-more-than-150-million-americans/)
to expanding access to navigation services to help patients and their
families navigate health care treatments for cancer and other serious
illnesses. The companies—Aetna, a CVS Health company; Blue Cross Blue
Shield of Minnesota; Elevance Health; Health Alliance Plan; Humana;
Priority Health; and Select Health—serve more than 150 million Americans
and commit to cover navigation services for cancer patients.  
  
“When you have someone by your side who knows the system and is with you
every step of the way, it changes everything. But for too long, these
navigation services weren’t available to many Americans.” **said First
Lady Jill Biden.** “The companies that have stepped forward serve 150
million Americans – nearly half the country. That’s the power of the
Biden Cancer Moonshot. Together, we’re building a world where the word
cancer loses its power, where patients and their families have a trusted
navigator by their side, and where no person has to face cancer
alone.”  
  
Through the Biden Cancer Moonshot, President Biden and First Lady Jill
Biden have prioritized supportive services for people who are touched by
cancer, including by championing the importance of patient navigation
services. Navigators guide families through every step of their cancer
journey. Navigators have been shown to improve health outcomes and the
patient experience by reducing times between diagnosis and treatment,
and increasing treatment completion. These services also lower health
care costs by reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations and
reduce health disparities, including by facilitating access to services
to address unmet health-related social needs, such as food and housing
insecurity and transportation needs. Until President Biden and Dr. Biden
prioritized increasing access to these services, Medicare and other
health plans largely did not pay for navigation, leaving this service
out of reach for too many people, especially in low-resourced
settings.  
   
*Leading oncology practices and private insurers support this vital work
to deliver important support services to more Americans living with
complex health conditions. See what they are saying below: *  
   
**<u>Praveen Thadani, President/CEO, Priority Health</u>**  
“Priority Health is honored to be among the first health plans in the
country involved in the expansion of patient navigation as part of
President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot. A cancer diagnosis triggers several
emotions for patients, including fear, loss and a sense of feeling
overwhelmed. Navigators are a positive first step to offer much-needed
support for cancer patients, caregivers, and families during such a
complex journey; and will reduce inequities driven by social
determinants.”  
  
**<u>Bruce Broussard, CEO, Humana:</u>**  
“Humana is proud to partner with the Cancer Moonshot initiative to help
patients and their families better navigate health care treatments for
cancer and other serious illnesses.  Humana serves six million Medicare
Advantage beneficiaries nationwide – approximately 268,000 of whom
underwent active cancer treatment last year, so we understand the unique
challenges these members face.  We believe that a whole-person approach
to health can improve health outcomes while helping reduce financial
burden and providing better experiences for our patients fighting
cancer.”  
  
**<u>Heather O’Toole, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Select
Health</u>**  
“Select Health is pleased to participate in this work as part of the
Biden Cancer Moonshot. These efforts align with our core mission of
Helping People Live the Healthiest Lives Possible®, and our dedication
to defeat this terrible disease. This collaborative effort highlights
our commitment to supporting individuals facing the challenges of a
cancer diagnosis and ensuring they receive the necessary guidance for
navigating the healthcare landscape. We recognize the essential role
that navigators play in assisting cancer patients and their families by
providing clarity and simple solutions when navigating the complexities
of their medical care. By offering coverage for these services, Select
Health aims to empower individuals with the information and support
needed to make informed decisions about their health.”  
  
**<u>M. Catharine Moffitt, Senior Vice President, CVS Health and Chief
Medical Officer, Aetna</u>**  
“Aetna, a CVS Health company is proud to advance the principles of the
Cancer Moonshot initiative and put our expertise to work as we provide
people living with cancer a personal, accessible, and connected care
experience. We look forward to sharing new educational materials related
to the initiative with our physician and clinician partners serving our
members living with cancer.”  
  
**<u>Michael Genord, President and Chief Executive Officer, Health
Alliance Plan:</u>**  
“We’re proud to support President Biden’s initiative to improve access
to cancer navigation services across the country. As these patients and
their families navigate the challenges of cancer, our attention is on
improving their overall experience including personalized assistance,
care coordination support and addressing unmet social determinants of
health to ensure their sole focus is on getting and staying healthy.
We’re committed to removing barriers to care, and as a result improving
patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs.”  
   
**<u>Robert McWilliams, Co-Deputy Director of Cancer Practice, Mayo
Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center:</u>**  
“Cancer is a complex, life altering diagnosis that can be overwhelming
for patients and their families. Navigators are passionate, essential
components of the care team, helping to overcome barriers to care and
coordinate care between multiple specialties. The Biden Cancer
Moonshot’s efforts to fund and expand navigation services will help
support all cancer patients, especially those who have the highest
barriers to care. This will improve outcomes.”  
   
**<u>Dana Erickson, President and Chief Executive Officer, Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Minnesota:</u>**  
“As part of our mission to help people achieve their healthiest lives,
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is committed to providing access
to medical care that is affordable, effective, and of the highest
quality. We are excited about this opportunity to advance our support
for those facing cancer. Ensuring pathways to cancer navigation services
is an important step in addressing barriers to care and improving
overall health equity.”

**<u>Stacy Borans, Board Member, The Self Insurance Institute of
America:</u>**  
“The Self Insurance Institute of America (SIIA) is proud to support the
Biden Cancer Moonshot’s initiative to expand navigation services access.
A cancer diagnosis is incredibly overwhelming and extremely complicated
for patients to wind through alone. The navigation codes will positively
impact patient engagement and communication exponentially. SIIA is
committed to educating our membership on the coverage and usage of these
codes.”  
   
**<u>Alliance of Community Health Plans</u>**  
“ACHP supports the Biden Cancer Moonshot & Patient Navigation
Initiative. We look forward to leveraging our members’ decades of
community roots and partnerships to ensure patients and their caregivers
are equipped to navigate an often-complicated health care system during
an especially stressful period in their lives. Cancer diagnoses impact
far too many families every year in the U.S., disproportionately
affecting communities of color and areas with limited access to health
care services. At their collective cores, ACHP and its nonprofit,
community-based health plans are dedicated to supporting programs and
initiatives that reduce disparities in access.”  
  
**<u>Andrea Dwyer, Senior Professional Research Assistant, University of
Colorado Cancer Center:</u>**  
“The commitment to Patient Navigation from the Biden-Harris
Administration is unprecedented. Our work at the University of Colorado
and UCHealth systems have centered around stronger access to care and
barrier reduction for cancer patients and survivors with a focus on
sustaining the role of patient navigation to help meet the needs of our
patients within and outside of Colorado. Sustainable funding mechanisms
are essential to long-term sustainability and viability of patient
navigation; without it, we would not be able to support patient
navigation as one of the only evidence-based interventions to truly
reduce health disparities for cancer patients*.*”  
   
**<u>Kris Blackley, Director of Patient Navigation, Levine Cancer
Institute:</u>**  
“Atrium Health Levine Cancer has always recognized the benefits of
Patient Navigation and how it helps our cancer patients, but the
Moonshot’s initiative to reimburse navigation services will be critical
to sustaining this supportive service and allowing us to expand and
serve more patients. We are looking forward to focusing on disease
specific areas and our rural locations in our efforts to provide
equitable care for all.”  
   
**<u>Nita Lee, Gynecologic Oncology Associate Director for Community
Outreach and Engagement and Co-Director for the Center to Eliminate
Cancer Inequity University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer
Center:</u>**  
“We applaud the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to improve access
to navigation services. Research has established that patients living
farther from healthcare facilities, or those with limited access due to
insurance status and other social determinants such as community health
resources, language, poverty, or health literacy, can have worse health
outcomes including higher rates of chronic disease-related conditions,
lower cancer survival rates, and increased overall disease burden.
Patient navigation programs can be cost saving and provide dedicated
support from early diagnosis to survivorship, while reducing
fragmentation of services for patients and caregivers. Adequate patient
navigation improves experiences for both patients and
providers. Providing increased equitable access to cancer therapies and
supportive care services, so that all patients have access to guideline
concordant care, is critical to improving quality patient care, reducing
costs, and ensuring optimal health outcomes across populations.”  
   
**<u>Yolanda Sanchez, Director and Chief Executive Officer, The
University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center:</u>**  
“As the only cancer center within a 500-mile radius that is designated
by the National Cancer Institute, The University of New Mexico
Comprehensive Cancer Center is committed to meeting the needs of all
cancer patients in our state. New Mexico has a minority-majority
population in a highly rural state: 51% of New Mexicans are Hispanic and
11% are American Indian. Patterns of cancer incidence and mortality vary
widely among our different communities. Our nurse and patient navigators
help our patients and their families through this difficult time by
offering culturally-appropriate information, support services,
and navigation to cancer care.”  
   
**<u>Jackie Miller, Director of Oncology Navigation, Sidney Kimmel
Cancer Center:</u>**  
“A cancer diagnosis is overwhelming and oncology navigators are able to
support care coordination, reduce barriers to care, and provide comfort
and a sense of calm by outlining a plan. Navigation is critical in
achieving desired outcomes and the Biden-Harris administration’s
recognition of the importance of this service is a positive step forward
in advancing the field.”  
   
**<u>Robert Vonderheide, Director, University of Pennsylvania Abramson
Cancer Center:</u>**  
“The Biden Moonshot calls for a reduction in cancer incidence which
disproportionately affects environmental justice (EJ) communities. Here
at the Abramson Cancer Center, we use community engagement to
disseminate cancer incidence and environmental exposures using an
“exposomic” framework to increase the uptake of cancer screening in EJ
communities.”  
  
**<u>Cary Presant, Kimlin Tam Ashing, Joseph Alvarnas, City of Hope
Comprehensive Cancer Center:</u>**  
“As one of the largest cancer research and treatment organizations in
the country, City of Hope is deeply committed to improving access to
optimal cancer care for all people, including multidisciplinary whole
person care. City of Hope is proud to promote the use of codes that will
increase navigation services to help our cancer patients receive whole
person care with tailored treatments for cancer prevention, care, and
survivorship. This process will help facilitate access to cutting edge
therapies including precision medicine and clinical studies offered at
City of Hope. Navigation is especially important for patients from
underrepresented and underserved communities who experience greater
barriers to accessing the care they need. City of Hope is also a leader
in championing oncology navigation within primary care settings, such as
Federally Qualified Health Centers. Access to these navigation services
will help improve cancer screening, early diagnosis, and pathways to
care while reducing cancer disparities.”  
   
**<u>Ann Valentine, Manager</u>** **<u>Oncology Supportive Care, Moores
Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego:</u>**  
“We advocate for the expansion of navigation services in cancer care.
These services are essential for overcoming barriers to care and
ensuring treatment plan adherence. With 7 years of experience in
offering navigation services, we have seen the successes firsthand. By
increasing access to navigation services, patients gain the knowledge
needed to navigate the complexities of cancer care, leading to improved
outcomes and heightened satisfaction among patients and caregivers
alike.”  
   
**<u>Irving Lafrancis, Oncologist, Mercy Hospital Joplin Cancer
Center:</u>**  
“Oncology patient navigation is such an important wraparound service in
the continuum of care for the cancer patient. They improve patient care,
access, and communication across the specialties that cancer care
patients utilize. Often equated to a ‘cancer concierge,’ patient
navigators know all of the resources that a patient may need and can
connect them to the needed resources in a timely manner. Our program has
utilized patient navigation for many years and this legislation is
recognition that cancer patient navigation is the standard of care and
the reimbursement will allow expansion of this role in cancer programs
across the country.”  
   
**<u>Electra Paskett, Founding Director of the Center for Cancer Health
Equity and Deputy Director for Population Sciences and Community
Outreach, and Marion Rowley, Designated Chair in Cancer Research, The
Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center:</u>**  
“Far too many people fall through the cracks when it comes to cancer
screening and treatment due to complex and layered barriers. At the
Center for Cancer Health Equity at The Ohio State University
Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research
Institute, we have been at the forefront of validating and championing
patient navigation services to help remove barriers to cancer screening
and care for more than 20 years. Today, we see the impact that
evidence-based patient navigation has in our work, with better screening
adherence and treatment completion among people at historically higher
risk for poor outcomes; simply because they have someone to help them
overcome barriers to care at every step on the journey. We applaud the
Biden administration’s rule, effective January 2024, requiring Medicare
coverage of patient navigation services in high-risk, serious illnesses,
like cancer, and creating a pathway for private insurer coverage. We
welcome additional steps to expand access to this proven service.”  
   
**<u>John Montville, Executive Director of the Oncology Service Line,
Mercy Health — Lourdes Hospital</u>**  
“By allowing billing and, therefore, funding for these important
services, the Biden Cancer Moonshot efforts around cancer navigation
will protect these vital services in programs where they already exist
for cancer patients and allow other cancer programs to add or expand
these services. All cancer patients should consider access to high
quality cancer care a given. But, they also need access to the many
integrative and ancillary care services for their journey with this
terrible disease; and, the foundation of these services is oncology
navigation which gives cancer patients a guide and coach through the
complex and challenging journey that is cancer.”
