  \ Petr Fiala of Czechia to the White\_House"

President Biden will welcome Prime Minister Petr Fiala of Czechia to the
White House on April 15 to further strengthen the U.S.-Czech
relationship. The leaders will reaffirm their resolute support for
Ukraine as it defends against Russia’s war of aggression. Czechia is a
stalwart NATO Ally celebrating a quarter century in the Alliance this
year, and the leaders will underscore their ironclad commitment to NATO,
which makes us all safer. President Biden and Prime Minister Fiala will
coordinate on a range of shared priorities during the visit, including
security issues, economic opportunities that benefit the American and
Czech people, and shared democratic values.
