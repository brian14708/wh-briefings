  \ Leaders, Public Safety Officials and Violence Intervention Organizations on President\_\
  Biden\u2019s Budget Proposals Aimed at Reducing Gun Violence and Violent\_Crime"
---
 
On Tuesday, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention (OGVP)
virtually convened nearly 300 leaders from across the nation to provide
further details and answer questions related to the President’s budget
proposals to keep communities safe from gun violence. The attendees
included state and local leaders, public safety officials, and
organizations focused on reducing community violence.

During the virtual briefing, OGVP Deputy Directors Gregory Jackson and
Rob Wilcox highlighted key parts of the President’s budget proposal
including, but not limited to:

-   $7.3 billion to replenish the Crime Victims Fund to better support
    survivors and families of those lost to gun violence;
-   $5 billion to expand Community Violence Intervention programs at the
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of
    Justice (DOJ) over the next 10 years;
-   $17.7 billion for DOJ law enforcement, including $2 billion for the
    Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to implement
    the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), which represents an
    increase of more than 30 percent since 2021;
-   $800 million in increased funding for the Violence Against Women Act
    programs to combat gender-based violence;
-   $10.9 billion in support of the President’s goal to recruit, train,
    support, and hire 100,000 additional police officers for effective,
    accountable community policing;
-   $1.2 billion over five years to launch a new Violent Crime Reduction
    and Prevention Fund to give federal, state, local, Tribal, and
    territorial law enforcement the dedicated, seasoned support they
    need to focus on violent crime;
-   $60 million to expand research on the causes, impacts and solutions
    to gun violence; and
-   $51 million to support the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI)
    implementation of the enhanced background checks for attempted
    buyers of firearms under 21, which was created by the BSCA.

During the briefing, OGVP also discussed how communities are already
seeing the positive impacts of the President’s strategy to prevent
and reduce crime and gun violence nationwide. Cities around the country
are experiencing historic declines in violent crime, and homicides are
estimated to be down nationally 12% from 2022 to 2023. By comparison,
during the final year of the prior administration in 2020, the United
States saw the largest increase in murders ever recorded. Key provisions
created by the BSCA are starting to deliver results to protect
communities from gun violence, including enhanced background check
provisions that have enabled the DOJ to stop more than 600 illegal gun
purchases by prohibited persons under 21 years old and the first-ever
federal gun trafficking and straw purchasing law.
