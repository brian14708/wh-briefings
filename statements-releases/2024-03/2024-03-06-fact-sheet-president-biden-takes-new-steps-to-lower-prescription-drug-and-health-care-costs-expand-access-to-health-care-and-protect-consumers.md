title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and\
  \ Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health Care, and Protect\_Consumers"
---
 
The President believes that health care is a right, not a privilege, and
since day one, he has delivered health care to millions more Americans
while also lowering health care costs. The President continues to build
on, strengthen, and protect Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care
Act, signing laws such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation
Reduction Act to lower prescription drug costs and health insurance
premiums. Thanks to the President’s efforts, more Americans have health
insurance than under any other President, and are better protected
against surprise medical bills and junk fees. Seniors are already seeing
lower prescription drug prices with insulin capped at $35, free
vaccines, and out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs capped at
$2,000 starting in 2025.  And the Administration is well on its way to
lower the cost of range of drugs as Medicare negotiates over the prices
of prescription drugs for the first time ever. The Biden-Harris
Administration has also taken steps to make sure consumers aren’t
scammed by junk insurance and have better access to mental health
care.  
  
However, the President is not just resting on these accomplishments. 
He’s fighting to deliver even lower costs and better health care to
Americans. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration is acting to lower
prescription drug costs, keep health insurance premiums low, expand
access to health care, especially mental health care coverage, and
continue to protect Americans from getting ripped off.

**Taking on Big Pharma to Deliver Lower Prescription Drug Costs for
Seniors and Families**  
  
After decades of opposition, President Biden enacted a law that finally
takes on Big Pharma and gives Medicare the power to negotiate drug
prices. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act will save millions of
seniors money on some of the costliest prescription drugs on the market.
Meanwhile, Big Pharma
also [executed](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/28/biopharma-biotech-merger-deal-2023-2024) over
$135 billion in mergers and acquisitions in 2023 alone, while passing
the cost to consumers. And eight of the 10 drugs selected for this
year’s negotiation program [raised their
prices](https://www.46brooklyn.com/branddrug-boxscore) in 2024 – after
all 10 drugs were
already [priced](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/PDF_Gumas_IRA_drugs_intl_price_comparison_exhibits.pdf) three
to eight times higher in the United States than in other countries.
President Biden knows how the Inflation Reduction Act is delivering for
American families, and his Administration will continue the fight to
lower health care costs for more Americans.

-   **Announcing that Manufacturers of 10 Drugs Remain at the
    Negotiating Table**. Last month, for the first time in history,
    Medicare has made offers on the fair price for 10 of the most widely
    used and expensive drugs. Medicare is no longer taking whatever
    price for these drugs that the pharmaceutical companies demand. This
    week CMS announced that manufacturers for all 10 selected drugs are
    participating in drug price negotiation, with all manufacturers
    having submitted counteroffers and negotiations continuing.  Later
    this year, new, negotiated prices for the first 10 prescription
    drugs selected for the negotiation program will be announced.  
-   **Let Medicare Negotiate Drug Prices for at least 50 Drugs Every
    Year.** Medicare should not be limited to negotiating just 20 drugs
    per year. Instead, the President is proposing that Medicare be able
    to negotiate prices for the major drugs that seniors rely on, like
    those used for treating heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. The
    Budget cuts federal spending by $200 billion increasing the number
    of drugs Medicare can select for negotiation and bringing more drugs
    into the negotiation process sooner, and other reforms.  
-   **Expand Cap on Out-of-Pocket Prescription Drug Costs.** When the
    $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs applies in Medicare
    in 2025, nearly 19 million seniors and other beneficiaries are
    projected to save $400 per year on prescription drugs. The President
    is calling on Congress to expand the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap to all
    private insurance so that all Americans have the peace of mind that
    comes with knowing that they won’t have to choose between filling
    their prescription or putting food on the table.  
-   **Capping Medicare Cost-Sharing at $2 for Common Generic Drugs.**
    Medicare will be launching a new model to limit Medicare Part D
    cost-sharing for certain generic drugs to $2. As Medicare prepares
    to launch the model, HHS will publish a list of dozens of generic
    drugs for the model, including drugs like statins to treat high
    cholesterol, beta-blockers for high blood pressure, and platelet
    inhibitors to prevent blood clots. In his budget, the President is
    calling on Congress to limit Medicare cost-sharing to $2 for
    high-value generic drugs for all Medicare plans.  
-   **Access to Cell & Gene Therapies**. In January, HHS announced that
    sickle cell disease will be the first focus of the Cell and Gene
    Therapy (CGT) Access Model. Under this model, CMS will negotiate
    with manufacturers on behalf of state Medicaid programs to increase
    affordable access to potentially lifesaving and life-changing
    treatment, and lower health care costs for some of the nation’s most
    vulnerable populations. CMS will release the Request for
    Applications for drug manufacturers of cell and gene therapies to
    participate in the model.  
-   **Expand the IRA’s Requirement that Drug Companies Pay Rebates When
    They Increase Prices Faster than Inflation.** Thanks to the IRA,
    drug manufacturers must now pay rebates to Medicare if their price
    increases for certain drugs exceed inflation. The President is
    calling on Congress to require those rebates for commercial drug
    sales, as well as sales to Medicare. That will save the federal
    government billions of dollars, further curb prescription drug price
    inflation, and reduce health insurance premiums for people with
    private health insurance coverage.

**Putting High-Quality Health Care Within Reach**  
  
Today, more Americans have health insurance than under any President.
The President’s efforts to lower health insurance premiums have led to
record-breaking enrollment in the Affordable Care Act’s Marketplaces,
with over 21 million people signing up for coverage – 9 million more
than when the President took office. The Biden-Harris Administration
isn’t stopping there and is building on this incredible success by:

-   **Keeping Health Insurance Premiums Low.** Thanks to the President’s
    American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act, millions of
    Americans are saving on average $800 a year on premiums. The
    Biden-Harris Administration is committed to keeping health insurance
    premiums low, giving families more breathing room and the peace of
    mind that health insurance brings. To do that, the President is
    calling on Congress to make the expanded premium tax credits that
    the Inflation Reduction Act extended permanent. Without
    Congressional action, millions of Americans will see their health
    insurance premiums spike by hundreds or thousands of dollars
    starting in the fall of 2025.  
-   **Closing the Medicaid Coverage Gap.** The President continues to
    call on Congress to provide Medicaid-like coverage to people in the
    10 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion as well as
    keeping Medicaid expansion enrollees covered.  
-   **Keeping Kids Covered.** Investing in our nation’s children is a
    top priority for the President. Research shows that when children
    have health insurance, they thrive: they’re healthier, they do
    better in school, and are more likely to succeed in adulthood.
    Keeping children covered is the right thing to do, which is why the
    President wants to make sure that children can never lose coverage
    due to red tape from birth until they turn age 6, and that families
    only have to submit Medicaid paperwork once every three years.  
-   **Closing Research Gaps in Women’s Health Research.** In November
    2023, the President and the First Lady launched the first-ever White
    House Initiative on Women’s Health Research to fundamentally change
    how our nation approaches and funds women’s health research. Women
    make up more than half the population but have been understudied and
    underrepresented in health research for far too long. Tonight, the
    President is calling on Congress to make a bold, transformative
    investment of $12 billion in new funding for women’s health
    research**. **These investments will support a new fund at the
    National Institutes of Health to advance an interdisciplinary
    research agenda and create a new nationwide network of research
    centers of excellence and innovation in women’s health. The
    Initiative will also catalyze private and philanthropic commitments
    to increase funding for women’s health research. These new resources
    will make investments that maximize our ability to prevent,
    diagnose, and treat health conditions in women and ensure women get
    the answers they need when it comes to their health.   
-   **Making Home Care More Available.** Thanks to the American Rescue
    Plan, President Biden delivered $37 billion to all states to expand
    access to home care and improve the quality of caregiving jobs. The
    Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to improve the quality
    of Medicaid home care services and to make sure home care workers
    get a bigger share of Medicaid payments for these critical
    services.  The President remains committed to further improving and
    expanding Medicaid home care services, and is calling on Congress to
    do their part to allow the hundreds of thousands of older adults and
    individuals with disabilities on Medicaid home care waiting list to
    remain in their homes and stay active in their communities while
    continuing to improve the quality of jobs for caregivers.  
-   **Ensuring Access to Mental Health Care.** Ensuring robust access to
    mental health care has been a bipartisan priority for almost 15
    years, including the enactment of mental health parity requirements
    which require health plans to cover mental health care benefits at
    the same levels as physical health care benefits. Yet today, too
    many Americans still struggle to find and afford the care they need.
    The President is committed to tackling the mental health crisis in
    this country, which means making health plans do their part and
    providing agencies with the needed support to make sure they’re
    doing so. The Biden-Harris Administration is working to finalize the
    mental health parity rule, which would close existing loopholes as
    well as ensure health plans evaluate access to mental health care in
    their networks, and make changes if it’s found to be inadequate. In
    addition, the President is calling on Congress to further increase
    access to mental health care by expanding coverage in Medicare and
    private insurance, applying the mental health parity requirements to
    Medicare beneficiaries, and extending Medicare incentive programs to
    address mental health provider shortages.

**Cracking Down on Junk Insurance, Surprise Bills and Fees, and
Confusing Health Care Pricing**  
  
Nothing infuriates the President more than seeing Americans get ripped
off. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized
implementing surprise billing protections, preventing 1 million
Americans from receiving surprise medical bills every single month. The
President has also taken steps to prevent Americans from being ripped
off by junk insurance that preys on vulnerable citizens by closing
loopholes to ensure consumers know what they’re buying and can get the
health coverage that best meets their needs. But more can be done to
protect consumers, which is why the President intends to:

-   **Prevent More Surprise Medical Bills.** Today, Americans are
    protected from receiving medical bills for most emergency care and
    air ambulance services as well as when consumers didn’t know they
    were getting care from an out-of-network provider despite doing
    their homework and going to an in-network facility for treatment. 
    The President wants to further protect consumers by applying
    surprise billing protections to ground ambulance providers. The last
    thing people should worry about during an emergency is an unexpected
    bill for their ambulance ride.  
-   **Crack Down on Junk Insurance.** Last year, the Biden-Harris
    Administration proposed a monumental rule to help millions of
    Americans access high-quality, affordable health insurance and
    protect consumers from being discriminated against because of
    pre-existing conditions. Making sure Americans aren’t scammed into
    low-quality coverage, and charged more or denied life-saving care is
    a key priority for the Administration, which is why we are working
    to finalize proposed rules that limit the availability of junk
    insurance.

**<u>Honoring America’s Commitment to Seniors</u>**  
The President has always believed that Medicare and Social Security are
a promise—a rock-solid guarantee generations of Americans have counted
on to be able to retire with dignity and security. The President will
reject any efforts to cut the Medicare or Social Security benefits that
seniors and people with disabilities have earned and paid into their
entire working lives. The Budget honors that ironclad commitment—not
only by rejecting benefit cuts, but by embracing reforms and investments
that will protect and strengthen both programs. The President is
committed to working with Congress to ensure Medicare and Social
Security remain strong for their beneficiaries, now and in the future.

-   **Securing Medicare.** In his budget, the President is calling on
    Congress to ensure that high-income individuals contribute their
    fair share to Medicare and directs revenue from the Net Investment
    Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was originally intended. In
    addition, the President has proposed to direct savings from further
    lowering drug costs into the Medicare trust fund.  If Congress were
    to heed the President’s call and enact these reforms, it would
    substantially extend solvency for the Medicare HI Trust Fund,
    guaranteeing seniors the benefits they have been promised.  
-   **Protects Seniors’ Health and Dignity.** As President Biden
    [pledged](https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/) to do
    two years ago in the State of the Union, the Biden-Harris
    Administration is “set\[ting\] higher standards for nursing homes
    and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that
    they expect.” The nursing home industry receives billions of dollars
    of taxpayer funding each year, but for too long, many facilities
    have not had the staff required to give residents safe, high-quality
    care. That is changing. HHS has proposed a new rule establishing a
    federal floor for nursing home staffing, so that owners cannot cut
    staffing to unsafe levels simply to turn a profit. This includes a
    proposal for every facility to have a Registered Nurse on site 24/7,
    in addition to minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides
    to assist with care. Earlier this year, HHS also
    [finalized](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/11/15/biden-harris-administration-continues-unprecedented-efforts-increase-transparency-nursing-home-ownership.html)
    a rule to increase transparency in nursing home ownership, making it
    easier for residents and their loved ones to hold facilities
    accountable. The final rule was just submitted to the Office of
    Management and Budget for review

**Strong Record on Expanding and Strengthening Health Care
Nationwide**  
  
The President’s new actions are all in addition to an already impressive
track record on fighting for the health care of Americans across the
nation. Over the last three years, the President has:

-   Expanded health insurance through the ACA Marketplaces to an
    additional nine million Americans and helped over one million people
    in Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Dakota gain
    Medicaid coverage.
-   Extended postpartum Medicaid coverage to nearly 700,000 women across
    44 states and the District of Columbia.
-   Kept children covered continuously in Medicaid and CHIP for a full
    year.
-   Made it easier for people to enroll in the ACA Marketplaces and
    Medicaid, including for older adults that are covered by both
    Medicaid and Medicare.
-   Made critical vaccines free for all Medicare beneficiaries as well
    as adults enrolled in Medicaid, with seniors on Medicare saving on
    average $70 in out-of-pockets for vaccines.
-   Lowered maximum out of pocket costs for Americans with employer and
    ACA coverage by an average of $400.
-   Capped out-of-pocket costs at $35 for a month’s supply of insulin
    for seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare.
-   Lowered coinsurance for seniors that took the 47 drugs covered by
    Medicare Part B that hiked prices faster than inflation in 2023,
    with some enrollees saving as much as $618 per dose.
