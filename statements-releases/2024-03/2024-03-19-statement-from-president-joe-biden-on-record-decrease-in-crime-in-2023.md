title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record Decrease in Crime in\_2023"
---
 
Across America, families want the same thing: the freedom to feel safe
in their community. To know their kids are secure. My Administration is
making it a reality. This week, the FBI released data showing that crime
declined across nearly every category in 2023. Last year, we also had
one of the lowest rates of all violent crime in more than 50 years and
the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history. That’s good news
for the American people.

In 2020, before I took office, the prior administration oversaw the
largest increase in murders ever recorded. My Administration got to work
on day one to fix that. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which every
Republican in Congress voted against, we made the largest-ever federal
investment in fighting and preventing crime at any time in our history.
That enabled cities and states to invest $15 billion in public
safety. This record investment in crime reduction – in community
violence intervention, mental health and additional officers – is
delivering results. It is keeping law enforcement on the beat, and
keeping communities safe from violence. My Administration is also taking
on the crisis of gun violence head on, with more executive actions on
gun violence than any President in history and signing the most
significant law to address gun violence in almost 30 years.

Keeping communities safe is my priority. While we’ve made major
progress, we still have more work to do. That’s why I’ll keep fighting
to make more investments in preventing crime, to fund additional
accountable police officers to ensure trust between law enforcement and
the communities they serve, and to ban assault weapons to keep guns out
of dangerous hands – and I will continue to urge Republicans in Congress
to join me.
