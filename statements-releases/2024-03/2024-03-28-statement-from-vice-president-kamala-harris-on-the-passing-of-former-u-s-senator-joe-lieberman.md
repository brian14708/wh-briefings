title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Former U.S.\
  \ Senator Joe\_Lieberman"
---
 
Senator Joe Lieberman dedicated his life to public service and building
a stronger America.  
  
Throughout his career—as a member of the Connecticut State Senate, as
Attorney General of Connecticut, and as United States Senator from
Connecticut—he worked across the aisle on behalf of the American
people.  
  
Senator Lieberman was one of the first lawmakers to raise the alarm
about the urgency of the climate crisis. He played a vital role in
repealing “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” making it possible for LGBTQ+
Americans to serve openly in our armed forces. He traveled the world to
stand up for American interests and values and believed deeply in the
importance of America’s global leadership. And he broke barriers in his
bid for the Vice Presidency as the first Jewish candidate on a major
party presidential ticket, showing countless Americans what was
possible.  
  
In all that he did, Senator Lieberman was driven by a fierce belief in
America—in our values, our people, and our future. Doug and I send our
prayers to his wife, Hadassah, and the entire Lieberman family.
