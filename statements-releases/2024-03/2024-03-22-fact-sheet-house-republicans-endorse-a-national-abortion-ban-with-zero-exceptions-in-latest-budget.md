title: "FACT SHEET: House Republicans Endorse a National Abortion Ban with Zero Exceptions\
  \ in Latest\_Budget"
---
 
This week, the Republican Study Committee, which represents 100% of
House Republican leadership and nearly 80% of their members, released a
budget that—among its many other anti-choice restrictions—endorses a
national abortion ban with zero exceptions for rape or incest.

The Republican Study Committee budget:

-   Supports eliminating reproductive freedom for all women in every
    state and puts IVF treatment squarely on the chopping block through
    House Republicans’ support for the *Life at Conception Act*.

<!-- -->

-   Endorses banning mifepristone – an FDA-approved, safe and effective
    medication that has been on the market for more than 20 years.

<!-- -->

-   Supports rolling back policies that help ensure our Nation’s
    veterans have access to abortion care when their health or lives are
    at risk or in cases of rape or incest.

<!-- -->

-   Guts funding for contraception—which is supported by the vast
    majority of Americans on both sides of the aisle—for low-income and
    uninsured women. This would further erode access to essential health
    care, from cancer screening to primary care, at a time when state
    abortion bans have already forced health clinics that provide
    contraception and other critical health services to close.

If House Republicans get their way, all of these proposals would become
the law of the land.

When the Supreme Court – enabled by justices nominated by Donald Trump –
overturned *Roe v. Wade* and allowed politicians to intrude in the most
personal decisions women and families can make, it paved the road for
Republican elected officials to pursue their extreme agenda. Their
latest budget advances that extreme agenda.

Republican elected officials have already imposed abortion bans in 21
states and last year, they introduced more than 380 state bills
attacking access to reproductive health care. And, as the Republican
Study Committee budget makes clear, they won’t stop until a national
abortion ban is in place.

President Biden has been clear: he will do everything in his power to
[fight back and protect reproductive
health](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-the-fight-for-reproductive-freedom/)
from these extreme attacks and he will continue to call on Congress to
restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade* into federal law so that women
can make their own health care decisions.
