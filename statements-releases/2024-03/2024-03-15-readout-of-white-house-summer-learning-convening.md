This week, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden and U.S. Deputy
Secretary of Education Cindy Marten hosted a Summer Learning Convening
at the White House as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
[Improving Student Achievement
Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-improving-student-achievement-agenda-in-2024/)
focused on improving academic performance for every child in schools
through the adoption of three evidence-based strategies: (1) increasing
student attendance; (2) providing high-dosage tutoring; and (3)
increasing summer learning and extended or afterschool learning time.  
   
This convening provided an opportunity to hear from representatives from
the National League of Cities, Tuscaloosa, AL and Rochester, NY on their
collaborative efforts to increase access to [high-quality summer
learning programs](https://www.ed.gov/raisethebar/academic-success) as a
key strategy to increase student achievement. The Tuscaloosa City
Schools Summer Program is an early champion of summer learning heading
into its fourth year with 19 programs that serve 3,000 students. The
Rochester City School District worked with community partners to
establish 30 summer programs, such as a program at St. John Fisher
University which provided learning support to over 5,000 students.  
   
This convening comes on the heels of the Biden-Harris Administration
Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request, which proposes $8 billion in new
mandatory funding for Academic Acceleration and Achievement Grants to
support student success across States and districts and the Department
of Education’s recently launched [Engage Every Student Recognition
program](https://engageeverystudent.org/engage-every-student-recognition-program/)
to spotlight high quality summer learning and afterschool programs
across the nation that are improving academic and other outcomes for
children and youth.  
   
Participants in the convening included:

-   Neera Tanden, Assistant to the President and Director of the
    Domestic Policy Council
-   Cindy Marten, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education
-   Simeon Banister, President & CEO, Rochester Area Community
