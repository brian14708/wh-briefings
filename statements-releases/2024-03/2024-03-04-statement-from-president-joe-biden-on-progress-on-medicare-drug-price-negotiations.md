title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Progress on Medicare Drug Price\_Negotiations"
---
 
Lowering costs for Americans is one of my top priorities, and today
we’re one step closer to bringing down the cost of prescription drugs
for millions of seniors. That’s because Medicare has the power to
negotiate prescription drug prices for the first time in history. As
part of that process, Medicare selected ten drugs for negotiation, and
last month Medicare sent offers to the manufacturers of those ten drugs,
representing the first time Medicare has ever been able to stand up for
a fair price for seniors through direct drug price negotiation.  
   
Today, my Administration is announcing that manufacturers for all ten
selected drugs will continue to participate in drug price negotiations,
as all manufacturers have submitted counteroffers. This is an important
milestone in our fight to give seniors the best possible deal on their
prescription drugs and in lowering health care costs for all families.
And it comes in the face of attacks from Big Pharma in the courts and
from Republicans in Congress who continue to try to repeal the Inflation
Reduction Act which would keep seniors on Medicare from benefitting from
these lower cost drugs.  
   
In my State of the Union address this week, I will discuss my
Administration’s efforts to lower health care costs and how we will
continue to take on Big Pharma to make prescription drugs more
affordable for all Americans.
