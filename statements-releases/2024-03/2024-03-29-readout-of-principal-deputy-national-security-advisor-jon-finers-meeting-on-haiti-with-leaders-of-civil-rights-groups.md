Today, Assistant to the President and Principal Deputy National Security
Advisor Jon Finer met with leaders of U.S.-based Black civil rights
groups to have a dialogue about the crisis in Haiti and U.S. efforts to
support the Haitian people. Mr. Finer underscored the Administration’s
commitment to ensuring a better future for Haiti and outlined the steps
taken by the United States to work with Haitian stakeholders and
international partners to address instability in Haiti, including by
supporting the UN-authorized Multinational Security Support (MSS)
mission to Haiti and lifting up Haitian-led solutions to the political
impasse.  
  
Additionally, White House officials shared the President’s authorization
to provide urgently needed assistance to Haitian security forces to aid
in the protection of civilians and critical infrastructure against
organized and targeted gang attacks.  During the conversation, Mr. Finer
reaffirmed the United States’ determination to work with Haitian and
international partners over the long-term to advance democratic
governance, citizen security, and economic progress in Haiti.  The
United States remains the single largest donor of humanitarian
assistance to Haiti, providing over $170 million since October 2022.   
  
Civil rights leaders shared their advice, including the urgent need for
more international assistance for Haiti and greater public awareness
about the deep security challenges that Haitians are facing.  The
leaders also highlighted the importance of bolstering Haitian-driven
efforts to restore political stability and address the deep humanitarian
needs in Haiti, drawing upon support from Haitian diaspora and Black
communities in the United States.  
  
The United States remains committed to supporting the Haitian people and
recognizes the positive role that U.S. civil society and diaspora
communities can play in ensuring a successful and sustainable resolution
to the crisis in Haiti.
