title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Stabbing Attack in Rockford,\_\
  Illinois"
---
 
Jill and I were horrified to learn of the brutal attack carried out in
Rockford last night, which took the lives of four people, including one
fifteen-year-old. Seven others were tragically wounded as a result of
this senseless violence. We are praying for the families of those who
lost loved ones, and hoping that all those injured make a full recovery.
We are also grateful for the heroic actions of local law enforcement,
who confronted the suspect and prevented the loss of more innocent
life.  
  
Federal law enforcement have offered all available assistance to local
law enforcement as they investigate this heinous act. In the meantime,
my Administration will do everything in its power to help the people of
Rockford and the broader community recover from this traumatic event.   
  
Families across America want the same thing: the freedom to feel safe in
their community. That is my priority and the reason we’ve made major
investments to provide communities with resources and law enforcement
officers to prevent and fight crime. This tragic event is a reminder
that we must continue to ensure that our police and first responders
have the support they need to do their jobs and keep us safe.
