---
 
When President Biden came into office, he promised to fight to lower
health care costs for American families. By passing the Inflation
Reduction Act, the President and Congressional Democrats finally allowed
Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors – while
every single Republican in Congress voted against it.  
   
Big Pharma and their allies have filed lawsuits all around the country
to try to block Medicare from getting the best deal for American
seniors. Today, a district court in Delaware rejected their
efforts. This represents the third district court to side with the
Administration in cases challenging the President’s prescription drug
law, and is the first case to be fully decided on the merits.  
   
While Big Pharma continues to use the courts to try to thwart lower
prices for consumers, today’s win is an important victory. The President
will never stop fighting to lower drug costs for the American people.
