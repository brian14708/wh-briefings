title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces New Actions to Lower Costs for Americans\
  \ by Fighting Corporate\_Rip-Offs"
---
 
*Launch of Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing; New Actions to
Slash Credit Card Late Fees, Combat High Internet Costs, and Support
Small Farmers; And New Report Showing That Administration Efforts to
Eliminate Junk Fees Will Save Over $20 Billion Annually*  

President Biden is laser focused on lowering costs for hardworking
Americans by taking action to end corporate rip-offs and other unfair
practices that keep prices high. Under the President’s leadership,
agencies across the Administration are working to promote competition,
protect consumers, and lower prices by implementing the President’s
[Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
Economy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/).  
  
**Today, President Biden will launch a new Strike Force to crack down on
unfair and illegal pricing.** President Biden is committed to making
sure corporations are held accountable when they try to rip off
Americans, including when they break the law while keeping prices high.
To that end, the President is establishing a new Strike Force on Unfair
and Illegal Pricing co-chaired by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This Strike Force will strengthen
interagency efforts to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior that
hikes prices on American families through anti-competitive, unfair,
deceptive, or fraudulent business practices. DOJ and FTC, along with
other agencies on the Strike Force, will focus their collaborative
efforts on key sectors where corporations may be violating the law and
keeping prices high, including prescription drugs and health care, food
and grocery, housing, financial services, and more.  
  
**At its sixth meeting, President Biden’s Competition Council will
announce three new actions to promote competition and lower costs and
release a new report showing that the Administration’s work to eliminate
junk fees will save Americans more than $20 billion each year:**

-   **Ending excessive credit card late fees**. Today, The Consumer
    Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finalized a
    [rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-bans-excessive-credit-card-late-fees-lowers-typical-fee-from-32-to-8/)
    to slash credit card late fees from the current average of $32 down
    to $8, saving consumers $10 billion a year, or an average savings of
    $220 per year for the more than 45 million people who are charged
    these late fees annually. For too long, surprise and hidden late
    fees have burdened consumers. By closing the loophole that has
    allowed companies to charge these excessive late fees, today’s
    action will not only save consumers billions of dollars but promote
    fair and competitive markets. It builds off of steps the CFPB has
    already taken to crack down on junk fees in the banking sector,
    including fees for basic customer services and moving to curb
    overdraft fees and bounced check fees. In addition, the CFPB has
    found that [credit card interest rate
    margins](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/credit-card-interest-rate-margins-at-all-time-high/)
    have climbed to an all-time high and [big banks are charging more in
    interest](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-finds-large-banks-charge-higher-credit-card-interest-rates-than-small-banks-and-credit-unions/)
    than smaller banks.
-   **Saving consumers more than $20 billion in junk fees.** A new
    [blog](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/03/05/the-price-isnt-right-how-junk-fees-cost-consumers-and-undermine-competition/)
    published today by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that
    actions from the Biden-Harris Administration will help eliminate
    more than $20 billion in junk fees annually going forward. Analysis
    of a number of major sectors across the economy show that consumers
    pay $90 billion in junk fees every year, including on live event
    tickets, internet and cable fees, apartment rentals, banking fees,
    auto dealer fees, and more. The CEA analysis cites extensive
    literature that indicates fees dripped in throughout the purchasing
    process after the consumer has already made decisions about what to
    buy make it difficult to comparison shop, disadvantage businesses
    that don’t want to employ junk fees, and lead to consumers paying
    more.
-   **Cracking down on bulk billing junk fees to lower costs and promote
    competition.** The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is
    circulating a proposed
    [rule](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-lower-broadband-costs-apartment-buildings)
    that would lower costs and increase choice for consumers by banning
    “bulk billing” arrangements, a practice by which landlords or
    providers charge everyone living or working in a building for a
    particular internet, cable, or satellite service, even if they don’t
    want it or haven’t opted in. These arrangements limit consumer
    choice by preventing tenants from choosing the services at the price
    point and level that are best for their needs, and can impose fees
    for unnecessary services and deter competition. In addition, the
    proposed rule seeks to address other exclusive arrangements between
    service providers and landlords that impede competition and drive-up
    prices, such as exclusive wiring arrangements, exclusive marketing
    arrangements, and certain revenue sharing agreements.
-   **Promoting competitive agricultural markets and ensuring fairness
    for farmers and ranchers.** Fair competition is key to making sure
    America’s food markets operate effectively and producers and
    consumers have robust choices and opportunity. Today, the Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) finalized a
    [rule](https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/unfair-practices-violation-packers-and-stockyards-act)
    to protect the farmers and ranchers who produce meat and poultry by
    cracking down on processing companies’ deceptive contracts, banning
    retaliatory practices that prevent small producers from raising
    concerns or coming together in associations, and protecting certain
    producers from discrimination. USDA’s work across the agricultural
    supply chain helps support more competition, which can lower food
    prices.

**Today’s announcements build on far-reaching work the Competition
Council has undertaken during the seven months since its last meeting,
including:**

-   **Cracking down on junk fees that cost consumers $90 billion each
    year.** [The FTC has proposed a
    rule](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-broad-new-actions-to-protect-consumers-from-billions-in-junk-fees/)
    that, if finalized as proposed, would ban companies from charging
    hidden and surprise junk fees and require that prices are listed
    upfront when consumers make purchases. In addition, [the FTC
    finalized a
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-announces-cars-rule-fight-scams-vehicle-shopping)
    to ban auto dealers from using bait-and-switch tactics to deceive
    consumers and to stop auto dealers from charging hidden junk fees
    for services that provide no additional value. The [Department of
    Labor also proposed a
    rule](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/31/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-protect-retirement-security-by-cracking-down-on-junk-fees-in-retirement-investment-advice/)
    that would reduce junk fees in retirement products and help ensure
    that the financial advice that Americans get about their retirement
    is in their best interest. Finally, the [FCC proposed a
    rule](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-rules-eliminate-video-service-junk-fees#:~:text=This%20Notice%20of%20Proposed%20Rulemaking,period%20of%20the%20service%20contract.)
    to ban early termination fees for cable and satellite operators, and
    [later this month will vote to finalize a
    rule](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400631A1.pdf) to
    mandate all-in pricing for cable and satellite services.
-   **Prohibiting financial product comparison shopping tools from
    steering consumers to products based on kickbacks.** The CFPB
    [issued a
    circular](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-to-rein-in-rigged-comparison-shopping-results-for-credit-cards-and-other-financial-products/)
    stating that companies that provide consumers with comparison
    shopping tools—say for a credit card, loan, or bank account—are
    prohibited from steering consumers to products or lenders because
    they are receiving a kickback. Individuals often use these sites
    thinking they are receiving unbiased comparisons; manipulated
    results makes it difficult for consumers to honestly evaluate
    products, and may result in choosing a less advantageous product.
-   **Promoting competition in food and grocery markets.** USDA
    continues to support new entrants in food markets, protect farmers
    and ranchers, and lower prices for consumers. This includes
    supporting domestic fertilizer production with over [$50 million in
    grants](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/10/16/usda-highlights-progress-partnering-farmers-increase-innovative)
    awarded in October as part of up to $900 million in funding for the
    program. USDA also
    [finalized](https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/transparency-poultry-grower-contracting-and-tournaments)
    a rule to improve poultry markets by making sure poultry growers
    receive the information they need about costs and payments from the
    large corporations they work with.
-   **Making health care markets more affordable and competitive.** In
    December, the Department of Commerce
    [released](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/12/nist-releases-public-comment-draft-guidance-march-rights__;!!FiG2giev53vN!4262pKH99yKCCeSiTy_TnNbp6lZbsNUTgpqA0luJF_7Klud-ru6-N1NW9FtVzMkqhnwqgvv6ud7lX1AxlM_wT_yngg$)
    a proposed framework providing guidance that agencies can consider
    price as a factor when determining whether to exercise march-in
    rights for federally funded inventions connected to prescription
    drugs. In addition, HHS rejected more than 1,000 Medicare Advantage
    TV marketing ads in one year that were misleading to consumers and
    [proposed a
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/11/06/biden-harris-administration-proposes-protect-people-medicare-advantage-prescription-drug-coverage-predatory-marketing-promote-healthy-competition-increase-access-behavioral-health-care-medicare.html)
    that if finalized will prohibit insurance companies from paying
    brokers to steer patients towards certain plans based on
    compensation, rather than options that meet best patient health
    needs. Additionally, HHS
    [proposed](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hhs-updates-2024-medicare-advantage-program-and-part-d-payment-policies)
    to protect Medicare consumers from third parties selling their
    information without their consent. HHS also took historic steps to
    [break
    up](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/02/06/health-resources-and-services-administration-takes-historic-new-steps-transform-organ-transplant-system-better-serve-patients.html)
    the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network vendor monopoly.
    Finally, FTC and HHS
    [launched](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/ftc-hhs-seek-public-comment-generic-drug-shortages-competition-amongst-powerful-middlemen)
    a probe into anti-competitive behavior by group purchasing
    organizations (GPOs) and drug wholesalers that may contribute to
    generic drug shortages and HHS is [seeking
    input](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/01/25/biden-harris-administration-launches-effort-increase-medicare-advantage-transparency.html)
    on how the agency can increase transparency and promote competition
    in Medicare Advantage markets.
-   **Improving transportation systems.** The Surface Transportation
    Board has proposed a new [reciprocal switching
    rule](https://www.stb.gov/news-communications/latest-news/pr-23-16/)
    to improve efficiency and increase competition for moving goods
    across the country, by creating an opportunity for competitors to
    share the tracks with railroads that fail to provide reliable
    service. The Federal Maritime Commission is also implementing the
    bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act signed by President Biden,
    including issuing a [final
    rule](https://www.fmc.gov/fmc-publishes-final-rule-on-detention-and-demurrage-billing-practices/)
    that provides new clarity and timelines on when shippers like
    farmers and retailers can be billed by ocean carriers. Finally, the
    Department of Transportation levied a [record $140 million
    penalty](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/dot-penalizes-southwest-airlines-140-million-2022-holiday-meltdown)
    on Southwest Airlines for their 2022 holiday meltdown—$90 million of
    the penalty will go towards compensating future Southwest passengers
    affected by cancellations or significant delays caused by the
    airline.
-   **Institutionalizing competition.** [The FTC and DOJ recently
    finalized updated merger
    guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/federal-trade-commission-justice-department-release-2023-merger-guidelines)
    to reflect the realities of the modern economy and help promote
    fair, open, and competitive markets as the two agencies review
    mergers that come before them. Further, the Office of Information
    and Regulatory Affairs [released new
    guidance](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/10/11/promoting-competitive-markets-through-regulatory-design/)
    to ensure that competition continues to be at the center of future
    federal rulemaking.
-   **Lowering costs and improving access in the communications
    sector.** The FCC is [working to restore
    net](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-83A1.pdf)
    neutrality, which will prohibit Internet Service Providers from
    blocking legal content, throttling speeds, and creating fast lanes
    that favor those who can pay for access. The FCC also adopted rules
    that prohibit [digital
    discrimination](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-rules-prevent-eliminate-digital-discrimination)
    in high-speed Internet access based on income, race, ethnicity,
    religion, and national origin, which will protect civil rights,
    lower costs, and increase internet access for Americans across the
    country.
