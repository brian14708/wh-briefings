title: "Statement by National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on U.S.\
  \ Sanctions on Zimbabwean Individuals and\_Entities"

In Zimbabwe we continue to witness gross abuses of political, economic,
and human rights.  The targeting of civil society and severe
restrictions on political activity have stifled fundamental freedoms,
while key actors, including government leaders, have siphoned off public
resources for personal gains.  These illicit activities support and
contribute to a global criminal network of bribery, smuggling, and money
laundering that impoverish communities in Zimbabwe, southern Africa, and
other parts of the world.  
   
In response to new and continuing corruption and serious human rights
abuse, the United States is refocusing and elevating its efforts to hold
accountable the individuals and entities that are responsible for this
exploitation.  Today, the United States is employing a new set of tools
in Zimbabwe, including the flagship [Global Magnitsky sanctions
program](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/global-magnitsky-sanctions),
to make clear that the egregious behavior of some of the most powerful
people and companies in Zimbabwe matches the actions of the worst human
rights abusers and corrupt actors globally.    
   
Specifically, the Department of the Treasury is designating three
entities and eleven individuals, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa,
Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Brigadier General (Retired) Walter
Tapfumaneyi, and businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, pursuant to Executive
Order 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human
Rights Accountability Act, for their involvement in corruption or
serious human rights abuse. These designations build on recent U.S.
Government actions, including pausing U.S. participation in the African
Development Bank Dialogue and utilizing the Department of State’s
[new](https://www.state.gov/visa-restriction-policy-for-undermining-democracy-in-zimbabwe/)
visa restriction policy for undermining democracy in Zimbabwe. These
steps are concurrent with the termination of the preexisting Zimbabwe
sanctions program that began in March 2003 and expanded on in subsequent
orders.  Actions to retire the previous sanctions program and designate
key actors under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program are part of an
ongoing effort to ensure we are promoting accountability for serious
human rights abuse and corruption in a targeted and strategic manner.   
   
Sanctions on these individuals and entities do not represent sanctions
on Zimbabwe or its public.  The Administration reaffirms its commitment
to work with the people of Zimbabwe; will continue to robustly support
civil society, human rights defenders, and independent media to promote
values consistent with the *Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act
of 2001*; and take additional measures to hold accountable those who
deny Zimbabweans the democratic freedoms and good governance they
deserve.
