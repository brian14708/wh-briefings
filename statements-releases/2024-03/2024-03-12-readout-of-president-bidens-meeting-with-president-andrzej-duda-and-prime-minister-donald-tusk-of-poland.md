President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. welcomed President Andrzej Duda and Prime
Minister Donald Tusk of Poland for a joint meeting at the White House on
March 12.  This historic visit marked the 25th anniversary of Poland’s
accession to NATO and underscores our two nations’ ironclad commitment
to the NATO Alliance, which makes us all safer.  The leaders committed
to ensuring continued support of Ukraine’s self-defense against Russia’s
war of aggression.  They also discussed the strong U.S.-Polish energy
security partnership and the enduring importance of democratic values.  
   
At the meeting, President Biden shared the United States will move
forward with a new $2 billion Foreign Military Financing (FMF) direct
loan to Poland to bolster its security and support its
defense modernization using previously appropriated congressional
funds. This loan will enable Poland’s purchase of additional U.S.
defense equipment, further  supporting U.S. jobs and our deepening
security relationship. The President also shared that the United States
will offer to sell Poland 96 AH-64 Apache helicopters.  This is a major
step to provide Poland’s armed forces with cutting-edge capability to
defend itself, strengthen NATO interoperability, and further bolster the
U.S. defense industry.
