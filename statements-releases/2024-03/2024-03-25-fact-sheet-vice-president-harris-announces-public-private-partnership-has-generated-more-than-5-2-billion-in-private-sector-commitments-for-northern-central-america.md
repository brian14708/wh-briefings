title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Public-Private Partnership Has\
  \ Generated More Than $5.2 Billion in Private Sector Commitments for Northern Central\_\
  America"
---
 
*More than $1 billion in new commitments announced today will create
economic opportunity and help address the root causes of migration in
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.*

Vice President Kamala Harris and the Partnership for Central America
(PCA) today announced more than $1 billion in new private sector
commitments, as part of Central America Forward (CAF), a public-private
partnership that was created in response to the Vice President’s Call to
Action for Northern Central America.  
  
Today’s announcement brings the overall total of new commitments to more
than $5.2 billion since May 2021.  
  
To date, CAF and other PCA partners include more than 50 companies and
organizations that have made commitments to support inclusive economic
growth in the region. These entities represent the financial services,
textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology and telecommunications,
and nonprofit sectors, among others.  
  
These investments are creating jobs, connecting people to the digital
economy, expanding access to financing for small businesses, providing
training and education for youth, women and workers, and improving
economic livelihoods for people in the region.  
  
These investments are materializing into tangible opportunities for
families and communities across integrated supply chains in Central
America and the United States – benefiting students, employees,
entrepreneurs, and families – and shaping a model for mobilizing private
sector commitments through collective action to drive economic
development.   
  
**NEW COMMITMENTS**  
The following companies and organizations announced major new
commitments today:

-   **Acceso **is a global social enterprise committed to creating
    fundamental and lasting economic change in the lives of rural
    smallholder farming families. From 2023 to 2028, Acceso will invest
    $3.6 million directly in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as
    part of a larger $30 million program to scale its proven
    seed-to-market model to strengthen local food systems, improve
    incomes and livelihoods, and increase women’s economic security.
    Over 10,000 producers in the agricultural, aquaculture, and
    artisanal fishing sectors will benefit directly from this
    investment, with an additional 30,000 benefiting from parallel
    collaborative efforts. The project will begin in El Salvador in
    partnership with USAID and the launch of the “Sustainable Market
    Access Project.”
-   **Banco Cuscatlan**, the second-largest bank in El Salvador, has
    committed to invest more than $30 million in El Salvador over the
    next five years, primarily in financial inclusion initiatives. These
    initiatives will enable 600,000 individuals to manage their money
    within the formal economy, providing access to more financial
    services, promoting investment in assets, increasing their savings,
    and fostering entrepreneurship. These initiatives are designed to
    create opportunities and promote sustainable development for future
    generations.
-   **Corporación AG**, the largest steel producer in Central America,
    plans to invest more than $150 million in Guatemala over the next
    three years to increase its production and distribution capacity and
    anticipates generating more than 500 full-time jobs and more than
    1,000 indirect jobs.
-   **Ficohsa**, a leading provider of financial services in the region,
    committed to increasing their small and medium enterprise (SME) loan
    portfolio by $490 million over the next five years, prioritizing the
    growth of women-led businesses through preferential loans,
    insurance, and financial education. Additionally, Ficohsa will
    invest $50 million in digital services to expand financial inclusion
    and ensure that a greater share of remittances are banked and
    invested in assets, savings, and businesses. 
-   **JA (Junior Achievement) Worldwide**, one of the world’s largest
    youth-serving NGOs, will commit $3.6 million through an impact
    consortium that will provide labor skills training and technical
    certifications to over 1,800 vulnerable girls in Guatemala,
    Honduras, and El Salvador. The initiative aims to reduce gender
    inequality by promoting women’s employment in the technology
    industry, facilitate access to employment and self-employment, with
    the goal of reducing migration due to lack of economic
    opportunities. 
-   **Meta **will make a 3-year commitment to train 250,000 youth,
    entrepreneurs and small business owners in El Salvador, Guatemala,
    and Honduras by July 2025.  Additionally, Meta is supporting an
    initiative to help over 9,000 women from Guatemala, El Salvador, and
    Honduras including women who lead small and medium-sized enterprises
    to establish their online presence, seize the opportunities afforded
    by immersive technologies such as augmented reality, access
    financial services, and expand their operations to international
    markets.
-   **Pearson **is committed to helping improve workforce development
    through lifelong learning solutions focused on upskilling and
    reskilling the young adult population needed in the productive
    sectors. Pearson commits to providing free access to various Pearson
    programs and tools for 3,000 high achieving, low income, young adult
    English language learners in El Salvador.
-   **Pantaleon**, an agro-industrial organization, completed the first
    phase of urbanization for the Synergy Industrial Park and will soon
    have its official inauguration. Pantaleon has invested over $11M in
    the construction of the industrial park in Guatemala, generating 430
    construction jobs. The Park has attracted $40M to date in new
    investment to Central America. As part of the new phases of Synergy,
    Pantaleon will commit an additional $42 million, including $15M
    toward workforce development with a special focus on women and
    indigenous communities; $25M in additional investment in the
    construction of the industrial park; and $1.5M to support the
    “Guatemala No Se Detiene” initiative to bring more foreign
    investment into Guatemala.
-   **Conecta**, the platform that incorporates the investments of Grupo
    Energía Bogotá in Guatemala, committed to invest over $260 million
    in Guatemala for six electrical power transmission projects,
    estimated to create over 3,000 direct and 7,600 indirect jobs. The
    projects will help connect thousands of people who lack access to
    electricity and have a positive impact on the local economy,
    generating employment, and contributing to improved well-being.

**IMPACT OF PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS**

-   **Financial Inclusion and Access to Capital:** Strengthening access
    to the formal financial sector allows businesses and individuals to
    save, invest, and access credit—fundamental building blocks to
    growth. Central America Forward investments have brought **<u>more
    than 2.5 million people into the formal economy</u>**, which is
    continued progress from 1 million financially announced in
    February 2023. Additionally, partners have provided more than $160
    million in new access to capital for families and entrepreneurs to
    purchase a home, buy a car to get to work, and start new businesses,
    including more than $1.3 million in catalytic funding specifically
    for vulnerable populations and women in a region that has suffered
    from one of the highest rates of femicide globally.
-   **Skilling and Workforce Development:** **<u>CAF investments have
    reached over 1 million learners</u>** with training programs on
    entrepreneurship, digital and financial literacy, skills for
    employment, and women’s empowerment. 60,000 learners have been
    reached with programs that lead to certification or employment.
    Skill and workforce development efforts are critical enablers of
    access to opportunity and human development.
-   **Job Creation: **CAF investments have generated **<u>more than
    70,000 new jobs across Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador</u>**.
    In a region where only one quarter of the labor force is formally
    employed, these investments are critical. The new jobs include more
    than 15,000 in manufacturing sectors to strengthen supply chains in
    critical sectors across the Americas and more than 30,000 in
    integrated textile production supply chains between the United
    States and Central America that support quality jobs in both
    regions.
-   **Digital Access:** In May 2021, PCA mobilized commitments to expand
    digital access to 3 million people across the region. In record
    pace, by December 2022, 2 million of this goal had been reached and
    in July 2022 the original goal of 3 million was achieved. Going
    beyond that original goal, as of today, **<u>CAF investments have
    expanded digital access to more than 4.5 million
    people</u>**—surpassing the goal set at the launch of this
    initiative. Investing in connectivity supports individuals to access
    educational, employment opportunities, and grows new markets that
    create inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
-   **Food Security and Climate Adaptation:** Partners have invested and
    procured more than $253 million in new products, services, and
    production capacity across the agricultural sector to increase the
    region’s agricultural capacity, production, and exports to provide
    food security to families in Central America and across the world
    and in a region where more than 40% of the workforce depends on a
    sustainable agricultural sector for their livelihoods.
-   **Advancing Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses:** Partner
    organizations have supported over 350,000 micro, small, and medium
    enterprises (MSMEs) and partner organizations across the region,
    which has connected small business owners to new markets and grow
    their businesses by improving their management, financial, digital
    capabilities, and provided new lending and access to capital.

**ADDITIONAL UPDATES ON CAF INITIATIVES**

-   [**Good Governance, Good Jobs
    Declaration**](https://www.state.gov/good-governance-good-jobs-declaration/)**:** PCA
    operationalized CAF’s [Good Governance, Good Jobs
    Declaration](https://www.state.gov/good-governance-good-jobs-declaration/),
    by announcing in June 2023 a Corporate Pledge on the Rule of Law,
    with ten company signatories.  PCA and Transparency International
    also launched the Anti-Corruption and Transparency Initiative (or
    “ACT Project”) in September 2023 to help companies fulfill their
    commitments to the pledge and improve their capabilities for
    transparent and legal business practices. The ACT Project,
    self-funded by companies who volunteer to join, holds them
    accountable for operating responsibly in accordance with the OECD
    Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct.
-   **CAF Investment Facilitation Team: **A 12-member U.S. interagency
    delegation completed an extensive visit to Honduras in February 2024
    to further explore the development of an economic corridor in
    Honduras. This strategic infrastructure project, led by Honduras and
    supported by the international community, multilateral development
    banks, and private sector, could potentially benefit the entire
    region, attracting investment, creating jobs, and providing social
    benefits to people throughout northern Central America. Other
    Investment Facilitation Team visits will take place to northern
    Central America in the months ahead.
-   **Central America Service Corps**: USAID has entered into agreements
    with six partners to work together to develop Central America
    Services Corps (CASC) activities in El Salvador, Guatemala, and
    Honduras. USAID, together with host-country governments and private
    sector partners, will work with over 60,000 vulnerable youth and
    offer them alternatives to irregular migration through community
    service projects and technical assistance to match youth to
    potential jobs, training and mentoring, facilitating financial
    inclusion efforts, and direct financial support through
    stipends. CASC activities have commenced in Honduras. After a
    successful pilot, USAID and the government of Guatemala will
    officially launch CASC in May of 2024, and El Salvador will launch
    its program soon after.      USAID coordinates activities with the
    U.S. Peace Corps, the Inter-American Foundation, the U.S. Forest
    Service, and the Partnership for Central America.
-   **Civil Society Coordination: **In 2023, PCA launched the Regional
    Civil Society Council, which aims to provide a critical platform for
    civil society in Northern Central America in shaping and advising on
    the coordination of PCA’s financial inclusion, capital access,
    diversity, digital access, and cross-cutting programs. Members of
    the Council include a diverse coalition of civil society, academia,
    and policy makers from the region, including indigenous groups.  
-   **Financial Inclusion Consortium for Central American
    Remittances: **The Financial Inclusion Consortium for Central
    American Remittances (FICCAR), an initiative of PCA in support of
    CAF, aims to boost people-to-people remittance to account transfers
    by at least 20 percentage points in the next five years. This
    collective commitment will result in digitizing nearly $14 billion
    in remittance transactions, resulting in safer, more secure, and
    lower-cost transactions that provide an opportunity to increase
    savings, thereby building assets and helping small businesses to
    grow.
-   **In Her Hands (IHH): **On June 7, 2022, Vice President Harris
    launched In Her Hands (IHH), a women’s economic security initiative
    with the goals of connecting more than 1.4 million women and their
    communities to the financial system and digital economy,
    accelerating women’s participation in the agroindustry, training
    more than 500,000 women and girls in core job skills, promoting
    gender parity, and elevating women within companies across the
    region. To date, PCA has mobilized $113 million to directly support
    new programs for women that includes skills training programs;
    English language learning; and access to financial inclusion tools
    such as bank accounts, credit, and digital platforms. Today, PCA is
    formally launching the IHH Gender Pledge with the following
    signatories: Accion, Bancolombia, Corporación AG, Davivienda, Grupo
    Mariposa, Meta, Millicom, Nespresso, Pantaleon, and Technoserve. The
    pledge focuses on the inclusion of women in the procurement and
    development plans for government, non-profits, and the private
    sector.
