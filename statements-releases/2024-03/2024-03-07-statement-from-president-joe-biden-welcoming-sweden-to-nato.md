title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Welcoming Sweden to\_NATO"
---
 
Today, I am honored to welcome Sweden as NATO’s 32nd Ally.  
   
75 years ago—when the United States and 11 other nations came together
to establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—President Truman
said the Alliance, “would create a shield against aggression and fear of
aggression.” Today, that shield—and transatlantic security—is stronger
than ever with the formal addition of Sweden to NATO.  
   
When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of
Ukraine, he thought he could weaken Europe and divide NATO. Instead, in
May 2022, Sweden and Finland—two of our close partners, with two highly
capable militaries—made the historic decision to apply for full NATO
membership. Alliance members ratified Finland’s membership last year
ahead of our historic summit in Vilnius. And, with the addition of
Sweden today, NATO stands more united, determined, and dynamic than
ever—now 32 nations strong.  
   
Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values—and our
willingness to stand up for them—is what makes NATO the greatest
military alliance in the history of the world. It is what draws nations
to our cause. It is what underpins our unity. And together with our
newest Ally Sweden—NATO will continue to stand for freedom and democracy
for generations to come. I look forward to hosting all 32 Allies for the
75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary NATO Summit this summer in Washington D.C.
