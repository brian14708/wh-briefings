***First Lady and “First Teacher” Jill Biden Continues “EGGucation”
Theme for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll***

Today, the White House announced the full program of activities for the
2024 White House Easter Egg Roll, a tradition dating back to 1878.  A
teacher for more than 30 years, First Lady Jill Biden is continuing her
theme of “EGGucation” for the event, transforming the South Lawn and
Ellipse into a school community, full of fun educational activities for
children of all ages to enjoy. 

In addition to the time-honored traditions of rolling and hunting eggs,
this year’s White House Easter “EGGucation” Roll will also feature a
School House Activity Area, Reading Nook, Field Trip to the Farm,
Picture Day, a Physical “EGGucation” Zone, a Snack Time Tent and more.
 The South Façade of the White House will be adorned with balloons,
marked with STEAM school subjects, a nod to Dr. Biden’s belief that with
EGGucation, [“all students can
soar.”](https://www.instagram.com/reel/COiUWxfJ11o/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)
 

In total, approximately 40,000 people will take part in this year’s
Easter “EGGucation” Roll, including thousands of military and veteran
families, caregivers, and survivors. Tickets for the general public were
distributed to guests from all across the country through an online
public lottery. 

The American Egg Board, on behalf of America’s Egg Farmers, continues
its more than 45-year history of participation in the event as our
legacy partner in support of the White House Easter Egg Roll.   

This year’s event will be broken into nine sessions, beginning at 7:00
AM ET and ending at 7:00 PM ET.  Follow along with the White House
Easter “EGGucation” Roll activities with \#EasterEggRoll and
\#EGGucation, and the official @White House, @POTUS, and @FLOTUS social
media accounts on X, Facebook, and Instagram.

This event will be open to pre-credentialed media. For interested media
