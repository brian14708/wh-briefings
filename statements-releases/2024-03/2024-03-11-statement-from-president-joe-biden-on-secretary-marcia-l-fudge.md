title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Secretary Marcia L.\_Fudge"
---
 
A fair housing market and access to quality and affordable housing are
critical to the fulfillment of the American dream, and no one
understands that better than Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. When I took
office, we inherited a broken housing system, with fair housing and
civil rights protections badly dismantled under the prior
administration. On Day One, Marcia got to work rebuilding the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and over the past three
years she has been a strong voice for expanding efforts to build
generational wealth through homeownership and lowering costs and
promoting fairness for America’s renters.   
   
Under Marcia’s transformational leadership, we have worked hard to lower
housing costs and increase supply. We’ve proposed the largest investment
in affordable housing in U.S. history. We’ve taken steps to aggressively
combat racial discrimination in housing by ensuring home appraisals
are more fair and by strengthening programs to redress the negative
impacts of redlining. Thanks to Secretary Fudge, we’ve helped first-time
homebuyers, and we are working to cut the cost of renting. And there are
more housing units under construction right now than at any time in the
last 50 years.  
   
From her time as a mayor, to her years as a fierce advocate in the U.S.
House of Representatives, Marcia’s vision, passion, and focus on
increasing economic opportunity have been assets to our country. I’m
grateful for all of her contributions toward a housing system that works
for all Americans, and I wish her well in her next chapter.
