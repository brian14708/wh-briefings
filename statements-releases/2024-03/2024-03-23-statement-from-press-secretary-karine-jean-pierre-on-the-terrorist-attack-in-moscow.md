The United States strongly condemns the heinous terrorist attack in
Moscow. We extend our deepest condolences to those who lost loved ones
and to those who were injured or affected by these unconscionable
attacks against innocent civilians. ISIS is a common
terrorist enemy that must be defeated everywhere.
