On April 15, President Joe Biden will welcome Prime Minister Mohammed
Shia’a Al-Sudani of Iraq to the White House to coordinate on common
priorities and reinforce the strong bilateral partnership between the
United States and Iraq.  The leaders will reaffirm their commitment to
the Strategic Framework Agreement and deepen their shared vision for a
secure, sovereign, and prosperous Iraq fully integrated into the broader
region.  President Biden and Prime Minister Sudani will consult on a
range of issues during the visit, including our shared commitment to the
lasting defeat of ISIS and evolution of the military mission nearly ten
years after forming the successful Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. They
will also discuss ongoing Iraqi financial reforms to promote economic
development and progress towards Iraq’s energy independence and
modernization.
