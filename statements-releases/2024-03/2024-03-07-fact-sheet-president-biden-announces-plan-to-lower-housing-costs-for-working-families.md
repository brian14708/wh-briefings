title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces Plan to Lower Housing Costs for Working\_\
  Families"
---
 
*Building and preserving over 2 million new homes to lower rents and the
cost of buying a home*

President Biden believes housing costs are too high, and significant
investments are needed to address the large shortage of affordable homes
inherited from his predecessor and that has been growing for more than a
decade. During his State of the Union Address, President Biden will call
on Congressional Republicans to end years of inaction and pass
legislation to lower costs by providing a $10,000 tax credit for
first-time homebuyers and people who sell their starter homes; build and
renovate more than 2 million homes; and lower rental costs.  President
Biden also announced new steps to lower homebuying and refinancing
closing costs and crack down on corporate actions that rip off renters.

We are starting to see some progress. More housing units are under
construction right now than at any time in the last 50 years, rents have
fallen over the last year in many places, and the homeownership rate is
higher now than before the pandemic. But rent is still too high, and
Americans who want to buy a home still have difficulty finding one they
can afford. That is why President Biden has a landmark plan to build
over 2 million homes, which will lower rents, make houses more
affordable, and promote fair housing.

**<u>Lowering Costs of Homeownership  
</u>**  
For many Americans, owning a home is the cornerstone of raising a
family, building wealth, and joining the middle class. Too many working
families feel locked out of homeownership and are unable to compete with
investors for a limited supply of affordable for-sale homes. President
Biden is calling on Congress to enact legislation to enable more
Americans to purchase a home, including:

-   **Mortgage Relief Credit.** President Biden is calling on Congress
    to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide middle-class
    first-time homebuyers with an annual tax credit of $5,000 a year for
    two years. This is the equivalent of reducing the mortgage rate by
    more than 1.5 percentage points for two years on the median home,
    and will help more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase
    their first home over the next two years. The President’s plan also
    calls for a new credit to unlock inventory of affordable starter
    homes, while helping middle-class families move up the housing
    ladder and empty nesters right size. Many homeowners have lower
    rates on their mortgages than current rates. This “lock-in” effect
    makes homeowners more reluctant to sell and give up that low rate,
    even in circumstances where their current homes no longer fit their
    household needs. The President is calling on Congress to provide a
    one-year tax credit of up to $10,000 to middle-class families who
    sell their starter home, defined as homes below the area median home
    price in the county, to another owner-occupant. This proposal is
    estimated to help nearly 3 million families.
-   **Down Payment Assistance for First-Generation Homeowners.** The
    President continues to call on Congress to provide up to $25,000 in
    down payment assistance to first-generation homebuyers whose
    families haven’t benefited from the generational wealth building
    associated with homeownership. This proposal is estimated to help
    400,000 families purchase their first home.

The President isn’t waiting for Congress to lower costs for homebuyers
and homeowners. Last year, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD)
[reduced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-action-to-save-homebuyers-and-homeowners-800-per-year/)
the mortgage insurance premium for Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
mortgages, saving an estimated 850,000 homebuyers and homeowners an
estimated $800 per year. And today, the President is announcing new
actions to lower the closing costs associated with buying a home or
refinancing a mortgage.

-   **Lowering Closing Costs for Refinancing.** The Federal Housing
    Finance Agency has approved policies and pilots to reduce closing
    costs for homeowners, including a pilot to waive the requirement for
    lender’s title insurance on certain refinances. This would save
    thousands of homeowners up to $1500, and an average of $750, and the
    lower upfront fees will unlock substantial savings for homeowners as
    mortgage rates continue to fall and more homeowners are able to
    refinance. According to independent
    [analysis](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/rethinking-title-insurance-could-dramatically-lower-costs-homebuyers),
    across the market title insurance typically pays out only 3% to 5%
    of premiums in claims to consumers, compared to more than 70% in
    other types of insurance. Homeowners can still purchase their own
    title insurance policies if they choose to do so.
-   **Lowering Closing Costs for Home Mortgages.** The Consumer
    Financial Protection Bureau will pursue rulemaking and guidance to
    address anticompetitive closing costs imposed by lenders on
    homebuyers and homeowners.  These charges—which benefit the lender
    but not the borrower—can add thousands to the upfront costs of a
    mortgage.  Those upfront costs cut into the amount of homebuyers’
    down payments and reduce homeowners’ available equity.

In the coming months, the Department of Treasury’s Federal Insurance
Office will convene a roundtable of relevant industry stakeholders,
including consumer advocates and academics, in order to discuss the
title insurance industry and analyze potential reforms. Building on
today’s announcements, President Biden is calling on federal agencies to
take all available actions to lower costs for consumers at the closing
table and help more Americans access homeownership.

**<u>Lowering Costs by Building and Preserving 2 Million Homes  
</u>**  
America needs to build more housing in order to lower rental costs and
increase access to homeownership. That’s why the President is calling on
Congress to pass legislation to build and renovate more than [2 million
homes](https://www.novoco.com/notes-from-novogradac/biden-harris-administrations-proposed-2025-budget-to-include-several-housing-proposals-that-combined-could-finance-as-many-as-2-million-affordable-homes),
which would close the housing supply gap and lower housing costs for
renters and homeowners. This legislation would build on executive
actions in the Biden-Harris Administration’s [Housing Supply Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/)
that contributed to record housing construction last year.

-   **Tax Credits to Build More Housing.** President Biden is calling
    for an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to build or
    preserve 1.2 million more affordable rental units. Renters living in
    these properties save hundreds of dollars each month on their rent
    compared with renters with similar incomes who rent in the
    unsubsidized market. The President is also calling for a new
    Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, the first tax provision to build or
    renovate affordable homes for homeownership, which would lead to the
    construction or preservation of over 400,000 starter homes in
    communities throughout the country.
-   **Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion.** The President is
    unveiling a new $20 billion competitive grant fund as part of his
    Budget to support communities across the country to build more
    housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. This fund would
    support the construction of affordable multifamily rental units;
    incentivize local actions to remove unnecessary barriers to housing
    development; pilot innovative models to increase the production of
    affordable and workforce rental housing; and spur the construction
    of new starter homes for middle-class families. According to
    independent analysis, this will create hundreds of thousands of
    units which will help lower rents and housing costs.
-   **Increasing Banks’ Contributions Towards Building Affordable
    Housing.** The President is proposing that each Federal Home Loan
    Bank double its annual contribution to the Affordable Housing
    Program – from 10 percent of prior year net income to 20 percent –
    which will raise an additional $3.79 billion for affordable housing
    over the next decade and assist nearly 380,0000 households. These
    funds will support the financing, acquisition, construction, and
    rehabilitation of affordable rental and for-sale homes, as well as
    help low- and moderate-income homeowners to purchase or rehabilitate
    homes.

**<u>Lowering Costs for Renters  
</u>**  
President Biden is also taking actions to lower costs and promote
housing stability for renters. The White House [Blueprint for a Renters
Bill of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights.pdf)
lays out the key principles of a fair rental market and has already
catalyzed new federal actions to make those principles a reality. Today,
President Biden is announcing new steps to crack down on unfair
practices that are driving up rental costs:

-   **Fighting Rent Gouging by Corporate Landlords**. The Biden-Harris
    Administration is taking action to combat egregious rent increases
    and other unfair practices that are driving up rents. Corporate
    landlords and private equity firms across the country have been
    accused of illegal information sharing, price fixing, and inflating
    rents. As part of the Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing
    announced by President Biden on Tuesday, the President is calling on
    federal agencies to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior
    that hikes prices on American families through anti-competitive,
    unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent business practices. In [a recent
    filing](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/418053a.pdf), the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) made clear its position that inflated
    rents caused by algorithmic use of sensitive nonpublic pricing and
    supply information violate antitrust laws. Earlier this month, the
    Federal Trade Commission and DOJ [filed a joint
    brief](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/03/price-fixing-algorithm-still-price-fixing)
    further arguing that it is illegal for landlords and property
    managers to collude on pricing to inflate rents – including when
    using algorithms to do so.
-   **Cracking Down on Rental Junk Fees**. Millions of families incur
    burdensome costs in the rental application process and throughout
    the duration of their lease, from “convenience fees” simply to pay
    rent online to fees charged to sort mail or collect trash. These
    fees are often more than the actual cost of providing the service,
    or are added onto rents to cover services that renters assume are
    included—or that they don’t even want. Last fall, the FTC proposed a
    rule that if finalized as proposed would ban misleading and hidden
    fees across the economy, including in housing rental agreements.
    Last month, HUD released
    a [summary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-boost-housing-supply-and-lower-housing-costs/)
    of banned non-rent fees within their rental assistance programs.
    These actions build on voluntary
    [commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-on-junk-fees-in-rental-housing-to-lower-costs-for-renters/)
    the President announced last summer from major rental housing
    platforms to provide customers with the total, upfront cost on
    rental properties on their platform.
-   **Expanding Housing Choice Vouchers**. Over the last three years,
    the Administration has secured rental assistance for more than
    100,000 additional households. The President is calling on Congress
    to further expand rental assistance to more than half of a million
    households, including by providing a voucher guarantee for
    low-income veterans and youth aging out of foster care – the first
    such voucher guarantees in history. Receiving a voucher would save
    these households hundreds of dollars in rent each month.
