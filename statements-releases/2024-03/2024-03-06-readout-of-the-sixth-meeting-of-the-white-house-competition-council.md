title: "Readout of the Sixth Meeting of the White\_House Competition\_Council"
---
 
Yesterday, President Biden convened the sixth meeting of the White House
Competition Council to discuss new actions his Administration is taking
to lower costs, promote innovation, and support workers by ending
corporate rip-offs and other unfair practices that keep prices high. The
President thanked Competition Council members for their work to date and
called on them to continue to do more to lower costs for the American
people.  
  
The President also announced the launch of a new Strike Force to crack
down on unfair and illegal pricing. This Strike Force will strengthen
interagency efforts to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior that
hikes prices on American families through anti-competitive, unfair,
deceptive, or fraudulent business practices. The Department of Justice
and the Federal Trade Commission will co-chair the Strike Force and,
along with other agencies on the Strike Force, will focus their
collaborative efforts on key sectors where corporations may be violating
the law and keeping prices high, including prescription drugs and health
care, food and groceries, housing, financial services, and more.  
  
In addition to the co-chairs, initial members of the Strike Force
include the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and
Human Services, and the Department of Transportation. The Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be invited to join. Other
agencies will be invited to consult with the Strike Force as needed.
Strike Force members will work together to share information and data,
explore ways to cooperate with state and local governments and other
third-party actors, identify new resources in partnership with other
federal agencies, and produce a biannual report highlighting the Strike
Force’s priority areas.  
  
At the meeting, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) Rohit Chopra spoke about the CFPB’s efforts to crack down on
banking junk fees, including a [new final
rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-bans-excessive-credit-card-late-fees-lowers-typical-fee-from-32-to-8/)
that will cut credit card late fees from an average of $32 to $8, saving
Americans $10 billion—an average of $220 per year for the more than 45
million people who are charged these fees. A [new

from the Council of Economic Advisers finds that actions by the
Biden-Harris Administration will save Americans more than $20 billion in
hidden junk fees every year.  
  
Members also discussed new actions to promote competition among internet
providers and in agriculture markets. The Department of Agriculture
[finalized a
rule](https://www.ams.usda.gov/press-release/usda-announces-next-major-step-promoting-competition-agriculture-and-advancing)
to protect farmers and ranchers by cracking down on processing
companies’ deceptive contracts, banning retaliatory practices that hurt
small producers, and protecting producers from discrimination. The
Federal Communications Commission circulated [a proposed
rule](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-lower-broadband-costs-apartment-buildings)
that would ban bulk billing arrangements by internet, cable, or
satellite service providers.
