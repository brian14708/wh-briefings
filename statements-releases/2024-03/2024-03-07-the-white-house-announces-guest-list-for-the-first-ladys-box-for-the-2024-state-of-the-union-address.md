  \ 2024 State of the Union\_Address"
---
 
**WASHINGTON, D.C.** – First Lady Jill Biden will welcome guests to join
her in the viewing box for President Biden’s State of the Union Address
on Thursday, March 7, 2024. Each of these individuals were invited by
the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed
by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris
Administration’s policies at work for the American people. The Second
Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady in the
viewing box.  
   
The following individuals, listed in alphabetical order, will be seated
in the box with the First Lady and Second Gentleman:  
   
**Latorya Beasley (Birmingham, Alabama)**  
Beasley and her husband had their first child through in vitro
fertilization (IVF) in 2022 and were in the process of expanding their
family through another round of IVF when her embryo transfer was
abruptly canceled as a result of the recent Alabama Supreme Court
decision. Her recent experience is yet another example of how the
overturning of *Roe v. Wade* has disrupted access to reproductive health
care for women and families across the country.  
   
**Kris Blackley (Fort Mill, South Carolina)**  
Blackley is an oncology nurse and the Director of Patient Navigation for
the Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, part of Advocate Health. She
has published research related to patient navigation showing improved
outcomes, including decreased readmissions, increased treatment
compliance, and equity in care. In 2023, the Biden Cancer Moonshot
announced new actions to expand access to patient navigation services —
services that help guide individuals, caregivers, and families through
cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. In February
2023, the First Lady visited Atrium Health, where Blackley shared how
the health system plans to bring patient navigation services to more
cancer patients and their loved ones as a result of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s actions.  
   
**Jazmin Cazares (Uvalde, Texas)**  
Cazares is a leading advocate for gun violence prevention at the state
and national level. After her sister Jackie was killed in the shooting
at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, Cazares spent her senior year of
high school traveling across the country and sharing Jackie’s story. She
spoke alongside March for Our Lives leaders at the Texas State Capitol
and testified before lawmakers to advocate for tighter background checks
and extreme risk protection order laws. In 2023, Cazares was honored by
the First Lady during the first-ever “Girls Leading Change” celebration
at the White House.  
   
**Kate Cox (Dallas, Texas)**  
Cox is a mother of two from Texas who has experienced the devastating
consequences of state abortion bans and courageously spoke out about her
experience seeking the care she needed to preserve her health. Cox is
one of the first women in 50 years to have to turn to the courts to ask
permission to receive the abortion that her doctor recommended. She was
ultimately forced to travel out of state for care that she would have
been able to receive if the protections of *Roe v. Wade* were still in
effect.   
   
**Samantha Ervin-Upsher (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)**  
Ervin-Upsher is an apprentice with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters
Local 432 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She is 23 years old and a mother
of two. In 2023, Ervin-Upsher met the First Lady during a visit to
Pennsylvania to highlight the Investing in America Workforce Hub in
Pittsburgh, an initiative that seeks to build career pathways through
high schools, community colleges, and unions to job opportunities fueled
by President’s Biden’s investments.  
   
**Shawn Fain (Metro Detroit, Michigan) **  
Fain is a 29-year member and the current President of the United Auto
Workers (UAW). Hailing from a family of UAW members, Fain got his start
with UAW Local Union 1166 as an electrician for Chrysler at the Kokomo
Casting Plant in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. In September 2023,
President Biden joined Fain and UAW workers on the picket line in
Belleville, Michigan, making history as the first sitting President to
join a picket line. After hard-fought negotiations and a “Stand-Up”
strike that inspired workers across the country, the UAW won historic
pay increases, greater retirement security, more paid leave, and more
dignity and respect. Their efforts also yielded job security commitments
from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, including a commitment from
Stellantis to bring thousands of good-paying UAW jobs back to Belvidere,
Illinois. The UAW’s historic contract immediately led non-union
automakers to announce double digit pay raises for their U.S. workers –
adding further evidence that when unions do well, all workers do well.  
   
**Bettie Mae Fikes (Selma, Alabama)**  
Fikes is an American singer and civil rights advocate who was a Bloody
Sunday Foot Soldier in Selma, Alabama in 1965. Known as “The Voice of
Selma,” Fikes served as a member of Selma’s Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Freedom Singers. She has performed at
Carnegie Hall, Newport Jazz Festival, the Library of Congress, and was
featured in the Smithsonian Institute’s Museum of Tolerance exhibition
honoring women of the Civil Rights Movement. In 2023, Fikes joined
President Biden to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in
Selma, Alabama. This year’s State of the Union Address falls on the 59th
anniversary of Bloody Sunday.  
   
**Steven Hadfield (Matthews, North Carolina)**  
Hadfield has a rare blood cancer and is diabetic—two conditions that
require very expensive drugs, including a drug that was selected for the
first round of Medicare drug price negotiation. He held several
part-time positions because he feared that, if he retired, he would not
have sufficient income to pay for the drugs he needs to stay alive. The
drug that treats his rare blood cancer costs about $15,000 a month. On
top of that, his insulin costs him up to $400 every month. Now, thanks
to the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare covers his insulin
prescriptions with a $35 copay cap per month. And for his blood cancer
medications, this year, his Part D out-of-pocket drug costs are capped
at about $3,500 and in 2025, he will benefit even more from the $2,000
annual cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.  
   
**Mayor Garnett L. Johnson (Augusta, Georgia)**  
Johnson is the Mayor of the City of Augusta, Georgia. In 2023, Augusta
was designated by the White House as one of five Investing in America
Workforce Hubs, where President Biden’s agenda — including the American
Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and
Inflation Reduction Act — is driving historic investments and creating
good-paying jobs. The Augusta Workforce Hub is led by a partnership
between Mayor Johnson and three Augusta regional education institutions
focused on training students in growing sectors, such as advanced
manufacturing and construction skilled trades, to prepare the next
generation for technical jobs in the region. The First Lady was last in
Augusta in July and November 2023, to meet with Mayor Johnson and
highlight how the local community is working together to expand pathways
to careers.   
   
**Keenan Jones (Plymouth, Minnesota)**  
Jones is a public middle school educator in Minnesota’s Twin Cities and
a member of Education Minnesota. In April 2023, Jones wrote an email to
President Biden to thank him for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness
Program, which eliminated his remaining student loan debt after 10 years
of public service and allowed him to continue his teaching career. Jones
is one of the nearly 800,000 teachers, nurses, social workers,
servicemembers, and other public servants who have received student loan
debt forgiveness since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration.  
   
**Natalie King (Detroit, Michigan)**  
King is the founder and CEO of Dunamis Charge, the first-ever African
American women-owned electric vehicle charger manufacturing company in
the United States. Her company employs over 135 workers and is on track
to manufacture 400,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2025. In March 2023,
King introduced President Biden at the Small Business Administration’s
Women’s Business Summit, where she shared that the Administration’s
investments in clean energy and small business owners helped her
business thrive throughout the pandemic.  
   
**Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden**  
Kristersson is the Prime Minister of Sweden. Sweden is formally joining
the NATO Alliance on March 7, 2024, becoming the 32nd Ally. Sweden is a
strong democracy with a highly capable military that shares our values
and vision for the world. Having Sweden as a NATO Ally will make the
United States and our Allies even safer. NATO is the most powerful
defensive alliance in the history of the world, and it is as critical
today to ensuring the security of our citizens as it was 75 years ago
when our Alliance was founded out of the wreckage of World War II.  
   
**Governor Stephen Roe Lewis (Gu-u-Ki, Sacaton, Arizona)**  
Lewis is serving in his fourth term as governor of the Gila River Indian
Community. Under his leadership, he has prioritized bringing innovative
solutions to long-term issues confronted by the Community and Indian
Country. In partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration, Governor
Lewis has revolutionized how Tribal governmental infrastructure is
constructed, which led to the completion of the first new schools on the
Reservation in over 100 years and the first solar-over-canal project in
the Western Hemisphere.  
   
**Commander Shelby Nikitin (Wakefield, Massachusetts)**  
Commander Nikitin is an officer in the U.S. Navy and recently completed
her command tour onboard the USS THOMAS HUDNER. Under her leadership,
the ship deployed to protect maritime shipping from illegal, dangerous,
and destabilizing Houthi attacks against vessels transiting the Red Sea.
For her ship’s actions in this combat zone, Commander Nikitin was
awarded the Bronze Star for her extraordinary leadership and bravery in
defending lives and protecting the free flow of commerce in one of the
world’s most critical waterways.  
   
**Justin Phillips (Indianapolis, Indiana)**  
Phillips is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Overdose
Lifeline, a non-profit dedicated to reducing the stigma of substance use
disorder and preventing deaths resulting from opioid and fentanyl
overdose. Since starting Overdose Lifeline, Phillips has led the
organization through program expansion to meet the growing needs of the
population. Phillips worked to pass “Aaron’s Law” in Indiana and focuses
her advocacy on expanding access to overdose prevention medications.
Aaron’s Law allows individuals access to Narcan without a prescription,
thus eliminating barriers to receiving the drug and using it to save
lives. The Second Gentleman met Phillips and her daughter, Audrey, in
2023 at an event commemorating International Overdose Awareness Day,
where the Administration announced additional federal funds to combat
accidental overdoses. Phillips is a special guest of Second Gentleman
Douglas Emhoff.  
   
**Kameryn Pupunu (Lahaina, Hawaii)**  
Pupunu is a police officer for the county of Maui where he has served
for the last five years. In August 2023, his hometown of Lahaina was
engulfed in flames during one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S history.
Pupunu was one of the many local police officers who performed heroic
acts, including saving 15 individuals, from this deadly
wildfire. Tragically, Pupunu lost four of his immediate family
members to these fires.  
   
**Maria Shriver (Los Angeles, California)**  
Shriver is an author, journalist, and founder of the Women’s Alzheimer’s
Movement and Strategic Advisor on Women’s Health and Alzheimer’s at
Cleveland Clinic. Shriver works to use her voice and platforms to
advance some of our nation’s most pressing issues affecting women and
women’s health. In November 2023, Shriver joined the President and the
First Lady to announce the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s
Health Research, an effort led by Dr. Biden and the White House Gender
Policy Council, to galvanize the federal government and the private and
philanthropic sectors to spur innovation, unleash transformative
investment to close research gaps, and improve women’s health. Shriver’s
advocacy has been integral to the initiative and she continues to advise
and collaborate with Dr. Biden.  
   
**Dawn Simms (Davis Junction, Illinois)**  
Simms is a member of United Auto Workers Local 126 and third-generation
autoworker on the Belvidere, Illinois assembly line. When Stellantis
shuttered their local auto plant in February 2023, her son had just
started his junior year in high school and she feared she may need to
relocate her family. The historic UAW-Big Three contract secured with
Stellantis reopened the plant in Belvidere and saved jobs, stabilizing
her family. Today, she is gainfully employed at Belvidere’s auto
distribution center, waiting to return to the new auto plant once it is
finished. In November 2023, Simms joined President Biden in Belvidere to
mark the reopening of the assembly plant and the return of 1,200 jobs
and higher wages.   
   
**Rashawn Spivey (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)**  
Spivey is the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. His decision to become a plumber was inspired by his mother,
who worked for one of the first Black-owned plumbing businesses in
Wisconsin. After graduating from a plumbing program at Milwaukee Area
Technical College and completing an apprenticeship with Plumbers Local
75, support from his local union enabled Spivey to launch his own
plumbing business. Spurred by investments from the Biden-Harris
Administration, Spivey expanded his plumbing business to focus on lead
pipe replacements. Spivey and his team have replaced more than 825 toxic
lead pipes, primarily at local daycare centers, to ensure safer drinking
water for his community and protect children from lead poisoning.
Through historic levels of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law and the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is
working to replace every lead pipe in America in the next decade.  
   
**Tiffany Zoeller (Fayetteville, North Carolina)**  
Zoeller is a military spouse and works as a medical coder at Fort
Liberty’s Womack Army Medical Center. In June 2023, Zoeller introduced
the President at Fort Liberty to announce the Presidential Executive
Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses,
Military Caregivers, and Survivors. This Executive Order is the most
comprehensive set of administrative actions any President has ever taken
to support military spouses, and included nearly 20 new actions aimed at
enhancing military spouse career stability, employment resources, and
career transition assistance. The First Lady, through her *Joining
Forces* initiative, has worked to eliminate barriers to employment and
increase economic opportunity for military and veteran families,
caregivers, and survivors.
