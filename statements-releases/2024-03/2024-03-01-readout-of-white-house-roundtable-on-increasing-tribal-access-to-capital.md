title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable on Increasing Tribal Access to\_Capital"
---
 
Yesterday, Interior Secretary Haaland, Small Business Administrator
Guzman, Commerce Deputy Secretary Graves, U.S. Treasurer Malerba, and
Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, and USDA Deputy Under
Secretary for Rural Development Farah Ahmad convened a roundtable on
increasing Tribal access to capital at the White House. The conversation
included leaders from financial, philanthropic, and nonprofit sectors to
discuss innovative approaches to expand economic development and
investment in Tribal communities across the country.

The Biden-Harris Administration has made strengthening the
self-determination and economic vitality of Tribal Nations and Native
people a key priority. Last December, President Biden signed a historic
[Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-historic-executive-order-to-usher-in-the-next-era-of-tribal-self-determination/#:~:text=The%20Executive%20Order%20affirms%20that,America%27s%20overlapping%20system%20of%20government.)
urging federal agencies to make their funding streams and programs fully
accessible to Tribal communities. These commitments create long-overdue
opportunities to advance Tribal self-determination––and positively
impact the lives of Tribal citizens for generations to come.

Senior Administration officials outlined their commitments to and
strategies for reducing barriers to accessing capital, building on the
current system of Native community development financial institutions
(CDFIs), and improving economic development in Tribal communities.
Secretary Haaland emphasized the importance of both public-private
partnerships and interagency collaboration in expanding capital access,
driving long-term economic growth, and robustly supporting Tribal
sovereignty and self-determination. She issued a challenge to the
philanthropic sector to commit 10% of total giving to projects in Indian
Country and invited banks and financial institutions to bring increased
financing to Tribal communities. Leaders from the financial and
philanthropic sectors affirmed the unique opportunity to catalyze
inclusive investments alongside the federal government to leverage the
unprecedented levels of public investment in Tribal Nations.

Hosting partners [Native Americans in
Philanthropy](https://nativephilanthropy.org/),
[Hyphen](https://www.hyphenpartnerships.org/), and [Mission Driven
Finance](https://www.missiondrivenfinance.com/) announced the
establishment of two public-private partnerships:

-   The Tribal Community Vision Fund (Vision Fund), a national
    multi-year initiative to expand capital access to promote
    self-determination and sustainable economic and community
    development in Indian Country. The Vision Fund seeks to raise and
    deploy $1.2 billion in private and philanthropic investments––in the
    form of grants, PRIs, MRIs, equity, and debt capital––to leverage
    historic levels of federal funding.

-   The Indigenous Futures Fund, which seeks to accelerate the flow of
    the State Small Business Credit Initiative capital to Native
    entrepreneurs and enterprises. The Fund seeks to raise $2 million in
    grants and $25 million in investment capital to address the
    immediate needs and opportunities of Native businesses, as well as
    support the long-term capacity of financial intermediaries working
    in Indian Country, particularly Native CDFIs.
