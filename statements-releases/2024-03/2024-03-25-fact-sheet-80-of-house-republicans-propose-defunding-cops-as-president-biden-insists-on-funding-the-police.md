  Biden Insists on Funding the\_Police"

President Biden has stood with law enforcement his entire career, and
worked to ensure law enforcement serves all communities his entire
career. And he has the results to show for it.

The President inherited a violent crime rate that surged under the prior
administration. After taking office, President Biden immediately took
action and signed the American Rescue Plan – which led to the largest
federal investment in public safety in history, giving state and local
governments resources to reduce crime and prevent violence. Even though
leaders on the ground sided with the President, the Plan passed without
a single Republican vote. 

The President also signed one of the most significant gun violence
prevention reforms in 30 years, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,
which has helped keep guns out of the hands of individuals with felony
convictions, and those who have a serious mental illness and are a
danger to themselves or others.

These swift actions paid off. FBI 2023 data shows that the prior
administration’s crime wave has turned around under President Biden,
resulting in a record drop in crime.

In his State of the Union, President Biden described how cities across
the country have used the American Rescue Plan to make historic
investments in public safety and urged Congress to build on that
progress, including by hiring over 100,000 new police officers
accountable to the public, investing in mental health workers and
community violence intervention programs across the country, and
cracking down on gun crime.

**<u>But the Republican Study Committee – which speaks for 100% of House
Republican leadership and 80% of its members – just released a dangerous
plan that would defund law enforcement:</u>**

-   The Republican Study Committee is proposing defunding the Community
    Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program on top of other efforts to
    undermine law enforcement. President Biden voted to
    create COPS while a Senator, and the COPS Hiring Program is one of
    the primary ways the federal government supports local law
    enforcement. Each year, communities seek funding they need to hire
    officers to engage in community policing and crime prevention, and
    during this Administration, nearly 500 communities have received
    awards that put more than 3,700 officers on the beat.

<!-- -->

-   The Republican Study Committee budget would also gut the Bipartisan
    Safer Communities Act and take steps that prioritize gun industry
    profits over the lives of the American people.

<!-- -->

-   Numerous House Republicans also support abolishing the FBI and the
    Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). Although
    the Border Patrol Union endorses President Biden’s tough bipartisan
    border security deal, congressional Republicans are blocking it, to
    the detriment of law enforcement and the benefit of fentanyl
    traffickers.

**<u>By contrast, President Biden backs law enforcement and supports
programs that reduce crime:</u>**

-   Through President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, more than 1,000
    communities across the country have invested over $15 billion to
    keep their communities safe and prevent crime. These include
    investments to avoid cuts to police budgets, hire more police
    officers for safe, effective, and accountable community policing,
    ensure first responders have the equipment they need to do their
    jobs, and expand community violence intervention and prevention
    programs.

<!-- -->

-   President Biden’s budget includes $1.2 billion over five years to
    launch a new Violent Crime Reduction and Prevention Fund.

<!-- -->

-   The President’s budget also funds his Safer American Plan, including
    providing for hiring 100,000 additional police officers for
    effective, accountable community policing.

<!-- -->

-   President Biden wants to deploy $17.7 billion for DOJ law
    enforcement, including $2.0 billion, an increase of over 30 percent
    since 2021, for the ATF.
