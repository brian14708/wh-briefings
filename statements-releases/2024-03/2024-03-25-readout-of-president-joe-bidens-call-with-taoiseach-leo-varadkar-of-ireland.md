President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of
Ireland today to recognize his seven years of service as Taoiseach and
Tánaiste. Having recently celebrated St. Patrick’s Day at the White
House, they reflected on their cooperation over the years on shared
priorities, particularly deepening U.S.-Ireland ties between our people
and our economies. They noted recent progress in Northern Ireland with
the restoration of its Executive and Assembly, reaffirming the critical
role these institutions play in preserving the gains of the Belfast/Good
Friday Agreement. The President conveyed that he looks forward to
continuing to build a vibrant future for U.S.-Irish relations with the
new Taoiseach, once elected by the Dáil.
