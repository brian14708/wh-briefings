---
 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine today
to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Head of the Office
of the President Andriy Yermak, and senior Ukrainian officials to
reaffirm the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine in its
self-defense against Russia’s brutal invasion. Sullivan underscored the
multiple lines of U.S. support to Ukraine following yesterday’s
successful Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, and he stressed the
urgent need for the U.S. House of Representatives to pass the national
security supplemental to meet Ukraine’s critical battlefield needs.
Sullivan discussed ongoing efforts with allies and partners to hold
Russia accountable for its aggression and mitigate the economic impacts
of Russia’s war on Ukraine and around the world, and progress on
anti-corruption and other key reforms needed to further Ukraine’s
Euro-Atlantic integration.
