I congratulate the Volkswagen autoworkers in Chattanooga who filed for a
union election with the UAW. As one of the world’s largest automakers,
many Volkswagen plants internationally are unionized. As the most
pro-union president in American history, I believe American workers,
too, should have a voice at work. The decision whether to join a union
belongs to the workers.
