title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Bipartisan Government Funding\_\
  Bill"
---
 
The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open,
invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national
security. This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither
side got everything it wanted. But it rejects extreme cuts from House
Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer
research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American
leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my
Administration successfully fought to include. That’s good news for the
American people.

But I want to be clear: Congress’s work isn’t finished. The House must
pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our
national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan
border security agreement—the toughest and fairest reforms in decades—to
ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border.
It’s time to get this done.
