title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the International Day to Combat\_Islamophobia"
---
 
Five years ago today, a gunman fired upon worshippers at the Al Noor
Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Center in Christchurch, New
Zealand—murdering 51 people, wounding 40 others, and forever shattering
families in one of the deadliest mass shootings in history. Today, on
the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, we remember these innocent
souls who were stolen from us while peacefully praying.  
   
We recognize the violence and hate that Muslims worldwide too often face
because of their religious beliefs—and the ugly resurgence of
Islamophobia in the wake of the devastating war in Gaza. And, we
rededicate ourselves to building a world where people of all faiths and
all backgrounds are free to live without fear of persecution.  
   
That includes right here at home. I’ve said it many times: Islamophobia
has no place in our nation. Yet Muslims in the United States frequently
endure baseless fearmongering, blatant discrimination, harassment, and
violence in the course of their everyday lives. Today, Jill and I
remember Wadea al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy
brutally killed in his own home last fall—a crushing loss for his family
and community, and a devastating reminder of how all Americans must
unequivocally stand up against hate.  
   
That’s why, in 2022, my Administration established an interagency policy
committee to counter Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of
Bias and Discrimination. We are also currently drafting the first-ever
National Strategy to Combat Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and
Discrimination. The goal of this strategy is to mobilize a
whole-of-society effort to counter all forms of hate, discrimination,
and bias against Muslim, Sikh, South Asian, and Arab American
communities and to raise awareness about their heritage and invaluable
contributions to our country. We are also strengthening the security of
mosques and other places of worship, and working to prevent and
prosecute hate crimes against vulnerable communities. And my
Administration continues to implement the National Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism amidst the serious increase in Antisemitism and to advance
the White House Initiative on Hate-Motivated Violence. Put simply, we
are taking concrete steps to make real for all Americans the promise of
America: that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally
throughout our lives.  We have never fully lived up to that promise, but
we have never walked away from it either, and for as long as I’m
President, we never will.  
   
Today, as millions continue to observe the holy month of Ramadan, Jill
and I extend our best wishes to Muslims everywhere and continue to keep
them in our prayers. And, we reaffirm our commitment to do all we can to
put an end to the vicious hate of Islamophobia—here at home and around
the world.
