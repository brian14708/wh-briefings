title: "Readout of Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force\_Meeting"
---
 
Yesterday, the National Economic Council convened a meeting of the
Biden-Harris Administration Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to
discuss potential impacts on regional and national supply chains from
the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and partial closure of the
Port of Baltimore.

The Task Force, [launched in
2021](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/) to
monitor and address near-term supply chain challenges, consists of
supply chain experts across the Administration who bring the full
capacity of the federal government to assess potential supply
constraints and bottlenecks, engage stakeholders, and prepare response
and mitigation efforts.

The Port of Baltimore is one of the nation’s largest shipping hubs and
the Francis Scott Key Bridge is critical to travel in the Northeast
Corridor. Since the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the White
House and Federal agencies have engaged extensively with industry, ocean
carriers, ports and labor unions to minimize disruptions as shipments
are rerouted while the Port of Baltimore is closed to ship
traffic. Members of the Task Force shared real-time analysis of sectors
with significant activity through the Port of Baltimore, including
automobiles, farm machinery, and agricultural products. Members of the
Task Force also provided an assessment of the impact on workers and the
community. The Task Force received a situational briefing of operations
on the ground and will continue to monitor any new supply chain
developments as the unified command under the U.S. Coast Guard supports
the recovery and rebuild efforts and normal operations resume at the
Port of Baltimore.

The Task Force will coordinate Federal outreach and efforts to assist
impacted industries and will continue to monitor shipping activity at
alternative ports as shipments are diverted. The Task Force is also
monitoring the impact of the closure on the workers directly associated
with activities at the Port of Baltimore and will work with the
Department of Labor, the state of Maryland, and impacted employers and
unions to minimize impacts. 

Participating agencies included:

The White House
