title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Issues Executive Order and Announces New Actions\
  \ to Advance Women\u2019s Health Research and\_Innovation"
---
 
In his State of the Union address, President Biden laid out his vision
for transforming women’s health research and improving women’s lives all
across America. The President called on Congress to make a bold,
transformative investment of $12 billion in new funding for women’s
health research. This investment would be used to create a Fund for
Women’s Health Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to
advance a cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research agenda and to
establish a new nationwide network of research centers of excellence and
innovation in women’s health—which would serve as a national gold
standard for women’s health research across the lifespan.

It is long past time to ensure women get the answers they need when it
comes to their health—from cardiovascular disease to autoimmune diseases
to menopause-related conditions. To pioneer the next generation of
discoveries, the President and the First Lady launched the first-ever
[White House Initiative on Women’s Health
Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/11/13/memorandum-on-the-white-house-initiative-on-womens-health-research/),
which aims to fundamentally change how we approach and fund women’s
health research in the United States.

Today, President Biden is signing a new Executive Order that will direct
the most comprehensive set of executive actions ever taken to expand and
improve research on women’s health. These directives will ensure women’s
health is integrated and prioritized across the federal research
portfolio and budget, and will galvanize new research on a wide range of
topics, including women’s midlife health.

The President and First Lady are also announcing more than twenty new
actions and commitments by federal agencies, including through the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Defense
(DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the National Science
Foundation (NSF). This includes the launch of a new NIH-wide effort that
will direct key investments of $200 million in Fiscal Year 2025 to fund
new, interdisciplinary women’s health research—a first step towards the
transformative central Fund on Women’s Health that the President has
called on Congress to invest in. These actions also build on the First
Lady’s announcement last month of the Advanced Research Projects Agency
for Health (ARPA-H) [Sprint for Women’s
Health](https://arpa-h.gov/engage-and-transition/sprint), which
committed $100 million towards transformative research and development
in women’s health.

**Today, the President is issuing an Executive Order that will:**

-   **Integrate Women’s Health Across the Federal Research Portfolio**.
    The Executive Order directs the Initiative’s constituent agencies to
    develop and strengthen research and data standards on women’s health
    across all relevant research and funding opportunities, with the
    goal of helping ensure that the Administration is better leveraging
    every dollar of federal funding for health research to improve
    women’s health. These actions will build on the NIH’s current policy
    to ensure that research it funds considers women’s health in the
    development of study design and in data collection and analysis.
    Agencies will take action to ensure women’s health is being
    considered at every step in the research process—from the
    applications that prospective grantees submit to the way that they
    report on grant implementation.  
-   **Prioritize Investments in Women’s Health Research**. The Executive
    Order directs the Initiative’s constituent agencies to prioritize
    funding for women’s health research and encourage innovation in
    women’s health, including through ARPA-H and multi-agency
    initiatives such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program
    and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program. These entities
    are dedicated to high-impact research and innovation, including
    through the support of early-stage small businesses and
    entrepreneurs engaged in research and innovation. The Executive
    Order further directs HHS and NSF to study ways to leverage
    artificial intelligence to advance women’s health research. These
    additional investments—across a wide range of agencies—will support
    innovation and open new doors to breakthroughs in women’s health.  
-   **Galvanize New Research on Women’s Midlife Health**.  To narrow
    research gaps on diseases and conditions associated with women’s
    midlife health or that are more likely to occur after menopause,
    such as rheumatoid arthritis, heart attack, and osteoporosis, the
    President is directing HHS to: expand data collection efforts
    related to women’s midlife health; launch a comprehensive research
    agenda that will guide future investments in menopause-related
    research; identify ways to improve management of menopause-related
    issues and the clinical care that women receive; and develop new
    resources to help women better understand their options for
    menopause-related symptoms prevention and treatment. The Executive
    Order also directs the DoD and VA to study and take steps to improve
    the treatment of, and research related to, menopause for Service
    women and women veterans.  
-   **Assess Unmet Needs to Support Women’s Health Research**. The
    Executive Order directs the Office of Management and Budget and the
    Gender Policy Council to lead a robust effort to assess gaps in
    federal funding for women’s health research and identify
    changes—whether statutory, regulatory, or budgetary—that are needed
    to maximally support the broad scope of women’s health research
    across the federal government. Agencies will also be required to
    report annually on their investments in women’s health research, as
    well as progress towards their efforts to improve women’s health.

Today, agencies are also **announcing new actions they are taking to
promote women’s health research**, as part of their ongoing efforts
through the White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research. Agencies
are announcing actions to:

**Prioritize and Increase Investments in Women’s Health Research**

-   **Launch an NIH-Cross Cutting Effort to Transform Women’s Health
    Throughout the Lifespan.** NIH is launching an NIH-wide effort to
    close gaps in women’s health research across the lifespan. This
    effort—which will initially be supported by $200 million from NIH
    beginning in FY 2025—will allow NIH to catalyze interdisciplinary
    research, particularly on issues that cut across the traditional
    mandates of the institutes and centers at NIH. It will also allow
    NIH to launch ambitious, multi-faceted research projects such as
    research on the impact of perimenopause and menopause on heart
    health, brain health and bone health. In addition, the President’s
    FY25 Budget Request would double current funding for the NIH Office
    of Research on Women’s Health to support new and existing
    initiatives that emphasize women’s health research.

This coordinated, NIH-wide effort will be co-chaired by the NIH Office
of the Director, the Office of Research on Women’s Health, and the
institute directors from the National Institute on Aging; the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the National Institute on Drug Abuse;
the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development; the National Institute on Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and
Skin Diseases.  

-   **Invest in Research on a Wide Range of Women’s Health Issues.** The
    bipartisan Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program
    (CDMRP), led out of DoD, funds research on women’s health
    encompassing a range of diseases and conditions that affect women
    uniquely, disproportionately, or differently from men. While the
    programs and topic areas directed by Congress differ each year,
    CDMRP has consistently funded research to advance women’s health
    since its creation in 1993. In Fiscal Year 2022, DoD implemented
    nearly $490 million in CDMRP investments towards women’s health
    research projects ranging from breast and ovarian cancer to lupus to
    orthotics and prosthetics in women.  In Fiscal Year 2023, DoD
    anticipates implementing approximately $500 million in CDMRP funding
    for women’s health research, including in endometriosis, rheumatoid
    arthritis, and chronic fatigue.  
-   **Call for New Proposals on Emerging Women’s Health Issues**. Today,
    NSF is [calling for new research and education
    proposals](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2024/nsf24068/nsf24068.jsp) to
    advance discoveries and innovations related to women’s health. To
    promote multidisciplinary solutions to women’s health disparities,
    NSF invites applications that would improve women’s health through a
    wide range of disciplines—from computational research to engineering
    biomechanics. This is the first time that NSF has broadly called for
    novel and transformative research that is focused entirely on
    women’s health topics, and proposals will be considered on an
    ongoing basis.  
-   **Increase Research on How Environmental Factors Affect Women’s
    Health.** The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is updating its
    grant solicitations and contracts to ensure that applicants
    prioritize, as appropriate, the consideration of women’s exposures
    and health outcomes. These changes will help ensure that women’s
    health is better accounted for across EPA’s research portfolio and
    increase our knowledge of women’s environmental health—from
    endocrine disruption to toxic exposure.  
-   **Create a Dedicated, One-Stop Shop for NIH Funding Opportunities on
    Women’s Health.** Researchers are often unaware of existing
    opportunities to apply for federal funding. To help close this gap,
    NIH is issuing a new Notice of Special Interest that identifies
    current, open funding opportunities related to women’s health
    research across a wide range of health conditions and all
    Institutes, Centers, and Offices. The NIH Office of Research on
    Women’s Health will build on this new Notice by creating a dedicated
    one-stop shop on open funding opportunities related to women’s
    health research. This will make it easier for researchers and
    institutions to find and apply for funding—instead of having to
    search across each of NIH’s 27 institutes for funding opportunities.

**Foster Innovation and Discovery in Women’s Health**

-   **Accelerate Transformative Research and Development in Women’s
    Health.** ARPA-H’s [Sprint for Women’s
    Health](https://arpa-h.gov/engage-and-transition/sprint) launched in
    February 2024 commits $100 million to transformative research and
    development in women’s health. ARPA-H is soliciting ideas for novel
    groundbreaking research and development to address women’s health,
    as well as opportunities to accelerate and scale tools, products,
    and platforms with the potential for commercialization to improve
    women’s health outcomes.  
-   **Support Private Sector Innovation Through Additional Federal
    Investments in Women’s Health Research.** The NIH’s competitive
    Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business
    Technology Transfer Program is committing to further increasing—by
    50 percent—its investments in supporting innovators and early-stage
    small businesses engaged in research and development on women’s
    health. These programs will solicit new proposals on promising
    women’s health innovation and make evidence-based investments that
    bridge the gap between performance of basic science and
    commercialization of resulting innovations. This commitment for
    additional funds builds on the investments the Administration has
    already made to increase innovation in women’s health through small
    businesses, including by increasing investments by sevenfold between
    Fiscal Year 2021 and Fiscal Year 2023.  
-   **Advance Initiatives to Protect and Promote the Health of Women.**
    The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeks to advance efforts to
    help address gaps in research and availability of products for
    diseases and conditions that primarily impact women, or for which
    scientific considerations may be different for women, and is
    committed to research and regulatory initiatives that facilitate the
    development of safe and effective medical products for women. FDA
    also plans to issue guidance for industry that relates to the
    inclusion of women in clinical trials and conduct outreach to
    stakeholders to discuss opportunities to advance women’s health
    across the lifespan. And FDA’s Office of Women’s Health will update
    FDA’s framework for women’s health research and seek to fund
    research with an emphasis on bridging gaps in knowledge on important
    women’s health topics, including sex differences and conditions that
    uniquely or disproportionately impact women.  
-   **Use Biomarkers to Improve the Health of Women Through Early
    Detection and Treatment of Conditions, such as Endometriosis.** NIH
    will [launch a new
    initiative](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HD-24-016.html)
    dedicated to research on biomarker discovery and validation to help
    improve our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat conditions that
    affect women uniquely, including endometriosis. This NIH initiative
    will accelerate our ability to identify new pathways for diagnosis
    and treatment by encouraging multi-sector collaboration and
    synergistic research that will speed the transfer of knowledge from
    bench to bedside.  
-   **Leverage Engineering Research to Improve Women’s Health**. The NSF
    Engineering Research Visioning Alliance (ERVA) is
    [convening](https://www.ervacommunity.org/event/visioning-event-transforming-womens-health-outcomes-through-engineering/)
    national experts to identify high-impact research opportunities in
    engineering that can improve women’s health. ERVA’s *Transforming
    Women’s Health Outcomes Through Engineering* visioning event will be
    held in June 2024, and will bring together experts from across
    engineering—including those in microfluidics, computational
    modeling, artificial intelligence/imaging, and diagnostic
    technologies and devices—to evaluate the landscape for new
    applications in women’s health. Following this event, ERVA will
    issue a report and roadmap on critical areas where engineering
    research can impact women’s health across the lifespan.  
-   **Drive Engineering Innovations in Women’s Health Discovery**. NSF
    awardees at Texas A&M University will [hold a
    conference](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2422973&HistoricalAwards=false)
    in summer 2024 to collectively identify challenges and opportunities
    in improving women’s health through engineering. Biomedical
    engineers and scientists will explore and identify how various types
    of engineering tools, including biomechanics and immuno-engineering,
    can be applied to women’s health and spark promising new research
    directions.

**Expand and Leverage Data Collection and Analysis Related to Women’s
Health**

-   **Help Standardize Data to Support Research on Women’s Health.** NIH
    is launching an effort to identify and develop new common data
    elements related to women’s health that will help researchers share
    and combine datasets, promote interoperability, and improve the
    accuracy of datasets when it comes to women’s health. NIH will
    initiate this process by convening data and scientific experts
    across the federal government to solicit feedback on the need to
    develop new NIH-endorsed common data elements—which are widely used
    in both research and clinical settings. By advancing new tools to
    capture more data about women’s health, NIH will give researchers
    and clinicians the tools they need to enable more meaningful data
    collection, analysis, and reporting and comprehensively improve our
    knowledge of women’s health.  
-   **Reflect Women’s Health Needs in National Coverage
    Determinations.** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
    will strengthen its review process, including through Coverage with
    Evidence Development guidance, to ensure that new medical services
    and technologies work well in women, as applicable, before being
    covered nationally through the Medicare program. This will help
    ensure that Medicare funds are used for treatments with a sufficient
    evidence base to show that they actually work in women, who make up
    more than half of the Medicare population.  
-   **Leverage Data and Quality Measures to Advance Women’s Health
    Research.** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
    the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) are building
    on existing datasets to improve the collection, analysis, and
    reporting of information on women’s health. The CDC is expanding the
    collection of key quality measures across a woman’s lifespan,
    including to understand the link between pregnancy and post-partum
    hypertension and heart disease, and plans to release the Million
    Hearts Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package. This resource will
    feature a menu of evidence-informed strategies by which clinicians
    can change care processes. Each strategy includes tested tools and
    resources to support related clinical quality improvement. HRSA is
    modernizing its Uniform Data System in ways that will improve the
    ability to assess how women are being served through HRSA-funded
    health centers. By improving the ability to analyze data on key
    clinical quality measures, CDC and HRSA can help close gaps in
    women’s health care access and identify new opportunities for
    high-impact research.  

**Strengthen Coordination, Infrastructure, and Training to Support
Women’s Health Research**

-   **Launch New Joint Collaborative to Improve Women’s Health Research
    for Service Members and Veterans.** DoD and VA are launching a new
    Women’s Health Research collaborative to explore opportunities that
    further promote joint efforts to advance women’s health research and
    improve evidence-based care for Service members and veterans. The
    collaborative will increase coordination with the goal of helping
    improve care across the lifespan for women in the military and women
    veterans. The Departments will further advance research on key
    women’s health issues and develop a roadmap to close pressing
    research gaps, including those specifically affecting Service women
    and women veterans.  
-   **Coordinate Research to Advance the Health of Women in the
    Military.** DoD will invest $10 million, contingent on available
    funds, in the Military Women’s Health Research Partnership. This
    Partnership is led by the Uniformed Services University and advances
    and coordinates women’s health research across the Department. The
    Partnership is supporting research in a wide range of health issues
    affecting women in the military, including cancers, mental and
    behavioral health, and the unique health care needs of Active Duty
    Service Women. In addition, the Uniformed Services University
    established a dedicated Director of Military Women’s Health Research
    Program, a role that is responsible for identifying research gaps,
    fostering collaboration, and coordinating and aligning a unified
    approach to address the evolving needs of Active Duty Service
    Women.  
-   **Support EPA-Wide Research and Dissemination of Data on Women’s
    Health.** EPA is establishing a Women’s Health Community of Practice
    to coordinate research and data dissemination. EPA also plans to
    direct the Board of Scientific Counselors to identify ways to
    advance EPA’s research with specific consideration of the
    intersection of environmental factors and women’s health, including
    maternal health.  
-   **Expand Fellowship Training in Women’s Health Research.** CDC, in
    collaboration with the CDC Foundation and American Board of
    Obstetrics and Gynecology, is expanding training in women’s health
    research and public health surveillance to OBGYNs, nurses and
    advanced practice nurses. Through fellowships and public health
    experiences with CDC, these clinicians will gain public health
    research skills to improve the health of women and children exposed
    to or affected by infectious diseases, mental health and substance
    use disorders. CDC will invite early career clinicians to train in
    public health and policy to become future leaders in women’s health
    research.

**Improve Women’s Health Across the Lifespan**

-   **Create a Comprehensive Research Agenda on Menopause.** To help
    women get the answers they need about menopause, NIH will [launch
    its first-ever Pathways to Prevention
    series](https://prevention.nih.gov/research-priorities/research-needs-and-gaps/pathways-prevention)
    on menopause and the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Pathways to
    Prevention is an independent, evidence-based process to synthesize
    the current state of the evidence, identify gaps in existing
    research, and develop a roadmap that can be used to help guide the
    field forward. The report, once completed, will help guide
    innovation and investments in menopause-related research and care
    across the federal government and research community.  
-   **Improve Primary Care and Preventive Services for Women**. The
    Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) will issue a
    Notice of Intent to publish a funding opportunity announcement for
    research to advance the science of primary care, which will include
    a focus on women’s health. Through this funding opportunity, AHRQ
    will build evidence about key elements of primary care that
    influence patient outcomes and advance health equity—focusing on
    women of color—such as care coordination, continuity of care,
    comprehensiveness of care, person-centered care, and trust. The
    results from the funding opportunity will shed light on vital
    targets for improvements in the delivery of primary healthcare
    across a woman’s lifespan, including women’s health preventive
    services, prevention and management of multiple chronic diseases,
    perinatal care, transition from pediatric to adult care, sexual and
    reproductive health, and care of older adults.  
-   **Promote the Health of American Indian and Alaska Native Women.**
    The Indian Health Service is launching a series of engagements,
    including focus groups, to better understand tribal beliefs related
    to menopause in American Indian and Alaska Native Women. This series
    will inform new opportunities to expand culturally informed patient
    care and research as well as the development of new resources and
    educational materials.  
-   **Connect Research to Real-World Outcomes to Improve Women’s Mental
    and Behavioral Health.** The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
    Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting a range of health
    care providers to address the unique needs of women with or at risk
    for mental health and substance use disorders. Building on its
    current efforts to provide technical assistance through various
    [initiatives](https://www.samhsa.gov/smi-adviser-clinical-support-system-serious-mental-illness-css-smi),
    SAMHSA intends, contingent on available funds, to launch a new
    comprehensive Women’s Behavioral Health Technical Assistance Center.
    This center will identify and improve the implementation of best
    practices in women’s behavioral health across the life span;
    identify and fill critical gaps in knowledge of and resources for
    women’s behavioral health; and provide learning opportunities,
    training, and technical assistance for healthcare providers.  
-   **Support Research on Maternal Health Outcomes.** USDA will fund
    research to help recognize early warning signs of maternal morbidity
    and mortality in recipients of Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and anticipates
    awarding up to [$5
    million](https://www.fns.usda.gov/grant/wic-recognizing-addressing-mmm-warning-signs)
    in Fiscal Year 2023 to support maternal health research through WIC.
    In addition, research being conducted through the Agricultural
    Research Service’s Human Nutrition Research Centers is focusing on
    women’s health across the lifespan, including the nutritional needs
    of pregnant and breastfeeding women and older adults.
