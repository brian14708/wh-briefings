  \ Women\u2019s Health\_Organization"

One year ago today, the Supreme Court took away a constitutional right
from the American people, denying women across the nation the right to
choose. Overturning *Roe v. Wade*, which had been the law of the land
for nearly half a century, has already had devastating consequences.

States have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans that put the
health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of
miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the
health care that their patients need and that they are trained to
provide.

Yet, state bans are just the beginning. Congressional Republicans want
to ban abortion nationwide, but go beyond that, by taking FDA-approved
medication for terminating a pregnancy, off the market, and make it
harder to obtain contraception. Their agenda is extreme, dangerous, and
out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.

My Administration will continue to protect access to reproductive health
care and call on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in
federal law once and for all.
