title: "President\_Biden Names Thirty-Fourth Round of Judicial Nominees and One New\
  \ Nominee to Serve as U.S.\_Attorney"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate two individuals to
federal district courts, one individual to the Court of Federal Claims,
and one individual to the District of Columbia Superior Court—all of
whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule
of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
  
If confirmed, this slate would include the first person of color ever to
sit on the United States District Court for the Western District of
Louisiana.  
  
This will be President Biden’s thirty-fourth round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 170.  
  
The President is also announcing his intent to nominate one individual
to serve as U.S. Attorney.  This is an official who will be
indispensable to upholding the rule of law as a top federal law
enforcement official.  
  
This candidate was chosen for her devotion to enforcing the law,
professionalism, experience and credentials, dedication to pursuing
equal justice for all, and commitment to the independence of the
Department of Justice.  
  
The President has now announced 71 nominees to serve as U.S.
Attorneys.
