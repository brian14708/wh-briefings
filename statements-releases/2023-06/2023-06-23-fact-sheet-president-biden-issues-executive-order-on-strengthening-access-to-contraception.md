title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Issues Executive Order on Strengthening Access\
  \ to\_Contraception"
---
 
Today, President Biden will issue an Executive Order on Strengthening
Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception and Family Planning
Services. This will be the third Executive Order on reproductive health
care access that the President has signed since the Supreme Court’s
decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,* and the
first focused specifically on protecting and expanding access to
contraception. Contraception is an essential component of reproductive
health care that has only become more important in the wake of *Dobbs*
and the ensuing crisis in women’s access to health care.

Through today’s Executive Order, the President will announce actions to:

-   **Improve Contraception Access and Affordability for Women with
    Private Health Insurance.**  The Executive Order directs the
    Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services
    (HHS) to consider new guidance to ensure that private health
    insurance under the Affordable Care Act covers all Food and Drug
    Administration-approved, -granted, or -cleared contraceptives
    without cost sharing and to streamline the process for obtaining
    care women need and want. This action will build on the progress
    already made under the Affordable Care Act by further reducing
    barriers that women face in accessing contraception prescribed by
    their provider.  
-   **Promote Increased Access to Over-the-Counter Contraception.** The
    Executive Order directs the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and
    HHS to consider new actions to improve access to affordable
    over-the-counter contraception, including emergency contraception.
    These actions could include convening pharmacies, employers, and
    insurers to discuss opportunities to expand access to affordable
    over-the-counter-contraception; identifying promising practices
    regarding the coverage of over-the-counter contraception at no cost
    to patients; and providing guidance to support seamless coverage of
    over-the-counter contraception.  
-   **Support Family Planning Services and Supplies through the Medicaid
    Program.** The Executive Order directs the Secretary of HHS to
    consider new actions that expand access to affordable family
    planning services and supplies across the Medicaid program—such as
    sharing best practices for State Medicaid programs on providing
    high-quality family planning services and supplies, including
    through Medicaid managed care.  
-   **Improve the Coverage of Contraception through the Medicare
    Program.** To improve coverage and payment for contraceptives for
    Medicare beneficiaries, the Executive Order directs the Secretary of
    HHS to consider new actions to strengthen the coverage of
    contraception through Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans.
    This action will help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries, especially
    women of reproductive age with disabilities, can access
    contraception without unnecessary barriers.  
-   **Support Access to Contraception for Service Members, Veterans, and
    Federal Employees.** The Executive Order directs the Secretary of
    Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Director of the
    Office of Personnel Management to consider new actions to ensure
    robust coverage of contraception for Service members, veterans, and
    Federal employees and ensure that they and their families understand
    how to access these benefits. These actions will build on the steps
    that these agencies have already taken to bolster access to
    contraception for those they serve.  
-   **Bolster Contraception Access Across Federally-Supported Health
    Care Programs.** The Executive Order directs the Secretary of HHS to
    consider encouraging Federally-supported health care and human
    services entities—such as Title X family planning clinics, community
    health centers, and the Indian Health Service—to expand the
    availability and quality of contraception access for those they
    serve. Actions could include issuing new guidance, technical
    assistance, and training resources so that providers in these
    programs understand their obligations under Federal law, including
    to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate family planning
    services.  
-   **Support Access to Affordable Contraception for Employees and
    College Students.** The Executive Order directs the Secretary of
    Labor to identify and share best practices for employers and
    insurers in making affordable, high-quality contraception available
    to employees. To help bolster access for college and university
    students, the Executive Order directs the Secretary of Education to
    convene institutions of higher education to share best practices and
    ways to make sure that students understand their options for
    accessing contraception.  
-   **Promote Research and Data Analysis on Contraception Access.**  To
    document the gaps and disparities in contraception access as well as
    the benefits of comprehensive coverage, the Executive Order directs
    the Secretary of HHS to support research, data collection, and data
    analysis on contraception access and family planning services.

Today’s announcements build on actions that the Biden-Harris
Administration has already taken to protect access to contraception,
including in response to two prior Executive Orders directing actions to
safeguard access to reproductive health care services. The
Administration has taken action to:

-   **Clarify Protections for Women with Private Health Insurance.**
    Under the Affordable Care Act, most private health plans must
    provide contraception and family planning counseling with no
    out-of-pocket costs. The Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS
    convened a meeting with health insurers and employee benefit plans.
    These agencies called on the industry to meet their obligations to
    cover contraception as required under the law. Following this
    conversation, these agencies issued guidance to clarify protections
    for contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  
-   **Expand Access Under the Affordable Care Act.** The Departments of
    the Treasury, Labor, and HHS proposed a rule to strengthen access to
    contraception under the Affordable Care Act so all women who need
    and want contraception can obtain it. Millions of women have already
    benefited from this coverage, which has helped them save billions of
    dollars on contraception.  
-   **Support Title X Clinics.** HHS provided resources to bolster
    quality family planning services through the Title X Family Planning
    Program. HHS provided funds to help clinics deliver equitable,
    affordable, client-centered, and high-quality family planning
    services and provide training and technical assistance for Title X
    clinics through the Reproductive Health National Training Center and
    the Clinical Training Center for Sexual and Reproductive Health. In
    addition, recognizing the important role that Title X clinics play
    in supporting access to contraception, the President’s Fiscal Year
    2024 Budget Request includes $512 million for the Title X Family
    Planning Program, a 76 percent increase above the 2023 enacted
    level.  
-   **Enhance Access Through a New Public-Private Partnership.** HHS
    announced a new public-private partnership to expand access to
    contraception with Upstream, a national nonprofit organization that
    provides health centers with free patient-centered, evidence-based
    training and technical assistance to eliminate provider-level
    barriers to offering the full range of contraceptive options. This
    partnership will leverage Upstream’s $90 million in resources and
    build on Upstream’s work with over 100 health care organizations
    across 18 states and accelerate their national expansion to
    transform contraceptive care in more than 700 health centers by
    2030, reaching 5 million women of reproductive age every year.  
-   **Promote Access to Contraception for Service Members and Their
    Families and Certain Dependents of Veterans.** To improve access to
    contraception at military hospitals and clinics, the Department of
    Defense expanded walk-in contraceptive care services for active-duty
    Service members and other Military Health System beneficiaries. And
    the Department of Veterans Affairs proposed a rule to eliminate
    out-of-pocket costs for certain types of contraception through the
    Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans
    Affairs.  
-   **Ensure Access to Family Planning Services at Health Centers.** The
    Health Resources and Services Administration provided updated
    guidance to community health centers on their obligation to offer
    family planning services to their patients. The guidance included
    evidence-based recommendations and resources to support health
    centers in providing high-quality family planning services.  
-   **Include Family Planning Providers in Health Plan Networks.** HHS
    strengthened the standard for inclusion of family planning providers
    in Marketplace plans’ provider networks under the Affordable Care
    Act. This policy, which goes into effect for plan year 2024, will
    help increase consumers’ choice of high-quality providers and
    improve access to care for low-income and medically underserved
    consumers.
