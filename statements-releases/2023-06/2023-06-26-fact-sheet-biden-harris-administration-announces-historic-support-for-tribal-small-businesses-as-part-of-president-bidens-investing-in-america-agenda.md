title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Historic Support for\
  \ Tribal Small Businesses as Part of President\_Biden\u2019s Investing in America\_\
  Agenda"
---
 
Small businesses are the backbone of the economy – employing half of all
private sector workers and growing our economy from the middle-out and
bottom-up in every corner of the United States, including in Indian
Country. Tribal communities and Native-owned small businesses, however,
were disproportionately hard hit by the pandemic, including a roughly
40% decline in the number of Native-owned small businesses in the
immediate aftermath of the pandemic.<sup>1</sup>

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing approval of the
first 15 Tribal State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) awards
for tribal governments funded by the American Rescue Plan, providing $73
million to 39 Tribal Governments to support Tribal enterprises and small
business owners, as part of President Biden’s Investing in America
agenda. These are the first-ever SSBCI awards directly to Tribal
Governments. The announcement coincides with the launch of the second
round of President Biden’s Investing in America tour, where President
Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, and leaders across
the Administration will fan out across the country over the course of
three weeks to highlight manufacturing, infrastructure, and cost-saving
investments in communities across the country driven by President
Biden’s economic agenda.  
**  
For the first time ever, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP)
included more than $500 million in SSBCI support that has been set aside
for, and applied for, by Tribal Governments**. This is the first ever
inclusion of dedicated, direct support to Tribal Governments in the
State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) program to help enable
investments in Tribal enterprises and small businesses. Investments like
SSBCI will help to ensure that all Americans—including in historically
underserved Tribal communities—will benefit from the record small
business growth happening under President Biden’s leadership. The SSBCI
awards announced today will not only benefit Tribal communities and
Native entrepreneurs but will also create critical jobs and economic
opportunities for workers and businesses in surrounding areas. The ARP’s
historic reauthorization and expansion of SSBCI—a more than 6-fold
increase from the program’s original 2010 allocation—is expected to
support 100,000 small businesses and result in tens of billions of
dollars in new small business financing nationwide over the course of
the decade.

“Small businesses are the backbone of our nation’s economy. Our
Administration has taken action to expand access to capital for all
entrepreneurs and small business owners so they can expand, grow and
thrive in the communities they serve.” said Vice President Harris. “Far
too often, entrepreneurs and small business owners with big plans and a
vision for the future struggle simply because they lack the capital or
financial services they need. That is why we are making this historic
investment, which will help Tribal communities grow their small
businesses, create jobs, and strengthen our economy. President Biden and
I will continue to fight to make sure that all communities have the
resources they need to thrive.”

**First-Ever State Small Business Credit Initiative Tribal awards
highlighted today include**:

-   **$2 million to the** **Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin**
    (MITW). The MITW’s SSBCI programs will build on the Tribe’s lending
    experience to take on capital access barriers in a county with a
    poverty rate more than double the state’s average. The SSBCI
    programs will partner with lenders—including a Wisconsin Native
    CDFI—to support small businesses owned by Tribal members, chartered
    by the Menominee Tribe, or located on the Menominee reservation.   
-   **$22 million to 25 Tribal governments applying jointly through
    the** **Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians** **Economic
    Development Corporation** (ATNI-EDC). ATNI-EDC, a Native CDFI, will
    operate SSBCI programs on behalf of the 25 Tribes—spread across
    California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Arizona—many in rural
    communities with limited access to capital. The programs will
    support Native American entrepreneurs, Tribal enterprises, and the
    development of Tribal business credit ecosystems. Supporting Tribal
    governments as they form consortia in order to more effectively
    operate new credit initiatives at scale was a key outcome of Tribal
    consultations in the design and administration of these new SSBCI
    resources.  
-   **$1.4 million to the Yurok Tribe** of California, the largest in
    the state, to operate new loan participation programs, including in
    conjunction with the Tribe’s Native CDFI. The Alliance CDFI was
    created by the Yurok Tribal government to address the lack of access
    to financial services in a remote community with high poverty rates.
    The programs will serve small businesses owned by Tribal members as
    well as Tribal enterprises.

**Today’s announcement builds upon the Biden-Harris
Administration’s **[**historic
support**](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-support-indian-country-and-native-communities-ahead-of-the-administrations-second-tribal-nations-summit/)
**for recovery, expanded economic opportunity, and better access to
capital for Native people and Tribal communities, including:**

-   **Launching the Federal Initiative on Access to Capital in Indian
    Country** – a multi-agency strategy to improve awareness of, access
    to, and utilization of federal funding resources for Tribal
    governments, Tribal enterprises, Native entrepreneurs, and Native
    Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs).  
-   **Delivering the largest-ever infusion of federal capital to
    Native-serving CDFIs in history through the Emergency Capital
    Investment, Rapid Response and Equitable Recovery Programs announced
    by Vice President Harris**. Treasury has invested $234 million in
    Native-owned and Native-majority shareholder depository institutions
    through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). Based on
    preliminary analysis, Treasury projects that ECIP investments
    nationwide could increase lending in Native communities by up to
    nearly $7 billion over the next decade. Additionally, the CDFI Rapid
    Response Program provided more than $55 million in immediate
    assistance in Native communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic
    and the Equitable Recovery Program awarded $46 million to 30 Native
    CDFIs in April 2023, strengthening the ability of these institutions
    to aid low- and moderate-income Native communities in their recovery
    from the COVID-19 pandemic and invest in long-term prosperity.  
-   **Awarding a $45 million Build Back Better Regional Challenge
    (BBB-RC)** **grant to the Mountain Plains Regional Native CDFI
    Coalition** **to grow the Native finance sector and expand economic
    opportunity** in Native American communities in Montana, North
    Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. The investment will provide
    financial investment to Native businesses and entrepreneurs,
    solidify a locally led financing infrastructure, and help to reverse
    decades of historical disinvestment and institutionalized inequities
    for Native communities by driving business development and job
    creation. The BBB-RC award is just one of the over 120 economic
    development grants—totaling nearly $500 million—awarded by the
    Department of Commerce with ARP funds to projects serving Native
    communities.

-   **Providing the** **largest-ever direct federal investment in Indian
    Country** **through the American Rescue Plan**, providing more than
    $32 billion specifically allocated for Tribal communities and Native
    people. This support included $20 billion in Fiscal Recovery Funds
    that were quickly and directly distributed to 579 Tribal governments
    in 2021 to stabilize Tribal economies devastated by the pandemic,
    allowing them to quickly respond to the unique needs of their
    communities and make the investments they deem most valuable – from
    the Mescalero Apache Tribe’s investment in workforce development to
    the Spirit Lake Tribe’s support for small ranchers.  
-   **The single largest dedicated investment in Tribal infrastructure
    ever.** The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is deploying record
    investments to provide affordable high-speed internet, safer roads
    and bridges, modern wastewater and sanitation systems, clean
    drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good paying
    jobs in every Tribal community. The law provides more than $13
    billion in funding to directly support Tribal communities and makes
    Tribes eligible to apply for or request billions more in
    discretionary, formula, and other funding.  
-   **Supporting the most aggressive action on climate and clean energy
    in American history through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),
    including more than $720 million specifically for Tribes and Native
    communities** to plan for and adapt to climate change, mitigate
    drought, support fisheries, and shift to clean energy production and
    use.

While challenges remain to ensure that all Tribal communities can
achieve prosperity and resilience, the Biden-Harris Administration’s
investments in Indian Country are working to help ensure a robust
recovery and a more promising economic future:

-   **<u>Lowest-ever unemployment rate among American Indians and Alaska
    Natives (AI/AN)</u>**: In the first twelve months after the start of
    the pandemic, the AI/AN unemployment rate averaged more than 12%. In
    February of 2023, the average unemployment rate over the previous
    twelve months dropped to 5.7%, the lowest level on record going back
    to 2000.
-   **<u>Lowest Native American child poverty rate on record</u>**:
    Historic support for Native American families, including the ARP’s
    expanded 2021 Child Tax Credit, helped cut AI/AN Child Poverty by
    more than half in 2021, reaching record lows.
