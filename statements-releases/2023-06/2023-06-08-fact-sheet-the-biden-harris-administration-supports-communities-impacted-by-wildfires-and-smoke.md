title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Supports Communities Impacted\
  \ by Wildfires and\_Smoke"
---
 
More than 100 million Americans are under Air Quality Index Alerts due
to smoke drift from historic wildfire activity throughout Canada, which
is facing one of its worst wildfire seasons on record.  There are over
425 active wildfires in Canada and nearly 10 million acres have burned,
17 times the 20-year average.  Since January 1, 2023, 19,574 wildfires
have burned 616,486 acres across the United States.  Most current large
fire activity in the United States is concentrated in the Southwest.

These latest events are another stark reminder of how the climate crisis
is disrupting communities across the country. That’s why from day one
President Biden recognized climate change as one of the four crises
facing our nation, and why he made historic investments to tackle the
climate crisis and strengthen community resilience.

Respond to Wildfires:</span>**  
***  
Amplifying Public Health Guidance  
***  
**Provide timely and accurate air quality data to the public and State
and local officials to help keep people safe. ** The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) collects data from hundreds of air quality
monitors around the country, along with crowd-sourced data from air
quality sensors.  This data is the lifeblood of the
[AirNow.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/) website and its app, a
user-friendly tool the EPA developed in partnership with the U.S. Forest
Service (USFS) to provide all Americans with real time information about
air quality so people can make informed decisions about how to stay
safe.   
  
**Provide technical assistance to public health officials in impacted
communities.** The Department of Health and Human Services and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have offered technical
assistance to impacted State and local health officials and are sharing
existing public health resources via social media and other channels. 
Recommended personal protection measures include staying indoors, using
air purifiers, and wearing masks when necessary.  By closely monitoring
trends and patterns, the CDC can assist State and local governments in
identifying any increases in respiratory symptoms, exacerbations of
chronic conditions, or other health effects associated with wildfire
smoke exposure.  The CDC maintains a [wildfire
page](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/index.html) that includes
several resources on wildfire smoke, including [Children and Wildfire
Smoke](https://www.cdc.gov/air/wildfire-smoke/children.htm), [Pregnancy
and Wildfire
Smoke](https://www.cdc.gov/air/wildfire-smoke/pregnancy.htm), and
[Asthma and Wildfire
Smoke](https://www.cdc.gov/air/wildfire-smoke/chronic-conditions.htm#asthma). 
Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s
[ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/wildfires) site includes tips, plans,
and resources to help families prepare for wildfires that may threaten
their communities.   

***Supporting Canadian Fire Suppression Actions  
***  
**Mobilizing Federal assets and coordinating with our Canadian allies to
help suppress wildfires. ** To date, the United States, through the
[National Interagency Fire
Center](https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/news-releases/us-resources-support-canadian-wildfires)
has deployed more than 600 Federal and State firefighters, support
personnel, and significant firefighting assets such as airtankers to
help our Canadian allies battle the record number of wildfires they are
facing, including additional personnel on the way.  This support
includes hotshot and smokejumper crews, the most highly trained,
skilled, and experienced wildland firefighters who work the most
challenging parts of the fire and do initial attack response on remote
wildland fires.  We have offered Canada additional firefighting
personnel and equipment and the President has directed that we provide
robust support to our neighbors while maintaining domestic readiness for
wildfires.  
  
***Strengthening Our Wildfire Response Capacity  
***  
**Provide robust response through a record 16,700 Federal firefighters
and additional surge capacity. ** Federal firefighters, working
alongside their State, Tribal, and local counterparts, support a robust,
multi-agency effort to combat wildfires.  Since 2021, the USFS and the
Department of the Interior (DOI) have increased their capacity to 16,700
Federal firefighters, with the ability to activate an additional 13,000
employees across their agencies to support wildfire response across the
Nation.  USFS and DOI can surge an additional 11,000 administratively
determined personnel, mostly retired agency personnel, from outside of
their agencies to support incident management teams and other
firefighting functions.  DOI Bureau of Indian Affairs also coordinates
with Tribes to add an additional 500 Tribal firefighters to support
firefighting response as needed.  
  
***Mitigating Smoke Impacts to Aviation and Airports  
***  
**“Smoke from Canada’s wildfires is affecting visibility in our airspace
and leading to delays.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is
fully prepared to modify operations as needed,” tweeted US Secretary of
Transportation Pete Buttigieg.  **As necessary, the FAA will take steps
to manage the flow of air traffic safely into New York City, Washington,
DC, Philadelphia, Charlotte, and other airports due to reduced
visibility from wildfire smoke.  Conditions are rapidly evolving, so
please monitor [www.fly.faa.gov](http://www.fly.faa.gov) frequently for
the latest and the [FAA’s official Twitter
account](https://twitter.com/faanews).      
  
***Wildland Fire Resilience & Response Is a Priority in the President’s
Budget***  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act
included over $7 billion in funding for the Department of Agriculture,
DOI, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to enhance
our ability to mitigate and respond to wildfires.  The Biden-Harris
Administration remains intensely focused on limiting the damage of
wildfires on communities this fire season — and will use all available
resources to protect homes, our economy, and the environment from
climate-induced natural hazards.  As part of the President’s 2024 budget
request, he called on Congress to:

-   Permanently increase pay for wildland firefighters — initially
    supplemented for two years through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    — and provide them with the health — including mental health —
    resources that they need to do dangerous jobs.  These first
    responders save lives, protect communities, and serve on the
    frontlines of our nation’s wildfire crisis;  
-   Provide housing for wildland fire personnel, who often struggle to
    find affordable housing options in hard-to-reach locations where
    they fight fires to protect communities;  
-   Increase funding for hazardous fuels treatment at the USFS by 28%
    above 2023 enacted levels; and    
-   Increase DOI’s wildland fire and hazardous fuels management funding
    21% above 2023 enacted levels.
