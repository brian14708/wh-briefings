Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer spoke with Prime
Minister Albin Kurti of Kosovo yesterday.  Mr. Finer underscored the
United States’ concern about the tense situation in northern Kosovo and
called for all parties to take steps aimed at de-escalating the
situation. He urged the Government of Kosovo to enable newly elected
mayors to carry out their duties from alternative locations and to
withdraw police forces from municipal buildings.  He also welcomed Prime
Minister Kurti’s willingness to work towards conditions for new
elections.  Mr. Finer reiterated that the United States expects both
sides to re-engage in the EU-facilitated Dialogue and to fully implement
the normalization agreement reached in Brussels and Ohrid earlier this
year.
