title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Christine King\_Farris"
---
 
I last saw Mrs. Christine King Farris this past January at Sunday
services at Ebenezer Baptist Church to celebrate the life of her
brother, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

The eldest child of the King family, she lived as an example of
America’s promise. Raised by a Black preacher in the Deep South,
educated at Spelman College and Columbia University, over nine decades
she became an esteemed educator and civil rights leader.  Alongside her
brother, she was active in the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She
also served as Vice Chair and Treasurer of the King Center for
Nonviolent Social Change. Shaping the history of the journey of America
in the 20th and 21st centuries, she stood for peace, freedom, and
justice—virtues that reflect the best of our nation. 

Jill and I are saddened to learn of her peaceful passing today in
Atlanta.  We send our condolences to the King family as our Nation
mourns her life of faith, service, and grace.
