title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on World Refugee\_Day"

On World Refugee Day, we join nations around the world in honoring the
bravery and resilience of millions of refugees forced to flee violence
and oppression. Together, as we celebrate their diverse contributions to
the fabric of our communities, we renew our support to citizens and
organizations who step up to provide them with critical care, services,
and assistance.  
   
Today, nearly 110 million people have been forced to leave their homes
around the world—more refugees than at any other time in history.
Russia’s brutal and unjust assault of Ukraine forced millions to seek
safety in other countries at a rate not seen since World War II.
Meanwhile, men, women, and children who have been displaced for years—
from Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan—have little
hope for a solution to their displacement.  
   
That is why my Administration has worked hard to rebuild the U.S.
Refugee Admissions Program. The United States plans to welcome 125,000
refugees next year, a level not achieved in three decades. We have also
strengthened the U.S. resettlement program, including advancing
opportunities for refugees to find work and contribute to our economy.
In January, we launched the Welcome Corps, a new private sponsorship
program that enables Americans to play a leading role in welcoming
refugees as they build new lives in communities across the country.  
The United States continues to be the single largest provider of
humanitarian assistance for refugees worldwide—including healthcare,
clean water, and education, in partnership with international and
non-governmental partners, to tens of millions of refugees and the
communities hosting them around the world.  
   
But refugee protection is a shared, transnational challenge that
requires shared solutions. That is why we are working with regional
partners in our own hemisphere to provide protection and support for
stabilization and integration to those in need, in alignment with the
Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection.  We are working
with the World Bank and the United Nations to strengthen refugee
inclusion around the world, because when refugees are allowed to work,
they contribute to the economy and strengthen the communities that host
them.   
   
Welcoming refugees is part of who we are as Americans—our nation was
founded by those fleeing religious persecution. When we take action to
help refugees around the world, and include them, we honor this past and
are stronger for it. And together, we create a more hopeful and better
future—one that embodies our highest values.
