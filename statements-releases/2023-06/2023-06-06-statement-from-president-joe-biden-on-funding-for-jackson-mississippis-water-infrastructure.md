title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Funding for Jackson, Mississippi\u2019\
  s Water\_Infrastructure"

For years, the people of Jackson, Mississippi, have suffered the
consequences of aging water infrastructure. Last summer, the city’s
water system reached a crisis point when a major flood aggravated
longstanding problems in the system and left tens of thousands of people
without any running water for days on end. Long before then, families in
Jackson lived under the constant threat of boil water orders.  
   
All Americans deserve access to clean, safe drinking water. That’s why I
directed my Administration to make sure the people of Jackson have the
resources they need and deserve.  
   
In December, I was proud to sign bipartisan legislation to help
stabilize Jackson’s drinking water infrastructure and protect against
future crises. Today, as a result of that legislation, I am announcing
an initial $115 million investment towards repairing the city’s water
infrastructure challenges and delivering clean water for all.  
   
This historic investment would not have been possible without
Congressman Bennie Thompson, who has been a steadfast leader in times of
crisis, a strong advocate for his constituents, and a great partner, and
I want to thank him for his untiring commitment to the Jackson
community.  
   
While we have made a lot of progress, there is much more work to do to
ensure that all Americans have access to clean water. Thanks to my
Investing in America agenda, we’re already deploying record resources to
communities all across America to replace lead pipes, improve water
quality, and rebuild the Nation’s drinking water infrastructure,
ensuring it can withstand the impacts of the climate crisis.  
   
Until all our children can safely drink water from the tap, our fight
for clean water must, and will, continue.
