Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
spoke with Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi on June 23.
Sullivan extended sincere condolences to the Israeli people for the June
20 terrorist attack by Hamas that killed four Israeli civilians in the
West Bank. He underscored the Administration’s unwavering support for
Israel’s security, as well as its right to defend its people against
Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups.  Sullivan
also expressed deep concern over the recent extremist settler attacks
against Palestinian civilians and the destruction of their property in
the West Bank.  He reiterated the importance of holding accountable
those responsible for such acts of violence.

Sullivan encouraged additional steps to restore calm and de-escalate
tensions, and called on all parties to refrain from unilateral actions,
including settlement activity, that further inflame tensions. Sullivan
conveyed the United States’ hope that the parties build on the
commitments made during talks at Aqaba, Jordan and Sharm el-Sheikh,
Egypt and reconvene soon. 

Sullivan also updated Hanegbi on broader regional issues including
efforts to enhance Israel’s integration into the region, as well as
President Biden’s iron-clad commitment that Iran will never be able to
obtain a nuclear weapon.  They committed to stay in regular contact over
the coming days and weeks.
