  \ Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar to\_Baghdad"

We welcome the visit of Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani to Baghdad
on June 15. The United States fully supports Iraq’s sovereignty,
independence, and increasing integration into the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) and broader Arab region. This includes Iraq’s movement
over the last year toward energy self-sufficiency through steps to
connect its energy grid to the GCC’s and Jordan’s grids. Both of these
infrastructure projects were components of President Biden’s visit to
the Middle East last year, and are now being achieved with active U.S.
facilitation and support. Additionally, the landmark project signed
earlier this year with TotalEnergies together with U.S. and Qatari
companies includes natural gas capture, a project that will serve the
needs of the Iraqi people while reducing emissions. We welcome the
active support of Sheikh al-Thani, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’
al-Sudani, other leaders in the region, and the Iraqi people. We also
welcome the participation of Kurdistan Region President Nechirvan
Barzani in these discussions to further enhance coordination between
Baghdad and the Iraqi Kurdistan region.
