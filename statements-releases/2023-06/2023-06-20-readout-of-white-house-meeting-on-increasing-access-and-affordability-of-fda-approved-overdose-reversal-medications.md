title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting on Increasing Access and Affordability of\
  \ FDA-Approved Overdose Reversal\_Medications"
---
 
Today, White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Dr.
Rahul Gupta, White House Domestic Policy Council Advisor Neera Tanden,
U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine, and U.S.
Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use Dr. Miriam E.
Delphin-Rittmon hosted a convening with U.S. drug manufacturers who
currently have FDA-approved opioid overdose reversal medication
products. During the meeting, senior Biden-Harris officials reiterated
President Biden’s clear and urgent directive to increase access and
affordability of these life-saving overdose reversal medications, and
underscored the critical role manufacturers play in the all-of-society
effort to help end the nation’s overdose crisis. The officials also
called on manufacturers to take robust actions in support of the
Biden-Harris administration’s guiding principles, which include that no
one who needs overdose reversal medications should lack access because
of costs or availability; that at-risk communities should be saturated
with these medications to reduce fatality rates; that organizations
serving high-risk individuals should not need to ration these
medications; that more must be done to raise public awareness; and that
public health agencies need timely, actionable data on distribution and
gaps in access.
