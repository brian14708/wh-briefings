title: "Statement by Vice President Harris on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Students\
  \ for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University\
  \ of North\_Carolina"
---
 
Today’s Supreme Court decision in *Students for Fair Admissions v.
Harvard* and *Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North
Carolina* is a step backward for our nation. It rolls back
long-established precedent and will make it more difficult for students
from underrepresented backgrounds to have access to opportunities that
will help them fulfill their full potential.  
   
It is well established that *all* students benefit when classrooms and
campuses reflect the incredible diversity of our Nation. Colleges and
universities provide opportunities for students to interact with
Americans from all walks of life and learn from one another. By making
our schools less diverse, this ruling will harm the educational
experience for all students.  
   
Our Nation’s colleges and universities educate and train the next
generation of American leaders. Students who sit in classrooms today
will be the leaders of our government, military, private sector, and
academic institutions tomorrow. Today’s decision will impact our country
for decades to come.  
   
In the wake of this decision, we must work with ever more urgency to
make sure that all of our young people have an opportunity to thrive.
