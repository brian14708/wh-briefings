title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Prime Minister Trudeau of\_Canada"
---
 
President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada today to
offer additional support to respond to the devasting and
historic wildfires burning in Canada. The President has directed his
team to deploy all available Federal firefighting assets that can
rapidly assist in suppressing fires impacting Canadian and American
communities. To date, the United States has deployed more than 600 U.S.
firefighters and support personnel, and other firefighting assets to
respond to the fires. The two leaders also discussed continued
cooperation to prevent wildfires and address the health impacts that
such fires have on our communities. They agreed to stay in close touch
on emerging needs.
