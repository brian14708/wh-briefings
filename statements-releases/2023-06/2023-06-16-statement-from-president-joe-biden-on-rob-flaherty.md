title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Rob\_Flaherty"
---
 
The way Americans get their information is changing, and since Day 1,
Rob has helped us meet people where they are, while keeping a constant
eye towards reaching new and different communities.  
   
Under Rob’s leadership, we’ve built the largest Office of Digital
Strategy in history, and with it, a digital strategy and culture that
brought people together instead of dividing them.  
   
The integration of the digital team into senior White House leadership
shows just how important Rob’s team is for our daily engagement with the
American people. His team has pioneered new methods of communication,
and operated with unparalleled creativity, innovative spirit and a bias
toward action.  
  
I’m grateful to Rob for his service over the last three and a half years
and look forward to our continued work together in the future.
