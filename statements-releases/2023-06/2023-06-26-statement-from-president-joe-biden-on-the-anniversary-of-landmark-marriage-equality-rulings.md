title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Anniversary of Landmark Marriage\
  \ Equality\_Rulings"
---
 
Today marks the anniversary of three landmark Supreme Court cases which
were consequential in affirming the basic truth that every American
should have the right to marry the person they love. Ten years ago
today, the Supreme Court rulings in *United States v. Windsor* and
*Hollingsworth v. Perry* made significant strides laying the groundwork
for marriage equality in our country. They were followed two years
later, to the day, by the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Obergefell v.
Hodges,* finally allowing millions of LGBTQI+ Americans to marry who
they love.  
  
These monumental cases moved our country forward, and they were made
possible because of the courageous couples and unrelenting advocates in
the LGBTQI+ community who, for decades, fought for these hard-won
rights. Last year, I was proud to build on their legacy by signing into
law the *Respect for Marriage Act* – guaranteeing the rights and
protections which LGBTQI+ Americans are entitled to – surrounded by many
of the plaintiffs from these cases. But more work lies ahead, and I
continue to call on Congress to pass the *Equality Act*, to codify
additional protections to combat the increased attacks on the rights and
safety of those in the LGBTQI+ community.  
  
As we conclude Pride month, we’re once again reminded that we must never
stop fighting to reach full equality for all LGBTQI+ – and all –
Americans.
