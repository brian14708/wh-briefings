title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Confirmation of Jared\_Bernstein"
---
 
I want to thank the Senate for confirming my nominee for Chair of the
Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein. Our economy continues to
show progress tackling inflation while unemployment remains at historic
lows. While there is more work to do, jobs are up, wages are up, and
inflation is down, and Jared uniquely understands that a job is about
far more than a paycheck, it’s about the dignity of work.

I look forward to Jared’s continued leadership as we build an economy
that works for working people.
