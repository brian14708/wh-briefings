title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Anniversary of\_DACA"
---
 
Eleven years ago on this day, President Obama and I announced
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to allow young
people to live and work in the only country they’ve called home. Since
then, DACA has provided more than 800,000 Dreamers the ability to work
lawfully, pursue an education, and contribute their immense skills and
talents to better our communities.  
   
Dreamers are Americans. Many have spent the majority of their lives in
the United States. They are our doctors, our teachers, and our small
business owners. Dreamers strengthen our economy, enrich our workplaces,
and during the COVID-19 pandemic, many served their communities on the
frontlines.  
   
The first version of the Dream Act was introduced to Congress by Senator
Dick Durbin and former Republican Senator Orrin Hatch more than twenty
years ago. Since then, the bill has been championed by bipartisan
coalitions of lawmakers, business and educational leaders and
organizations, and the overwhelming majority of the American public. But
at each opportunity, Congress has failed to act.  
   
My Administration is committed to providing Dreamers the opportunities
and support they need to succeed. That’s why in April I announced a plan
to expand health coverage for DACA recipients, and directed the
Department of Homeland Security to “preserve and fortify” DACA.  
   
While Vice President Harris and I will continue fighting to pass
legislation to protect Dreamers and create a path to citizenship, only
Congress can provide permanent and lasting stability for these young
people and their families. Congress must act to protect our Dreamers.
