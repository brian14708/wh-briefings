title: "Joint Statement Following the Meeting Between National Security Advisor Jake\
  \ Sullivan and National Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al\_Nahyan"
---
 
Today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met National Security
Advisor Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab
Emirates at the White House to reiterate the enduring U.S.-UAE strategic
partnership and discuss a range of global and regional issues.  Mr.
Sullivan welcomed the UAE’s leadership in the run-up to the COP-28
Summit in the UAE, and its commitment to becoming a global leader in
clean energy technologies, including through the U.S.-UAE Partnership
for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE).  Mr. Sullivan and Sheikh Tahnoon
pledged to intensify cooperation under the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), continuing their constructive
discussions held last month together with India and Saudi Arabia.
 Sheikh Tahnoon praised the United States’ strong security and defense
partnership with the UAE.  Mr. Sullivan confirmed the U.S. commitment to
deterring threats against the UAE and other U.S. partners while also
working diplomatically to de-escalate conflicts and reduce tensions in
the region.  Mr. Sullivan and Sheikh Tahnoon discussed ways to deepen
and expand the Abraham Accords including through the I2U2 grouping
(India, Israel, United States, and UAE) and the Negev Forum, under
which the UAE last year convened the largest gathering of Israelis and
Arabs in decades.  The two sides also discussed shared goals towards
building a more integrated, prosperous, and stable Middle East
region.  Mr. Sullivan and Sheikh Tahnoon also discussed the importance
of building trusted technology ecosystems and the potential for advanced
technology to improve human welfare in the Middle East region and
globally.  Both look forward to remaining in close contact on these and
other issues.
