title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019s Meeting with World Bank President\
  \ Ajay\_Banga"

Vice President Kamala Harris met today at the White House with World
Bank President Ajay Banga.  This meeting was the first official U.S.
engagement since President Banga took office.   
   
The Vice President underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s strong
support for World Bank efforts to make investments and spur policy
reforms that reduce poverty and advance achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals.  She praised the steps taken to evolve the World
Bank—including expanding its mission to include building resilience to
global challenges like climate change, pandemics, fragility and
conflict.  She underscored that addressing these global challenges is
interlinked with and indivisible from the Bank’s work to eliminate
extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.  The Vice President
welcomed President Banga’s commitment and high ambition in driving
forward this evolution initiative.   
   
The Vice President conveyed the United States’ intention to work with
World Bank shareholders and President Banga in the leadup to the
September G20 Leaders Summit to agree to steps we will jointly take to
deliver:  
 

-   Significant new concessional World Bank financing delivered through
    a new window or other innovative mechanisms to incentivize action on
    global challenges across all borrower countries.  A new framework
    and principles for the targeted use of concessional resources will
    help deploy new financing to where it is most additional and has the
    highest impact.

<!-- -->

-   Enhanced support for addressing the urgent needs of low-income
    countries, including through contributions to support crisis
    response in International Development Association recipient
    countries.

   
Recognizing that the public sector alone cannot meet the immense
development needs, the Vice President also underscored our commitment to
work with the World Bank and other shareholders to develop and implement
an action plan to raise the level of ambition in mobilizing private
investment.   
   
The Vice President discussed with President Banga her work around the
world, from Southeast Asia to Africa to the Caribbean.  In particular,
as the Vice President has made clear in this and other meetings,
countries should have access to the finance and tools they need to
accelerate the clean energy transition and build resilience to shocks. 
The Vice President and President Banga also discussed ongoing work to
galvanize private investment in developing countries, particularly in
Central America and Africa.  This meeting comes just before the Vice
President’s upcoming trip to The Bahamas on June 8 to participate in the
U.S.-Caribbean Leaders Meeting, alongside President Banga, where she
will further discuss the U.S. commitment and actions to support
sustainable and inclusive economic development in the Caribbean.  To
this end, she raised the importance of all creditors offering Climate
Resilient Debt Clauses to allow a temporary suspension of debt service
after a natural disaster.
