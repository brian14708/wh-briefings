Voting is the bedrock of our democracy. Today’s decision preserves state
courts’ critical role in safeguarding elections and protecting the voice
and the will of the American people. We know that more work must to be
done to protect the fundamental right to vote and to draw fair maps that
reflect the diversity of our communities and our nation. The President
and I will keep fighting to secure access to the ballot box, but we
cannot do this alone. We continue to call on Congress to do their part
to protect voters and our democracy and pass the John Lewis Voting
Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
