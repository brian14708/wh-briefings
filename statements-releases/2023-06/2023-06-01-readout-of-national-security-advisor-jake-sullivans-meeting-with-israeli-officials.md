Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
hosted Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and Minister of
Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer at the White House today to discuss a broad
range of global and regional issues of mutual concern.  Following up on
the March U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group, they continued
discussions on enhanced coordination to prevent Iran from acquiring a
nuclear weapon, and ways to counter threats from Iran and its proxies. 
Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the Administration’s goal of further enhancing
Israel’s security and economic integration throughout the Middle East. 
Mr. Sullivan also stressed the need to take additional steps to improve
the lives of Palestinians, critical to realizing a more peaceful,
prosperous, and integrated region.  Finally, Mr. Sullivan discussed our
shared concern with Russia’s deepening military relationship with Iran,
and the importance of supporting Ukraine in the defense of its territory
and citizenry, including from Iranian drones.
