title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Dr. Ashish\_Jha"
---
 
When I took office, our nation was facing a once-in-a generation
pandemic, hit with a virus that changed everything. Thanks to my
Administrationâ€™s whole-of-government approach, we now have the tools to
manage COVID-19 and the virus no longer controls our daily lives.  
  
For the last year, I have relied on Dr. Ashish Jha to help me do just
that as the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator. As one of the
leading public health experts in America, he has effectively translated
and communicated complex scientific challenges into concrete actions
that helped save and improve the lives of millions of Americans.  
  
I extend my deepest thanks to Ashish and his family. We are a stronger
and healthier nation because of his contributions to public service.
