title: "The Atlantic Declaration: A Framework for a Twenty-First Century U.S.-UK Economic\_\
  Partnership"
---
 
Today the United States and the United Kingdom are announcing the
Atlantic Declaration for a Twenty-First Century U.S.-UK Economic
Partnership to ensure that our unique alliance is adapted, reinforced,
and reimagined for the challenges of this moment.  
  
Over the last century, the essential partnership between the United
States and the United Kingdom has enabled us to lead together on issues
of global importance. Since the signing of the Atlantic Charter in 1941,
we have worked together to shape an open and rules-based international
order based on our enduring support for shared values. In the New
Atlantic Charter signed in 2021, we underscored and refreshed this
vision. Together, we also designed an international economic
architecture that has underpinned our economic strength and helped to
lift millions around the world out of poverty. Our essential bilateral
relationship is underpinned by the closest cooperation on defense and
security, a thriving economic relationship, leadership in science and
technology, and deep ties between our people and civil societies.  
  
U.S.-UK cooperation and joint leadership is as essential today as ever –
both internationally and for the security and prosperity of our people
at home. To achieve this, we must keep pace with changes in the world
around us and adapt our alliance to them. The global economy is
undergoing one of the greatest transformations since the Industrial
Revolution. Breakthroughs in innovation offer enormous potential if we
can harness them to work for, not against, our democracies and security.
The transition to the clean energy economies of the future is an
opportunity to improve jobs and livelihoods and deepen the resilience of
our economies. At the same time, the nature of national security is
changing. Technology, economics, and national security are more deeply
intertwined than ever before. We face new challenges to international
stability – from authoritarian states such as Russia and the People’s
Republic of China (PRC); disruptive technologies; non-state actors; and
transnational challenges like climate change.  
  
Over the past year, we have taken steps to deepen our unrivalled
defense, security, and intelligence relationship across every theater in
the globe in which we cooperate, recognizing the indivisibility of
security in the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific and other regions. We
have energized our traditional alliances and built new and innovative
partnerships based on deeper cooperation on technology, trade, and
security. We have stood shoulder to shoulder in our resolve to support
Ukraine for as long as it takes in the face of Russia’s illegal,
unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression and to preserve a free,
independent, and sovereign Ukraine. We are committed to continuing to
strengthen NATO’s ability to deter further attempts to undermine
Alliance security, in support of NATO’s new Strategic Concept.  
  
We have taken significant steps to implement AUKUS, including announcing
our plans to support Australia acquiring conventionally armed,
nuclear-powered submarines. Through our deeper engagement in the
Indo-Pacific we are working more closely than ever before with our
partners to support a free and open region. Through the U.S.-UK
Indo-Pacific Dialogue we will continue to find new opportunities to
coordinate our approaches, to support ASEAN and ASEAN centrality, to
partner with the Pacific Islands, to coordinate on economic and
technological advancement, and to contribute to regional peace and
stability, including through AUKUS and expanded joint exercises and
planning, including trilaterally.  
  
Today, we are announcing the Atlantic Declaration for a Twenty-First
Century U.S.-UK Economic Partnership to build on that partnership in the
economic sphere. The United States and the United Kingdom resolve to
partner to build resilient, diversified, and secure supply chains and
reduce strategic dependencies. We remain committed to continuing to lead
in the technologies of the future and advance the closest possible
coordination on our economic security and technology protection toolkits
to ensure that emerging technologies work for, not against, our
democracies and security. And as democratic and open societies we
resolve to work together to ensure the safety, prosperity, and security
of our nations and peoples while driving growth in living standards
across the world.  
  
The Atlantic Declaration and accompanying Action Plan form the basis of
a new type of innovative partnership across the full spectrum of our
economic, technological, commercial and trade relations; a first of its
kind, and which demands our joint leadership and imagination to realize
in full.  
  
It will constitute a new economic security framework covering
ever-closer cooperation on critical and emerging technologies and
stronger protective toolkits. It will support the United States and the
United Kingdom in our efforts to harness the energy transition and
technological breakthroughs to drive broadly shared growth, create good
jobs, and leave no community behind. It will explore ways to deepen our
trade and investment relationship. And it will strengthen our alliance
across defense, science, health security, and space – allowing us to
explore increased cooperation in other areas for mutual economic
benefit.  
  
*These* are the pressing economic issues of our time. These are the
issues that demand the United States and the United Kingdom to lead
together.  

**Action Plan for a Twenty-First Century U.S.-UK Economic Partnership
(ADAPT)**  
  
Deep economic ties between the United States and the United Kingdom have
long been a source of mutual strength. The U.S.-UK bilateral investment
relationship is the largest in the world, with over $1.5 trillion in
stock supporting more than 2.7 million jobs in both countries. As we
evolve our unparalleled economic relationship to reflect today’s
challenges, we have an opportunity to exemplify what a twenty-first
century economic partnership should look like. Together the United
States and the United Kingdom can lead in building a new form of
economic partnership that advances economic growth and competitiveness,
that builds capacity, resilience, and inclusiveness, and works for our
workers and communities. A partnership that works for our businesses,
works for our climate, and works for our national security.   
  
As the first steps in this new partnership, we are today announcing and
taking concrete and coordinated actions to deepen this partnership
across five pillars, by:

-   ensuring U.S.-UK leadership in critical and emerging
    technologies,   
-   advancing ever-closer cooperation on our economic security and
    technology protection toolkits and supply chains,  
-   partnering on an inclusive and responsible digital transformation,  
-   building the clean energy economy of the future, and  
-   further strengthening our alliance across defense, health security,
    and space. 

Senior White House and Downing Street representatives will convene
biannually under the Atlantic Declaration Action Plan (ADAPT) to develop
and drive forward concrete progress across the Atlantic Declaration
Action Plan and ensure increasing ambition over the next months and
years.  
  
**1. Ensuring U.S.-UK Leadership in Critical and Emerging
Technologies**  
  
A handful of critical and emerging technologies are forming the backbone
of new industries and shaping our national security landscape. ​These
technologies include semiconductors, quantum technologies, artificial
intelligence, cutting-edge telecommunications, and synthetic biology. As
the home of world-leading companies and academic institutions, we are
committed to ensuring the United States and the United Kingdom continue
to lead across these sectors. We intend to do so by collaborating on
tangible research and development joint efforts ​, deepening
public-private dialogue across our priority technologies, jointly
mobilizing private capital towards strategic technologies​ ​​and by
improving reciprocal talent flows​.​ These long term initiatives​ ​are the
initial steps in a long-term partnership and will fall under existing
U.S.-UK frameworks, including the U.S.-UK Agreement on Scientific and
Technological Cooperation, the U.S.-UK Comprehensive Dialogue on
Technology and Data, and additional forums as applicable, through which
we will ​​​develop and deliver a shared workplan on critical and emerging
technologies, to be updated and taken forward within the next twelve
months. ​

-   **Launching**​​ **collaborative work on priority technologies.** ​We
    intend to explore joint efforts and collaborative R&D in a range of
    critical and emerging technologies and pursue a set of initial
    activities, including the following:  
    -   Pursuing a range of **quantum technologies initiatives** to
        address fundamental research questions in quantum science and
        other initiatives to reduce barriers to U.S.-UK collaboration,
        such as increasing researcher and student mobility, and
        exploring workforce development activities to foster the
        exchange of people and ideas.  
    -   Cementing leadership by the United States and the United Kingdom
        in **cutting-edge telecoms** by setting out a joint vision,
        taking forward joint R&D projects, and deepening cooperation on
        technical activity in innovative 5G and 6G solutions, including
        more ambitious cooperation to accelerate Open RAN to market, and
        to increase the diversity and resilience of critical supply
        chains.  
    -   Deepening cooperation on **synthetic biology** with a view to
        concluding a joint workplan to drive public and private
        cooperation, exchanges, and joint research, developing novel
        applications and promoting our economic security through
        improved supply chain pathways for biomanufacturing and
        biotechnologies.  
    -   Exploring collaborative R&D in areas that support advanced
        **semiconductor** technologies, such as advanced materials and
        compound semiconductors, beginning in the next twelve months,
        and facilitating collaboration among our national research
        institutes.  
    -   Accelerating our cooperation on **AI** with a focus on ensuring
        the safe and responsible development of the technology.​   
-   **Mobilizing private capital towards strategic technologies.** We
    intend to support the growth of companies in both countries across
    these critical and emerging technologies. We intend to work together
    to crowd in private capital to ensure companies in these areas have
    the ability to emerge and scale. To this end, we commit to set up a
    U.S.-UK Strategic Technologies Investor Council within the next
    twelve months. We will use this newly formed Council to bring
    leading investors from both sides of the Atlantic together with
    national security experts to analyze where funding gaps currently
    exist and unlock new private investment in critical and emerging
    technologies.  
-   **Facilitating reciprocal talent flows.** We recognize the need for
    a skilled workforce across our technology sectors. As part of
    meeting this objective, we leverage expertise from across the public
    sector, industry, and academia to advise on how we best improve
    U.S.-UK reciprocal talent flows. The United States welcomes funding
    from the United Kingdom for expansion of Marshall and Fulbright
    scholarships focused on science, technology, engineering, and
    mathematics subjects, to deepen the ​​wider ​​exchange of talent
    between our two countries.​ 

**2. Advancing Ever Closer Cooperation on Technology Protection,
Economic Security Toolkits and Supply Chains **  
  
Many of our technology protection tools were designed for a different
time, a different set of threats, and a different set of
technologies. We recognize that our current regulatory frameworks
related to export controls, investment screening, sanctions, and
research and development security are essential tools that should
correspond to a changing geostrategic and technological environment. We
intend to take concrete steps to update and more closely align our
respective toolkits across all these areas to prevent the leakage of
sensitive and dual-use emerging technologies, and other
export-controlled commodities and technologies. We will work to enhance
our information-sharing mechanisms on threat information with relevant
stakeholders in the policy and intelligence communities, including
deepening our cooperation on investment security.

-   **Addressing the national security risks posed by certain types of
    outbound investment.** As allies with a close and long-standing
    defense partnership, and as global leaders in critical and emerging
    technologies, we have a shared objective in preventing our
    companies’ capital and expertise from fueling technological advances
    that will enhance the military and intelligence capabilities of
    countries of concern. We are taking steps to ensure that our
    respective toolkits are adequate to meet our shared objective. The
    United States is working to develop a targeted set of controls on
    outbound investments in sensitive technologies with a core national
    security nexus. The United Kingdom intends to complement this by
    swiftly engaging a range of business and financial stakeholders to
    develop an evidence base to assess and inform how the UK can best
    calibrate its actions to respond effectively to these risks and meet
    our shared objective. As we act according to our own respective
    timelines, we will communicate clearly to the private sector
    regarding our joint resolve and shared objectives in this area.  
-   **Ensuring flexible and coordinated export controls.** Against the
    backdrop of a rapidly shifting and ever more sophisticated
    technological landscape, our toolkits must address evolving
    challenges. We will therefore work together to enable our respective
    toolkits to work in a complementary way, implementing export
    controls related to certain sensitive technologies, including
    targeting end-uses of concern, and considering our approach to
    tackling the challenge of intangible transfers. The United Kingdom
    has enhanced its capability in this area by expanding the scope of
    its Military End Use Controls (MEUC) regime and is progressing work
    – due to complete by the autumn – to understand its impact. The
    United Kingdom will consult later this year on updating its export
    control regime and consider how best to flexibly and rapidly tackle
    sensitive technology transfers. The United Kingdom will also consult
    on the targeting of end uses and end-users of concern. Building on
    our existing cooperation and recognising that the multilateral
    system faces challenges in accommodating new realities and that
    creative solutions are necessary, both sides will advance work and
    bilateral consultations in the coming months to enable deeper
    collaboration and ensure both our export control systems are able
    together to tackle the identified threats.  
-   **Strengthening our world-leading partnership across sanctions
    strategy, design, targeting, implementation and enforcement.** We
    will continue to coordinate our work to tackle sanctions evasion and
    intend to jointly target those facilitating Russia’s illegal
    invasion of Ukraine in Russia, Belarus, and in third countries,
    including those who help Russia acquire goods and technology that
    support Russian aggression. We intend to enhance our ability to
    collect, analyze, and share information and data with a financial
    sanctions nexus from our financial institutions and businesses,
    including for identification of companies and individuals
    financially supporting or facilitating payments to Russia’s war
    machine. We further intend to work closely together to protect
    humanitarian activity from unintended impacts of sanctions, building
    on our significant cooperation on the landmark UN Security Council
    Resolution 2664. We have implemented exceptions for humanitarian
    activities in our UN programs. The United States has implemented
    these exceptions in its autonomous sanctions programs, and the
    United Kingdom will take this further in its autonomous sanctions
    programs as appropriate. We will also continue joint work to
    underline that food supplies are not the target of our sanctions.  
-   **Reducing our vulnerabilities across critical technology supply
    chains.** Recent events have shown that our supply chains need to be
    made more resilient to geopolitical incidents, natural disasters,
    third country policies, economic coercion, and other possible
    shocks. The United Kingdom and United States recognize the strategic
    and shared imperative of building resilient semiconductor and other
    critical technology supply chains and are putting in place robust
    strategies to minimize disruptions. In order to further this
    cooperation, the United States and the United Kingdom will work
    bilaterally to share analysis, develop, and deepen our channels for
    coordination and timely consultation during critical technology
    supply chain disruptions and crises.

**3. Partnering on an Inclusive and Responsible Digital
Transformation**  
  
As we promote the critical and emerging technology ecosystems in our
countries, we will work together to shape the policy environment around
technology and enable further responsible innovation.

-   **Enhancing cooperation on data.** ​​The trusted and secure flow of
    data across our borders is foundational to efforts to further
    innovation. To that end, we have committed in principle to establish
    a U.S.-UK Data Bridge to facilitate data flows between our countries
    while ensuring strong and effective privacy protections. We are
    working to finalize our respective assessments swiftly to implement
    this framework. We also intend to coordinate to further promote
    trust in the digital economy, including through support for the
    Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) Forum and the OECD’s
    Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private
    Sector Entities, and to build shared understandings on data security
    risks.  
-   **Accelerating cooperation on AI.**​​ The United States and the
    United Kingdom recognize Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the
    potential to transform our societies and economies and share a
    commitment to the role of government action to unlock the
    opportunities and mitigate the risks arising from the rapid
    development of these technologies.​​ We will accelerate our
    cooperation on AI with a focus on ensuring the safe and responsible
    development of the technology. Both nations welcome ongoing activity
    internationally including at the OECD, UN, Global Partnership for
    AI, Council of Europe, and International Standards Organisations, as
    well as the G7 Hiroshima AI Process, and recognize the need to go
    further particularly with respect to the risks and opportunities AI
    presents. The United States welcomes the Prime Minister’s plans to
    launch the first Global Summit on AI Safety, to be hosted in the
    United Kingdom this year, and commits to attend at a high level.
    This effort, which fits with the United Kingdom’s comprehensive and
    balanced approach to AI risks and opportunities, will bring together
    key countries, as well as leading technology companies and
    researchers, to drive targeted, rapid international action focused
    on safety and security at the frontier of this technology, including
    exploring safety measures to evaluate and monitor risks from AI. The
    United States has taken strong action to promote responsible
    innovation and is undertaking a process to advance a comprehensive
    approach to AI-related risk and opportunities, including
    comprehensive engagement with companies, research, civil society,
    and our allies and partners.  
-   **Deepening** **collaboration on Privacy Enhancing Technologies.**
    ​To maximize the responsible use of data, we intend to launch a
    Collaboration on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that will
    allow us to gain more valuable insight from data and train
    responsible AI models, enabling economic and societal benefits,
    while protecting individuals’ privacy and our democratic principles.

**4. Building the Clean Energy Economy of the Future**  
  
The United States and the United Kingdom are both committed to meeting
our goals under the Paris Agreement, building a clean energy economy,
strengthening resilient supply chains, and investing in our industrial
bases. We share a belief that building a clean energy economy is one of
the most significant opportunities to create good jobs with high labor
standards. We affirm that bold investment and strategic public funding
are necessary to achieve these goals. We are committed to deepening
cooperation to develop and strengthen clean energy supply chains,
including building diverse, resilient, and secure critical mineral and
battery supply chains that reduce unwanted strategic dependencies to
meet our defense, economic, energy security, and climate goals. As we
pursue our national strategies, we will work to align our approaches
wherever possible to make clean energy technologies more affordable for
all nations and help drive a global, just, and secure energy transition
for workers and communities that will leave no one behind. We are
committed to making the 2020s the decisive decade for climate action,
implementing our respective ambitious 2030 nationally determined
contributions under the Paris Agreement, and meeting our 2050 net zero
emission goals.

-   **Launching negotiations on a Critical Minerals Agreement.** With
    congressional consultation, we intend to immediately begin
    negotiations on a targeted critical minerals agreement covering the
    five relevant critical minerals most important for electric vehicles
    – cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese, and nickel – that are
    extracted or processed in the United Kingdom count toward sourcing
    requirements for clean vehicles eligible for the Section 30D clean
    vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. We intend to use
    these focused negotiations to ensure the consistency of our
    approaches on supply chain diversification and robust labor and
    environmental standards to support the creation of well-paying jobs
    with a free and fair choice to join a labor union on both sides of
    the Atlantic. Through our strong U.S.-UK partnership we will work
    towards increasing our respective and collective clean energy
    industrial capacity, boosting electric vehicle production and
    deployment, and expanding access to sustainable, secure,
    high-standard critical mineral and battery supply chains.   
-   **Partnering on a Joint Clean Energy Supply Chain Action Plan.**
    Today we are announcing the launch of a one-year Joint Clean Energy
    Supply Chain Action Plan. Through the U.S.-UK Joint Action Group on
    Energy Security and Affordability (the JAG), the United States and
    the United Kingdom will, by the end of 2023, identify and decide on
    near-term actions our two countries can take in parallel and
    together to accelerate the buildout of capacity in our countries and
    third countries sufficient to meet the clean energy demands of the
    future. We intend to conduct public-private consultations across key
    clean energy supply chains, including offshore wind and electric
    vehicle batteries, and conduct rapid stress-test exercises across
    key clean energy supply chains, which could form a model for future
    work on supply chain resilience.  
-   **Launching a Civil Nuclear Partnership.** Building on our unique
    economic and security relationship, and recognizing our
    complementary capabilities, we are launching a civil nuclear
    partnership overseen by senior officials in both governments. The
    JAG will also be mobilized to set near-term priorities for joint
    action to encourage the establishment of new infrastructure and
    end-to-end fuel cycle capabilities by 2030 in both continents, and
    substantially minimize reliance on Russian fuel, supplies, and
    services. Our joint activity and leadership will support and
    facilitate the safe, secure, and sustainable international
    deployment of advanced, peaceful nuclear technologies, including
    small modular reactors, in accordance with the highest
    non-proliferation standards and consistent with a 1.5 degree Celsius
    limit on global warming. These priorities will form the basis of a
    Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC),
    which is designed to deliver on shared commitments by the end of the
    year and serve as an enduring bilateral forum to advance shared
    policy goals across existing engagement mechanisms, including
    near-term actions identified through the JAG, and facilitate
    exchanges on new and evolving technical and policy developments
    regarding nuclear energy. 

**5. Strengthening our Alliance Across Defense, Health Security, and
Space**  
  
We are further strengthening the U.S.-UK alliance in emerging areas with
critical nexuses to economic resilience and economic security.

-   **Continuing to optimize our longstanding defense cooperation.** We
    continue to optimize our longstanding defense cooperation and ensure
    that defense and technology trade and exports between our countries
    are as frictionless as possible, particularly as part of our efforts
    to enable collaboration in and between AUKUS nations. To this end,
    the President plans to ask the United States Congress to add the
    United Kingdom as a “domestic source” within the meaning of Title
    III of the Defense Production Act. Doing so would deepen industrial
    base collaboration, accelerate, and strengthen AUKUS implementation,
    build new opportunities for United States investment in multiple
    strategic sectors, and support our efforts to increase our
    respective and collective industrial capacity across both clean
    energy and key technology sectors. Together the U.S. and the UK are
    taking steps to streamline defense trade between our nations,
    including the U.S. proposal to Congress to modernize export control
    laws to enhance collaboration between and among AUKUS nations. The
    UK is also examining its export control regime to streamline the
    flow of defense trade among the AUKUS partners.  
-   **Strengthening bilateral cooperation on biological and health
    security.** Building on the New Atlantic Charter, we commit to
    strengthening bilateral collaboration between our two nations on
    biological security, reflecting our shared ambition to bolster
    future heath and economic resilience against a growing and diverse
    spectrum of biological threats (deliberate, accidental, or natural),
    including drug-resistant infections. To this end, we will increase
    our collaboration to overcome the market failures that prevent vital
    research and development of anti-microbial vaccines, therapeutics,
    and diagnostics – via mechanisms such as the Combating Antibiotic
    Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X). We will
    enhance our cooperation on tackling emerging infectious disease
    threats with pandemic or epidemic potential and promote biosafety,
    biosecurity, and responsible innovation in the biotechnology and
    life science sectors domestically and internationally to realize the
    full potential of the growing bioeconomy. We reaffirm our commitment
    to strengthen global norms against the misuse of biology and
    prohibitions on the development of biological weapons.   
-   **Looking to the future and deepening our partnership across all
    sectors of space cooperation.** We recognize recent bilateral
    innovation in commercial space launch and are committed to further
    strengthening bilateral commercial space cooperation, including in
    the field of deep space communications. We are committed to taking
    tangible steps to deepen our collaboration on space sustainability
    and our respective regulations. The United States welcomes the close
    partnership with the United Kingdom on heliophysics missions and the
    United Kingdom’s contribution to the NASA Helioswarm mission in
    particular. The United States welcomes potential participation by
    the United Kingdom in future commercial space station concepts. The
    United States and the United Kingdom are committed to studying
    opportunities for cooperation on space nuclear power and propulsion
    in accordance with their respective domestic laws and consistent
    with international obligations and commitments.
