Today, President Biden announced that Christian L. Tom will serve as
Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Digital
Strategy.

*Statement from President Biden:*

“Christian is an innovator. He helped develop a first-of-its-kind
digital strategy in 2020 — one that has continued to be a key part of
this Administration’s approach to reach Americans in new, creative, and
authentic ways. As a Day 1 member of my team, Christian returns to the
White House with a wealth of experience in the ways technology, digital
media, and social platforms can be used to strengthen our democracy and
bring people together.

The way we consume information is undergoing a fundamental shift. Under
Christian’s leadership, my Office of Digital Strategy will remain at the
forefront of this change, navigating how people exchange information on
a daily basis.”

President Biden also announced that Patrick Stevenson will be Deputy
Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor for Digital Strategy, and
Tericka Lambert will be promoted to Deputy Assistant to the President as
the Deputy Director of Digital Strategy.
