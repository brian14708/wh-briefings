On June 15, 2023 in Tokyo Japan, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
met with Japanese National Security Secretariat Secretary General Akiba
Takeo and ROK National Security Office Director Cho Tae-yong for a
trilateral national security advisors meeting.  Mr. Sullivan commended
his counterparts on the historic steps taken by both Seoul and Tokyo to
strengthen bilateral Japan-ROK ties, noting that our trilateral
partnership is now stronger and has more potential than ever before. The
national security advisors discussed the DPRK’s illicit nuclear and
missile programs and most recent provocations and identified next steps
to strengthen their coordination. They discussed opportunities for
coordination in the East China Sea and South China Sea and emphasized
the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. 
The national security advisors discussed ways to increase economic
security cooperation, including on critical and emerging technologies,
energy security, and countering economic coercion.  Mr. Sullivan
reiterated the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of
Japan and the ROK and the national security advisors discussed recent
efforts to strengthen both alliances to the benefit of the region. The
national security advisors look forward to the trilateral leaders’
summit to be hosted by President Biden in the United States in the
coming months.
