title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Tom\_Perez"
---
 
I am pleased to announce that Tom Perez will be serving as Senior
Advisor, Assistant to the President, and Director of Intergovernmental
Affairs.  
   
Tom will build on the tremendous work of Julie Chavez Rodriguez.
He brings decades of experience to my team, having served in local,
state and federal government. His perspective and relationships as a
former county councilman, a top civil rights attorney, and Secretary of
Labor will be invaluable as we implement our Invest in America agenda
and continue to make our government work for the people and for
communities across the country.  
   
I’ve known Tom for years and I look forward to working together again.
