title: "FACT SHEET:Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Protect\
  \ LGBTQI+\_Communities"
---
 
Today, in celebration of Pride Month, the Biden-Harris Administration is
announcing new actions to protect LGBTQI+ communities from attacks on
their rights and safety.  Over a dozen states have enacted anti-LGBTQI+
laws that violate our most basic values and freedoms as Americans, and
are cruel and callous to our kids, our neighbors, and those in our
community. The Biden-Harris administration stands with the LGBTQI+
community and has their backs in the face of these attacks, and today,
federal agencies are announcing new actions to:

-   **Protect LGBTQI+ communities from attacks on their rights and
    safety **by launching a new LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership and
    announcing that the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights
    Division of the Justice Department will serve as the Department’s
    liaison to the LGBTQI+ community on issues related to protecting the
    rights of the community.
-   **Support LGBTQI+ kids so they can thrive **by strengthening mental
    health resources for LGBTQI+ youth, launching a new federal
    initiative to address LGBTQI+ youth homelessness, releasing federal
    funding to support programs that help parents affirm their LGBTQI+
    kids, and advancing new regulations to protect LGBTQI+ youth in
    foster care.
-   **Shield LGBTQI+ Americans from book bans that threaten their
    rights **by announcing that the Department of Education will appoint
    a new coordinator to address the growing threat that book bans pose
    for the civil rights of students.

Today’s announcements include:

**I.   Protecting the LGBTQI+ Community**

**Launching a LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership. **LGBTQI+
communities face a surge in violence against individuals and community
spaces. [Federal threat
monitoring](https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-may-24-2023) shows
that these threats are increasingly tied to hate groups and domestic
violent extremists. LGBTQI+ individuals – especially transgender women
and girls of color – have experienced disproportionately high rates of
violence and hate crimes for decades. To protect against these
increasing threats, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with
support from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), will launch the LGBTQI+ Community
Safety Partnership. The Partnership will work hand-in-hand with LGBTQI+
community organizations to provide critical safety resources to ensure
these organizations can remain safe spaces for the community. In
acknowledgement of the mistreatment that LGBTQI+ communities have often
faced in interactions with law enforcement, the Partnership will also
work to build trust between LGBTQI+ organizations and federal law
enforcement agencies. The Partnership will:

-   **Provide dedicated safety trainings for LGBTQI+ community
    organizations and increase federal threat briefings for LGBTQI+
    organizations. **DHS, through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
    Security Agency (CISA), will provide trainings to LGBTQI+ community
    organizations – including community centers, small businesses, and
    Pride festivals – to help them prevent and respond to threats. DHS
    will host bi-monthly threat briefings (or as required based on
    changes in the threat levels) for LGBTQI+ organizations to provide
    updates on the threat landscape and review key indicators of
    violence, and offer resources for local leaders. DHS will also lead
    a series of workshops for LGBTQI+ community organizations to raise
    awareness of federal funding for both physical security and threat
    prevention grant opportunities.  
     
-   **Protect health care providers who serve the LGBTQI+
    community. **DHS and HHS will work with health care providers and
    medical associations to provide access to safety trainings and
    improve threat reporting to support doctors, clinics, and children’s
    hospitals that face increasing threats when they care for LGBTQI+
    patients.  
     
-   **Support LGBTQI+ communities to report hate crimes and build
    cross-community partnerships to address hate-fueled violence. **U.S.
    Attorneys’ Offices, FBI Field Offices, DOJ Community Relations
    Service (CRS), the Civil Rights Division and others will undertake
    targeted engagement with community groups from the LGBTQI+ community
    and other communities victimized by hate crimes to increase
    understanding about how to report hate crimes. DOJ will also enhance
    public trust and public safety by partnering with state and local
    law enforcement agencies to increase the number of law enforcement
    officers who have completed CRS’s training programs on engaging with
    transgender individuals. Through its United Against Hate initiative,
    which brings together diverse communities to help improve the
    reporting of hate crimes and provide an opportunity for trust
    building between law enforcement and communities, DOJ will engage
    LGBTQI+ communities and other communities victimized by hate crimes
    as the program is expanded to all 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices by the
    end of September. 

**Protecting LGBTQI+ Americans’ rights. **DOJ is committed to taking an
all-of-Department approach to protecting LGBTQI+ rights.  As part of
that commitment, DOJ’s LGBTQI+ Working Group will coordinate quarterly
stakeholder meetings chaired by the Assistant Attorney General of the
Civil Rights Division, who will serve as liaison to and engage with the
LGBTQI+ community and other relevant stakeholders on issues related to
discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community. In addition, the Associate
Attorney General will continue to coordinate and expand the Department’s
work to respond to issues and challenges that affect the LGBTQI+
community, building on DOJ’s existing efforts to support the rights of
LGBTQI+ Americans. DOJ is also releasing a fact sheet summarizing the
Department’s work to protect the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans.

**II.   Supporting LGBTQI+ kids to thrive.**

-   **Support the mental health of LGBTQI+ youth and partner with
    families to affirm LGBTQI+ kids. **LGBTQI+ youth face a nationwide
    mental health crisis, and almost half of LGBTQI+ kids say they
    seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. However,
    when LGBTQI+ kids are supported, they thrive. Today, HHS is
    announcing it will issue a Behavioral Health Care Advisory on
    Transgender and Gender Diverse Youth to provide evidence-based
    practices for mental health providers. HHS will also issue a
    guidance to states and communities on using federal funding to
    support mental health services for LGBTQI+ youth, including funding
    from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and provide technical
    assistance to communities to increase LGBTQI+ youth mental health
    services. HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA) has also just released an [LGBTQI+ Family
    Support
    Grant](https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grant-announcements/fg-23-004) to
    provide $1.7 million in federal funding for programs that prevent
    health and behavioral health risks for LGBTQI+ youth (including
    suicide and homelessness) by helping families to affirm and support
    their LGBTQI+ child.

-   **Protect LGBTQI+ youth in foster care. **LGBTQI+ youth are
    overrepresented in the child welfare system, and far too often
    experience trauma, including being exposed to so-called “conversion
    therapy” while in care, being placed in foster care or congregate
    care settings that are hostile to their identity, or lacking access
    to health care and mental health services to support them. Today,
    the Administration for Children and Families at HHS is announcing
    that it will advance a rulemaking under Title IV-E of the Social
    Security Act to protect LGBTQI+ youth in foster care by requiring
    that state child welfare agencies ensure that LGBTQI+ youth have
    access to a safe and appropriate placement and have access to
    supportive services that help to affirm them. To inform this
    potential proposed rule, HHS will continue engaging with LGBTQI+
    youth, foster parents, and other stakeholders.  
     
-   **Shield LGBTQI+ kids and families from discrimination.** The HHS
    Office for Civil Rights is announcing that it expects to issue
    proposed regulations to protect LGBTQI+ kids and families from
    discrimination in human services programs that support children and
    families. This Rule would strengthen protections eroded by the
    previous Administration to help protect LGBTQI+ Americans from
    discrimination.  
     
-   **Address LGBTQI+ youth homelessness. **The Department of Housing
    and Urban Development is announcing that it will launch a new
    LGBTQI+ Youth Homelessness Initiative to partner with local
    communities, service providers, and directly affected young people
    to address LGBTQI+ youth homelessness. Nearly 40 percent of all
    youth experiencing homelessness identify as LGBTQI+. HUD will
    encourage communities to develop collaborative solutions to address
    the specific needs of LGBTQI+ youth experiencing homelessness. HUD
    will also provide technical assistance and regular training for
    shelter and service providers, new resources highlighting innovative
    methods for supporting LGBTQI+ youth, and Know Your Rights tools for
    LGBTQI+ youth. This work will be informed by listening sessions HUD
    will hold with LGBTQI+ youth across the country.

**III.    Addressing Book Bans**

-   **Protecting Americans from book banning. **Across the country, our
    nation faces a spike in book bans – efforts that disproportionately
    strip books about LGBTQI+ communities, communities of color, and
    other communities off of library and classroom shelves. In fact,
    2022 saw the [highest
    number](https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2023/03/record-book-bans-2022) of
    book bans in 20 years. Book banning erodes our democracy, removes
    vital resources for student learning, and can contribute to the
    stigma and isolation that LGBTQI+ people and other communities face.
    The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is announcing
    that to support its ongoing work to defend the rights of LGBTQI+
    students and other underserved communities, it will appoint a new
    coordinator to address the growing threat that book bans pose for
    the civil rights of students. That coordinator will work to provide
    new trainings for schools nationwide on how book bans that target
    specific communities and create a hostile school environment may
    violate federal civil rights laws.

**Uplifting LGBTQI+ communities. **The Department of Education will
host *Free to Learn: Creating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School
Environments for LGBTQI+ Students*, a national convening on taking
action to support LGBTQI+ students. The Department of Health and Human
Services will host *Advancing LGBTQI+ Health Equity*, a national
convening on ensuring that LGBTQI+ Americans are healthy and can thrive.
