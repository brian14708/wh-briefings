title: "Readout of the National Academies Workshop on Incorporating Climate into Macroeconomic\_\
  Modeling"
---
 
Last week, Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) Member Heather Boushey,
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Deputy Director for
Industrial Innovation Justina Gallegos, OSTP Chief Environmental
Economist Solomon Hsiang, and other officials from across the
Biden-Harris Administration participated in a workshop on [Incorporating
Climate into Macroeconomic
Modeling](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/39824_06-2023_incorporating-climate-into-macroeconomic-modeling-a-workshop)
convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine. At the workshop, representatives from CEA and the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) presented recent analysis and our current
analytical approach to accounting for the economic impacts of climate
change in the Administration’s macroeconomic forecasts.  
   
The workshop was the first of four in a series initiated by the
[Roundtable on Macroeconomics and Climate-related Risks and
Opportunities](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/roundtable-on-macroeconomics-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities),
a group that the White House [helped
establish](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/25/readout-of-the-executive-meeting-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-roundtable-on-macroeconomic-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities/).
The workshop featured sessions on how current macroeconomic models may
or may not be accounting for climate change, strategies used in the
research community to project the physical and transition risks of
climate change, and synthesis discussion around identifying avenues for
connecting these modeling communities. In attendance were dozens of
scholars, policymakers, and civic and business leaders focused on the
intersection of climate change, macroeconomic modeling, and public
policy.  
  
The President knows that to address the serious challenges climate
change presents, we must take swift and bold action, which is why he has
set an ambitious goal of transitioning to a net-zero economy by 2050. To
support this effort, the President’s [Executive Order on Climate-Related
Financial
Risk](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/15/fact-sheet-biden-administration-roadmap-to-build-an-economy-resilient-to-climate-change-impacts/) called
on CEA and OMB to “identify the primary sources of Federal
climate-related financial risk exposure and develop methodologies to
quantify climate risk within the economic assumptions and the long-term
budget projections of the President’s Budget.” New analytic tools to
accurately model the macro-economic effects of climate change and the
energy transition will enable policymakers to better anticipate, plan
for, and manage these emerging risks.  
   
In response to this Executive Order, CEA, OMB, and an Interagency
Technical Working Group are working together to improve the
representation of climate risks in the Federal Budget. This includes an
updated accounting of climate risks in the [Long-Term Budget
Outlook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ap_3_long_term_fy2024.pdf).
The modeling behind this accounting and a framework for improving this
model are described in a recent [CEA and OMB white
paper](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CEA-OMB-White-Paper.pdf),
which builds on conversations at the [Inaugural Meeting of the
Roundtable](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/01/readout-of-the-inaugural-meeting-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-roundtable-on-macroeconomic-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities/)
in October 2022 and [the Executive Meeting of the
Roundtable](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/25/readout-of-the-executive-meeting-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-roundtable-on-macroeconomic-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities/)
in January 2023. Future workshops will provide further guidance on
longer-term work to develop new tools and models to improve the
Administration’s accounting and management of the complex risks of
climate change and the energy transition.  
   
These workshops represent one of a series of steps the White House has
taken to foster a global community of practice around these modeling
efforts. Other such initiatives include recent convenings of [private
sector macroeconomic
forecasters](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/23/readout-of-convening-on-blue-chip-climate-risk-macroeconomic-forecasts/)
and of [representatives of partner governments’ finance ministries and
multilateral
institutions](/Users/AJWilson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/HEKA1ZDV/whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/14/readout-of-workshop-on-addressing-integration-of-climate-risks-into-macroeconomic-models/),
including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Together,
these events will build our global collective knowledge base and further
an economic toolkit that can help us move prudently and reliably toward
a net-zero economy.
