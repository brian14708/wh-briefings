title: "President\_Biden Names Thirty-Fifth Round of Judicial Nominees and One New\
  \ Nominee to Serve as U.S.\_Attorney"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate four individuals to
federal district courts, two individuals to the Court of International
Trade, and three individuals to the District of Columbia Superior
Court—all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
  
This will be President Biden’s thirty-fifth round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 176.  
  
The President is also announcing his intent to nominate one individual
to serve as U.S. Attorney.  This is an official who will be
indispensable to upholding the rule of law as a top federal law
enforcement official.  
  
This candidate was chosen for her devotion to enforcing the law,
professionalism, experience and credentials, dedication to pursuing
equal justice for all, and commitment to the independence of the
Department of Justice.  
  
The President has now announced 72 nominees to serve as U.S.
