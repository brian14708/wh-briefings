title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration and Civic Nation Bring Together\
  \ Over 300 National and Community Organizations to Help Students and Families Cut\
  \ Costs and Access Affordable High-Speed\_Internet"
---
 
Access to high-speed internet is no longer a luxury – it is a necessity
to fully participate in today’s society. Still, many students and
families go without high-speed internet because of the cost, while
others are forced to cut back on other essentials to pay their monthly
internet bill. That’s why President Biden and Vice President Harris
worked with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to include the
Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)**—**the largest internet
affordability program in our nation’s history**—**in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. The Affordable Connectivity Program, administered by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), provides eligible
households up to $30/month (or up to $75/month on qualifying Tribal
lands) off internet bills, as well as a one-time discount of up to $100
off a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet. To further lower costs,
President Biden and Vice President Harris secured commitments from
internet service providers across the country to offer high-speed
internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity
Program—meaning millions of working families can now get high-speed
internet without paying a dime. Americans can check their eligibility
and sign-up at [GetInternet.gov](https://getinternet.gov/).  
  
**Today, the Administration announced that Civic Nation and the U.S.
Department of Education are launching** [***Online For
All***](https://onlineforall.org/)**, a digital equity campaign working
to close the digital divide by focusing on internet access,
affordability, and equity for students, families, and all
Americans. ***Online For All* will work with nonprofit, government,
corporate, and media stakeholders to educate communities about how the
Biden-Harris Internet for All Initiative can help them access reliable,
affordable high-speed internet.  
  
The partnership is kicking off with a Week of Action to drive enrollment
in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Over 18.5 million households are
now enrolled, saving a total of over $500 million per month on their
high-speed internet bills. This is incredible progress for a program
that is just 18 months old, but there’s more work to do. Research
indicates that approximately half of the remaining qualified Americans
are not aware of the program. **The *Online for All* Week of Action will
bring together the federal government and over 300 organizations to
raise awareness and help eligible families sign-up.  
  
AN “ALL OF GOVERNMENT” EFFORT**

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to continuing to reach
qualified Americans and seeing this program continue for years to come.
The Administration previously launched an [“all of government” ACP
enrollment
drive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/21/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-highlights-milestone-of-1-million-new-participants-on-reducing-high-speed-internet-cost-for-americans/).
Now, the Administration is taking additional actions to reach eligible
Americans, including:

-   **Vice President Kamala Harris** is encouraging Americans to sign-up
    for the Affordable Connectivity Program at
    [GetInternet.gov](https://getinternet.gov/apply) in a new video.
    **View the video**
    [**HERE**](https://twitter.com/VP/status/1668969605526593537).  
     
-   The **FCC** and the **Universal Service Administration
    Company** (USAC) have made significant improvements to the

    including allowing Pell Grant recipients to apply without having to
    submit eligibility documentation.

    Pell Grant recipients of their eligibility for the program, and that
    they can enroll without eligibility documentation.

    satellite media tour to spread the word about the Affordable
    Connectivity Program through radio and television interviews in

    send a message about the Affordable Connectivity Program to 84,000
    school principals, vice principals, and tech coordinators across the
    country.  
     
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services **will share
    information about the Affordable Connectivity Program with Federally
    Qualified Health Centers and the stakeholders who provide telehealth
    services.   
     
-   The **Department of Agriculture** (USDA) and the **FCC** partnered
    to train USDA State Directors and General Field Representatives on
    how to help get qualified households enrolled.  
     
-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development **(HUD) will send
    a letter about the Affordable Connectivity Program to all 3,300+
    Public Housing Authorities in the nation to help ensure as many
    HUD-assisted families have access to quality, high-speed internet as
    possible.  
     

 And Administration officials are hitting the road to spread the word.
Today’s events include:

-   **Senior Advisor to the President and White House Infrastructure
    Coordinator Mitch Landrieu** and **FCC Chairwoman Jessica
    Rosenworcel** will kick-off the week with a “train the trainer”
    event at a library in **Towson**, **Maryland**.

    (AFT), the National Education Association (NEA), and the National

    with the tools they need to educate families on this opportunity and
    keep students connected over the summer.  
     
-   **Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information
    Alan Davidson** will join New America’s Open Technology Institute,

Connecting all communities across the United States to affordable
high-speed internet is a central part of President Biden’s and Vice
President Harris’ *Investing in America* agenda, which is rebuilding our
nation’s infrastructure, driving new private sector manufacturing
investments, and creating good-paying jobs, including those that don’t
require a four-year degree—rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and
middle out. That investment includes Monday’s announcement of more than
$700 million across 19 states through the ReConnect Program to fund
affordable high-speed internet deployment in rural America. And by June
30, the Department of Commerce will announce state and territory
allocations for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD)
program, which will also require service providers receiving funding to
offer a low-cost plan and to participate in the Affordable Connectivity
Program.
