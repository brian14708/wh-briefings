title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Action to Address Veteran\_\
  Homelessness"
---
 
President Biden has made clear that every veteran deserves a roof over
their head, and since Day One, his Administration has made lowering
housing costs and addressing homelessness — particularly among veterans
— a top priority.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing new actions to
prevent and reduce homelessness among veterans through actions that
include launching supportive services to quickly rehouse veterans
experiencing homelessness; providing new legal services for veterans
experiencing or at risk of homelessness; and funding programs to help
veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness find jobs and connect
to work. The Administration will also invest an unprecedented $3.1
billion to help communities across the country quickly rehouse people
experiencing homelessness, including veterans.  
  
These actions build upon historic investments by the Biden-Harris
administration to address veteran homelessness that have driven historic
reductions in homelessness amongst veterans.   Today the number of
veterans experiencing homelessness has fallen by 11% since early 2020
and by more than 55% since 2010. They will also advance the
Administration’s goal to permanently house [at least 38,000
veterans](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-announces-goal-to-house-38000-veterans-experiencing-homelessness-in-2023/)
in 2023. Specifically, the Administration is:

1.  **Making the single largest investment in communities’ homelessness
    response systems in history. **The Department of Housing and Urban
    Development (HUD) will soon issue a Notice of Funding Opportunity to
    provide approximately $3.1 billion under the Continuum of Care (CoC)
    program—the largest-ever single-year investment through this program
    to help communities address homelessness. The funds will support
    efforts by nonprofit providers, States, Indian Tribes or Tribally
    Designated Housing Entities, and local governments to quickly
    rehouse homeless individuals; families; veterans and their families;
    persons fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,
    and stalking; and youth while minimizing the trauma and dislocation
    caused by homelessness. The program will also promote access to and
    effective utilization of affordable housing programs and other
    health and supportive services by homeless individuals and families.
     HUD is strongly encouraging CoCs to work and coordinate with local
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers, to ensure these
    funds are effectively supporting veterans and their families.  
2.  **Providing first-of-its-kind funding for legal services for
    veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness.** The Department
    of Veterans Affairs (VA) is [awarding $11.5
    million](https://news.va.gov/press-room/first-of-their-kind-grants-for-legal-services-for-homeless-veterans)
    to public and nonprofit organizations through its new Legal Services
    for Veterans Grant Program. Funds will support veterans experiencing
    or at risk of homelessness, including providing legal representation
    to help prevent eviction and helping veterans obtain public benefits
    for which they are eligible.  
3.  **Connecting veterans experiencing homelessness with jobs.** The
    Department of Labor Veterans’ Employment and Training Service (VETS)
    is awarding more than $58 million in grant funding to help veterans
    experiencing or at risk of homelessness reintegrate into the labor
    force, including homeless women veterans, homeless veterans with
    children, and justice-involved veterans. These grants have helped
    train and place homeless veterans in in-demand sectors such as
    advanced manufacturing, construction, information technology, and
    cybersecurity. Grants are locally designed and tailored to the
    service area, giving America’s veterans experiencing homelessness
    the ability to reach their full employment potential and obtain
    high-quality career outcomes.  
4.  **Launching new effort to quickly rehouse veterans.** HUD and VA are
    launching a series of “Boot Camps” to help public housing agencies
    and VA Medical Centers improve their processes and more quickly
    transition veterans from homelessness to permanent housing with
    wrap-around supportive services under the HUD-VA Supportive Housing
    (HUD-VASH) program. These Boot Camps will seek to improve program
    efficiency, impact, and utilization of the HUD-VASH program, which
    pairs rental assistance with vital case management and supportive
    services. Increasing the use of housing vouchers like HUD-VASH and
    the Emergency Housing Voucher Program to address homelessness is one
    of HUD’s key strategies under [All In: The Federal Strategic Plan to
    Prevent and End
    Homelessness.](https://www.usich.gov/All_In_The_Federal_Strategic_Plan_to_Prevent_and_End_Homelessness.pdf)
    HUD also recently issued
    [guidance](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/pih2023-13.pdf)
    to public housing agencies on ways they can support efforts to
    address homelessness using all of their programs, including public
    housing and Housing Choice Vouchers.

President Biden’s American Rescue Plan represented the largest
single-year investment in ending homelessness in U.S. history and helped
prevent a surge of homelessness across the country. Earlier this year,
HUD [released](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_079) a
series of grants totaling $486 million, as well as approximately 3,300
housing stability vouchers to help 62 communities address unsheltered
and rural homelessness and homeless encampments. And, in May, the
Biden-Harris Administration launched [ALL

a new initiative to address unsheltered homelessness in selected
communities.

The President’s Fiscal Year 2024 Budget also proposes unprecedented
investments—not only to urgently address homelessness, but also
to [prevent
homelessness](https://www.usich.gov/news/how-president-bidens-fy-2024-budget-would-prevent-homelessness),
including through additional housing vouchers; emergency rental
assistance; increasing the supply of affordable housing; and
establishing a guarantee of rental assistance for extremely low-income
veterans and youth aging out of foster care—two groups
disproportionately at risk of and experiencing homelessness.
