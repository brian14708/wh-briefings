title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on House Republicans\u2019\
  \ Tax Scam\_2.0"
---
 
The GOP Tax Scam 2.0 once again makes clear the House Republicans’
values: their priority isn’t reducing the deficit or out-competing the
world, their priority is giving handouts to rich special interests and
corporations at the expense of everyone else. Just days ago, House
Republicans were demanding devastating cuts to programs hard-working
Americans count on—from health care to public safety to Meals on
Wheels—in the name of “deficit reduction.” Today, they are proposing to
spend hundreds of billions on tax breaks for big corporations. That
means they are prioritizing restoring tax breaks for big corporations
over restoring tax credits that helped cut child poverty in half. And
they would deliver those tax giveaways to large profitable corporations,
while shipping clean energy jobs overseas and raising energy costs on
American families by thousands of dollars a year.
