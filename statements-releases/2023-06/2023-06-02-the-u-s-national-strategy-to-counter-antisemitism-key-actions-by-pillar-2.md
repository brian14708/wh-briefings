title: "The U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism: Key Actions by\_Pillar"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration released [the U.S. National Strategy to
Counter
Antisemitism](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/U.S.-National-Strategy-to-Counter-Antisemitism.pdf)
on May 25, 2023. The strategy outlines a whole-of-society approach to
tackle the scourge of antisemitism in America. It features over 100
meaningful actions that over two dozen government agencies will take to
counter antisemitism, as well as over 100 calls to action for Congress,
State and local governments, companies, technology platforms, students,
teachers and academics, civil society and faith leaders, and others to
counter antisemitism. The four pillars of the strategy address key
themes and threats raised by over 1,000 diverse stakeholders across the
Jewish community and beyond: (1) increasing awareness and understanding
of antisemitism, including its threat to America, and broaden
appreciation of Jewish American heritage; (2) improving safety and
security for Jewish communities; (3) reversing the normalization of
antisemitism and countering antisemitic discrimination; and (4) building
cross-community solidarity and collective action against hate.

**Pillar 1: Increase awareness and understanding of antisemitism,
including its threat to America, and broaden appreciation of Jewish
American heritage**

In order to fight antisemitism, Americans must recognize and understand
it. The strategy seeks to increase awareness and education in schools,
communities, and the workplace about both antisemitism, including the
Holocaust, and Jewish American heritage.

-   **The United States Holocaust and Memorial Museum** will launch the
    first-ever U.S.-based Holocaust education research center to promote
    effective Holocaust education.
-   **The National Endowment for the Humanities will** issue a special
    call for research applications to study the origins, history, and
    effects of antisemitism in the United States, including the spread
    of antisemitism online.
-   **Federal agencies will** incorporate information about antisemitism
    into federal Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA)
    training programs.
-   **The Department of Labor** **will** disseminate model resources for
    unions on how to recognize antisemitism and how countering
    antisemitism relates to workers’ rights.
-   **The Small Business Administration will** facilitate the provision
    of training and resources for small business owners and employees on
    understanding, preventing, and responding to antisemitism.
-   **The Institute of Museum and Library Services** **will** partner
    with the Council of American Jewish Museums to host a summit for
    museums, libraries, and archives on countering antisemitism.

**Pillar 2: Improve safety and security for Jewish communities   **

To prevent violence against Jewish communities through accountability,
deterrence, and effective responses to attacks, the strategy aims to
improve data collection on antisemitism, ensure vigorous enforcement of
hate crime laws, and increase federal funding for the physical security
of Jewish institutions.

-   This summer, **the Department of Justice** **and** **the Department
    of Homeland Security** will undertake targeted engagements with the
    Jewish community to understand and help address their security
    needs.
-   **The White House** will launch an interagency effort to understand
    the barriers to reporting hate incidents, eliminate those barriers,
    and improve criminal justice data reporting.
-   **The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice
    published** and disseminated [a resource
    guide](/Users/AJPascal/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/F7XFRSMY/resource%20guide)
    for houses of worship and other faith-based institutions to increase
    security while sustaining an open and welcoming environment.
-   **The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will** offer
    risk assessments, planning assistance, and active shooter and bomb
    prevention-related training to Jewish houses of worship, community
    centers, and day schools.
-   **The Department of Commerce** **will** publish a report on
    telecommunications’ role in the commission of hate crimes, including
    the use of social media in antisemitic harassment.
-   **The Biden-Harris Administration calls** on Congress to fully fund
    its FY24 budget request of $360 million for the Nonprofit Security
    Grant Program (NSGP)—$55 million above the FY23 enacted amount.

**Pillar 3: Reverse the normalization of antisemitism and counter
antisemitic discrimination**

To address the rise of antisemitic speech and intimidation in the public
square and especially online, the strategy urges all Americans to speak
out against antisemitism and calls on Congress and tech platforms to
take action to address hate online. The strategy also commits agencies
to raise awareness of and fully enforce federal nondiscrimination laws.
It additionally aims to boost digital literacy and civics education and
combat growing antisemitism in schools and especially on college
campuses.

-   **The Department of Education will** launch an [Antisemitism
    Awareness
    Campaign](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-antisemitism-awareness-campaign)
    aimed at raising awareness among educators, students, parents, and
    school communities about the alarming rise of antisemitism and
    giving them the tools to address it.
-   **Federal agencies will** raise awareness about and fully enforce
    federal nondiscrimination laws to counter antisemitic and related
    forms of discrimination as well as promote religious communities’
    equitable access to government programs and religious
    accommodations. For example, the **Department of Housing and Urban
    Development issued
    a** [letter](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/Ensuring%20Fair%20Housing%20Amidst%20Ongoing%20Religious%20Discrimination.pdf) to
    the over 200 federally-funded Fair Housing Initiatives Programs and
    Fair Housing Assistance Programs on how to identify and counter
    antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and
    discrimination in housing. 
-   **The Department of Agriculture will** work to ensure equal access
    to all USDA feeding programs for USDA customers with religious
    dietary needs, including kosher and halal dietary needs. **The
    Department of Health and Human Services will** similarly expand
    efforts to ensure kosher and halal foods are provided in hospitals.
-   **The Department of Defense will** evaluate all existing training to
    identify any gaps in coverage of antisemitic conduct as a form of
    prohibited discrimination.
-   **The Biden-Harris Administration calls** on Congress to hold social
    media platforms accountable for spreading hate-fueled violence,
    including antisemitism, by requiring fundamental reforms to Section
    230 of the Communications Decency Act and by removing special
    immunity for online platforms; to impose much stronger transparency
    requirements on online platforms, including their algorithmic
    recommendation systems, content moderation decisions, and
    enforcement of community standards; and to pass legislation
    requiring platforms to enable timely and robust public interest
    research, including on the spread of antisemitism and other forms of
    hate, using platforms’ data and analyzing their algorithmic
    recommendation systems, while maintaining users’ privacy.
-   **The Biden-Harris Administration encourages all online platforms to
    independently commit to actions such as** ensuring that terms of
    service and community standards explicitly cover antisemitism; adopt
    zero-tolerance standards for hate speech, including antisemitism;
    permanently ban repeat offenders, both personal accounts and
    extremist websites; invest in the human and technical resources
    necessary to enable vigorous and timely enforcement of their terms
    of service and community standards; improve capabilities to stop
    recommending and de-rank antisemitic and other hateful content; and
    increase the transparency of their algorithmic recommendation
    systems and data.

**Pillar 4: Build cross-community solidarity and collective action to
counter hate**

Partnerships across diverse communities and faiths provide a foundation
to counter antisemitism and other forms of hate. They are one of
America’s greatest strengths. To strengthen the bonds of solidarity and
mutual support among Jewish and other communities, the strategy expands
the most effective efforts at coalition-building against hate and
supports efforts to mobilize multi-faith partnerships nationwide.

-   **The President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition will**
    launch a digital campaign to spotlight the importance of
    cross-community solidarity.
-   **The President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities will** work
    with national and local leaders in the public, private, and
    non-profit sectors to bolster social cohesion in America, and combat
    hate and targeted violence.
-   **The White House Office of Public Engagement will** launch the Ally
    Challenge, inviting Americans to describe their acts of allyship
    with Jewish, Muslim, or other communities that are not their own.
    The White House will recognize leaders of outstanding projects.
-   **The White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood
    Partnerships will**, in cooperation with federal agency Centers for
    Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and diverse faith leaders,
    produce a toolkit for faith communities on standing in solidarity
    with other religious communities to combat antisemitism and other
    forms of hate.
-   **The Department of Veterans Affairs will** expand its chaplain
    partnership with Jewish, Muslim, and other chaplain associations and
    facilitate local multi-faith partnerships among chaplains of diverse
    faiths.
