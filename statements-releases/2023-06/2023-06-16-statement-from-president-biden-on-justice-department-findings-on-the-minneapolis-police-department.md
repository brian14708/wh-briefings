title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Justice Department Findings on the Minneapolis\
  \ Police\_Department"
---
 
This afternoon, I was briefed by my team on the Department of Justice’s
independent findings of unconstitutional practices of the Minneapolis
Police Department. The findings are disturbing and underscore the urgent
need for Congress to pass common sense reforms that increase public
trust, combat racial discrimination and thereby strengthen public
safety.  
   
Since I took office, the Department of Justice has also taken
independent and aggressive action to ensure accountability for systemic
misconduct and by police departments at the local level. The vast
majority of Americans want the same thing: trust, safety,
accountability. Any police officer will tell you that public trust is
the foundation of public safety. At the same time, we must also ensure
law enforcement have the funding, resources, training, and personnel
they need for safe, effective, and accountable community policing in
line with the standards of my Policing Executive Order.  
   
One year ago, I stood alongside the family of George Floyd, civil rights
leaders, and law enforcement to sign a historic Executive Order to
advance effective, accountable policing and criminal justice practices
that will limit racial profiling, build public trust and strengthen
public safety. It’s a positive step forward, but we know there is still
more work to be done – especially in communities of color, where the
bonds of trust are frayed or broken. I have a simple message for
Congress: send the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to my desk, and
I will sign it. I will continue to do everything in my power to fight
for police accountability in Congress, and I remain willing to work with
Republicans and Democrats alike on genuine solutions.
