WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
the following individual to serve as a key leader in his administration:

-   Nancy Anderson Speight, Nominee for Member of the Federal Labor
    Relations Authority

**<u>Nancy Anderson Speight, Nominee for Member of the Federal Labor
Relations Authority</u>**

Nancy Anderson Speight has served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Civilian Personnel Policy since August of 2021. Her
responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and programs to
manage the Department’s civilian workforce effectively, efficiently, and
strategically. Speight is responsible for ensuring the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies and Field Activities, as well as
military departments are provided with comprehensive policy advice and
guidance through the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service.

Previously, Speight served in the Senior Executive Service as the
Regional Director for the Atlanta Regional Office of the Federal Labor
Relations Authority (FLRA) from 2001 to 2009, an independent agency that
administers the labor-management relations program for 1.9 million
non-Postal Service Federal employees world-wide. At the FLRA, she was
responsible for providing leadership and management of personnel and
operations relating to the investigation, analysis, resolution, and
litigation of unfair labor practice cases and the processing of
representation petitions for cases arising in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, South Carolina, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Prior to being appointed as the Atlanta Regional Director, Speight held
multiple positions within the FLRA’s Office of the General Counsel where
she managed regional operations, conducted agency management
assessments, and implemented changes in policy, case handling
procedures, and resources. As a recognized expert on representation
matters, she was instrumental in reorganizing two Executive Departments
and authored amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the Deputy General
Counsel that resulted in precedent-setting case law decisions. Speight
wrote the operational manuals which guide FLRA employees when processing
representation petitions that are still in use today.
