Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer spoke with
President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia today.  Mr. Finer stressed the
United States’ concern about the tense situation in northern Kosovo and
called for all parties to take steps aimed at de-escalating the
situation.  He urged the Government of Serbia to withdraw its armed
forces stationed near the border and to lower their state of readiness,
as well as to urge protesters to remain peaceful in northern Kosovo. 
Mr. Finer reiterated that the United States expects both sides to
re-engage in the EU-facilitated Dialogue and to fully implement the
normalization agreement reached in Brussels and Ohrid earlier this year.
