title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Labor Agreement at West Coast\_Ports"
---
 
As I have always said, collective bargaining works, and I congratulate
both parties at the ports for reaching an agreement. I want to
thank Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su who used her deep experience and
judgment to keep the parties talking, working with them to reach an
agreement after a long and sometimes acrimonious negotiation. Above all
I congratulate the port workers, who have served heroically through the
pandemic and the countless challenges it brought, and will finally get
the pay, benefits, and quality of life they deserve.

Julie Su has proven herself time and time again, both as Deputy
Secretary working closely with Secretary Marty Walsh – and now as a
leader who helped assure that our supply chains remain strong for
America’s businesses, farmers, and working families.
