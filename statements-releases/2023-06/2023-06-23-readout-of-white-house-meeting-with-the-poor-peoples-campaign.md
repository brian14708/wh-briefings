This week, White House Office of Public Engagement Director Steve
Benjamin, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, and Infrastructure
Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu met with Co-Chair of the Poor
People’s Campaign Bishop William J. Barber, *Service Employees
International Union (SEIU)* International President Mary Kay Henry, and
other leaders from the Poor People’s Campaign and Repairers of the
Breach to discuss the enduring fight to end poverty in America.  
  
During the meeting, senior White House officials underscored the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to make the promise of America
real for every American, including communities impacted by persistent
poverty. They discussed how President Biden has led the most equitable
economic recovery on record by signing into law the historic American
Rescue Plan (ARP), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA), in turn creating more than 13 million jobs since
taking office and helping generate new economic opportunities for
underserved communities. The officials thanked participants for sharing
their stories about the devastating impact of poverty and for their
moral leadership and partnership in building an America in which all can
participate, prosper, and reach their full potential.  The officials
emphasized the Biden-Harris Administration’s core commitment to continue
building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
