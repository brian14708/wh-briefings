title: "Readout of White\_House Celebration of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and\
  \ the PUMP for Nursing Mothers\_Act"

Today, Special Assistant to the President for Gender Policy Latifa
Lyles, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Charlotte
Burrows, and Principal Deputy Administrator of the Wage and Hour
Division at the U.S. Department of Labor Jessica Looman hosted a
roundtable conversation to discuss the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act
(PWFA), which went into effect today, and the Providing Urgent Maternal
Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act. These laws, which President
Biden signed in December 2022, advance the President and Vice
President’s commitment to ensuring America’s workers have access to good
jobs, and safe and healthy workplaces free from discrimination. Today’s
event included workers, employers, advocates, and unions.  
  
Participants discussed how the PWFA will help millions of pregnant and
postpartum workers request reasonable accommodations in the workplace
and ensure they are able to stay in their jobs. They also discussed how
the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act extends break time and private space
protections for nursing parents to nine million workers, including
teachers, nurses, and farmworkers. During the event, workers shared
their stories about their need for accommodations at work to maintain a
healthy pregnancy and the importance of being able to pump at work. The
Administration officials shared information and new resources to help
workers and employers understand their rights and responsibilities under
these laws, and underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
to supporting the well-being and economic security of pregnant,
postpartum, and nursing women.
