title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of William\_Spriggs"
---
 
I am deeply saddened by the passing of Bill Spriggs, a man who brought
as much lasting brilliance to economics as he brought joy to his friends
and colleagues. Bill was a towering figure in his field, a trailblazer
who challenged the field’s basic assumptions about racial discrimination
in labor markets, pay equity, and worker empowerment. His work inspired
countless economists, some of whom work for our Administration, to join
him in the pursuit of economic justice. Serving as both the Economics
Department Chair at Howard University and as Chief Economist for the
AFL-CIO — the first Black American to hold the position — Bill
relentlessly fought to ensure that the voices and needs of workers were
at the center of economic policymaking.  Bill was also a dedicated
public servant who held several economic policy positions across the
federal government spanning two presidential administrations. Along with
these remarkable contributions and achievements, Bill will be missed for
his kindness, warmth, and humility.
