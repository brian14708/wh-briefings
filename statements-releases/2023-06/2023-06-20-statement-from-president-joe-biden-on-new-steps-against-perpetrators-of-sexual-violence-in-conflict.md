title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on New Steps Against Perpetrators of Sexual\
  \ Violence in\_Conflict"
---
 
Yesterday, nations around the world marked the International Day for the
Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict, recognizing that this
scourge continues to be widespread throughout the world—from Ukraine, to
Ethiopia, to Haiti, to Sudan, and beyond. The United States is committed
to doing all we can to end this blatant abuse of human rights. That’s
why, today, my Administration is issuing historic sanctions targeting
actors who perpetrate this abuse—marking the first time that a dedicated
focus on conflict-related sexual violence has led to the imposition of
U.S. sanctions.  
   
Ending gender-based violence, wherever it occurs, and supporting
survivors has been a high priority for me – as a Senator, Vice
President, and since day one of my Administration. Last November, I
issued a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/28/presidential-memorandum-to-promote-accountability-for-conflict-related-sexual-violence/)
to reinforce and strengthen our government’s use of financial,
diplomatic, and legal tools to address conflict-related sexual violence.
The sanctions issued today build off of this Memorandum and
[designate](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1552) two
political and military targets from South Sudan who oversaw the rape and
murder of civilians during the civil war, and [two ISIS
terrorists](https://www.state.gov/designating-and-promoting-accountability-for-conflict-related-sexual-violence/)
responsible for the brutal rape and torture of Yazidi women and girls.  
   
The United States stands in solidarity with survivors of sexual violence
in conflict. And, together with our partners, we will continue to lead
the effort to hold perpetrators accountable for this grave abuse of
human rights.
