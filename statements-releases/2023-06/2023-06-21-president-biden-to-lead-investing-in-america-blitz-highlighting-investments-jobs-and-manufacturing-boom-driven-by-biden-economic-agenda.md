*Biden Administration to launch second installment of Investing in
America tour coinciding with the Fourth of July Congressional Recess*

On Monday, June 26, President Biden will kick off a second round of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America tour with a major
infrastructure funding announcement at the White House. Over the course
of three weeks, President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill
Biden, Cabinet members, and Senior Administration Officials will
barnstorm across the country to highlight how President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda is driving a manufacturing and clean energy
boom, rebuilding America’s infrastructure, lowering costs, and creating
good-paying jobs. The three-week tour will run from June 26 through July
15, overlapping with the two-week Congressional Recess around
Independence Day.  
  
During the tour, President Biden and leaders across the Administration
will travel directly to communities benefitting from President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda. This includes communities seeing new
manufacturing and clean energy investments spurred by the Inflation
Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, new infrastructure projects
funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, small businesses and
families saving money on high-speed internet as a result of the American
Rescue Plan, and more. While Congressional Republicans try to repeal key
provisions of the Investing in America agenda that are lowering costs
for millions of Americans and revitalizing American manufacturing,
President Biden and leaders across the Administration will highlight how
the President’s Investing in America agenda is creating jobs and
opportunity in every corner of the country.
