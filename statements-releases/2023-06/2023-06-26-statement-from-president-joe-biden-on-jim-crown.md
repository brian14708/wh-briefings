title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Jim\_Crown"
---
 
When Jim and Paula Crown joined us at the White House last week for a
State Dinner, Jim was as he always was – thoughtful, warm, a good man.
It was heartbreaking to learn today of his shocking death.

Jim lived a great Chicago story – one that tied our nation’s industrious
past to an ever-hopeful future. He grew up the great-grandson of a
sweatshop worker whose son turned a construction-supply company into an
empire. Throughout his own career as a business and civic leader, Jim
continued to drive that legacy forward, bring out the best in his peers,
and help shape the city he loved.  
  
His commitment to Chicago was bone deep; many flagship institutions
benefitted from his generosity, from the University of Chicago to the
Museum of Science & Industry. More recently, Jim was on the cusp of a
new initiative, rallying fellow corporate leaders to commit to hiring
people from communities that have been left behind and to be part of the
solution to end gun violence.

Jim represented America at its best – industrious, big-hearted, and
always looking out for each other. He was a good man, a dear friend, and
a great American.  
  
Jill and I send our love to his wife, Paula; their four children and two
grandchildren; as well as to Jim’s parents, Renee and Lester, and his
six brothers and sisters.
