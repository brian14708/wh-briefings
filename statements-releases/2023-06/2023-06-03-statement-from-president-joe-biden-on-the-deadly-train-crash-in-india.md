title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Deadly Train Crash in\_India"
---
 
Jill and I are heartbroken by the tragic news of the deadly train crash
in India. Our prayers go out to those who have lost loved ones and the
many who suffered injuries in this terrible incident. The United States
and India share deep bonds rooted in the ties of family and culture that
unite our two nations—and people all across America mourn alongside the
people of India.  As the recovery effort continues, we will hold the
people of India in our thoughts.
