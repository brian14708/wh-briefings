title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Republican Study Committee\_\
  Budget"
---
 
The hardcore MAGA budget just released by the Republican Study Committee
– which represents a majority of House Republicans – amounts to a
devastating attack on Medicare, Social Security, and Americans’ access
to health coverage and prescription drugs.  
   
The Republican Study Committee is taking aim at the Medicare benefits
all Americans pay to earn by repealing the new power President Biden
gave it to negotiate lower drug costs, to address rapid drug price
increases, and to cap the price of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries.  
   
They are also raising the retirement age for Social Security.  
   
This is exactly what Republicans in Congress pledged not to do just
months ago at the President’s State of the Union address.  
   
Moreover, on top of these devastating cuts to programs middle class
families rely upon, the Republican Study Committee wants to cut off tens
of millions of Americans from healthcare coverage by slashing the
Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, while ending critical protections for
people with pre-existing health conditions.  
   
Worse yet, House Republicans want to impose these disastrous cuts for
hardworking families alongside massive tax cuts for the super-rich and
big corporations. In fact, they’re proposing a total of $5 trillion in
tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations – cutting taxes by
at least $175,000 per year for the wealthiest 0.1 percent with incomes
over $4 million.  
   
President Biden is working around the clock to grow our economy by
investing in America and the middle class – not the trickle-down
economics that never actually trickle-down.  
   
This extreme MAGA proposal invests in the super wealthy and the biggest
corporations at the expense of hardworking families. It’s not just
backward, it threatens all the economic progress the President has made
over the last two and a half years to rebuild an economy that works for
everyone
