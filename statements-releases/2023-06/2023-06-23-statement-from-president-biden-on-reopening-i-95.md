title: "Statement From President\_Biden on Reopening\_I-95"
---
 
 When I visited Philadelphia on Saturday and met with local officials
and union workers, I made clear: my Administration would move heaven and
earth to reopen I-95 as soon as possible.

Thanks to the grit and determination of operating engineers, laborers,
cement finishers, carpenters, teamsters, and so many other proud union
workers doing shifts around the clock, I-95 is reopening. And it’s ahead
of schedule.

I want to thank Governor Shapiro for his great work and leadership, as
well as Senator Casey, Senator Fetterman, Congressman Boyle, Mayor
Kenney, and my team including Senior Advisor and Infrastructure
Coordinator Landrieu, Secretary Buttigieg, FHWA Administrator Bhatt and
many others. This emergency repair is 100% federally funded and all
approvals were given as quick as possible. We also deployed officials
from the U.S. Department of Transportation to the crash site within
hours – to help fast-track the effort.  We are proving that when we work
together, there is nothing we cannot do.

I grew up in Claymont, Delaware not far from the damaged stretch of
I-95. I know how important it is to people’s quality of life, the local
economy, and the 150,000 vehicles that travel on it every day. That’s
why I’m so proud of the hard-working men and women on site who put their
heads down, stayed at it, and got I-95 reopened in record time.

This is an important step forward. We’ll be here to provide whatever it
takes to keep the permanent repairs on track.
