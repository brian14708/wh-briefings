All Americans deserve the opportunity to pursue a college education
without the burden of crushing student loan debt. That is why our
Administration took action to provide a lifeline to tens of millions of
borrowers. Nearly 90% of the people who would have benefitted make less
than $75,000 per year. At every turn, Republican officials at the state
level and in Congress tried to block our plan. Today, the Supreme Court
sided with them.   
   
Reducing student loan debt and securing relief for families has been a
priority throughout my career and a pillar of our Administration. As
California Attorney General, I took on predatory for-profit colleges and
won $1 billion for defrauded veterans and other students. President
Biden and I fought to secure the largest increases to Pell Grants in a
decade. And our Administration’s income driven repayment plan will cut
undergraduate loan payments in half by capping monthly payments at five
percent of income.    
   
President Biden and I are committed to delivering the relief student
debt borrowers need to recover from the pandemic and move forward with
their lives. As the President announced, we are moving quickly to create
an alternative path to provide relief through the Higher Education Act. 
In the short-term, borrowers struggling to make their payments will be
protected from impacts on their credit for 12 months. And we are
launching our new income-based repayment program, which will cut monthly
payments in half for undergraduate borrowers.    
   
Our Administration will continue to fight to make sure Americans can
access the life-changing opportunities of postsecondary education
without assuming life-altering amounts of student loan debt.
