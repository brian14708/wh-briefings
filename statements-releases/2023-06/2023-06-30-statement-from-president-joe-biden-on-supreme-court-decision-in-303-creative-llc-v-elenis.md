title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Supreme Court Decision in 303 Creative\
  \ LLC v.\_Elenis"
---
 
In America, no person should face discrimination simply because of who
they are or who they love. The Supreme Court’s disappointing decision
in *303 Creative LLC v. Elenis *undermines that basic truth, and
painfully it comes during Pride month when millions of Americans across
the country join together to celebrate the contributions, resilience,
and strength of the LGBTQI+ community. While the Court’s decision only
addresses expressive original designs, I’m deeply concerned that
the decision could invite more discrimination against LGBTQI+
Americans. More broadly, today’s decision weakens long-standing laws
that protect all Americans against discrimination in public
accommodations – including people of color, people with disabilities,
people of faith, and women.  
   
My administration remains committed to working with our federal
enforcement agencies to rigorously enforce federal laws that protect
Americans from discrimination based on gender identity or sexual
orientation. We will also work with states across the country to fight
back against attempts to roll back civil rights protections that could
follow this ruling. And we will accelerate our march towards full
equality for every American.  
   
When one group’s dignity and equality are threatened, the promise of our
democracy is threatened and we all suffer. Our work to advance equal
rights for everyone will continue. That is why we must pass the Equality
Act, which will enshrine civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ Americans
in federal law and strengthen public accommodations protections for all
Americans. I urge Congress to swiftly send this legislation to my desk.
