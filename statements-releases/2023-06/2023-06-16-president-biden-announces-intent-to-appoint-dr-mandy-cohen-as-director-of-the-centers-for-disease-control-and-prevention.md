Today, President Biden announced his intent to appoint Dr. Mandy Cohen
as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
  
*Statement from President Biden:  
*  
Dr. Cohen is one of the nation’s top physicians and health leaders with
experience leading large and complex organizations, and a proven
track-record protecting Americans’ health and safety.  
  
As Secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human
Services, Dr. Cohen developed innovative and nationally recognized
programs that improved the health and lives of families across the
state. Her leadership through the COVID-19 crisis drew bipartisan
praise, as did her successful transformation of North Carolina’s
Medicaid program and pivotal role in the bipartisan passage of Medicaid
expansion. Before serving in North Carolina, Dr. Cohen held senior roles
at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services where she helped
implement Affordable Care Act programs, including expanding insurance
coverage and protections.   
  
Dr. Cohen has been recognized by leaders from both parties for her
ability find common ground and put complex policy into action. I look
forward to working with Dr. Cohen as she leads our nation’s finest
scientists and public health experts with integrity and transparency.

Medicaid expansion, and her focus on “whole person health” with the
launch of the country’s first statewide coordination platform,
NCCARE360.   
   
Dr. Cohen is currently the Executive Vice President at Aledade and CEO
of Aledade Care Solution, which helps independent primary care
practices, health centers, and clinics deliver better care to their
patients and thrive in value-based care.

Staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and served as
Acting-Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance
Oversight (CCIIO).  Dr. Cohen was involved in many aspects of the
Affordable Care Act policy development and implementation, including the
expansion of coverage, insurance protections, and new provider payment
models.   
   
A graduate of Cornell University, Dr. Cohen received her medical degree
from Yale School of Medicine and a Master’s in Public Health from the

Massachusetts General Hospital. Secretary Cohen is married to Sam Cohen,
a health care regulatory attorney and they have two daughters.
