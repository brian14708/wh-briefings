Today’s report is good news for hard working families. It shows
continued progress tackling inflation at the same time that unemployment
remains at historic lows. Annual inflation is now at the lowest level
since March 2021, and less than half of what it was last June. After gas
and grocery prices increased rapidly last year due to the war in
Ukraine, inflation has fallen for 11 months in a row.  
   
While there is more work to do, the plan that I laid out a year ago to
bring down the cost of living and sustain stable and steady growth is
working.  We have taken action to bring down the cost of gas at the
pump, prescription drugs, and health insurance premiums. At the same
time, the unemployment rate has remained below 4 percent for the longest
stretch in more than 50 years, helping to support wage gains over the
last year, even after accounting for inflation. More Americans are in
the workforce than in decades. And, earlier this month, I brought
Democrats and Republicans together around a bipartisan agreement that
protects our historic economic progress and reduces the deficits by
nearly $1 trillion over the next decade.  
   
We are just getting started. My Investing in America agenda is
rebuilding our infrastructure, manufacturing, and supply chains here at
home, and creating good-paying jobs. Under my administration, private
sector companies have invested over $470 billion in manufacturing, and
America is seizing leadership in the industries that will be critical to
our economic security for decades, like semiconductors and clean energy.
I’ve never been more optimistic that our best days are ahead of us.
