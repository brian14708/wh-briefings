Jill and I send our best wishes to all those celebrating Eid al-Adha,
the “great holiday” of Islam.  The traditions of Eid commemorate the
story of Abraham and his family’s ultimate fidelity to God, and serve as
a reminder of the importance of selflessness, charity, and service to
the less fortunate.

This year—for the first time—the White House is celebrating Eid al-Adha
with a gathering of Muslim community leaders, hosted by Vice President
Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff. In the United States,
we are proud to be home to millions of Muslims who enrich our nation’s
cultural fabric and contribute to our shared prosperity. We value the
countless contributions American Muslims make to our society, from
education and healthcare to business and public service. Their presence
strengthens our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and religious
freedom.

As we gather with loved ones and engage in acts of worship, charity, and
community service during this holy occasion, let us renew our commitment
to the values that bind us together: compassion, empathy, and mutual
respect. These principles are at the core of both Islam and the American
spirit.

As Muslims around the world celebrate Eid, more than a million pilgrims
are peacefully performing their religious obligations of, the Hajj*,* at
Mount Arafa and Mecca in Saudi Arabia —including thousands of American
Muslims— and, here in America, we join in the work of renewing our
commitment to pursuing peace and a better world for everyone. The Hajj
brings together people from every continent and corner of the globe,
leaving their worldly possessions and wearing the simple, white *Ihram*
garb in a spirit of equality. This idea is similar to those on which our
nation is built — that we are all created equal, and have the right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

May the spirit of Eid Al-Adha bring joy, peace, and unity to your hearts
and homes. We look forward to welcoming home our American Muslim
pilgrims who have earned the title “Al-Hajj.” To them and to Muslims
across the globe, we wish you a joyous and peaceful holiday. Eid
Mubarak!
