title: "Excerpts from Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President\_Biden on Averting\
  \ Default and the Bipartisan Budget\_Agreement"
---
 
Essential to all the progress we’ve made in the last few years is
keeping the full, faith, and credit of the United States and passing a
budget that continues to grow our economy and reflects our values as a
nation.

And that’s why I’m speaking to you tonight. To report on a crisis
averted and what we are doing to protect America’s future. Passing this
budget agreement was critical. The stakes could not have been higher.

…

No one got everything they wanted but the American people got what they
needed. We averted an economic crisis and an economic collapse.

We’re cutting spending and bringing deficits down. And, we protected
important priorities from Social Security to Medicare to Medicaid to
veterans to our transformational investments in infrastructure and clean
energy.
