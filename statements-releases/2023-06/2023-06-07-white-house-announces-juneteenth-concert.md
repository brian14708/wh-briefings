******The President and First Lady to Host a Juneteenth Concert
on******  
******Tuesday, June 13, 2023******

The White House announced today a Juneteenth Concert on Tuesday, June
13. The South Lawn concert will be a celebration of community, culture
and music.

In 2021, President Biden signed bipartisan legislation establishing
Juneteenth as the nation’s newest Federal holiday, so that all Americans
can feel the power of this day, learn from our history, celebrate our
progress, and recognize and engage in the work that continues.  

President Biden has worked to advance racial equity and ensure the
promise of America for Black Americans. See fact sheet on the
Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to advance equity and
opportunity for Black Americans and communities across the
