title: "Message to the Senate on the President\u2019s Veto of S.J. Res.\_11"
---
 
TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
  
     I am returning herewith without my approval S.J. Res. 11, a
resolution that would disapprove the rule entitled “Control of Air
Pollution From New Motor Vehicles:  Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle
Standards.”

     This rule amends the Environmental Protection Agency’s heavy-duty
emissions control program — including its standards, test procedures,
and other requirements — to further reduce the air quality impacts of
heavy-duty engines.  The rule cuts pollution, boosts public health, and
advances environmental justice in communities across the country.  It
will prevent hundreds, if not thousands, of premature deaths; thousands
of childhood asthma cases; and millions of missed school days every
year.

     The resolution would deny communities these health benefits by
resulting in weaker emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles and
engines, which are significant sources of pollutants that threaten
public health.  If enacted, the resolution would squander $36 billion in
benefits to society — and an opportunity to lead on the defining crisis
of our time.

     Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.  

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 June 14, 2023.
