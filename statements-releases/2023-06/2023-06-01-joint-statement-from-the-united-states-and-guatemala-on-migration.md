---
 
On May 31, 2023, as follow up to the May 26, 2023 call between President
of Guatemala Alejandro Giammattei and Vice President of the United
States Kamala Harris, National Security Advisor to the Vice President
Dr. Phil Gordon and National Security Council Senior Director for
Transborder Katie Tobin led a high-level delegation of White House and
State Department officials to meet with President Giammattei and a
high-level delegation comprised of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
Interior and National Defense, the Solicitor General, the Migration
General Director and the Ambassador of Guatemala to the United States.
Today’s meetings built on the strong cooperation between Guatemala and
the United States to manage the historic irregular migration challenge
impacting both countries.   
   
As a result of this meeting, the two governments jointly commit to take
a series of critical steps to humanely reduce irregular migration and
expand legal pathways under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and
Protection.  
   
Guatemala and the United States announce a comprehensive program to
manage irregular migration, including as the first step the
implementation of a six-month pilot phase of “Oficinas de Movilidad
Segura”. This program will facilitate access to lawful pathways to the
United States and other countries, family reunification, and access to
temporary work visas. These offices will begin accepting appointments on
the website [movilidadsegura.org](https://movilidadsegura.org/) on June
12, 2023.  
   
The United States and Guatemala will also deepen cooperation on border
security and will continue to address the root causes of irregular
migration.
