title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Proposed FCC All-in Pricing\_Rule"
---
 
My Administration’s top priority is lowering the cost of living for the
middle class, and that includes cracking down on companies’ use of junk
fees to hide true costs from families, who end up paying more as a
result. Today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), under the
leadership of Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, proposed a new rule that
would require cable and satellite TV providers to give consumers the
all-in price for the service they’re offering up front. Too often, these
companies hide additional junk fees on customer bills disguised as
“broadcast TV” or “regional sports” fees that in reality pay for no
additional services. These fees really add up: according to one
report, they increase customer bills by nearly 25% of the price of base
service.   
   
The FCC all-in pricing proposal would help consumers comparison shop
between providers and increase competition for viewers. This is only the
latest action taken by my Administration to crack down on junk fees in
order to increase transparency, and bring down costs for hard working
Americans. Junk fees may not matter much for the wealthy, but they hit
working families hard, costing them hundreds of dollars that could be
used to help pay their bills.
