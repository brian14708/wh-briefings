title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Marking National Gun Violence Awareness\_\
  Day"
---
 
In the last year alone, we’ve lost more than 40,000 Americans to gun
violence. Countless other survivors of gun violence will carry the
trauma for the rest of their lives.  
   
In the last two years, I’ve been able to sign the most significant gun
safety legislation in decades and have taken dozens of executive
actions. But it’s not nearly enough. I will keep fighting to do
everything I possibly can, but the reality is that it will take
Congressional action to make the kinds of meaningful reforms we need to
keep our communities safe.  
   
A broad majority of Americans want to see commonsense reforms that would
curb our gun violence epidemic – like establishing universal background
checks, requiring safe storage of firearms, and finally banning assault
weapons and high-capacity magazines.  
   
But instead of listening to their constituents, Republicans in Congress
continue to do the bidding of the gun lobby. Instead of shielding our
kids from gun violence in their classrooms, Republicans in Congress are
focused on shielding gun manufacturers from liability.  
   
At a time when guns are the number one killer of kids in America, it
shouldn’t be this hard to convince Republicans in Congress to keep
weapons of war off our streets and to keep guns out of the hands of
dangerous people. Even a majority of responsible gun owners support
commonsense actions to save lives and keep our communities safe.  
   
State lawmakers must step up as well. I’m encouraged by the growing
number of states working to pass commonsense measures like red flag laws
and assault weapons bans, but we have to do more. And Americans must
demand more.  
   
It is within our power to realize a future where our malls, grocery
stores, movie theaters, and places of worship are safe from the threat
of gun violence. Where parents aren’t gripped with anxiety dropping
their kids off at school every single day. Where our children don’t
learn to duck and cover before they learn to read and write. But it will
require Congress to act.  
   
Today and every day, Jill and I hold those killed and injured by gun
violence, and their loved ones, in our prayers. And we pray for the day
that we can honor their memory with meaningful action to address a
crisis of gun violence that has gone on for far too long.
