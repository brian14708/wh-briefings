**WASHINGTON –** Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to
nominate Charlotte A. Burrows to be a Member of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.

**<u>Charlotte A. Burrows, Nominee for Member of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission</u>**

Charlotte A. Burrows has served as Chair of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) since January of 2021. As Chair, Burrows
has worked to enhance the EEOC’s enforcement of all laws within its
jurisdiction and advocated for robust cooperation between the
Commission, employers, and employees to advance equal opportunity in the
workplace. She has focused on combating retaliation, ensuring that
artificial intelligence and other technologies comply with workplace
civil rights laws, and expanding employment opportunities for
underserved communities. While at the Commission, Burrows has worked to
increase the agency’s outreach to Native Americans, vulnerable immigrant
and migrant communities, and other traditionally underserved
populations.

Burrows has dedicated her career to advancing civil rights. Prior to her
appointment to the EEOC, Burrows served as Associate Deputy Attorney
General at the Department of Justice (DOJ), where she worked on a broad
range of civil and criminal matters, including employment litigation,
voting rights, combatting racial profiling, and implementing the
Violence Against Women Act. Burrows previously served as General Counsel
for Civil and Constitutional Rights to Senator Edward M. Kennedy on the
Senate Judiciary Committee and later on the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions. Prior to this, Burrows held several roles
in the Civil Rights Division’s Employment Litigation Section at the DOJ,
including Deputy Chief of the Section. There, she represented the United
States in all phases of civil litigation, including trial, to enforce
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Burrows holds an A.B. from
Princeton University and a J.D. from Yale Law School.
