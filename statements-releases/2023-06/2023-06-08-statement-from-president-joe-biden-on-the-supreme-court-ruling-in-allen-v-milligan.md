title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Supreme Court Ruling in Allen v.\_\
  Milligan"
---
 
Today the Court ruled that Alabama likely violated the Voting Rights Act
by drawing a map that diluted Black votes in the state. The right to
vote and have that vote counted is sacred and fundamental — it is the
right from which all of our other rights spring. Key to that right is
ensuring that voters pick their elected officials — not the other way
around. Today’s decision confirms the basic principle that voting
practices should not discriminate on account of race, but our work is
not done. Vice President Harris and I will continue to fight to pass
both the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and
strengthen the Voting Rights Act, and the Freedom to Vote Act to ensure
fair Congressional maps and that all Americans have their voices heard.
