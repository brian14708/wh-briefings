title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Ongoing Efforts to Stem\
  \ Firearms Trafficking to\_Mexico"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take significant and
historic actions to disrupt the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and
dismantle firearms trafficking networks.  Drug traffickers’ supply of
firearms enables them to grow their enterprises and move deadly drugs,
including illicit fentanyl, into the United States. They use these
weapons, which consist of everything from handguns to high caliber and
assault weapons, against the Mexican people, including law enforcement
and military personnel who try to stop their operations. That’s why
discovering, disrupting, and dismantling firearms trafficking networks
is critical to the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to combat
illicit fentanyl.  
  
On June 14, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, Deputy Homeland
Security Secretary John Tien, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar,
Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives (ATF) Steve Dettelbach, and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor
Josh Geltzer participated in the Southbound Firearms Trafficking
Coordination Meeting at ATF Headquarters to discuss ongoing efforts to
stem the trafficking of firearms from the United States into Mexico.
They also identified near-term actions to scale up collaboration across
the federal enterprise, including surging resources to support Operation
Southbound, a multi-agency enforcement operation led by ATF that
includes Department of Homeland Security (DHS) law enforcement partners.
   
  
The United States is committed to address firearms trafficking into
Mexico that contributes to violence and the trafficking of illicit
fentanyl by:  
  
**Expanding Firearms Trafficking Investigations**

-   The Department of Justice (DOJ) and DHS are working to stem firearms
    trafficking into Mexico through expanded investigatory initiatives.
-   Through its signature firearms initiative, Operation Southbound, DOJ
    disrupts the trafficking of firearms from the United States to
    Mexico. Operation Southbound has deployed nine interagency Firearms
    Trafficking Task Forces to eight cities along the Southwest border.
    These teams focus on investigations that involve trafficking of
    firearms to Mexico – with participation from Immigration and Customs
    Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Customs
    and Border Protection (CBP), and state and local law enforcement, as
    well as prosecutors, U.S. Attorneys, and DOJ’s Criminal Division. As
    a result of these combined efforts, nearly 2,000 firearms were
    seized in the first half of FY23 – a 65.8% increase over the same
    period in FY22. Over 80,000 rounds of ammunition were seized in the
    first half of FY 23 – also a substantial increase over the same
    period in FY22.   
-   Through DHS’s Operation Without a Trace, ICE HSI and CBP, in
    partnership with ATF, identify, target, seize, and investigate the
    financing, transportation, and communications methods employed by
    firearms procurement and smuggling networks to disrupt and dismantle
    their illegal gun trafficking operations. Since its inception,
    Operation Without a Trace has led to over 700 arrests and the
    seizure of over 1,900 firearms and over 850,000 rounds of
    ammunition.  
     

**Holding Traffickers Accountable and Deploying New Authorities**

-   DOJ established a new anti-cartel weapons trafficking group along
    the Southwest border last year that already has proven effective at
    taking concerted action against firearm-trafficking networks. These
    cases include the prosecution in the District of Arizona of Jorge
    Zuniga-Aguilera, who was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison
    for trafficking at least 82 firearms, including one that was used to
    murder a Mexican citizen, and the prosecution in Laredo, Texas of
    Jaime Jesus Esquivel, who produced and illegally exported fully
    automatic weapons to Mexico for use by the cartels.
-   DOJ is using new criminal authorities in the Bipartisan Safer
    Communities Act (BSCA) to identify and hold firearms traffickers
    accountable. These new legal authorities give DOJ critical tools to
    go after gun traffickers by, among other things, making it a federal
    crime to act as straw purchaser of firearms intended for unlawful
    use. DOJ has now charged over 100 defendants with violations of
    BSCA’s firearms-trafficking or straw-purchasing provisions (or
    both). The firearms-trafficking provision has proven particularly
    useful at the Southwest border, as more than half of all charges
    under that offense have been brought by border-state U.S. Attorneys’
    Offices (USAOs).   
-   Using authorities under E.O. 14059 (“Imposing Sanctions on Foreign
    Persons Involved in the Global Illicit Drug Trade”), the Department
    of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed
    multiple rounds of sanctions on individuals engaged in the
    trafficking of high-caliber firearms from the United States to
    Mexico’s powerful drug organizations.  

**Countering Rise of Ghost Guns and Other Dangerous Weapons**

-   The rise of privately made firearms, aka “ghost guns,” has made the
    firearms trafficking challenge more acute. Last year, ATF issued a
    final rule to further rein in the proliferation of ghost guns.
-   To respond to emerging technologies that may pose a threat to public
    safety (i.e., privately made firearms, 3D printers, machinegun
    conversion devices, etc.), ATF created an Emerging Threats Unit
    (ETY) to conduct and coordinate multijurisdictional investigations.
    These cases are often undertaken in conjunction with other violent
    crime-related investigations – and represent a defined partnership
    with the respective USAOs. 
-   ATF is using all tools to stop the proliferation of illegal
    firearms, including partnering with USAOs to bring affirmative civil
    actions and obtain restraining orders to stop the sale of illegal
    machine gun conversion devices. 
-   In a March 14 Executive Order, President Biden also directed the
    independent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a public report
    analyzing how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and how
    such manufacturers market firearms to all civilians, including
    through the use of military imagery.

**Stemming the Supply of Illegal Guns**

-   In 2021, the Justice Department announced a new policy to underscore
    zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally
    licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.
-   The Administration is taking action to promote the safe storage of
    firearms, which can prevent thefts contributing to the flow of
    trafficked firearms. For example, ATF issued a final rule clarifying
    firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to make available for
    purchase compatible secure gun storage or safety devices. In a March
    14 Executive Order, President Biden directed key members of his
    Cabinet to increase public awareness and use of safe storage of
    firearms. He also directed the Secretary of Transportation, in
    consultation with the Department of Justice, to work to reduce the
    loss or theft of firearms during shipment and to improve reporting
    of such losses or thefts, including by engaging with carriers and
    shippers.

**Continuing to Focus on U.S. Outbound Operations and Enforcement**

-   CBP is committed to disrupting the smuggling of weapons and currency
    out of the United States. Through numerous robust outbound
    operations performed at ports of entry along the Southwest Border
    every day, CBP is uniquely postured to navigate the complexities
    associated with stemming the tide of international firearms
    trafficking. In Fiscal Year 2023 to date, CBP has seized over 1,500
    firearms and firearm components and over 100,000 rounds of
    ammunition.
-   ICE HSI is focused on disrupting the illicit flow of firearms,
    firearms components, and ammunition from the United States to other
    countries. HSI special agents investigate individuals and criminal
    organizations that are responsible for the financing, procurement,
    brokering, transportation, and dissemination of firearms in support
    of transnational criminal organizations. In Fiscal Year 2023 to
    date, ICE HSI has seized nearly 1,000 firearms and firearm
    components and more than 125,000 rounds of ammunition.

**Deepening Collaboration with Mexico**

-   In partnership with the Government of Mexico, DOJ – in coordination
    with the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and
    Law Enforcement (INL) – expanded access to the eTrace system in
    Mexico, enabling Mexican law enforcement to quickly track down the
    origin and purchaser of many of the guns used in crimes. To date,
    they have established accounts in the majority of Mexico’s states
    and have plans to complete implementation in the remaining states
    this year. INL and ATF have collectively trained 757 forensic
    experts and investigators from federal and state law enforcement
    agencies on firearms and explosives identification, as well as more
    than 118 forensics experts and investigators from federal and state
    law enforcement agencies on ATF’s eTrace system.
-   As a result of these efforts, nearly 12,000 traces were submitted to
    ATF by Mexican government agencies in the first half of FY 23, and
    over a third of those were successfully traced to a purchaser.
    Successful eTrace hits have informed a number of U.S.-led firearms
    trafficking investigations and prosecutions, including the Villa
    Union case that resulted in the prosecution of 18 individuals.
     Eighteen states and the Federal Attorney General’s Office (FGR)
    have access to eTrace to date.
-   Through INL, State works closely with the Mexican government to
    strengthen their counternarcotics efforts through capacity-building
    training, technical assistance, and provision of technical
    equipment, in addition to supporting police professionalization,
    criminal investigations, and interdiction at the U.S.-Mexico border
    and air, sea, and land ports of entry. In collaboration with DOJ,
    INL has supported the accreditation of 25 ballistics laboratories in
    19 Mexican states and the FGR. As part of the accreditation process,
    INL provides material and equipment donations, including
    ballistics analysis equipment and mobile labs to facilitate
    firearms-related investigations, including firearms trafficking. INL
    aims to accredit one ballistics laboratory in all 32 Mexican states
    by 2025.
-   Recently, Mexican Attorney General Gertz and his Deputy Attorney
    General Gallo established a vetted unit to work exclusively on
    firearms trafficking and to focus on strategic enforcement efforts.
       

**Driving Ongoing Research**

-   ATF has assembled a team of subject matter experts from within the
    Bureau and from academic and related fields to produce the National
    Firearms in Commerce and Trafficking Assessment (NFCTA), a
    comprehensive examination of commerce in firearms and the diversion
    of firearms to illegal markets. Although ATF issues a variety of
    public and law enforcement reports and bulletins regarding firearm
    commerce, trafficking, and related issues every year, it has not
    undertaken a joint academic study on the scale of the NFCTA in more
    than 20 years. Recognizing that effective approaches to reducing gun
    violence are data-driven, grounded in research, and informed by
    multi-disciplinary input, the NFCTA will issue its initial
    assessment in a series of four separate reports. ATF has published
    NFCTA Volume I [National Firearms Commerce and Trafficking
    Assessment: Firearms in Commerce
    (atf.gov)](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/national-firearms-commerce-and-trafficking-assessment-firearms-commerce-volume/download) and
    Volume II,  [National Firearms Commerce and Trafficking Assessment
    (NFCTA)
    (atf.gov)](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/nfcta-volume-ii-intro/download),
    with Volume III due later this year.
