title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adam Hodge Welcoming Hajj Flights Between Yemen\
  \ and Saudi Arabia Enabling Yemenis to Perform Religious\_Obligations"

From the earliest days of the Biden-Harris Administration, the United
States prioritized de-escalating and ultimately ending the conflict in
Yemen through diplomatic engagements. The UN-brokered truce that began
in March 2022 has now brought nearly 15 months of calm to the people of
Yemen.  This is the quietest period since the war began almost a decade
ago.  U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking, National Security
Council’s Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk, and other senior U.S.
officials spent the last week in the Middle East focused on expanding
the truce in Yemen and other issues. We credit Saudi Arabia for its
efforts to support the truce over recent months, including the historic
hajj flights today that enable Yemenis to perform their religious
obligations and other flights soon to follow. The United States remains
engaged with all parties to consolidate the ongoing benefits from truce,
and to ultimately end the war altogether through a Yemeni-led political
process.
