title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Marks One Year Since the Ninth\
  \ Summit of the Americas in Los\_Angeles"
---
 
One year ago, President Biden hosted leaders from across our hemisphere
for the Ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles. The leaders came
together to forge a path for the Americas that builds on our vast
economic potential, remarkable and diverse people, and deep democratic
traditions. The overarching theme of the Summit was that our nations are
stronger together than on our own, and this sentiment was reflected in
many of the initiatives and commitments President Biden and Vice
President Harris announced in Los Angeles.

Over the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant
and impactful progress in following through on those commitments,
underscoring the importance of our partnerships in the region.

Administration achievements since the Summit of the Americas in Los
Angeles include:

**A bold and ambitious vision for creating a more prosperous, inclusive,
and sustainable Americas**: During the Summit of the Americas, President
Biden, recognizing the enormous economic potential in the region, called
for a new approach to cooperation in the hemisphere with the [**Americas
Partnership for Economic
Prosperity**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-the-americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity/),
a historic agreement to drive our hemisphere’s recovery and growth, and
deliver for our working people.

-   On January 27, 2023 the United States and 11 partner countries
    [advanced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity/)
    the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity when foreign
    affairs and trade ministers jointly declared our commitment to drive
    more inclusive and sustainable regional integration in a group of
    economies representing about 90 percent of the Western Hemisphere’s
    GDP and nearly two thirds of its people.
-   The Administration ramped up bilateral engagement with Americas
    Partnership countries, including through Special Presidential
    Advisor Chris Dodd’s frequent travel to the region where he
    discussed the initiative with each partner head of state.
-   Following through on the President’s promise to reinvigorate the
    Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to mobilize more investment in
    the region, on March 17-19, President Biden sent Dodd to the IDB
    annual meeting in Panama to lead the call to begin negotiations for
    a capital increase at the Inter-American Investment Corporation –
    IDB Invest.

**Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection:** In response to
the historic challenge of migration impacting the entire hemisphere,
President Biden mobilized 20 leaders at the Summit of the Americas last
year to endorse the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.
The Los Angeles Declaration is a first-of-its-kind framework to promote
responsibility-sharing under three core pillars: (1) stabilization; (2)
expanding legal pathways and protection; and (3) humane border
management.

-   In October of 2022, ministers of the endorsing states approved an
    implementation plan in Lima, Peru, with each endorsing state
    appointing a Special Coordinator to meet regularly and drive
    collective action toward the plan.
-   Also in October of 2022, the United States and Mexico jointly
    launched a new initiative under the Los Angeles Declaration to
    address Venezuelan migration. By increasing both consequences for
    unlawful entry and access to legal pathways, we achieved a 90
    percent drop in irregular Venezuelan migration at our border. We
    jointly expanded the successful initiative to Cubans, Haitians, and
    Nicaraguans in January 2023, further reducing irregular migration
    and creating a safe, legal pathway for 30,000 people per month from
    these four countries.
-   In March of 2023, the United States and Canada announced a similar
    initiative, combining increased consequences at our shared border
    with Canada’s commitment to offer an additional 15,000 migrants from
    the Western Hemisphere a legal pathway to Canada this year. This
    initiative similarly led to over a 90 percent drop in irregular
    migration into Canada.
-   In April of 2023, the United States, Panama, and Colombia announced
    a trilateral campaign to reduce irregular migration in the Darien in
    line with the core principles of the Los Angeles Declaration. To
    this end, Panama and Colombia each launched major counter-smuggling
    operations on June 2.
-   In May of 2023, the Department of Homeland Security and Department
    of State announced the creation of the regional processing center
    initiative in Central and South America, where migrants will be able
    to access a number of legal pathways to the United States. Canada,
    Spain, and Mexico have also agreed to accept cases, reinforcing
    regional approach under the Los Angeles Declaration.
-   In the past year, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Belize each
    launched new regularization or temporary protected status policies
    to integrate hundreds of thousands of migrants in their countries.
    The United States has delivered on its commitment to support these
    frontline host countries, and partnered with multilateral
    development banks and other donors to do so.

**Cities Summit of the Americas**: During the Summit of the Americas,
President Biden and Secretary Blinken announced that the United States
would host the first Cities Summit of the Americas. On April 26-28, the
Department of State and the City of Denver hosted the inaugural summit.
The Cities Summit brought together more than 2,500 participants,
including 250 mayors, to discuss how to implement at the local level the
commitments adopted at the Summit of the Americas to work together on
building resilient health systems, facilitate digital transformation,
and bolster democratic governance, among others. The gathering was a
fundamental and positive shift for U.S. engagement in the Americas.
During the Summit:

-   The Department of State launched the Cities Forward urban
    sustainability initiative, which will select 12 cities from across
    the Americas to develop and implement sustainability action plans
    and projects to promote job creation and investment, mitigate
    pollution, strengthen climate resilience, and improve health and
    welfare in underserved communities. 
-   The Inter-American Development Bank and the CAF – Development Bank
    of Latin America hosted a series of dialogues with mayors, local
    government officials, private sector leaders, and national
    development banks to identify new tools and concepts for mobilizing
    more investment to subnational governments.
-   The Cities Summit provided a platform for mayors from across the
    hemisphere to share successful policies, programs, and other
    city-led initiatives ripe for expanding and scaling across the
    hemisphere.

**Americas Health Corps:** Latin America and the Caribbean were hit
especially hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, suffering more than 40 percent
of global reported deaths and seeing millions pushed back into poverty.
The United States responded decisively to the pandemic by donating more
than 71 million vaccine doses in the region, and is working with
hemispheric partners to ensure we are better prepared for the next
health emergency. At the Summit of the Americas last year, the White
House and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) jointly announced
the Americas Health Corps, an initiative aiming to provide basic and
specialized training to 500,000 public health, health science, and
medical professionals throughout the Americas in the next five years. In
the first year of the Americas Health Corps, the United States has
supported training of nearly 120,000 health workers across 22 countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean. This puts us well on our way to
achieving our commitment to building stronger and more resilient health
systems in the hemisphere, starting with health workers. Since then, the
United States has undertaken a number of efforts to train health
workers, including doctors, nurses, community health workers, and
laboratory technicians:

-   In Brazil, the United States supported in-person and virtual
    workshops focused on COVID-19 vaccine-related topics—including case
    investigation and contact tracing—for community health workers and
    clinical staff in the Amazon to assist them to reach populations in
    remote areas.
-   In Guatemala, the United States supported virtual webinars for
    health care workers also focused on COVID-19 safety protocols to
    support the phased re-opening of educational centers including
    schools.
-   In Paraguay, the United States supported training of technical staff
    to use the first-of-its-kind digital system to monitor medical
    oxygen as part of overall strengthening of the oxygen ecosystem, a
    major vulnerability of Paraguay’s health system during the pandemic.
-   In El Salvador, the United States supported training of health care
    workers on how to integrate test-to-treat programming to quickly
    identify new COVID-19 infections and initiate appropriate treatment
    in high-risk patients.
-   The United States also supports PAHO’s Virtual Campus for Public
    Health to provide regional online training courses focused on
    capacity building for delivering quality health services in addition
    to emerging technical information for COVID-19 response.

**U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC
2030):** Vice President Harris has led the Administration’s
implementation of PACC 2030 to address the unique climate and energy
challenges facing Caribbean nations. This month, the Vice President
visited The Bahamas and in pursuit of shared prosperity and security,
and in recognition of the close ties between our nations, the Vice
President
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/08/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-new-initiatives-to-strengthen-u-s-caribbean-partnership/)
a number of new activities that address security and firearms
trafficking, the need for an enhanced diplomatic presence in the eastern
Caribbean, the crisis in Haiti, and the U.S.–Caribbean Partnership to
Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030). These announcements include
more than $100 million in new assistance for the region.

These announcements build on the accomplishments made over the past
year, which include:

-   The United States, through USAID, is providing technical and
    financial support to help Barbados set up the Blue-Green Investment
    Corporation, a regional financing vehicle to finance projects that
    will help with climate change mitigation and adaptation, including
    resilient housing, renewable energy, green transportation, and water
    conservation.
-   The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is leading the State
    Department’s Global Climate Action Partnership supporting Antigua
    and Barbuda with clean energy and energy resilience initiatives.
    These projects provide backup power for critical facilities. NREL is
    also supporting capacity building and workforce development in
    Antigua and Barbuda for the installation and maintenance of clean
    and resilient energy technologies such as: solar and battery energy
    storage systems, hurricane resistant wind turbines, electric vehicle
    charging stations, and energy efficiency improvements in buildings.
-   In the Caribbean, the State Department’s Bureau of Energy Resources
    Power Sector Program is delivering regional webinars, workshops, and
    trainings to strengthen regulatory capacity to incentivize and
    procure clean energy projects, in partnership with the Caribbean
    Electric Utility Services Corporation and the Organization of
    Caribbean Utility Regulators. This kicked off with a workshop as
    part of a CEO and Leadership Conference on May 21.

**Food Security Action**: USAID Administrator Power held a food security
event last year in Los Angeles as part of the Summit of the Americas
where she announced $331 million in funding to the region. Since the
Summit, USAID has obligated more than $159 million to the region in
support of food security assistance that will help ameliorate future
shocks to global food systems following Russia’s further invasion of
Ukraine, including:

-   In Haiti, USAID provided more than 1,200 metric tons of food
    assistance to about 145,000 people since mid-October. In December
    2022, USAID supported the distribution of more than 130 metric tons
    of food commodities, including cooking oil, peas, and rice, to more
    than 18,000 food-insecure individuals in Port-au-Prince’s Cité
    Soleil commune. Additionally, USAID-supported cash assistance
    provided $1.6 million to nearly 66,800 people in Nord-Ouest,
    Artibonite, and Centre departments during December.
-   In Honduras, USAID initiated a soil mapping activity with food
    producer organizations to improve the understanding to grow more
    food. This information will be shared with fertilizer companies to
    determine the appropriate fertilizer formulation, reduce its
    overuse, and save costs for one of the most expensive inputs in
    agriculture.
-   In the Caribbean, the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) is investing
    $11.2 million in 33 grassroots and civil society organizations
    supporting food security across the Caribbean.

**Investments in Civil Society:** The IAF is on track to fulfill the
commitment it made in Los Angeles to invest approximately $75 million
over three years across 300 locally based, community-led organizations
to empower local civil society organizations, including underrepresented
and underserved populations. In the first year, the IAF has already
channeled $26.1 million in new funding to 145 organizations, advancing
the priorities of underserved populations to foster inclusive
prosperity, build peace and security, and hold their governments
accountable to responsiveness and transparency through civic engagement.
This investment has benefited more than 3.8 million community members,
provided technical assistance to 10,720 micro and small enterprises,
formed or strengthened 5,730 strategic partnerships among local
institutions, and leveraged local funding for 1,250 grassroots
organizations. 

**Summit Implementation Review Group Commitments**: In Los Angeles, the
democratically elected leaders of the Americas committed to work
together to address pressing issues facing our region: health and
resilience, digital transformation, clean energy, environmental
sustainability, and democratic governance. As summit host and Chair of
the Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG), the United States has
worked with those governments to turn plans into action, and fulfill the
President’s promise to build a sustainable, resilient, and equitable
future for the Americas. Since Los Angeles, the United States has
convened ten ad hoc technical group meetings on implementing our shared
summit commitments, bringing together hundreds of experts from more than
25 countries and driving toward outcomes. To ensure implementation meets
the needs of the people of the Americas, we incorporated youth, the
private sector, and civil society stakeholders into the process,
convening SIRG meetings and private roundtables to hear their
recommendations and ensure that our level of ambition meets the level of
the needs of people across our hemisphere.
