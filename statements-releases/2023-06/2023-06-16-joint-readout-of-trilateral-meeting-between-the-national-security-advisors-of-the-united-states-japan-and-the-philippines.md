National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan of the United States, National
Security Advisor Akiba Takeo of Japan, and National Security Advisor
Eduardo Año of the Republic of the Philippines gathered for the first
time on 16 June 2023 in Tokyo, Japan to exchange views on a concrete
approach for improving trilateral cooperation.  
  
Mr. Akiba and Mr. Año welcomed Mr. Sullivan’s reaffirmation of the
United States’ ironclad alliance commitments to both Japan and the
Philippines. Recalling the security environment discussed in the recent
Japan-United States, Japan-Philippines, and United States-Philippines
summit meetings, the three National Security Advisors (NSAs) reaffirmed
the importance of deepening trilateral cooperation among Japan, the
United States and the Philippines, which share fundamental values of
freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights, in order to maintain
and strengthen a free and open international order.  
  
The three NSAs emphasized the importance of enhancing trilateral
cooperation and response capabilities based on the Japan-United States
Alliance and Philippines-United States Alliance in order to maintain
peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Also, they concurred
that a free and open maritime order, characterized by freedom of
navigation, and a free, fair, and equitable economic order are essential
in the Indo-Pacific, especially given unilateral attempts to change the
status quo by force or coercion. The three NSAs discussed a wide range
of regional security challenges, including with respect to the South
China Sea and the East China Sea, as well as North Korea. In addition,
they reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait.  
  
The three NSAs confirmed plans to enhance trilateral cooperation as
reflected below:  
  
**<u>Efforts to enhance trilateral defense and security
capabilities</u>**

-   The three NSAs discussed opportunities to conduct combined maritime
    activities including multilateral joint naval exercises in
    Indo-Pacific waters in support of freedom of navigation, and the
    broader rules-based order.  
-   The three NSAs resolved to advance trilateral defense cooperation
    based on the recent progress between the United States and the
    Philippines such as the four additional locations identified
    pursuant to their Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and between
    Japan and the Philippines in discussing frameworks that will enhance
    and facilitate reciprocal visits of defense and military officials.

**<u>Efforts to maintain a free and open maritime order</u>**

-   The first trilateral joint training among the three countries’ coast
    guards was conducted in early June and the three NSAs reaffirmed the
    importance of such activities.  
-   The three NSAs reaffirmed the importance of efforts to promote
    Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) by utilizing Japan’s new “Official
    Security Assistance (OSA)” cooperation framework, the QUAD’s
    Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) and
    other capacity building measures.

**<u>Efforts to enhance trilateral cooperation on humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief</u>**

-   The three NSAs resolved to deepen trilateral cooperation in the area
    of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR), drawing on
    their military and civilian HA/DR capabilities.

**<u>Efforts to maintain a free and equitable economic order</u>**

-   The three NSAs resolved to make common efforts to promote economic
    security and economic resilience.  
-   The three NSAs affirmed their commitment to addressing economic
    coercion in coordination with other partners.

The three NSAs decided to convene additional trilateral exchanges in the
coming months among the National Security Secretariat of Japan, the
National Security Council staff of the United States, and the National
Security Council Secretariat of the Philippines, to further expand
cooperation and information-sharing.
