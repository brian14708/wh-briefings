title: "Trilateral National Security Advisors Statement on the Democratic People\u2019\
  s Republic of Korea\u2019s Missile\_Launches"
---
 
The United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea condemn today’s DPRK
missile launches.  These launches are clear violations of multiple
United Nations Security Council resolutions, and demonstrate the threat
the DPRK’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile
programs pose to the region, international peace and security, and the
global non-proliferation regime. This action demonstrates the need for
all countries to fully implement DPRK-related UN Security Council
resolutions that are intended to prohibit the DPRK from acquiring the
technologies and materials needed to carry out these destabilizing
launches.  
  
The United States reaffirms unequivocally its ironclad security
commitments to both Japan and the ROK. National Security Secretariat
Secretary General Akiba Takeo, ROK National Security Advisor Cho
Tae-yong, and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today in
Tokyo and discussed ways to further strengthen trilateral cooperation,
including through lock-step coordination in responding to the threats
posed by the DPRK’s illicit nuclear and missile programs. They also
affirmed that Japan-ROK-U.S. cooperation would not be shaken by
provocations and shared their belief that the DPRK should take the path
of diplomacy rather than continued provocations. The national security
advisors stated their intent to redouble their collective efforts to
uphold peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
