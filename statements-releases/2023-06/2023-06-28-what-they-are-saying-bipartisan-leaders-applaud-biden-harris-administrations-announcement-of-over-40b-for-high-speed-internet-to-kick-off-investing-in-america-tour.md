title: "WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: Bipartisan Leaders Applaud Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019\
  s Announcement of Over 40B for High-Speed Internet to Kick off Investing in America\_\
  Tour"
---
 
On Monday, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that it has
allocated over $40 billion to all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and five territories to deploy affordable, reliable high-speed Internet
service to American families through the Broadband Equity, Access, and
Deployment (BEAD) program.  
  
Every state received more than $100 million in BEAD allocations, with 19
states receiving more than a billion dollars. This investment is the
largest single investment in high-speed internet in history, as well as
the largest one-time announcement from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law. The announcement kicked off the three-week Investing in America
tour, where President Biden, Vice President Harris, and leaders across
the Administration will travel to states and communities across the
country to highlight how President Biden‚Äôs economic agenda is growing
the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up, not top-down.  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris are delivering on their
historic commitment to connect everyone in America to reliable,
affordable high-speed internet by the end of the decade.  
  
*Bipartisan public officials and industry leaders from all 50 states,
D.C. and territories praised the announcement. Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre
saying:*

¬†  
**Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer:** ‚ÄúThanks to the Bipartisan
Infrastructure & Jobs Law we passed, a historic nearly $670 million is
now on its way to expand broadband infrastructure and boost high-quality
internet access across New York. Whether it is for work, school, or
getting the healthcare you need, access to the internet is not luxury,
but a necessity for modern life. Long before the pandemic, communities
across New York, from rural communities Upstate to bustling city
neighborhoods, have struggled to obtain reliable high-speed internet
service. I am proud to deliver this record setting nearly $670 million
for New York to help finally close the digital divide. New York, under
Governor Hochul‚Äôs leadership, is leading the charge to get all New
Yorkers the equitable access to the internet they deserve, and this
major federal investment will help finally give our communities the
support they need to succeed in the 21st century.‚Äù

America, there are far too many under-resourced communities without the
ability to connect online and engage with family, work, school and
telemedicine. Working with President Biden, House Democrats passed the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to ensure that every single
community throughout our nation has access to high-speed internet. We
invested $65 billion to expand broadband in every single zip code. I
thank President Biden and Governor Hochul for their leadership in
shepherding $665 million in crucial investments across New York.‚Äù
