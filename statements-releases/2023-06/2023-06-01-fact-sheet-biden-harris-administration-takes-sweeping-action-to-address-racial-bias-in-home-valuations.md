title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes Sweeping Action to Address\
  \ Racial Bias in Home\_Valuations"
---
 
Homeownership remains a central part of the American dream and the
primary contributor to generational wealth building and housing
stability for millions of families. For far too long, bias in home
valuations has limited the ability of Black and brown families to enjoy
the financial returns associated with homeownership, thereby
contributing to the already sprawling racial wealth gap.  
  
Two years ago today, on the [centennial of the Tulsa Race
Massacre](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/02/remarks-by-president-biden-commemorating-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-tulsa-race-massacre/),
President Biden announced the creation of the Interagency Task Force on
Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE): a [first-of-its-kind
interagency
effort](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-build-black-wealth-and-narrow-the-racial-wealth-gap/)
to root out bias in the home appraisal process. As its first order of
business, the Task Force developed and released the most wide-ranging
set of actions ever announced to advance equity and root out racial and
ethnic bias in home valuations – the [PAVE Action
Plan](https://pave.hud.gov/). Since its release in March 2022, the
Biden-Harris Administration has made critical progress towards fully
implementing the Action Plan, including by empowering consumers with new
tools to address appraisal bias; leveraging data to identify trends and
crack down on offenders of appraisal bias; and supporting a well-trained
and more representative appraiser profession.  
  
Today, on the anniversary of the creation of the PAVE Task Force and the
start of [National Homeownership
Month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/05/31/a-proclamation-on-national-homeownership-month-2023/),
the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a set of meaningful
actions to deliver on the PAVE Action Plan and ensure that every
American who buys a home has the same opportunities to build
generational wealth through homeownership:

-   **Preventing algorithmic bias in home valuation.** Six agencies are
    issuing a proposed rule regarding Automated Valuation Models (AVMs),
    the algorithmic and computational models used to assess the value of
    homes. In recent years, AVMs have spread across the housing finance
    marketplace. The proposed rule, subject to a 60-day public comment
    period, would establish quality control standards to help ensure
    AVMs are accurately and fairly assessing home values. These
    standards would require financial institutions, mortgage
    originators, and secondary market issuers that use AVMs to adopt and
    maintain policies and other safeguards to ensure greater confidence
    in valuation estimates, protect against data manipulation, avoid
    conflicts of interest, and conduct random sample testing and
    reviews. In addition, the proposed rule expressly includes a
    nondiscrimination quality control standard.  
-   **Empowering consumers to take action against appraisal bias.** When
    consumers encounter potentially inaccurate or biased appraisals,
    reconsiderations of value (ROV) provide an opportunity to challenge
    potentially inaccurate appraisal valuations when obtaining or
    refinancing a mortgage. Consumers obtaining an appraisal for a
    mortgage are often unaware that they have options when they receive
    a lower-than-expected valuation. Agencies are taking actions to
    promote industry-wide consistency for ROV processes and increase
    consumers’ knowledge about the option to pursue an ROV:  
    -   Federal banking agencies are in the process of issuing proposed
        guidance on how financial institutions may integrate ROV
        policies and controls into their current appraisal processes.
        The proposed guidance, subject to a60-day public comment period,
        will advise on how financial institutions may respond to
        consumer concerns about their appraisal and design policies and
        controls around ROV requests to appraisers. This proposal will
        be the first-ever effort to provide such guidance on an
        interagency basis.  
    -   Building off of HUD’s [January 2023 draft mortgagee
        letter](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/borrower_req_review_appraisal_results_draft.pdf) discussing
        proposed processes for receipt and handling of borrower requests
        for review of appraisal results, HUD and FHFA are initiating a
        working group to increase coordination and develop more
        consistent standards for the ROV processes of HUD’s Federal
        Housing Administration (FHA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac
        lenders. Collectively, FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac
        represent approximately two-thirds of new originations in the
        mortgage market.
-   **Increasing transparency and leveraging federal data to inform
    policy and improve enforcement against appraisal bias.** The Federal
    Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is announcing that it will update the
    Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) Aggregate Statistics with new
    appraisal data to further its commitment to making appraisals
    available to the public. The next quarterly release of the UAD
    Aggregate Statistics is scheduled for June 2023. In October 2022,
    FHFA
    [published](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Publishes-New-UAD-Aggregate-Statistics-Data-File.aspx) the
    nation’s first publicly available dataset and tools for aggregate
    statistics on appraisal records using appraisals received by Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac. These statistics are based on more than 48
    million appraisal records, and FHFA’s quarterly update will add
    approximately 600,000 new records. Using these data, academic
    researchers have already published new analyses illustrating stark
    differences in home valuations across racial and ethnic groups. New
    data will allow appraisers, consumers, and researchers to
    investigate trends in appraisals in their area and nationwide and
    help the industry to improve quality and compliance. In addition,
    HUD is committing to make its FHA appraisal data available to the
    public for the first time. Given FHA’s outsized role in serving
    minority borrowers, these data will strengthen efforts underway to
    eliminate bias and promote equity in the appraisal sector. FHA plans
    to make its data publicly available later this year.  
-   **Breaking down barriers to entry into the appraisal profession**.
    Today, the PAVE Task Force is publishing a
    [dashboard](https://pave.hud.gov/reducebarriers) that shows which
    states impose education, examination, and experience requirements to
    become an appraiser that are more stringent than the federal minimum
    requirements and is calling on states to make appropriate changes to
    reduce unnecessary barriers to entry to the appraiser profession.
    Federal criteria for becoming an appraiser are significant, and
    there is no evidence that these some of these requirements—for
    example, for a college degree—produce more ethical, accurate, or
    credible appraisals. Furthermore, many states require higher
    standards than the federal floor, making it more difficult for
    aspiring appraisers, especially underrepresented groups, to enter
    the profession. The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) will continue to
    provide ongoing assistance to states interested in reducing barriers
    to entry. Today’s announcement builds on ongoing efforts by the PAVE
    Task Force to create a more representative and well-trained
    appraiser workforce; earlier this year, the PAVE Task Force issued a
    letter to the Appraisal Foundation (TAF) urging it to find
    meaningful solutions to the experience, education, and examination
    requirements that exceed most industry standards and are not linked
    to evidence showing how they produce better, more accurate
    appraisals.
