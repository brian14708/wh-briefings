title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 79th Anniversary of\_D-Day"
---
 
79 years ago today, American and Allied forces “set upon a mighty
endeavor”—storming the shores of Normandy and launching the greatest
amphibious military operation in history. The brave service members who
served on D-Day represent the greatest generation in our history. They
stood to oppose the forces of fascism. They volunteered to lay down
their lives for our liberty. And together, they answered freedom’s call
at its hour of greatest need.  
   
Our World War II service members and veterans kept the ultimate faith to
our country, and we must always keep our sacred obligation to them,
their families, caregivers, and survivors. Today, as we reflect on their
service and remember their sacrifice, let us also recommit to the future
they fought for—one grounded in freedom, democracy, equality, and
opportunity for all.
