title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces New Actions to Provide Debt Relief\
  \ and Support for Student Loan\_Borrowers"
---
 
No President has fought harder for student debt relief than President
Biden, and he’s not done yet. President Biden and Vice President Harris
will not let Republican elected officials succeed in denying hardworking
Americans the relief they need.  
  
In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling this morning, President Biden and
his Administration **have already taken two steps this afternoon aimed
at providing debt relief for as many borrowers as possible, as fast as
possible, and supporting student loan borrowers**:

-   **The Secretary of Education initiated a rulemaking process aimed at
    opening an alternative path to debt relief for as many working and
    middle-class borrowers as possible, using the Secretary’s authority
    under the Higher Education Act.**  
     
-   **The Department of Education (Department) finalized the most
    affordable repayment plan ever created, ensuring that borrowers will
    be able to take advantage of this plan this summer—before loan
    payments are due. **Many borrowers will not have to make monthly
    payments under this plan. Those that do will save more than $1,000 a
    year.

In addition, to protect the most vulnerable borrowers from the worst
consequences of missed payments following the payment restart, **the
Department is instituting a 12-month “on-ramp” to repayment, running
from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, so that financially
vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments during this period are
not considered delinquent, reported to credit bureaus, placed in
default, or referred to debt collection agencies.**

These actions reflect the President’s belief that an education beyond
high school should be a ticket to the middle class. It also builds on
the unprecedented steps President Biden and his Administration have
taken to make college more affordable for working and middle-class
families and make federal student loans more manageable. The
Biden-Harris Administration has:

-   Secured the largest increases to Pell Grants in a decade.  
     
-   Fixed broken student loan programs such as Public Service Loan
    Forgiveness, so borrowers actually get the relief they deserve.  
     
-   Approved more than $66 billion in loan cancellation for 2.2 million
    borrowers across the country, including public service workers and
    those who have been defrauded by their colleges.  
     

**Debt Relief for As Many Borrowers as Possible, as Fast as Possible**  
  
The President remains committed to providing relief to low- and
middle-income borrowers. For too many Americans, a ticket to the
middle-class remains out of reach because of unmanageable student loan
debt. COVID-19 exacerbated that challenge – risking tens of millions of
borrowers’ financial security and futures because of the economic harms
brought on by a once-in-a-century pandemic.  
  
Today, the Department [initiated
rulemaking](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2023/negregpublichearingannouncement.pdf) aimed
at opening an alternative path to debt relief for as many borrowers as
possible, using the Secretary of Education’s authority under the Higher
Education Act. The Department issued a notice, which is the first step
in the process of issuing new regulations under this so-called
“negotiated rulemaking” process. The notice announces a virtual public
hearing on July 18th and solicits written comments from stakeholders on
topics to consider.  
  
Following the public hearing, the Department will finalize the issues to
be addressed through rulemaking and begin the negotiated rulemaking
sessions this fall. The Department will complete this rulemaking as
quickly as possible.

**Lowering Monthly Payments**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration today also finalized the most affordable
repayment plan ever created, called the Saving on a Valuable Education
(SAVE) plan. This income-driven repayment plan will cut borrowers’
monthly payments in half, allow many borrowers to make $0 monthly
payments, save all other borrowers at least $1,000 per year, and ensure
borrowers don’t see their balances grow from unpaid interest.  
  
Specifically, the plan will:

-   For undergraduate loans, cut in half the amount that borrowers have
    to pay each month from 10% to 5% of discretionary income.
-   Raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary
    income and therefore is protected from repayment, guaranteeing that
    no borrower earning under 225% of the federal poverty level—about
    the annual equivalent of a $15 minimum wage for a single
    borrower—will have to make a monthly payment under this plan.
-   Forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments, instead of 20
    years, for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less.
    The Department estimates that this reform will allow nearly all
    community college borrowers to be debt-free within 10 years.
-   Not charge borrowers with unpaid monthly interest, so that unlike
    other existing income-driven repayment plans, no borrower’s loan
    balance will grow as long as they make their monthly payments—even
    when that monthly payment is $0 because their income is low.

All student borrowers in repayment will be eligible to enroll in the
SAVE plan. They will be able to enroll later this summer, before any
monthly payments are due. Borrowers who sign up or are already signed up
for the current Revised Pay as You Earn (REPAYE) plan will be
automatically enrolled in SAVE once the new plan is implemented. To
learn more about the new SAVE plan, visit [the Department of Education’s
website.](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2021/idrfactsheetfinal.pdf)

**Ensuring Support for Borrowers Most at Risk**  
  
To protect the most vulnerable borrowers, the Department is creating a
temporary “on-ramp” to protect borrowers from the harshest consequences
of late, missed, or partial payments for up to 12 months. While payments
will be due and interest will accrue during this period, interest will
not capitalize at the end of the on-ramp period. Additionally, borrowers
will not be reported to credit bureaus, be considered in default, or
referred to collection agencies for late, missed, or partial payments
during the on-ramp period. Future monthly bills for borrowers not
enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan will be automatically
adjusted to reflect the accrued interest during those months.  
  
Borrowers who can pay should do so, but this on-ramp period gives
borrowers who cannot make payments right away the necessary time to
adjust, enabling them to ultimately make their monthly payments and meet
their financial obligations on their loans. Borrowers do not need to
take any action to qualify for this on-ramp.
