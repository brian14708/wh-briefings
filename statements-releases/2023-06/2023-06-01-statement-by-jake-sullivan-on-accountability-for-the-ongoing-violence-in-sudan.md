title: "Statement by Jake Sullivan on Accountability for the Ongoing Violence in\_\
  Sudan"
---
 
The ongoing fighting in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the
Rapid Support Forces is a tragedy that has already stolen far too many
lives—it must end.  
  
Despite a ceasefire agreement, senseless violence has continued across
the country—hindering the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and
hurting those who need it most. The scope and scale of the bloodshed in
Khartoum and Darfur, in particular, is appalling. And, the failure of
the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces to abide by the
ceasefire only further deepens our concern that the people of Sudan will
once again face a protracted conflict and widespread suffering at the
hands of the security forces.  
  
The United States will continue to do everything we can to prevent that
from happening. On May 4, President Biden issued an Executive Order that
expanded U.S. authorities to respond to the violence and help bring an
end to the conflict. Today, we are following through by levying economic
sanctions, imposing visa restrictions against actors who are
perpetuating the violence, and releasing an updated Business Advisory on
Sudan. These measures are intended to hold accountable those responsible
for undermining the peace, security, and stability of Sudan.  
  
The Sudanese people did not ask for this war. The United States will
continue to stand with them. We will continue to support their rightful
demand for a transition to democracy. And working with our partners, we
will continue to hold the belligerent parties accountable for their
unconscionable violence and defiance of the will of the people.
