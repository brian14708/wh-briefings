  \ Allen v.\_Milligan"

The most fundamental right of American citizenship is the right to vote.
Today, the Supreme Court rejected Alabama’s attempt to dilute the voting
power of Black Americans and to further weaken the Voting Rights Act of
1965. This decision upheld the law, but our fight to protect,
strengthen, and expand the freedom to vote continues. Voting is the
right that unlocks all other rights, and fair maps are essential for
representation. Important freedoms we enjoy and continue to fight for
today come from our equal access to the ballot box. That is why the
President and I continue to call on Congress to pass the John Lewis
Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
