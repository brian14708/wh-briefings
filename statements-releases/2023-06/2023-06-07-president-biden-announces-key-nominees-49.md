Governor Charlie Crist, a political leader and attorney, has dedicated
his life to public service. He recently served as U.S. Congressman for
Florida’s 13th District, representing the Tampa Bay region in Congress.
Previously, Crist served as the 44th Governor of the State of Florida,
Florida’s Attorney General, and was the last elected statewide
Commissioner of Education.

As Governor, Crist guided the state through challenging times, including
the Great Recession and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Despite drastic
budget shortfalls due to the economic crisis, he made public education a
top priority, steering federal stimulus funding to save thousands of
teachers’ jobs. He is also a staunch environmental advocate, working at
the federal and state levels to help secure billions in public and
private aid to restore the Florida Everglades.

Crist got his first job out of law school as General Counsel of minor
league baseball. He worked for Republican U.S. Senator Connie Mack III
as his State Director and began his political career with election to
the Florida State Senate in 1992. Crist attended Wake Forest University,
and later transferred to Florida State University, where he would
receive his bachelor’s degree. Following that, he earned his Juris
Doctorate degree from Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, Alabama.

Select Committee on Intelligence since 2016. In that capacity and in
conjunction with the Minority Staff Director, he oversees the staff of
the committee as they assist the committee members in conducting
oversight of the Intelligence Community’s operations on behalf of the
Senate. He also is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations
of the committee, including enhancements to the committee’s operations

nine years. There, he was responsible for policy covering wide swaths of
global operations as well as those pertaining to the Department of
Defense. He has spent over 27 years on Capitol Hill in a variety of
