title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Measures to Promote\
  \ Equitable Community\_Development"
---
 
Bidenomics is rooted in the simple idea that we need to grow the economy
from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. And we are
making progress: President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,
including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL),
CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), continues to
generate historic investments in cities and towns across the country.
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps to ensure
underserved communities can build wealth and advance community-driven
priorities.  
  
Community and economic development projects—such as investments in
housing, small businesses, climate and disaster resilience, and
transportation infrastructure—have great potential to build community
wealth and strong local economies and support long-time residents and
businesses. But federal investments and subsidies in underserved
communities have historically fallen short of achieving these goals.
Today, the Biden-Harris administration is publicly releasing a new
[policy
memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Guidance-for-Federal-Departments-and-Agencies-on-Advancing-Equitable-Community-and-Economic-Development-in-American-Cities-and-U.pdf)
to all federal agencies that outlines actions federal agencies can take
to advance equitable development in American cities and urban
communities. The Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC)—a
coalition of federal agencies that support economic growth in
historically underserved communities—is announcing a slate of new
actions that will strengthen how federal community investment programs
serve communities across the country that have historically lacked
access to resources and capital including communities of color,
low-income communities, rural areas, and Tribal communities. Taken
together, these critical actions build upon President Biden and Vice
President Harris’s commitment to creating economic opportunity and
advancing equity across the Federal Government.  
  
“President Biden and I have been working to grow an economy that works
for all people,” said Vice President Harris. “Today’s announcement
builds on these efforts and will help make sure that our
Administration’s historic investments in infrastructure, clean energy,
and manufacturing reach all communities as we build a future where all
Americans — no matter zip code— can thrive.”

***<u>White House Policy Directive to Federal Agencies to Advance Urban
Equitable Development</u>***

Today, the Biden-Harris administration is publicly releasing a new
[policy
memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Guidance-for-Federal-Departments-and-Agencies-on-Advancing-Equitable-Community-and-Economic-Development-in-American-Cities-and-U.pdf)
pursuant to a key provision in President Biden’s [Executive Order on
Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities
Through The
Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/)
(Executive Order 14091), which  directs agencies to undertake efforts,
consistent with applicable law, to strengthen urban equitable
development policies and practices such as advancing community wealth
building projects; preventing physical and economic displacement as the
result of federal investments; facilitating equitable flows of private
capital, including to underserved communities; and incorporating
outcome-based metrics focused on urban equitable development in the
design and deployment of federal programs and policies. This effort is
complementary to the Administration’s efforts to equitably lift up rural
and Tribal communities across the nation, including through [historic
investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/17/what-they-are-saying-biden-harris-administration-announces-largest-investment-in-rural-electrification-since-the-new-deal/)
and [expanded access to federal
resources](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-the-rural-partners-network-to-empower-rural-communities-to-access-federal-resources/).  
  
The memorandum being publicly released today outlines principles to
guide agencies on actions agencies can take to advance urban equitable
development and can also be used by the private sector, non-profits and
philanthropy, and state and local governments to guide their investments
and policies to:

-   **Expand access to resources for underserved communities.**
    Strategically allocate public funding to address longstanding
    inequitable resource distributions, encourage equitable private
    sector investment, and support local organizations’ capacity to
    receive and steward public and private resources for community
    development and aligned services.   
-   **Build community wealth.** Prioritize development that generates
    and retains wealth in a community by investing in the needs of both
    current and future residents, businesses, and institutions;
    mitigating displacement pressures; and supporting the long-term
    economic mobility of people and vitality of places. 
-   **Invest in a community’s strengths.** Elevate a community’s assets,
    culture, and history as central to a comprehensive economic
    development strategy, invest in opportunities to support local
    capacity and civic infrastructure, and build on strengths. 

<!-- -->

-   **Empower community voice and vision.** Center community engagement,
    input, and goals throughout the phases of program or project design,
    delivery, and evaluation; ensure the inclusion of underserved
    community members in engagement efforts; and intentionally work to
    build trust among diverse stakeholders.  
-   **Respond to multiple areas of community need.** Ensure federal
    investments, including outreach, engagement, and capacity-building
    efforts, are coordinated across agencies to holistically advance
    equity and address concurrent barriers to economic mobility and
    opportunity.      
-   **Measure and expand upon what works.** Establish clear outcomes,
    metrics, and evaluation criteria, derived with input from local
    stakeholders, to track community goals, adjust investment
    strategies, build evidence for both the short- and long-term impacts
    of equitable development, and scale successful pilots and programs. 

<sup>1</sup>The memorandum builds on early action by the Biden-Harris
Administration. Last year, the Department of Transportation launched its
[Reconnecting
Communities](https://www.transportation.gov/grants/reconnecting-communities)
Pilot program, a first-of-its-kind initiative to reconnect communities
that are cut off from opportunity and burdened by past transportation
infrastructure decisions. This year, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development proposed a new [Affirmatively Furthering Fair
Housing](https://www.hud.gov/AFFH) Rule, which when finalized will lead
to greater equity and choice in housing opportunities for communities
that have faced segregation and disinvestment, while empowering
communities and increasing transparency. 

***<u>New Public Sector Efforts to Facilitate the Flow of Resources into
Underserved Communities</u>***  
  
Today, the Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC) \[1\] is
announcing a slate of [new
actions](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ICIC-Action-Plan-2023.pdf)
to strengthen how federal community investment programs serve
communities across the country that have historically lacked access to
resources and capital. In July of last year, Vice President Harris
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/28/fact-sheet-vice-president-announces-new-private-and-public-sector-efforts-to-align-tens-of-billions-in-investments-in-underserved-communities/)
the ICIC, a coalition of agencies with a focus on aligning federal
investments to support economic growth in historically underserved
communities and address economic disparities. Since its creation, the
ICIC has sought to improve the operational coordination of federal
investment programs to maximize their collective impact for all
Americans, including communities that have been historically
underserved, such as communities of color, low-income communities, rural
areas, and Tribal communities. 

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that the ICIC
agencies will take the following actions:

-   **Adopt a ‘no wrong door’ policy to ensure that small businesses and
    entrepreneurs get the assistance and information most relevant to
    them**. ICIC Agencies will collaborate across their nationwide
    network of field offices \[2\] to provide easy-to-use information
    guides and train staff on the full suite of federal capital products
    and technical assistance programs.  
-   **Support community finance market development through access to
    secondary markets.** HUD, through Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Treasury’s CDFI
    Fund, and USDA will engage with Federal Home Loan Banks and
    community-based lenders to enable more borrowers to access
    affordable homeownership through providing access to global
    financial markets through HUD’s GNMA guarantee. Treasury will also
    conduct new outreach to private investors and CDFIs to better
    understand the metrics that could best support market development,
    secondary market access, and the value of CDFIs to the communities
    they serve.   
-   **Better connect rural communities to capital for growing small
    businesses, developing affordable housing, and workforce training.**
    As part of the ICIC’s commitment to deliver capital to rural and
    Tribal communities, the ICIC will train field and Rural Partners
    Network (RPN) staff on how federal support can best support local
    efforts around affordable housing, small business development, and
    workforce development. RPN is a USDA-led, whole-of-government
    program to increase access to federal resources in rural and Tribal
    communities by supporting full-time federal staff who are partnering
    with 36 communities in 10 states and Puerto Rico. RPN is also
    developing rural economic development materials, such as webinars
    and guides, to help all rural communities identify and access
    federal funds on Rural.gov.  
-   **Identify opportunities to improve the alignment of federal
    investments to maximize community impact, including through
    expanding access to capital and affordable housing.** The ICIC will
    ensure that new programs funded in the BIL and IRA are designed and
    deployed in such a way. As a starting point, Treasury, in
    partnership with HUD, will issue guidance to make it easier for
    Treasury’s State and Local Federal Relief Funds (SLFRF) program to
    be paired with HUD’s Community Development Block Grant Program
    (CDBG).  
-   **Launch a pilot to analyze how federal community and economic
    development investments flow into, and interact in, urban
    neighborhoods and rural communities**. In partnership with local
    communities, this interagency pilot will inform how federal
    community investment flows can benefit recipient communities.
