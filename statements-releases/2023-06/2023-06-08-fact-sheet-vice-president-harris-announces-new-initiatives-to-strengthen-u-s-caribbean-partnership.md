title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces New Initiatives to Strengthen\
  \ U.S-Caribbean\_Partnership"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris and Prime Minister Philip Davis of The
Commonwealth of The Bahamas will host the U.S-Caribbean Leaders Meeting
in Nassau, The Bahamas on June 8, 2023. This meeting will build on the
Vice President’s previous meetings with Caribbean leaders in April 2022,
at the June 2022 Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, and in September
2022. The Vice President’s trip delivers on the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to advance cooperation with the Caribbean.

In pursuit of shared prosperity and security, and in recognition of the
close ties between our nations, the Vice President is announcing the
following new activities that address: (1) security and firearms
trafficking; (2) the need for an enhanced diplomatic presence in the
eastern Caribbean; (3) the crisis in Haiti; and (4) the U.S.–Caribbean
Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030). Today’s
announcements include more than $100 million in new assistance for the
region.

**<u>Security and Firearms Trafficking;</u>**

-   **Department of Justice Firearms Coordinator**: The Biden-Harris
    Administration is committed to disrupting firearms trafficking in
    the Caribbean by interdicting illicit shipments of firearms and
    ammunition, and by holding offenders accountable and bringing them
    to justice. To bolster these efforts, the Department of Justice
    (DOJ) will name a Coordinator for Caribbean Firearms Prosecutions
    who will be an experienced DOJ prosecutor. The creation of this
    position will elevate this critical issue and help implement the
    provisions of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which included
    new federal criminal provisions on firearms trafficking and straw
    purchases.

<!-- -->

-   **Crime Gun Intelligence Unit:** The Department of Stateis
    supporting the recently established regional Crime Gun Intelligence
    Unit (CGIU) in Trinidad and Tobago, which facilitates collaboration
    and cooperation among regional and international law enforcement
    agencies including the Caribbean Community Implementation Agency for
    Crime and Security; U.S. agencies including the Bureau of Alcohol,
    Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Homeland Security Investigations
    (HSI), Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and
    Security); and INTERPOL. The CGIU will address critical firearms
    investigation training needs in the Caribbean and help our Caribbean
    partner nations solve gun-related crime cases, deterring gun crimes
    in the region and bringing criminals to justice. The CGIU will
    provide training on real-time collection, management, and analysis
    of crime gun intelligence and encourage information sharing with
    international law enforcement partners. 

<!-- -->

-   **Haiti Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU):** The
    Department of State will support HSI collaboration with the Haitian
    National Police (HNP) to develop a TCIU, to facilitate
    investigations and prosecution of transnational crimes, including
    those with a U.S. nexus. The TCIU will focus on crimes including
    firearms and ammunition smuggling, human trafficking, and
    transnational gang activity.

<!-- -->

-   **Regional Forensics Accreditation:** The Department of State,
    through the continuation of a regional forensics accreditation
    project, will help bring Caribbean forensic capabilities up to
    international standards with a goal of achieving International
    Organization for Standardization accreditation. The United States
    will help establish a regional forensics Center of Excellence in St.
    Lucia in addition to continued support to forensic laboratories in
    The Bahamas and the Dominican Republic. The project will support the
    collection of timely, reliable, and admissible forensic evidence to
    support criminal investigations and prosecutions, increase
    efficiency, and help lower case backlogs.

<!-- -->

-   **Caribbean Law Enforcement Capacity Building:** The Department of
    State will continue to increase the capacity of Caribbean law
    enforcement partners by strengthening organizational and
    administrative structures of national police forces, improving
    internal affairs and criminal investigation capabilities, and
    upgrading police education and training. These efforts will better
    equip law enforcement partners to respond to crime perpetrated using
    illegal firearms and will support increased community involvement in
    public safety planning.  

<!-- -->

-   **U.S.-UK Eastern Caribbean Criminal Justice Advisor Program:** The
    Department of State, alongside the United Kingdom, will leverage the
    presence of a senior criminal justice advisor in the Caribbean to
    mentor local prosecutors and judges, improve the criminal justice
    experience of victims and witnesses, and enhance public legal
    education. This program will build more efficient criminal justice
    systems to achieve more effective prosecutions of firearms-related
    crimes throughout the Eastern Caribbean. 

**<u>Enhanced Diplomatic Presence</u>**

-   **New Diplomatic Presence in Eastern Caribbean**: The Biden-Harris
    Administration has begun the process to establish two new embassies
    and an additional diplomatic support presence in the eastern
    Caribbean. This effort, pursued in consultation with the United
    States Congress and the countries of the region, recognizes that
    deepening our relationship with Caribbean nations requires regular
    exchange between our governments at all levels, and is in response
    to long-standing requests from our Caribbean partners. An expanded
    diplomatic footprint in the Caribbean will help strengthen
    people-to-people ties between our nations.

**<u>Haiti</u>**

-   **Assistance for the Haitian People:** The United States,through the
    U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing an
    additional $53.7 million for the people of Haiti in response to the
    country’s humanitarian crisis. This new funding will provide
    vulnerable Haitians with urgently needed support, including vital
    food assistance and other humanitarian assistance, as 4.9 million
    people face acute food insecurity. In addition, these funds will
    support care for survivors of gender-based violence and will provide
    access to safe drinking water and health care.  USAID also intends
    to provide an additional $10.5 million in development assistance to
    enhance resilience and productivity in Haiti’s agriculture and
    livestock sector.

<!-- -->

-   **Support for Extension of HOPE/HELP Trade Preferences Program**:
    The Administration strongly supports the extension of the HOPE/HELP
    trade preferences program for Haiti. At this critical time, it is
    important that producers and investors in Haiti, those they do
    business with, and the workers upon whom they rely have certainty
    about the uninterrupted continuation of the HOPE/HELP program.

**<u>U.S.–Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC
2030)</u>**

In June 2022, the Vice President and Caribbean leaders launched PACC
2030, the U.S. Government’s flagship partnership with our Caribbean
partners to advance climate adaptation, build resilience and expand
clean energy access across the region.

To advance PACC 2030, today the Vice President is announcing the
following new initiatives:

-   **Caribbean Climate Investment Program (CCIP):** With an initial $20
    million investment, subject to the availability of funds, USAID will
    provide financial, technical assistance, and business development
    services through CCIP to enterprises deploying technologies in
    renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation by
    mobilizing private finance and private sector-led actions. CCIP
    recently announced a funding opportunity, which is offering matching
    grants of up to $1 million to catalyze climate-related businesses in
    the Caribbean.

<!-- -->

-   **Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience:** USAID will provide
    nearly $15 million to support disaster risk reduction, emergency
    response capacity strengthening, and resilience building across the
    Caribbean. This funding will build operational capacity in disaster
    response and preparedness, including emergency logistics for
    regional and national government entities and community-based first
    responders.

<!-- -->

-   **Operationalize Climate Resilience Initiative:** Working with
    Congress, and in response to partner demand, the Department of
    Defense is moving forward with a $5 million Operationalize Climate
    Resilience Initiative that will help partners in the Western
    Hemisphere, including in the Caribbean, address the challenges at
    the nexus of climate change and national security. This program will
    provide training in how to plan against, prepare for, and respond to
    climate contingencies and will fund additional bilateral and
    multilateral research on climate security in the Western Hemisphere.

<!-- -->

-   **Sharing Climate Expertise:** The Department of State is partnering
    with the Department of Commerce – to launch a clean energy
    investment and procurement training series for Caribbean energy
    regulators known as *Power Hours. * It is also a partnership with
    the Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation to launch a
    Resilient Energy Regulation Workshop Series. The trainings will
    build technical and institutional capacity among Caribbean electric
    utilities and regulators to prepare for a cleaner power system and
    more electric vehicles.

<!-- -->

-   USAID will provide $1.5 million to the Caribbean Community Climate
    Change Center to increase the flow of international climate funding
    and help strengthen key data tools for decision-making to support
    the region’s response to climate change.

<!-- -->

-   **Caribbean Islands Higher Education Resilience Consortium:** USAID
    will provide $1 million to partner with the Caribbean Islands Higher
    Education Resilience Consortium and Northeastern University to help
    Caribbean Island States better mitigate and adapt to the effects of
    climate change, including the risks associated with extreme weather
    events.

<!-- -->

-   **Storm Risk Surge Mapping:** The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA), with funding from USAID, will develop storm
    surge risk maps to improve understanding of storm surge flooding
    vulnerability from landfalling tropical cyclones, providing critical
    information to help save lives and minimize impacts to property in
    The Bahamas.

The following actions are intended to increase access to development
financing for the Caribbean, a key pillar of PACC 2030:

-   **World Bank Evolution:** The United States strongly supports
    efforts underway at the multilateral development banks to evolve
    their business models to better address global challenges such as
    climate change, pandemics, fragility, and conflict, which are
    integral to achieving poverty reduction and sustainable, inclusive,
    and resilient development. For example, the United States supported
    a $100 million International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
    loan to Barbados in January 2023 to support Bridgetown’s low carbon
    economic development and resilience to climate change. Most
    recently, the Vice President called for World Bank shareholders to
    decide on a plan by September to mobilize new concessional financing
    to incentivize action on global challenges across all borrower
    countries, enhance support to crisis response in International
    Development Association recipient countries, and develop an action
    plan to raise the level of ambition in mobilizing private
    investment. 

<!-- -->

-   **Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Group:** The United States
    led IDB Group shareholders to mandate a set of priority reforms that
    will enable the IDB Group to be more relevant and effective
    vis-à-vis Caribbean nations, including by expanding private sector
    operations in the Caribbean and advocating for a robust Partnering
    for Caribbean Development Framework that responds to the unique
    needs of the region, including small markets, small firms, and high
    transport costs. The United States also committed to pushing for
    doubling the capital base of IDB Invest—the IDB Group’s
    private-sector lending window—to increase investments in a
    low-carbon, climate-resilient and inclusive future, especially in
    the energy, transport and agricultural sectors.

<!-- -->

-   **Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII):** The
    United States seeks to scale PGII investments, including in the
    Caribbean, to better respond to the global demand for high quality
    infrastructure financing. Through PGII, the Administration and G7’s
    flagship infrastructure initiative, the United States is
    collaborating with partners to develop transformative ecosystems of
    infrastructure investment that support inclusive growth, benefit
    partners’ economic security, and diversify our global supply chains.
    The United States aims to mobilize $200 billion globally by 2027
    towards PGII—delivering energy, physical, digital, health, and
    climate-resilient infrastructure.  
    -   **Climate Resilient Debt Clauses:** The United States continues
        to encourage all creditors—including the private sector and
        multilateral development banks—to offer climate resilient debt
        clauses in their lending.  The United States is preparing to do
        so in our own bilateral lending where feasible.

<!-- -->

-   **International Monetary Fund (IMF) Resilience and Sustainability
    Trust:** The Administration is committed to working closely with
    Congress to lend up to $21 billion through the IMF, including to the
    Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which has already benefitted
    Caribbean countries. The IMF Board has already approved programs
    under the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust for Barbados and
    Jamaica.  These programs, $183 million for Barbados and $764 million
    for Jamaica, will help both nations build resilience to
    climate-related shocks.

<!-- -->

-   **IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust:** The United States is
    encouraging the IMF to identify all available options by the
    IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings to put the Poverty Reduction and
    Growth Trust on a sustainable footing in the near term with a view
    to raise the level of concessional finance available from the IMF in
    a manner that ensures this access is sustainable.

Since the Vice President launched PACC 2030 in June 2022, there has been
a whole-of-government effort to implement the objectives, and we have
made significant progress.  Highlights of progress thus far include:

*Improving access to development financing:*
