President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is rebuilding the economy
from the middle-out and bottom-up, not top-down. As a result of historic
legislation passed by President Biden – including the American Rescue
Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and
the Inflation Reduction Act – President Biden has overseen the strongest
jobs recovery in history, is rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure, and
is bringing manufacturing back to the United States. Since President
Biden took office, private companies have announced over $470 billion in
private sector manufacturing investments, and over the last 18 months,
the Administration has awarded over $220 billion in funding from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law aimed at repairing roads and bridges,
delivering clean water, deploying high-speed internet, and building out
clean energy transportation infrastructure. Invest.gov enables Americans
in every state and territory across the country to see these investments
in their communities.  
  
The website also includes summaries of the impact of President Biden’s
Investing in America agenda in each state and territory, including jobs
created, new businesses started, spotlight infrastructure projects
funded, and manufacturing investments made under the Biden presidency.
The website will be updated regularly to reflect recent investments,
projects, and announcements.
