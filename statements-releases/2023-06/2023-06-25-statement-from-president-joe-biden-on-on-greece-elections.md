On behalf of the people of the United States, I send our congratulations
to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece on his reelection. I
look forward to continuing our close cooperation on shared priorities to
foster prosperity and regional security. Together—as Allies, partners,
and friends—Greece and the United States have championed democracy. We
will keep working with the government and people of Greece as well as
our vibrant Greek-American community in the United States to continue
this legacy.
