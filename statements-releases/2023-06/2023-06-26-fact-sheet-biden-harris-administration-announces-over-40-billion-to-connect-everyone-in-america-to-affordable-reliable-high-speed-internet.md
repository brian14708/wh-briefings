*Largest Internet Funding Announcement in History Kicks Off
Administration-Wide Investing in America Tour*

High-speed internet is no longer a luxury – it is necessary for
Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school, access
health care, and to stay connected with family and friends. Yet, more
than 8.5 million households and small businesses are in areas where
there is no high-speed internet infrastructure, and millions more
struggle with limited or unreliable internet options. Just like Franklin
Delano Roosevelt’s Rural Electrification Act brought electricity to
nearly every home and farm in America, **President Biden and Vice
President Harris are delivering on their historic commitment to connect
everyone in America to reliable, affordable high-speed internet by the
end of the decade**.

Today, the Department of Commerce announced funding for each state,
territory and the District of Columbia for high-speed internet
infrastructure deployment through the Broadband Equity Access and
Deployment (BEAD) program—a $42.45 billion grant program created in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and administered by the Department of
Commerce. This announcement—the largest internet funding announcement in
history—kicks off the three-week Administration-wide Investing in
America tour, where President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady
Jill Biden, Cabinet members, and Senior Administration Officials will
fan out across the country to highlight investments, jobs, and projects
made possible by President Biden’s economic agenda.

Among the highlights:

-   Awards range from $27 million to over $3.3 Billion, with every state
    receiving a minimum of $107 million.
-   19 states received allocations over $1 billion with the top 10
    allocations in Alabama, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan,
    Missouri, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington.
-   With these allocations and other Biden administration investments,
    all 50 states, DC, and the territories now have the resources to
    connect every resident and small business to reliable, affordable
    high-speed internet by 2030.

Details related to the BEAD allocation for the states, D.C., and
territories, as well as the total Federal investment in high-speed
internet in each State and Territory are available
[here](https://internetforall.gov/news-media/biden-harris-administration-announces-state-allocations-4245-billion-high-speed-internet).

In addition to helping connect everyone in America to high-speed
internet, this funding will support manufacturing jobs and crowd in
private sector investment by using materials Made in America.  For
example, anticipating this major investment in high-speed internet
infrastructure deployment, earlier this year, fiber optic cable
manufacturers CommScope and Corning announced $47 million and $500
million expansions of their domestic manufacturing capacity, which will
create hundreds of good-paying American jobs in North Carolina. These
investments are part of the nearly $500 billion in private sector
manufacturing and clean energy investments spurred by the President’s
Investing in America agenda. The Investing in America agenda represents
the most significant upgrade to our nation’s infrastructure in
generations—an investment larger than FDR’s Rural Electrification
effort, Eisenhower’s effort to build the Interstate Highway system, and
the construction of the Panama Canal.

***Internet for All***

Today’s announcement of BEAD funds is just one component of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to ensure that everyone in America
has access to affordable, reliable high-speed internet as part of
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda.  In recent weeks, the
Administration has announced [over $700 million in USDA ReConnect
awards](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/06/12/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-700-million-connect),
[over $900 million in NTIA Middle Mile
awards](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/06/biden-harris-administration-announces-930-million-expand-and-strengthen)
and launched the [Online for All campaign to increase ACP enrollment and
visibility](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/14/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-and-civic-nation-bring-together-over-300-national-and-community-organizations-to-help-students-and-families-cut-costs-and-access-affordable-high-speed-internet/).
  Beyond BEAD, billions have already been announced or distributed to
all states and territories to build out high-speed internet
infrastructure by the Biden-Harris Administration.

In addition to BEAD, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes:

-   $14.2 billion for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which
    provides eligible households up to $30/month (up to $75/month on
    qualifying Tribal Lands) off their internet bill, as well as a
    one-time $100 toward a desktop, laptop or tablet computer offered by
    participating internet service providers. Thanks to commitments by
    over 20 internet service providers, millions of Americans are using
    the Affordable Connectivity Program to access internet for *free*.
    Today, 19 million Americans are enrolled in this program. Households
    can check their eligibility and sign up at GetInternet.gov.
-   $2.75 billion for the Digital Equity Act, which provides grants to
    ensure communities have the skills and support needed to take
    advantage of high-speed internet connections;
-   An additional $2 billion for the Tribal Broadband Connectivity
    Program, which provides grants to federally recognized Tribal
    governments, Tribal organizations, Tribal Colleges and Universities,
    the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, and Alaska Native Corporations
    for high-speed internet deployment on Tribal lands, as well as for
    telehealth, distance learning, high-speed internet affordability,
    and digital inclusion;  
-   $2 billion for the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Reconnect
    Program, which provides loans and grants primarily to build
    high-speed internet infrastructure in eligible rural areas;  
-   $1 billion for the Middle Mile Program, which provides funding for
    the “middle mile” backbone of internet networks.

President Biden’s American Rescue Plan also included over $25 billion
for high-speed internet, including:

-   The Department of Treasury’s Capital Projects Fund (CPF) provides
    $10 billion to states, territories, and Tribes for which high-speed
    internet is an eligible use. Today, over $7 billion has already been
    dedicated to high-speed internet deployment and connectivity across
    45 states;
-   The Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF)
    delivered funding across the country to support the response to and
    recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. About $8 billion is being used
    by states, territories, Tribes, and local governments for high-speed
    internet deployment and connectivity; and,
-   The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) $7 billion [Emergency
    Connectivity
    Fund](https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-connectivity-fund) program
    helped schools and libraries close the “homework gap,” providing
    schools and libraries with 10.5 million connected devices and over 5
    million internet connections.
