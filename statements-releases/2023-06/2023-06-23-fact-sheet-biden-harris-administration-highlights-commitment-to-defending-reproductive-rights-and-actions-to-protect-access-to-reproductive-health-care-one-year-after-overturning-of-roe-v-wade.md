title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Highlights Commitment to Defending\
  \ Reproductive Rights and Actions to Protect Access to Reproductive Health Care\
  \ One Year After Overturning of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
One year ago, the Supreme Court eliminated a constitutional right that
it had previously recognized, overturning nearly fifty years of
precedent. Today, more than 23 million women of reproductive age—one in
three—live in one of the 18 states with an abortion ban currently in
effect. In the last year, women have been denied essential medical care
to preserve their health and even save their lives. They have been
turned away from emergency rooms, forced to delay care, and made to
travel hundreds of miles and across state lines for needed medical care.
Despite this devastating impact on women’s health, Republican elected
officials continue to advance these bans at both the state and national
level.

President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the majority of
Americans who believe the right to choose is fundamental—and who have
made their voices heard at every opportunity since the Supreme Court’s
decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.* As the
President has made clear since the day of the *Dobbs* decision, the only
way to ensure women in every state have access to abortion is for
Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of *Roe v. Wade.*

While we continue to call on Congress to restore these protections, the
Administration has taken executive action to protect access across the
full spectrum of reproductive health care. In the wake of *Dobbs*, the
President issued two Executive Orders directing a comprehensive slate of
actions to protect access to reproductive health care services,
including abortion. And today, [the President is issuing a third
Executive Order focused on strengthening access to affordable,
high-quality
contraception](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/),
a critical aspect of reproductive health care. The Administration
remains fully committed to implementing these Executive Orders and
advancing access to reproductive health care through the leadership of
the interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, co-chaired
by the White House Gender Policy Council and the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS).

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing an update on the
work of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access and the
Administration’s ongoing efforts to defend reproductive rights.

**Protecting Access to Abortion, including Medication Abortion**

-   **Ensure Access to Emergency Medical Care. ** The Administration is
    committed to ensuring all patients, including women who are
    experiencing pregnancy loss, have access to the full rights and
    protections for emergency medical care afforded under federal
    law—including abortion care when that is the stabilizing treatment
    required. HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/reinforcement-emtala-obligations-specific-patients-who-are-pregnant-or-are-experiencing-pregnancy-0)
    affirming requirements under the Emergency Medical Treatment and
    Labor Act (EMTALA) and Secretary Becerra
    [sent](https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUQs-2BN3jQcVLX1PF2KeT0WHpjKuEGg9HmpTkm0U662e5MZPUxFHTPmAUcFbW4j1MvV724tEggkjCEA2ZX3gi-2FNyPGJFj8gYazBcTjCojRcpqq8BsK2ApNp1RFmFOQsiu6fA-3D-3DCFjw_gatHLOXVnjS-2Fys-2B7qAyVd81zv1Wap8yT25fZboq0-2BiJx32YthI2zl6rLINVJW-2BIntQ2xHKXC9-2BG6LAj91HsUVwh1AxFPJdA27CeTtZ70weukMTYQr8WctKfx-2BmGuVXIt7NBdKdc5BSZ0vWWNOejTWPEy2AgckfSiYxFle46ealnje2B4V4C0QYRTkcLdfsRU56JahbxdQ2uRxCBEsIaevThQ0x69QHjdNvp4laljWEcd4M0qNQNSgcwU24FhZ1w96ALZQHFywHGvRhge-2F9zNwNaJPGFGZQxR7GEUSGFO-2FX9y-2B1RcBuCXkeyu-2BDztuqiWbfnn1up39qkzdr48HwOg9C6DCFMqDsFLHFH4tFzwcYk-3D)
    [letters](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/01/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-statement-on-emtala-enforcement.html)
    to providers making clear that federal law preempts state law
    restricting access to abortion in emergency situations. The U.S.
    District Court of Idaho [issued a preliminary
    injunction](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-regarding-reproductive-rights)
    blocking the enforcement of Idaho’s abortion ban as applied to
    medical care required by EMTALA after the Department of Justice
    (DOJ) [filed a
    lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1523481/download)
    seeking to enjoin Idaho’s ban to the extent it makes abortion a
    crime even when necessary to prevent serious risks to the health of
    pregnant patients.
-   **Defend FDA Approval of Medication Abortion in Court. ** The Food
    and Drug Administration (FDA) and DOJ are defending access to
    mifepristone, a safe and effective drug used in medication abortion
    that FDA first approved more than twenty years ago, and FDA’s
    independent, expert judgment in court—including in a [lawsuit in
    Texas](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/07/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-decision-in-alliance-for-hippocratic-medicine-v-fda/)
    that attempts to eliminate access nationwide. The Administration
    will [continue to stand
    by](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/21/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-in-alliance-for-hippocratic-medicine-v-fda/)
    FDA’s decades-old approval of the medication and by FDA’s ability to
    review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription
    medications.
-   **Protect Access to Safe and Legal Medication Abortion. ** On what
    would have been the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of *Roe v. Wade* on
    January 22, President Biden issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-presidential-memorandum-on-ensuring-safe-access-to-medication-abortion/#:~:text=The%20Presidential%20Memorandum%20directs%20the,or%20provide%20mifepristone%E2%80%94no%20matter)
    directing further efforts to protect access to medication abortion,
    including to support patients, providers, and pharmacies who wish to
    legally access, prescribe, or provide mifepristone—and to safeguard
    their safety and security, including at pharmacies. This
    Presidential Memorandum was issued in the face of attacks by state
    officials to prevent women from accessing mifepristone and
    discourage pharmacies from becoming certified to dispense the
    medication. These attacks followed independent, [evidence-based
    action](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/information-about-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation) taken
    by FDA to allow mifepristone to continue to be prescribed by
    telehealth and sent by mail as well as to enable interested
    pharmacies to become certified.
-   **Partner with State Leaders on the Frontlines of Abortion Access.
     **Today, the White House [is releasing a new
    report](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dobbs-Anniversary-States-Report-6.22.23.pdf) on
    the battle for abortion access at the state level and the
    Administration’s engagement with state leaders over the past year.
    The report underscores the Administration’s ongoing commitment to
    partnering with leaders on the frontlines of protecting access to
    abortion—both those fighting extreme state legislation and those
    advancing proactive policies to protect access to reproductive
    health care, including for patients who are forced to travel out of
    state for care. The Vice President has led these efforts, traveling
    to 18 states and meeting with more than 250 state legislators,
    health care providers, and advocates in the past year. And last
    week, the White House
    [hosted](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/15/readout-of-the-white-house-state-legislative-convening-on-reproductive-rights/)
    over 80 state legislators from 41 states to discuss efforts to
    protect access to reproductive health care.

<!-- -->

-   **Provide Access to Reproductive Health Care for Veterans. ** The
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) [issued an interim final
    rule](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-will-offer-abortion-counseling-and-in-certain-cases-abortions-to-pregnant-veterans-and-va-beneficiaries/)
    to allow VA to provide abortion counseling and, in certain
    circumstances, abortion care to Veterans and VA beneficiaries. VA
    provides abortion services when the health or life of the patient
    would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term or when
    the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. When working within the
    scope of their federal employment, VA employees [may
    provide](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2022-11/2022-09-21-va_immunity_for_abortion_services.pdf)
    authorized services regardless of state restrictions. DOJ will
    support and provide representation to any VA providers whom states
    attempt to prosecute for violations of state abortion laws where
    those providers were appropriately carrying out their duties under
    VA’s interim final rule. 
-   **Support Access to Care for Service Members. ** The Department of
    Defense (DoD) has [taken
    action](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3195298/dod-looks-to-ensure-access-to-reproductive-health-care/)
    to ensure that Service members and their families can access
    reproductive health care and that DoD health care providers can
    operate effectively. DoD has [released
    policies](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3301006/dod-releases-policies-to-ensure-access-to-non-covered-reproductive-health-care/)
    to support Service members and their families’ ability to travel for
    lawful non-covered reproductive health care and to bolster Service
    members’ privacy and afford them the time and space needed to make
    personal health care decisions.
-   **Defend Reproductive Rights in Court.**
    DOJ [created ](https://www.justice.gov/reproductive-rights)a
    Reproductive Rights Task Force, which monitors and evaluates state
    and local actions that threaten to infringe on federal protections
    relating to the provision or pursuit of reproductive health care,
    impair women’s ability to seek abortion care where it is legal,
    impair individuals’ ability to inform and counsel each other about
    the care that is available in other states, ban medication abortion,
    or impose criminal or civil liability on federal employees who
    provide legal reproductive health services in a manner authorized by
    Federal law.

**Supporting Women’s Ability to Travel for Medical Care**

-   **Defend the Right to Travel.**  On the day of the *Dobbs*
    decisions, President
    Biden [reaffirmed](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/) the
    Attorney
    General’s [statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s) that
    women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek the
    care they need. President Biden committed his administration to
    defending “that bedrock right,” and DOJ continues to monitor
    attempts to restrict a woman’s right to travel to receive lawful
    health care.  
-   **Support Patients Traveling Out of State for Medical Care. ** HHS
    Secretary Becerra and CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure
    [issued](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hhs-letter-to-governors-reproductive-health-care.pdf)
    a letter to U.S. governors inviting them to work with CMS and apply
    for Medicaid 1115 waivers to provide increased access to care for
    women from states where reproductive rights are under attack and
    women may be denied medical care. HHS continues to encourage state
    leaders to consider and develop new waiver proposals that would
    support access to reproductive health care services.

**Safeguarding Access to Contraception**

-   **Strengthen Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception.
     **Today, the President [issued an Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/) directing
    agencies to: improve access and affordability for women with private
    health insurance; promote increased access to over-the-counter
    contraception; support access to affordable contraception through
    Medicaid and Medicare; ensure Service members, veterans, and Federal
    employees are able to access contraception; bolster contraception
    access across Federal health programs; and support access for
    college students and employees. The Task Force on Reproductive
    Healthcare Access will oversee the swift and robust implementation
    of this Executive Order in the coming months.
-   **Clarify Protections for Women with Private Health Insurance.**
    Under the Affordable Care Act, most private health plans must
    provide contraception and family planning counseling with no
    out-of-pocket costs. The Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS
    convened a meeting with health insurers and employee benefit plans.
    These agencies called on the industry to meet their obligations to
    cover contraception as required under the law. Following this
    conversation, these agencies [issued
    guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/28/hhs-dol-treasury-issue-guidance-regarding-birth-control-coverage.html)
    to clarify protections for contraceptive coverage under the
    Affordable Care Act.
-   **Expand Access Under the Affordable Care Act.**  The Departments of
    the Treasury, Labor, and HHS [proposed a
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/30/biden-harris-administration-proposes-new-rules-expand-access-birth-control-coverage-under-affordable-care-act.html)
    to strengthen access to contraception under the Affordable Care Act
    so all women who need and want contraception can obtain it. Millions
    of women have already benefited from this coverage, which has helped
    them save billions of dollars on contraception.
-   **Support Title X Clinics. ** HHS provided resources to bolster
    quality family planning services through the Title X Family Planning
    Program, including funding to help clinics deliver equitable,
    affordable, client-centered, and high-quality family planning
    services and provide training and technical assistance for Title X
    clinics. In addition, recognizing the important role that Title X
    clinics play in supporting access to contraception, the President’s
    Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request includes $512 million for the Title
    X Family Planning Program, a 76 percent increase above the 2023
    enacted level.
-   **Promote Access to Contraception for Service Members and Their
    Families and Certain Dependents of Veterans.  **To improve access to
    contraception at military hospitals and clinics, DoD expanded
    walk-in contraceptive care services for active-duty Service members
    and other Military Health System beneficiaries, and eliminated
    TRICARE copays for medical contraceptive services. And VA proposed a
    rule to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for certain types of
    contraception through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the
    Department of Veterans Affairs.

**Reinforcing Nondiscrimination Protections under Federal Law**

-   **Issue Guidance to Retail Pharmacies.**  HHS
    issued [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/13/hhs-issues-guidance-nations-retail-pharmacies-response-supreme-court-decision-roe.html) to
    roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies to remind them of their
    obligations under federal civil rights laws to ensure access to
    comprehensive reproductive health care services. The guidance makes
    clear that as recipients of federal financial assistance, pharmacies
    are prohibited under law from discriminating on the basis of race,
    color, national origin, sex, age, and disability in their programs
    and activities. This guidance is especially important in the wake of
    reports that women of reproductive age have been denied prescription
    medication at pharmacies—including medication that is used to treat
    stomach ulcers, lupus, arthritis, and cancer—due to concerns that
    these medications could be used to terminate a pregnancy.
-   **Protect Students from Discrimination Based on Pregnancy. ** The
    Department of Education (ED) released a
    [resource](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-pregnancy-resource.pdf?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=)
    for universities outlining their responsibilities not to
    discriminate on the basis of pregnancy or pregnancy-related
    conditions, including termination of pregnancy. This guidance
    reminds schools of their existing and long-standing obligations
    under Title IX.
-   **Strengthen Nondiscrimination in
    Healthcare. ** HHS [announced](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/25/hhs-announces-proposed-rule-to-strengthen-nondiscrimination-in-health-care.html) a
    proposed rule to strengthen nondiscrimination in health care. The
    proposed rule implements Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and
    affirms protections consistent with President Biden’s executive
    orders on nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender
    identity.

**Promoting Safety and Security of Patients, Providers, and Clinics**

-   **Promote Safety and Security of Patients, Providers and Clinics. **
    DOJ
    [continues](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/fact-sheet-justice-department-efforts-protect-reproductive-rights-health-and-justice)
    to robustly enforce the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,
    which protects the right to access and provide reproductive health
    services.

**Safeguarding Privacy and Sensitive Health Information**

-   **Strengthen Reproductive Health Privacy under HIPAA.**  HHS [issued
    a proposed
    rule ](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/regulatory-initiatives/hipaa-reproductive-health-fact-sheet/index.html)to
    strengthen privacy protections under the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This rule would prevent
    an individual’s information from being disclosed to investigate,
    sue, or prosecute an individual, a health care provider, or a loved
    one simply because that person sought, obtained, provided, or
    facilitated legal reproductive health care, including abortion. By
    safeguarding sensitive information related to reproductive health
    care, the rule will strengthen patient-provider confidentiality and
    help health care providers give complete and accurate information to
    patients. Prior to the proposed rule and immediately after *Dobbs,*
    HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/phi-reproductive-health/index.html)
    reaffirming HIPAA’s existing protections for the privacy of
    individuals’ protected health information.
-   **Take Action Against Illegal Use and Sharing of Sensitive Health
    Information. ** The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
    has [committed](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/location-health-and-other-sensitive-information-ftc-committed-fully-enforcing-law-against-illegal) to
    enforcing the law against illegal use and sharing of highly
    sensitive data, including information related to reproductive health
    care. Consistent with this commitment, the FTC has
    taken [first-of-its-kind enforcement
    actions ](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/first-ftc-health-breach-notification-rule-case-addresses-goodrxs-not-so-good-privacy-practices)against
    companies for disclosing consumers’ personal health information,
    including [highly sensitive reproductive health
    data](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/05/ftc-says-premom-shared-users-highly-sensitive-reproductive-health-data-can-it-get-more-personal),
    without permission.
-   **Help Consumers Protect Their Personal Data.  **The Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) [launched a new guide for
    consumers](https://www.fcc.gov/protecting-your-personal-data) on
    best practices for protecting their personal data, including
    geolocation data, on mobile phones. The guide follows a
    recent [Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-22-102A1.pdf) issued
    by FCC that would strengthen data breach rules to provide greater
    protections to personal data. In addition, separately, HHS issued [a
    how-to
    guide](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/cell-phone-hipaa/index.html) for
    consumers on steps they can take to better protect their data on
    personal cell phones or tablets and when using mobile health apps,
    like period trackers, which are generally not protected by HIPAA.
-   **Protect Students’ Health Information. ** ED [issued guidance to
    over 20,000 school
    officials ](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-guidance-school-officials-student-health-records)to
    remind them of their obligations to protect student privacy under
    the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The guidance
    helps ensure that school officials—including those at federally
    funded school districts, colleges, and universities—know that, with
    certain exceptions, they must obtain written consent from eligible
    students or parents before disclosing personally identifiable
    information from students’ educational records, which may include
    student health information. The guidance encourages school officials
    to consider the importance of student privacy, including health
    privacy, with respect to disclosing student records. ED also [issued
    a know-your-rights
    resource](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/know-your-rights-ferpa-protections-student-health-records) to
    help students understand their privacy rights for health records at
    school. 
-   **Safeguard Patients’ Electronic Health Information. ** HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/information-blocking/information-blocking-regulations-work-in-concert-with-hipaa-rules-and-other-privacy-laws-to-support-health-information-privacy) affirming
    that doctors and other medical providers can take steps to protect
    patients’ electronic health information, including their information
    related to reproductive health care. HHS makes clear that patients
    have the right to ask that their electronic health information
    generally not be disclosed by a physician, hospital, or other health
    care provider. The guidance also reminds health care providers that
    HIPAA’s privacy protections apply to patients’ electronic health
    information.

**Providing Access to Accurate Information and Legal Resources**

-   **Ensure Easy Access to Reliable Information. ** HHS launched and
    maintains [ReproductiveRights.gov](https://reproductiverights.gov/),
    which provides timely and accurate information on people’s right to
    access reproductive health care, including contraception, abortion
    services, and health insurance coverage, as well as [how to file a
    patient privacy or nondiscrimination
    complaint](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html). DOJ also
    launched justice.gov/reproductive-rights,
    a [webpage](https://www.justice.gov/reproductive-rights?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) that
    provides a centralized online resource of the Department’s work to
    protect access to reproductive health care services under federal
    law.
-   **Hosted a Convening of Lawyers in Defense of Reproductive
    Rights. ** The Department of Justice and the Office of White House
    Counsel
    [convened](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/01/readout-of-first-convening-of-lawyers-in-defense-of-reproductive-rights-and-justice/)
    more than 200 lawyers and advocates from private firms, bar
    associations, legal aid organizations, reproductive rights groups,
    and law schools across the country for the first convening of
    pro-bono attorneys, as directed in the first Executive Order.
    Following this convening, reproductive rights organizations
    [launched](https://lawyeringproject.org/our-work/adn_press_20230222/)
    the Abortion Defense Network to offer abortion-related legal defense
    services, including legal advice and representation.
-   **Launch a National Hotline to Enable Access to Accurate
    Information. ** HHS
    [issued](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=347425) a
    Notice of Funding Opportunity to establish a safe and secure
    national hotline to provide referral services to women in need of
    accurate information about their legal reproductive health care
    options. The nondirective hotline will provide information to
    patients served by the Title X family planning program who request
    information related to prenatal care and delivery; infant care,
    foster care, or adoption; or pregnancy termination.

**Promote Research and Data Collection**

-   **Use Data to Track Impacts on Access to Care.**  HHS will convene
    leading experts to discuss the state of existing reproductive health
    research and what the data tells us about the impact of the *Dobbs*
    decision, as well as the future of research on reproductive health
    care access. These convenings will help identify research gaps,
    opportunities for collaboration, and ways to bolster research
    efforts for both Federal agencies and external partners.
-   **Leverage Maternal Health Data to Address Disparities.**  FCC
    has [committed to the swift
    implementation](https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-letter-cdc-director-maternal-health-collaboration) of
    the Data Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act, which directs FCC, in
    coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to
    incorporate publicly available data on maternal mortality and
    morbidity into its Mapping Broadband Health in America platform.
    This innovation will support women’s health by informing efforts to
    expand broadband access—including access to telehealth—in areas with
    poor maternal health outcomes. FCC will continue to explore
    opportunities to improve research, data collection, data analysis,
    and interpretation in the context of reproductive health care and
    maternal health outcomes.
