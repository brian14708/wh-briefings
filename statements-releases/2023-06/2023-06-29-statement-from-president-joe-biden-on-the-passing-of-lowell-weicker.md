title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Lowell\_Weicker"
---
 
Lowell Weicker and I served together in the U.S. Senate for nearly two
decades. He was blunt, brave, committed to his convictions, and fiercely
independent. And I was proud to call him a friend.

Throughout his career – from his days as a young Republican senator on
the frontlines of the Watergate hearings, to his years as an independent
governor who ignored politics to do what he believed was right – Lowell
had the courage to take tough stands, speak the truth, and stand up for
the better angels of our nation.

He built an extraordinary record of service to the people of Connecticut
and to our country – serving in the United States Army, as well as in
local and state government, and as a U.S. congressman, senator,
governor, and presidential candidate. He fought for disability rights,
helping to lay the groundwork for passage of the civil rights landmark
Americans with Disabilities Act; and worked in Congress and for a decade
after to boost funding for medical research and disease prevention.

Throughout, Lowell was guided not by party, but by principle. He was a
fearless moderating force who stood up for those who couldn’t always
stand for themselves – and he relished the fight.

Jill and I send our love to his wife, Claudia, his three children and
extended family, and to the people of Connecticut, whom he served so
honorably for so long.
