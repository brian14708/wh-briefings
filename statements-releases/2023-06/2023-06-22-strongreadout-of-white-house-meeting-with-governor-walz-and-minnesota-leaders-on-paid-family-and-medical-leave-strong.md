title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Governor Walz and Minnesota Leaders on\
  \ Paid Family and Medical\_Leave"

Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President & Director of the
Gender Policy Council, and Aviva Aron-Dine, Deputy Assistant to the
President and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council met with
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, Speaker
of the House Melissa Hortman, Senate Majority Leader Kari Dziedzic, and
Senator Alice Mann to celebrate Minnesota becoming the twelfth state,
along with the District of Columbia, to pass paid family and medical
leave legislation.

Minnesota’s historic legislation will strengthen the state’s economy and
ensure that workers in the state can take the time they need to recover
from a serious illness, care for a sick family member, or welcome a new
child without losing a paycheck. The Biden-Harris Administration
applauds states that have made significant progress in advancing paid
leave and continues to support a national paid family and medical leave
program for families across the country.

In the meeting, White House officials and Minnesota elected leaders
discussed the state’s paid family and medical leave legislation, the
significance of states across the country passing similar measures, and
the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to ensuring access to paid
leave for all working families. White House officials congratulated
Minnesota elected officials on their historic legislative session in
2023, which also delivered important gains in climate and clean energy,
infrastructure, health care, paid sick leave, free school meals, and
more.
