title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Supreme Court Decision in\
  \ Haaland v.\_Brackeen"
---
 
Today’s Supreme Court decision in *Haaland v. Brackeen* is a victory for
Tribal sovereignty and Native communities.  
   
For centuries, Native children were torn away from their families and
their communities. These acts were not only violations of the basic
human rights of those children and their families but also an attack on
the very existence of Tribal Nations.  
   
The Indian Child Welfare Act—or ICWA—was passed to address this systemic
injustice. As District Attorney of San Francisco, I represented children
and families in ICWA cases. As Attorney General of California, I
partnered with Tribal leaders, child welfare agencies, and law
enforcement officials to enforce ICWA. So I have seen firsthand how
essential this law is to the safety and wellbeing of Native children.  
   
President Biden and I will continue to fight to protect Native families,
children, and communities. And we will continue to stand with Tribal
Nations in defense of Tribal sovereignty.
