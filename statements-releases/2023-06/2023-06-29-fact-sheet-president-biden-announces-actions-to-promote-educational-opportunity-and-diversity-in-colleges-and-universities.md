title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces Actions to Promote Educational Opportunity\
  \ and Diversity in Colleges and\_Universities"
---
 
Today, the Supreme Court upended decades of precedent that enabled
America’s colleges and universities to build vibrant diverse
environments where students are prepared to lead and learn from one
another. Although the Court’s decision threatens to move the country
backwards, the Biden-Harris Administration will fight to preserve the
hard-earned progress we have made to advance racial equity and civil
rights and expand educational opportunity for all Americans.  
  
As our nation’s colleges and universities consider their admissions
processes in the wake of the Court’s decision, President Biden is
calling on them to seize the opportunity to expand access to educational
opportunity for all. Our nation is stronger when our colleges and
universities reflect the vast and rich diversity of our people. But
while talent, creativity, and hard work are everywhere across this
country, equal opportunity is not.  
  
Specifically, the President is calling on colleges and universities,
when selecting among qualified applicants, to give serious consideration
to the adversities students have overcome, including:

-   the financial means of a student or their family;
-   where a student grew up and went to high school; and
-   personal experiences of hardship or discrimination, including racial
    discrimination, that a student may have faced.

In doing so, colleges and universities can fully value aspiring students
who demonstrate resilience and determination in the face of deep
challenges.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is taking swift action to support our
Nation’s colleges and universities so they can continue building
pathways to upward mobility and success for all students to thrive in
the American workforce and our Nation’s military. Specifically, the
Biden-Harris Administration is:

-   **Providing colleges and universities with clarity on what
    admissions practices and additional programs to support students
    remain lawful.** The Department of Education and Department of
    Justice will provide resources to colleges and universities
    addressing lawful admissions practices within the next 45 days, as
    colleges prepare for the next application cycle. The Department of
    Education will also provide assistance to colleges and universities
    in administering programs to support students from underserved
    communities. 
-   **Convening a National Summit on Educational Opportunity**. The
    Department of Education will host a national summit on equal
    opportunity in postsecondary education next month with advocates,
    student leaders, college and university administrators, researchers,
    and state, local, and Tribal leaders to share lessons learned and
    innovative strategies, and develop additional resources for colleges
    and students to expand access to educational opportunity.
-   **Releasing a report on strategies for increasing diversity and
    educational opportunity, including meaningful consideration of
    adversity.** Following the Summit, the Department of Education will
    produce a report by this September, elevating promising admissions
    practices to build inclusive, diverse student bodies, including by
    using measures of adversity. The report will address topics
    including the impact of current admissions practices that may
    negatively affect the admissions chances of students from
    underserved communities; strategies to integrate measures of
    adversity in admissions; outreach and recruitment programs to create
    diverse applicant pools; strategies for retention and degree
    completion; and financial and other support programs to make college
    attainable.
-   **Increasing transparency in college admissions and enrollment
    practices.** The Administration is committed to providing
    transparent data with respect to admissions and enrollment. The
    Department of Education’s National Center for Educational Statistics
    will consider ways to collect and publish more information related
    to college application and enrollment trends. This includes ways
    that information might be validly disaggregated by race and
    ethnicity, first-generation status, legacy status, and other
    measures. Information in these areas could help higher education
    leaders, academics and the general public address potential barriers
    to college recruitment, admissions, and enrollment.
-   **Supporting states in analyzing data to increase access to
    educational opportunity for underserved communities.** The
    Department of Education will assist states and Tribal nations in
    marshaling their data to improve college recruitment, admissions,
    and financial aid practices and devise strategies for increasing
    access to educational opportunity, such as partnerships to
    appropriately share and use education data, and direct admissions
    programs that proactively admit students based on factors such as
    academic performance and students’ geographic location – without
    requiring them to apply or pay an application fee. 

This work builds upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic efforts
to ensure all students have the opportunity to access higher education
by:

-   **Securing a historic increase in the Pell Grants: **The President
    championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in the last decade –
    a combined increase of $900 to the maximum award over the past two
    years to benefit low – and middle-income students.
-   **Prioritizing college completion:** The Biden-Harris Administration
    has championed efforts to improve postsecondary outcomes,
    particularly for students who face the greatest barriers to
    accessing and completing college. In response to the President’s
    budget, Congress established a new Postsecondary Student Success
    Grant program to provide direct support to institutions to engage in
    evidence-based activities that support college re-enrollment,
    retention, and completion among individuals who are close to
    graduation.
-   **Supporting America’s Minority-Serving Institutions: **President
    Biden has secured historic investments in institutions that enroll
    and graduate disproportionate shares of low-income students and
    students of color, including tens of billions of dollars in funding
    for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges
    and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions, including
    Hispanic Serving Institutions through the Department of Education.
-   **Fixing the broken student loan system:** The Biden-Harris
    Administration has taken action to make the student loan system more
    manageable for current and future borrowers and reduce the burden of
    student debt, including by:
    -   Cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans. The
        Department of Education is proposing an income-driven repayment
        plan that protects more low-income borrowers from making any
        payments and caps monthly payments for undergraduate loans at 5%
        of a borrower’s discretionary income – half of the rate that
        borrowers must pay now under existing plans. The average annual
        student loan payment will be lowered by more than $1,000 for
        both current and future student borrowers who owe payments.
    -   Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program
        by ensuring that borrowers who have worked at a qualifying
        nonprofit organization, in the military, or in federal, state,
        Tribal, or local government, receive appropriate credit towards
        loan forgiveness. These regulatory changes build on temporary
        changes the Department of Education made to PSLF, under which
        roughly 616,000 public servants received more than $42 billion
        in loan forgiveness.
    -   Ensuring targeted student loan forgiveness programs work.
        Including its reforms to PSLF, the Department of Education has
        approved a total of more than $66 billion in relief to over 2.2
        million student loan borrowers, including many who were
        defrauded by their college, enrolled in a college that abruptly
        closed, or are permanently disabled and unable to work.
