Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer and Homeland
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas welcomed Colombian Foreign
Minister Alvaro Leyva, Ambassador Luis Gilberto Murillo, and their
delegation to the White House on June 10, 2023. The delegations recalled
their respective announcements on June 4 and 5, 2023, describing their
collaboration on migration and regional development. During the meeting,
the two sides underscored the need to open new and flexible legal
pathways to reduce irregular migration. They decided to proceed on June
19, 2023 with an initial six-month implementation phase of the Safe
Mobility Offices (SMOs), receiving applications from migrants for the
purpose of identifying and registering irregular migrants that, as of
today, are present in the country, and advising them on safe, regular,
legal pathways for migration. Furthermore, the United States reaffirmed
its commitment to concurrently expand legal pathways for Colombian
nationals, including through labor and family reunification
opportunities. These steps will be undertaken in the context of the
commitments contained in the joint statement of June 5, 2023 regarding
the need for broader efforts to deliver social services, create
employment, and generate economically sustainable opportunities for
communities along Colombia’s borders.
