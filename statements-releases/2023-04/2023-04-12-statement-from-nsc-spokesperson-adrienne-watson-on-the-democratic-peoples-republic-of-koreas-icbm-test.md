The United States strongly condemns the DPRK for its test of a
long-range ballistic missile. The President and his national security
team are assessing the situation in close coordination with our allies
and partners.  This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security
Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks
destabilizing the security situation in the region. This action
demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons
of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being
of its people.  We urge all countries to condemn these violations and
call on the DPRK to come to the table for serious negotiations.  The
door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease
its destabilizing actions and instead choose diplomatic engagement.  The
United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of
the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies.
