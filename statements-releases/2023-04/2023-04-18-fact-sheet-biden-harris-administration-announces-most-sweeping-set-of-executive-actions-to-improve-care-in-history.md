title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Most Sweeping Set\
  \ of Executive Actions to Improve Care in\_History"
---
 
Today, President Biden will announce the most comprehensive set of
executive actions any President has ever taken to improve care for
hard-working families while supporting care workers and family
caregivers. Joined by people with disabilities, family caregivers,
long-term care workers, early educators, veterans, and aging advocates,
the President will sign an Executive Order that includes more than 50
directives to nearly every cabinet-level agency to expand access to
affordable, high-quality care, and provide support for care workers and
family caregivers.  
  
Too many families and individuals struggle to access the affordable,
high-quality care they need.  The cost of child care is up 26% in the
last decade and more than 200 percent over the past 30 years. For the
elderly or people with disabilities long-term care costs are up 40% in
the past decade. The result is many Americans – particularly women –
stay out of the workforce to care for their families, making it hard for
businesses to attract and retain a skilled workforce and for the economy
to grow. A [BCG
brief](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/solving-the-care-crisis) forecasts
losses of $290 billion each year in gross domestic product in 2030 and
beyond if the U.S. fails to address the lack of affordable child care.  
  
At the same time, many workers providing this critical care find
themselves in low-paying jobs with few benefits. Care workers, who are
disproportionately women of color, struggle to make ends meet, and
turnover rates are high. In addition, at least 53 million Americans
serve as family caregivers—including over 5 million caring for service
members or veterans—and many face challenges due to lack of support,
training, and opportunities for rest.  
  
President Biden believes that we must secure significant new federal
investments to transform care in this country. That’s why he and Vice
President Harris called for investments to support high-quality,
affordable child care, preschool, and long-term care in their fiscal
year 2024 budget. While Congress considers those proposals, the
President is taking immediate action to make care more affordable for
American families, support family caregivers, boost compensation and
improve job quality for care workers, and expand care options.
Specifically, his Executive Order will:

-   **Make child care and long-term care more accessible and affordable
    for families, including military families**. The acute challenges
    families face in accessing affordable, high-quality care are well
    documented. In 2019, 76% of families with young children who
    searched for care reported difficulty finding adequate child care,
    and military families consistently cite access to high-quality child
    care as an impediment to military spouse employment and family
    economic security. More than three-quarters of home and
    community-based care service providers are not accepting new
    clients, leaving hundreds of thousands of older Americans and
    Americans with disabilities on waiting lists for home and
    community-based services or struggling to afford the care they need.
    The President is taking action to make child care and long-term care
    more affordable by directing federal agencies to:  
    -   Identify which of their grant programs can support child care
        and long-term care for individuals working on federal projects,
        and consider requiring applicants seeking federal job-creating
        funds to expand access to care for their workers. This builds
        off of the [historic child care
        requirement](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/02/28/CHIPS_NOFO-1_Building_Skilled_Diverse_Workforce_Fact_Sheet_0.pdf)
        for semiconductor employers seeking significant federal funding
        under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to submit a plan for how
        they will help employees access affordable child care. These
        actions help employers delivering major federal projects recruit
        and retain a robust, skilled, and diverse workforce.  
    -   Lower costs for families benefitting from the Child Care &
        Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program, including by directing
        the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to consider
        actions to reduce or eliminate families’ co-payments for child
        care.  
    -   Ensure the federal government is a model employer by supporting
        its own workforce. The Executive Order directs the Office of
        Personnel Management to conduct a review of child care subsidy
        policy and consider setting standards for when and how federal
        agencies should provide child care subsidies to federal
        employees. Additionally, all federal agencies will review
        opportunities to expand employee access to child care services
        through federal child care centers, child care subsidies, or
        contracted care for providers.  
    -   Provide support for our service members and their families by
        directing the Department of Defense to take steps to improve the
        affordability of child care on military installations.  
-   **Improve access to home-based care for veterans**. To meet our
    sacred obligation to our veterans and their families, the Executive
    Order directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to improve
    access to home-based care for veterans who require support with
    activities of daily living, like bathing and getting dressed, by
    giving them more decision-making power over who delivers that care
    and when. VA is directed to consider expanding its Veteran Directed
    Care program to all 172 VA Medical Centers by the end of Fiscal
    Year 2024. This program provides veterans with a budget to hire
    personal care assistance including from family members. VA will also
    consider piloting a new self-directed care program in no fewer than
    5 new sites that provides veterans with a budget for personal care
    assistance while reducing administration burdens related to managing
    care. Further, VA will consider adding 75 new interdisciplinary
    teams to its Home-Based Primary Care program to serve an additional
    5,600 veterans in their homes.  
-   **Boost job quality for early educators.** Early care and education
    professionals are among the lowest-paid workers in the country.
    Child care workers earn a median wage of less than $18 an hour,
    while the typical nonsupervisory worker in the U.S. earns over $28
    an hour. While the average salary of a public preschool teacher and
    kindergarten teacher is about $49,000 and $60,000, respectively, the
    average annual salary for Head Start and preschool teachers is about
    $35,000. To address this, HHS will take steps to increase the pay
    and benefits for Head Start teachers and staff. HHS will implement
    policies so that more child care providers benefiting from CCDBG
    receive higher reimbursements for the children they serve.
    Additionally, the Department of Education (ED) will encourage
    grantees of the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS)
    program—which supports thousands of student-parents across the
    country pay for care while going to school—to improve the quality of
    the services they provide, including higher wages for child care
    workers.  
-   **Enhance job quality for long-term care workers.** The President is
    committed to improving the quality of long-term care jobs in this
    country so that Americans can get the reliable, high-quality care
    they deserve—whether it is in their homes and communities or in
    nursing homes. To advance the President’s long-term care priorities,
    the Executive Order directs HHS to consider issuing several
    regulations and guidance documents to improve the quality of home
    care jobs, including by leveraging Medicaid funding to ensure there
    are enough home care workers to provide care to seniors and people
    with disabilities enrolled in Medicaid, as well as build on the
    minimum staffing standards for nursing homes and condition a portion
    of Medicare payments on how well a nursing home retains workers.  
-   **Support family caregivers**. Without adequate resources, family
    caregiving can affect caregivers’ physical and emotional health and
    well-being and contribute to financial strain. These negative
    consequences are felt most acutely by women, who make up nearly
    two-thirds of family caregivers and who drop out of the workforce at
    higher rates than men. To provide greater support to family
    caregivers, the Executive Order directs HHS to consider testing a
    new dementia care model that will include support for respite care
    (short-term help to give a primary family caregiver a break) and
    make it easier for family caregivers to access Medicare beneficiary
    information and provide more support to family caregivers during the
    hospital discharge planning process. Additionally, VA will consider
    expanding access to the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for
    Family Caregivers and provide more mental health support for
    caregivers enrolled in that program. These actions build on the
    [2022 National Strategy to Support
    Caregivers](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/RAISE_SGRG/NatlStrategyToSupportFamilyCaregivers.pdf).  
-   **Advance domestic workers’ rights**. Care workers should be
    supported, valued, and fairly compensated, and care workers should
    have the free and fair choice to join a union. In particular,
    domestic workers providing care for our loved ones are often
    underpaid and subject to discrimination and abuse. To provide
    greater protection for these workers, the Department of Labor will
    publish a sample employment agreement so domestic child care and
    long-term care workers and their employers can ensure both parties
    better understand their rights and responsibilities.  
-   **Ease construction of early childhood facilities for Tribes**.
    There are approximately half a million American Indian and Alaska
    Native children under the age of 13 who potentially need child care
    so their parents can work. Nearly half are below the age of five. To
    help the families of these children access high-quality child care,
    HHS will streamline the process for tribal grantees of federal child
    care assistance and Head Start to apply for and construct or improve
    early childhood facilities.  
-   **Engage affected communities**. To make the delivery and design of
    federal care assistance and programs work better for families, the
    care workforce, and people seeking care, the Treasury and the
    Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Labor, Health and Human
    Services, Education, and Veterans Affairs, will engage with parents,
    guardians, and other relatives with care responsibilities;
    individuals receiving long-term care; State and local care experts;
    care providers and workers; employers; and labor unions. The
    Executive Order also encourages the Administrator of the Small
    Business Administration to consider conducting similar engagement.

**  
The Biden-Harris Administration’s Record on Care  
**  
The Administration invested over $60 billion from the American Rescue
Plan (ARP) Act in the care economy, including $39 billion to help child
care providers keep their doors open and to provide child care workers
with higher pay, bonuses, and other benefits—reducing turnover and
attracting new staff. To date, these efforts have helped 220,000 child
care programs, which employ more than one million child care workers
with the capacity to serve 9.6 million children. In addition, the
Administration invested $25 billion in ARP funds to help states
strengthen their Medicaid home care programs, including over $9 billion
in spending to boost wages for home care workers as well as improve
overall job quality.  
  
The stabilization funding provided through the ARP saved child care in
this country. One in three child care programs who received
stabilization support
[report](https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-73607/november_2022_naeyc_policy_fieldsurvey_final.pdf) that
they would have been forced to close permanently without these funds.  
  
These grants likely have had effects beyond the child care workforce and
providers as access to child care is critical for parental employment,
particularly for women. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers
analyzed this relationship in their most recent [Economic Report of the
President](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ERP-2023.pdf#page=140),
and found that mothers’ employment has recovered more quickly in areas
with greater child care capacity supported by ARP stabilization grants.
In those areas, employment among mothers with young children outpaced
that of mothers in lower ARP-supported areas throughout 2022 and
rebounded to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022.

The FY 2024 President’s Budget builds on these investments and proposes
investing $600 billion over 10 years to expand access to high-quality,
affordable child care and free, high-quality preschool. This funding
will enable States to increase child care options for more than 16
million young children. The proposal lowers costs so that parents can
afford to send their children to high-quality child care while also
paying child care providers wages that reflect the value they provide
families and communities.   
  
The President’s Budget also includes $150 billion over the next decade
to improve and expand Medicaid home care services—making it easier for
seniors and people with disabilities to live, work, and participate in
their communities. This funding would improve the quality of jobs for
home care workers and support family caregivers. The Administration is
also promoting the use of apprenticeship programs and partnering with
employers, unions, and others to recruit, train, and keep long-term care
workers on the job while also helping them advance their careers as
registered and licensed nurses. Just this month, the President also
signed the first-ever
[proclamation](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/31/a-proclamation-on-care-workers-recognition-month/)
designating April as National Care Worker Recognition Month, to honor
the efforts and sacrifices of our child care and long-term care
workers.  
  
The Administration is committed to getting caregivers the resources and
respect they deserve. The National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers
outlines nearly 350 actions the federal Government can take to support
family caregivers’ health, well-being, and financial security. And the
ARP provided $145 million to help the National Family Caregiver Support
Program deliver counseling, training, and short-term relief to family
and other informal care providers. The Administration has also expanded
the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers to
veterans of all service eras so more veteran caregivers have the
financial and mental health support they deserve. Through the First
Lady’s *Joining Forces* initiative, the Administration has partnered
with more than 50 public and private sector organizations to launch the

Coalition to serve the 2.3 million military and veteran children in
caregiving homes.
