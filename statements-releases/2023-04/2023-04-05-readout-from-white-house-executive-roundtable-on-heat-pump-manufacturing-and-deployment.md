title: "Readout from White\_House Executive Roundtable on Heat Pump Manufacturing\
  \ and\_Deployment"
---
 
Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi, Secretary of Energy
Jennifer Granholm, and Senior Advisor for Clean Energy Innovation and
Implementation John Podesta convened the first-ever White House
roundtable on heat pump manufacturing and deployment, underscoring how
the President is Investing in America to grow good-paying clean energy
manufacturing jobs and lower energy bill costs for consumers and
businesses.  
  
Administration officials were joined by executives from heat pump
manufacturers, distributors, and labor leaders to discuss how
investments from President Biden’s historic legislative record will
expand the American heat pump manufacturing industry and build a
pipeline of skilled workers to meet the growing demand for heat pumps
around the country.  
  
These super-efficient heating, cooling and hot water systems – also
known as heat pumps – lower energy costs for American families, building
owners, consumers, and companies, and will reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. We can create good manufacturing and construction jobs,
strengthen American competitiveness, and improve building performance
with energy efficiency.  
  
Through the Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
Defense Production Act, and other aligned programs, the Biden-Harris
Administration is making both demand-side investments to spur heat pump
manufacturing capacity and workforce development, and supply-side
investments to help consumers capture the benefits of a clean energy
economy.  
  
This roundtable comes as President Biden’s economic agenda on lowering
energy costs is driving momentum around heat pump deployment and growing
consumer demand, with American consumers buying more heat pumps than gas
furnaces in 2022.   
  
Buildings are the foundation of where we live, work, and learn, yet they
collectively represent almost 40% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
Deploying heat pumps in millions of American homes and buildings,
alongside energy efficiency improvements and clean energy deployment,
will help tackle the climate crisis, boost our energy security and
independence, lower energy costs for American consumers, create good
paying jobs for American workers, all while improving health in our
communities.
