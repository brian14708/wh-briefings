  \ of President Pedro Sanchez of\_Spain"

President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Pedro Sanchez of
Spain to the White House on Friday, May 12 to further deepen the
historic ties between the United States and Spain.  The two leaders will
review our efforts as NATO Allies and close partners to strengthen our
bilateral defense relationship, transatlantic security, and economic
prosperity.  They will discuss our unwavering support for Ukraine and
our efforts to impose costs on the Kremlin as Russia continues its
brutal war of aggression.  The leaders will coordinate on a range of
issues as Spain prepares to assume the rotating Presidency of the
Council of the European Union in July, including climate change and
expanded cooperation with Latin America and the Caribbean.
