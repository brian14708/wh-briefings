title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Harry\_Belafonte"
---
 
Jill and I are saddened by the passing of a groundbreaking American who
used his talent, his fame, and his voice to help redeem the soul of our
Nation.   
  
Harry Belafonte was born to Caribbean parents in Harlem, New York on
March 1, 1927, when segregation was the order of American society.  To
our Nation’s benefit, Harry never accepted those false narratives and
unjust boundaries.  He dedicated his entire life to breaking barriers
and bridging divides.  
  
As a young man motivated to find his purpose, he became mesmerized by
theater when he saw a performance of the American Negro Theater in
Manhattan.  As one of America’s original breakthrough singers and
performers, he would go on to garner a storehouse of firsts—the first
Black matinee idol, the first recording artist to sell over a million
records, the first Black male Broadway actor to win a Tony award, the
first Black producer to win an Emmy award, and one of the highest paid
entertainers of his time, among other accolades.  
  
But he used his fame and fortune for the public good throughout his
extraordinary career. He became a powerful ally of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. and other giants of the Civil Rights Movement. He raised money
and donated resources to post bail for activists jailed for acts of
civil disobedience. He provided the critical funds to launch the Freedom
Rides. 

He lobbied against apartheid in South Africa, for the release of Nelson
Mandela, and was one of the visionaries behind “We Are the World,” an
innovative record released to raise millions of dollars to support
humanitarian aid in Sudan and Ethiopia.  For these and other
humanitarian and artistic efforts he was conferred with a Kennedy Center
Honor, the National Medal of the Arts, and a Grammy lifetime achievement
award.    
  
Harry Belafonte’s accomplishments are legendary and his legacy of
outspoken advocacy, compassion, and respect for human dignity will
endure.  He will be remembered as a great American.  
  
We send our deepest condolences to his family and legions of admirers
across the country and the world.
