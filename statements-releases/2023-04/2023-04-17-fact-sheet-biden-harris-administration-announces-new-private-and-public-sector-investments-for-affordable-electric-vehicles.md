title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Private and Public\
  \ Sector Investments for Affordable Electric\_Vehicles"
---
 
*President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda is Unleashing a
Manufacturing and Clean Energy Boom and Accelerating the Production of
Affordable Electric Vehicles*

As part of President Biden’s goal of having 50 percent of all new
vehicle sales be electric by 2030, the White House is announcing public
and private commitments to support America’s historic transition to
electric vehicles (EV) under the EV Acceleration Challenge. These
commitments are part of President Biden’s [Investing in
America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/) agenda to spur domestic
manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, boost U.S. competitiveness and
create good-paying jobs. Because of President Biden’s leadership and
historic investments, electric vehicle sales have tripled and the number
of publicly available charging ports has grown by over 40 percent since
he took office. There are now more than three million EVs on the road
and over 135,000 public EV chargers across the country.  

President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act adds and expands tax credits
for purchases of new and used EVs—helping bring the benefits of clean
energy to communities across the nation. The law also provides
incentives to electrify heavy-duty vehicles like school buses, and
includes support for the installation of residential, commercial, and
municipal EV charging infrastructure. These incentives complement
investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other federal
initiatives that are spurring the domestic manufacturing of EVs and
batteries and the development of a national EV charging network that
provides access to low income and disadvantaged communities.  

These incentives will lower the cost of EVs and EV charging
infrastructure; increase consumer demand and competition; promote equity
and inclusion; and accelerate the growth of the EV market. They are
creating good-paying manufacturing jobs in America building EVs,
bringing supply chains home, and unleashing unprecedented private sector
investments—with more than $100 billion already announced for battery
manufacturing alone. The White House announced the [EV Acceleration
Challenge](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/ev-acceleration-challenge/)
to bring a clean, safe, affordable, and reliable transportation future
to Americans even faster.

Today companies and nonprofits including Blink Charging, the National
Automobile Dealers Association, Pacific Gas & Electric, Uber, Zipcar and
others, are announcing new commitments to expand EV fleets, increase
consumer education, and grow the availability of EV charging.   

**ACCELERATING THE EV TRANSITION   
**   
The Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda has
spurred public and private sector commitments to accelerate the
transition to electric vehicles. State and local governments are also
leveraging federal funds to expand electrification of their vehicle
fleets. These announcements build on the EV charging network expansion
and manufacturing announcements [highlighted by the White House in
February](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-standards-and-major-progress-for-a-made-in-america-national-network-of-electric-vehicle-chargers/),
