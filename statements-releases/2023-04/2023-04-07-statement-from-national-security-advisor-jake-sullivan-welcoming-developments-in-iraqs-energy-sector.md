We welcome significant progress in Iraq this week with respect to energy
deals that further strengthen Iraq’s sovereignty, independence, and
economic prosperity.  First, the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan
Regional Government reached a historic agreement on the export of oil
and management of revenues through the Iraq-Turkey Pipeline.  This
agreement paves the way for a multi-year budget now before Iraq’s
Council of Representatives and an eventual hydrocarbons law for
long-term stability and predictability in Iraq’s energy sector.  Second,
the Government of Iraq reached an unprecedented $27 billion deal with
France’s TotalEnergies, including a project to enable the recapture and
use of flared gas in southern Iraq.  Once implemented, this historic
project will increase electricity supply for the benefit of the Iraqi
people, advance Iraq’s energy self-sufficiency, reduce harmful climate
effects from flared gas in southern Iraq, and allow for the export of
gas products to new markets.  We are pleased that companies from Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, and the United States will play important roles in this
infrastructure project.  The United States is proud to support these and
other regional projects and ongoing diplomatic initiatives to advance a
more stable, interconnected, and prosperous Middle East region, which
ultimately benefits the United States and the American people.
