Julie Su’s performance in today’s Senate nomination hearing to become
the Secretary of Labor was greeted with enthusiasm and support from
members of Congress, labor organizations, business groups, and community
leaders. These individuals and groups called for her swift confirmation
touting her qualifications, leadership of the Department of Labor, and
thoughtful engagement with stake holders across the board.  
  
As Acting Secretary Su said during her hearing today, “when he announced
my nomination for U.S Secretary of Labor, the President called me ‘the
American Dream.’ My parents believed in it, I benefited from it, and I
want to do my part to make sure it is a reality for workers across the
nation.”
