title: "Joint Statement from the United\_States and Colombia following the Bilateral\
  \ Meeting Between President Joe\_Biden and President Gustavo\_Petro"
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States and President
Gustavo Petro Urrego of the Republic of Colombia met today to advance
bilateral cooperation on issues of mutual interest, including climate
change, clean energy transition, migration, drug trafficking, and peace.
We reaffirmed the strategic importance of the U.S.-Colombia partnership
based on principles of friendship, mutual respect, cultural ties, and a
shared commitment to democracy and human rights.  
   
President Biden and President Petro committed to work together to
address the challenges of our countries and the region, protect and
improve the lives of our citizens, and uphold democratic principles. The
United States and Colombia are seeking to adapt their engagement
strategies to reflect this new moment in our shared history. The leaders
instructed their teams to continue developing new road maps towards
progress, so we can respond quickly and effectively to shared
challenges.  
   
**Combating Climate Change**  
   
President Biden and President Petro expressed unwavering commitment to
combat the climate crisis, a real threat facing the world, that imposes
a collective responsibility demanding immediate action to overcome it
and thus protect life on the planet. President Biden applauded President
Petro’s commitment to protect the Amazon and Colombia’s ambitious goal
of achieving net-zero deforestation by 2030. The leaders expressed their
commitment to work toward an ambitious and productive United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP28) and to work in other international
organizations to achieve concrete results that prioritize life and
nature. The Amazon is the world’s main natural carbon sink and it is
essential to the reduction of emissions worldwide. The United States is
the largest international supporter of climate action in Colombia with
$87 million in environmental programming provided during the last two
years and the President’s $45 million Fiscal Year 2024 budget request to
Congress. With Colombia’s announcement to allocate US$200 million during
the next twenty years to save and protect the Amazon, the United States
and Colombia we committed to work with the international community to
mobilize greater climate financing for that purpose.  
   
**Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity**  
   
President Biden and President Petro discussed the importance of
promoting economic and social opportunity in the region as a shared
interest. They reaffirmed our commitment to strengthening economic
cooperation through the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, in
line with mutual priorities to create good jobs across the Western
Hemisphere and promote labor rights, environmental sustainability, and
economic inclusion.  
   
As part of that effort, the United States and Colombia will work
together to promote regional integration. The leaders pledged to
establish a working group to advance electrical interconnection in the
Americas to help reduce the cost of energy, promote the growth of a
regional market for renewable energy, and reduce energy dependence on
fossil sources.  
  
Similarly, President Biden and President Petro committed to take
measures to accelerate the clean energy transition, decarbonize our
economies, and promote renewable energy sources that will allow us to
lay the foundations for an inclusive and fair economy.  
   
**Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection**  
   
President Biden thanked President Petro for Colombia’s leadership and
example in addressing irregular migration in the Americas. The leaders
highlighted the importance of the Los Angeles Declaration as a
comprehensive framework for moving forward with concrete solutions, and
recognize the changes in demographic trends that explain why certain
countries in our hemisphere are significant draws of labor migration.
They also underscored our joint commitment to counter human smuggling in
the Darien.  
   
**Democratic Governance**  
   
As the two oldest democracies in the hemisphere, the United States and
Colombia recommitted to shared democratic values, including justice and
the rule of law, free speech, free assembly, a free press, freedom of
religion, and the inherent human rights of all individuals. The leaders
affirmed the need to provide for the inclusive participation of the
whole of society, the strengthening of institutions and justice, the
promotion of women’s equality, and the inclusion of
historically-excluded ethnic groups such as Afro-Colombians and
Indigenous peoples. To that effect, President Biden and President Petro
condemned all forms of authoritarianism and aggression in the world,
including Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity contrary
to international law, while reiterating the urgent call for a stable and
lasting peace. They expressed our shared commitment to support and
contribute to the resolution of the situation in Venezuela.  
   
**Promotion of Peace**  
   
President Biden reiterated his support for President Petro’s peace
efforts, and for rural and agricultural development in Colombia, as
essential to effectively advance the implementation of the 2016 Peace
Agreement in its international accompaniment of the accord’s Ethnic
Chapter.  
   
**Holistic Counternarcotics Strategy**  
   
President Biden and President Petro committed to a holistic approach to
address the harmful impacts of drug use and drug trafficking on both our
peoples’ health, safety, the environment, the economy, rule of law, and
the strength and transparency of democratic institutions. Under the
principle of shared responsibility, we will redouble our efforts in
terms of demand reduction through science-based prevention, harm
reduction, treatment, and recovery support. Likewise, the leaders
instructed their teams to intensify and expand bilateral cooperation in
intelligence and interdiction to dismantle the networks, pursue the true
owners and enablers of drug trafficking in their jurisdictions, and
counter illicit finance.  
   
President Biden expressed the willingness and commitment of the United
States to cooperate with Colombia’s efforts to transform coca-growing
territories, to overcome the conditions of vulnerability of rural,
Indigenous, and Afro-Colombian communities, allowing for their true
insertion in the sustainable development of the country and enhancing
their fundamental role in caring for the environment and biodiversity.
