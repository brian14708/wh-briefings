title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on PACT Act\_Milestone"
---
 
Our veterans represent the very best of us. But for far too many of our
men and women in uniform, their military service involved exposure to
hazardous environments and substances—exposures that could lead to
harmful health effects including cancer, respiratory illnesses, or
hypertension. That’s why I was proud to sign the bipartisan Sergeant
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive
Toxics (PACT) Act into law last August – the most significant expansion
of benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans and survivors in
over thirty years.  
  
This week, our Administration reached a critical milestone as a direct
result of this law: veterans and survivors submitted 500,000 PACT
Act-related claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs and three
million veterans received toxic exposure screenings since August. My
Administration is processing claims at record rates, and is delivering
on our sacred obligation to care for America’s veterans and their
families. But that work hangs in the balance with Republican Members of
Congress’ proposals to drastically cut VA programs, resulting in
significant increases in backlogs and tens of millions fewer health care
visits – harming those the PACT Act most aims to help.  
  
We will continue to honor our nation’s veterans by providing them the
care and support they need – and oppose any efforts to cut critical
services for veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors.
