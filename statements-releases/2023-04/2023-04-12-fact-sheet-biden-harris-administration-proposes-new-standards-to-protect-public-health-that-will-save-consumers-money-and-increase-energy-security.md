*President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda Has Accelerated American
Zero Emission Vehicles Production and Positioned the U.S. to Lead the
Clean Vehicles Future*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new proposed
vehicle pollution standards to make all vehicles, including gas-powered
cars and heavy-duty trucks, cleaner and more efficient. The proposed
standards would protect public health by cutting nearly 10 billion tons
of CO2 emissions – twice the annual U.S. emissions today.  They would
also save consumers on average $12,000 over the lifetime of a vehicle.
And they would strengthen American energy security by reducing reliance
on 20 billion barrels of imported oil.

Cars and truck manufacturers have made clear that the future of
transportation is electric. The market is moving. Since President Biden
took office, the private sector – including the American auto industry –
has invested more than $120 billion in the American-made electric
vehicle and battery supply chain. The United States can seize this
moment to secure American leadership in the global race to a clean
transportation future, or let competitors like China out-compete us for
the jobs and investments building that future.

As a car enthusiast and self-proclaimed car guy, President Biden is
seizing the moment. His Investing in America agenda is expanding
domestic manufacturing and accelerating adoption of zero-emission
vehicles (ZEV), including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and
fuel cell electric vehicles. This is bringing good-paying jobs back home
and putting the United States on a bold path to out-compete China in
securing the jobs and investments of the future.

The pollution standards proposed today by the Biden-Harris
Administration will:

**Spur Adoption of Pollution-Reducing Technology for Nearly All Road
Vehicles**

The Environmental Protection Agency today is proposing two new rules to
improve public health and combat climate change that will also lower
costs for families and create good-paying jobs. The first rule would
target emissions of greenhouse gases and smog- and soot-forming
pollutants from passenger cars, vans, and light trucks. The second rule
would update vehicle emissions standards for greenhouse gas emissions
from buses, freight trucks, and other heavy-duty vehicles. This rule
builds on the final standards that EPA released in December 2022 for
criteria pollutant emissions from heavy-duty vehicles.

The proposed updates would:

-   **Protect Public Health**. Through 2055, EPA projects that the
    proposed standards would avoid nearly 10 billion tons of
    CO<sub>2</sub> emissions — equivalent to more than twice the annual
    U.S. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2022.
-   **Lower Consumer Costs. **By leveraging accelerated adoption of
    technologies that reduce fuel and maintenance costs alongside
    pollution, the proposed standards would save the average consumer
    $12,000 over the lifetime of the vehicle. The proposals would also
    result in approximately $12 billion in reduced reliance on oil
    imports. Rapid innovation in the automotive sector has driven down
    the cost of emissions-reducing technology and put us closer to
    a [clean transportation
    sector](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/EERE_TranspoDecarb_factsheet-508_0.pdf).
-   **Accelerate the Clean Vehicle Transition in Technology-Neutral
    Way. **The EPA’s approach is technology-neutral, meaning that
    better-designed gas vehicles, hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and other
    innovations could all be used to meet stricter standards. But with
    EV technology getting better and cheaper every day, and consumer
    demand rising rapidly, many manufacturers would likely rely on fully
    electric vehicles for compliance. EPA estimates that by 2032, if
    finalized, the proposed rules could result in electrification of 67%
    of new sedans, crossovers, SUVs, and light trucks; 50% of new
    vocational vehicles (such as buses and garbage trucks); 35% of new
    short-haul freight tractors; and 25% of new long-haul freight
    tractors.

**Reinforce President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda to Continue
Building a Clean Transportation Future Made in America**

These standards build on the generational investments secured by the
Biden-Harris Administration that will ensure our nation’s transportation
systems are clean, affordable, equitable, and Made in America. In the
first year of his Administration, President Biden set a goal that at
least 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030
be zero-emission vehicles. A year later, President Biden joined
countries around the world in targeting that 100 percent of all new
medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sold in 2040 be zero-emission vehicles,
with an interim 30 percent sales target for these vehicles in 2030.

The United States is making strong progress towards these goals. Under
President Biden’s watch, the number of available electric models have
doubled while the number of electric car sales have tripled. There are
over 130,000 public chargers now available across the country – with all
50 states now implementing a historic federal investment to build a new
national charging network. The iconic yellow school bus is going green
and the U.S. Postal Service is shifting to fully electric. The private
sector has committed more than $120 billion into the American-made
electric vehicle and battery supply chain in the last two years alone.
U.S. capacity to source the critical materials and inputs for this
supply chain is also rapidly expanding. Through partnerships with unions
and industry, the Administration is lifting up the workers who represent
America’s competitive edge – and is ready to take on and tap into the
massive economic opportunity embedded in this shift.

This extraordinary progress is propelled in large part by public and
private investments made under President Biden’s leadership, including:

-   Nearly $25 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
    support clean transportation, including by building a national
    network of EV chargers and alternative-fuel stations; ensuring
    domestic manufacturers have the materials they need to make EV
    batteries; and funding clean transit and clean school buses, with
    priority for underserved communities.
-   $6 billion through the Inflation Reduction Act to directly support
    the clean-vehicle transition, including by extending loans to
    manufacture clean vehicles and their components in the United
    States; retooling domestic production lines for clean vehicles; and
    funding for Tribal, state, and local governments deploy clean
    heavy-duty vehicles, especially in nonattainment areas.
-   More than $120 billion of private investments in EVs and batteries
    in the United States since President Biden has taken office.

President Biden has also acted to ensure a seamless clean-vehicle
transition that benefits all Americans, including by:
