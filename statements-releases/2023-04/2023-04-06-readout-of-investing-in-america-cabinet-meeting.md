title: "Readout of Investing in America Cabinet\_Meeting"
---
 
Today, Chief of Staff Jeff Zients hosted an Investing in America Cabinet
meeting. During the meeting, President Biden stopped by to thank members
of his Cabinet and his Administration for implementing his historic
economic agenda and delivering for hardworking families – including the
Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and the American Rescue Plan – and for their
participation in the ongoing three-week long Investing in America tour.

Investing in America Cabinet members and Administration officials
discussed the impact of President Biden and Vice President Harris’
legislative successes that White House and Cabinet officials have been
highlighting throughout the Investing in America tour, including how
this Administration has unleashed over $435 billion of new private
sector investments in manufacturing and clean energy, awarded funding
for over 23,000 new infrastructure projects, and brought affordable,
high-speed internet to over 17 million households since the President
took office. They also discussed what’s at stake if Congressional
Republicans get their way and repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, slash
funding for manufacturing, innovation, and research, and put at risk
hundreds of billions of dollars of investment we’ve seen unleashed as a
result of the President’s economic agenda.   
  
Over the course of three weeks, President Biden, Vice President Harris,
the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and Administration officials are
traveling to 25 states as part of the Investing in America tour,
including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
