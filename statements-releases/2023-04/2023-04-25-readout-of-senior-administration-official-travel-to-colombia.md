On Tuesday, April 25, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon
Finer traveled to Colombia to lead the interagency U.S. delegation for
the international conference on Venezuela. While in Colombia, Finer met
with President Gustavo Petro. He also met with Foreign Minister Alvaro
Leyva, Chief of Staff Laura Sarabia, Minister of Justice and Law Nestor
Ivan Osuna, and Deputy Finance Minister Gonzalo Hernandez Jimenez to
follow up on the recent bilateral meeting between President Biden and
President Petro in Washington last week.   
   
During the conference, Finer made clear that the United States remains
firmly committed to the Venezuelan people and will continue to work with
the international community to support the restoration of democracy and
the rule of law in the country so Venezuelans can rebuild their lives.
He outlined the United States’ vision of a step-by-step approach where
concrete actions toward restoring Venezuelan democracy, leading to free
and fair elections, are met by corresponding sanctions relief by the
United States.  
   
Finer was accompanied by Special Presidential Advisor for the Americas
Chris Dodd, National Security Council Senior Director for Western
Hemisphere Affairs Juan Gonzalez, and State Department Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Mark Wells.
