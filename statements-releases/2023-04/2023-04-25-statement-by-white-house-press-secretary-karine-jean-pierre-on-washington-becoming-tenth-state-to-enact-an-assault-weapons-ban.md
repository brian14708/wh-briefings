title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Washington\
  \ Becoming Tenth State to Enact an Assault Weapons\_Ban"
---
 
Today, Washington State has become the tenth state in the nation
alongside Washington, D.C. to ban assault weapons and get weapons of war
off America’s streets. President Biden commends the leadership of
Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and legislative leaders, as well as the
advocates, survivors, and elected officials who fought for years to make
today a reality. In so doing, they have made every community in the
state – from Seattle to Spokane and everywhere in between – safer and
more secure.
