Jill and I join Christians around the world in celebrating Easter
Sunday, a day of hope and joy, renewal and rebirth. It marks the end of
Lent, a period of sacrifice and contemplation. And it commemorates
Christ’s Resurrection, a powerful reminder of God’s love and the promise
of redemption for us all.   
   
During Lent and especially on Good Friday, we held in our hearts all
those who are suffering from threats of violence and persecution, grief
and isolation, and illness, poverty, and other hardships.  
   
Today, we hold close the Easter message that nothing – not even death –
can match the power of faith, hope, and love. And we remember Jesus’
sacrifice and recommit ourselves to love God with all our hearts and to
love our neighbors as ourselves, embracing His call to treat one another
with compassion.   
   
To all those gathering in churches and homes around the world today,
happy Easter and may God bless and keep you.
