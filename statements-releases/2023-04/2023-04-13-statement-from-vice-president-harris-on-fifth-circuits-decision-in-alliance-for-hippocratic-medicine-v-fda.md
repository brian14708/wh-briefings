title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision in Alliance\
  \ for Hippocratic Medicine v.\_FDA"
---
 
Last night, the Fifth Circuit issued a decision which invalidates the
scientific, independent judgment of the FDA about when and how a
medicine is available to Americans. The Justice Department has already
announced that they are seeking emergency relief from the Supreme
Court.  
   
More than 20 years ago, the FDA approved medication abortion as safe and
effective for the American people. Last week, a Texas district court
ruled to block access to this medication in every state in the
country.  
   
The Fifth Circuit’s decision—just like the district
court’s—second-guesses the agency’s medical experts. If this decision
stands, no medication—from chemotherapy drugs, to asthma medicine, to
blood pressure pills, to insulin—would be safe from attacks. This
decision threatens the rights of Americans across the country, who can
look in their medicine cabinets and find medication prescribed by a
doctor because the FDA engaged in a process to determine the efficacy
and safety of that medication.  
   
This lawsuit is the next step to a nationwide abortion ban. The decision
severely limits access to mifepristone, standing between doctors and
their patients. President Biden and our Administration remain firmly
committed to protecting access to medication abortion, as the President
and I have made clear since the day of the Supreme Court’s decision in
*Dobbs*.  
   
There is a reproductive health care crisis in America. Our
Administration will continue fighting to protect women’s health and the
right to make decisions about one’s own body.
