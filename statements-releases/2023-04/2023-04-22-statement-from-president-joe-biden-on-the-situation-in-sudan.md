title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Situation in\_Sudan"

Today, on my orders, the United States military conducted an operation
to extract U.S. Government personnel from Khartoum.  I am proud of the
extraordinary commitment of our Embassy staff, who performed their
duties with courage and professionalism and embodied America’s
friendship and connection with the people of Sudan.  I am grateful for
the unmatched skill of our service members who successfully brought them
to safety.  And I thank Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia, which were
critical to the success of our operation.       
   
I am receiving regular reports from my team on their ongoing work to
assist Americans in Sudan, to the extent possible.  We are also working
closely with our allies and partners in this effort.  
   
This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of
innocent civilians.  It’s unconscionable and it must stop.  The
belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional
ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of
the people of Sudan.  We are temporarily suspending operations at the
U.S. Embassy in Sudan, but our commitment to the Sudanese people and the
future they want for themselves is unending.
