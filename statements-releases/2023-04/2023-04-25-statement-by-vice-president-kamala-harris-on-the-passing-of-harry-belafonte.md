title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Harry\_Belafonte"
---
 
Harry Belafonte was one of our nation’s most powerful voices for
change.  
   
As an activist, Harry Belafonte helped lead the fight for civil rights
and human rights here and across the world—and inspired a generation of
young leaders to fight for change. He used his voice and resources to
champion the cause of racial justice, speaking out for freedom alongside
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and supporting organizations like the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. On stage and on screen, the “King of Calypso”
captivated audiences around the globe.  
   
Like all true patriots, Harry Belafonte had the ability to see what
could be and had the courage to work to realize that vision. He fought
to help America live up to our highest ideals: dignity, equity, and
justice for all.  
   
For years, it was my honor to call Harry a dear friend and rely on his
wisdom and counsel. America has lost a giant.  
   
Today, Doug and I are praying for his family and loved ones.
