title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the March Consumer Price\_Index"
---
 
Today’s report shows continued progress in our fight against inflation
with the 12-month inflation rate at the lowest level since May 2021.
This progress follows last week’s news that our job market remains
historically strong.  Inflation has now fallen by 45% from its summer
peak. Gas prices are down more than $1.40 from the summer, and grocery
prices fell in the month of March for the first time since September
2020.  In recent months, we have also seen price declines for items like
used cars, smart phones, and other electronics. While inflation is still
too high, this progress means more breathing room for hard-working
Americans – with wages now higher than they were 9 months ago, after
accounting for inflation.

My administration is continuing to fight to lower costs for families.
That includes historic action to lower prescription drug costs for
seniors, capping insulin at $35, and allowing Medicare to negotiate
lower prices. My Investing in America agenda is bringing good jobs to
communities throughout the country, and building a stronger and more
dynamic economy for the long haul. We should build on that progress with
policies to grow our economy, lower costs, create jobs, and reduce the
deficit. And we must reject reckless proposals from Congressional
Republicans to take our economy hostage in order to cut taxes for the
wealthy and large corporations, and bring back failed trickle down
policies that would ship jobs overseas and gut programs that are
lowering costs for seniors, middle-class families, and hard-working
Americans.
