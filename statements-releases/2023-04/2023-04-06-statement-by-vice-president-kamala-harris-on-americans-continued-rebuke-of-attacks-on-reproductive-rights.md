title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Americans\u2019 Continued Rebuke\
  \ of Attacks on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
This week’s election in Wisconsin reaffirmed what we already know to be
true: the majority of Americans believe and agree that every woman, not
her government, should have the freedom to make decisions about her own
body. After the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade*, voters have
rejected measures to take away reproductive rights and supported
measures to strengthen them every time the measures were on the ballot.
We saw that last year in states across our nation, including in Kansas,
California, Michigan, Montana, Kentucky, and Vermont. Similarly, we saw
Americans standing up for reproductive freedom this week in
Wisconsin.   
   
Since the *Dobbs* decision, extremist elected officials continue to
undermine and attack reproductive freedom. They have pushed for a wide
range of radical policies, from banning abortion in all 50 states, to
criminalizing doctors and nurses, to threatening access to safe and
effective FDA-approved medication.   
   
The consequences of these abortion bans and extreme laws have been
heart-wrenching. Women’s lives have been put at risk, as care is denied
because providers fear prosecution for doing their job. Women have been
turned away from emergency rooms and denied treatments and care that are
essential to preserve their health and life.  
   
President Biden and I will continue to stand with the women of America,
and against these attacks on their freedom and health care. As voters in
Wisconsin showed, this fight continues. And we will not rest until
Congress passes a law to protect freedom and liberty.
