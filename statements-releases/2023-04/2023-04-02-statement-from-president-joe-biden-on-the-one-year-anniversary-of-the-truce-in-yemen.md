  \ in\_Yemen"

Today marks a significant milestone—one year of a truce in the Yemen
war.  One year that has saved countless Yemeni lives, enabled increased
humanitarian assistance to flow throughout the country, allowed Yemenis
to travel throughout the Middle East, and set the conditions for a
comprehensive peace. Maintaining this truce and strengthening progress
toward peace has been a main focus of my administration’s engagement
with our partners in the Middle East. That focus will continue
intensively as we seek to build on this extraordinary progress and
support all efforts towards a comprehensive resolution to this terrible
conflict. The United States remains fully committed to our partners in
the region, and to supporting Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Iranian
enabled attacks. The fact that cross border attacks from Yemen have
ceased in the last year, as well as airstrikes inside Yemen, is yet
another positive outcome of the truce. I look forward to continuing to
work with all our partners in the region to permanently end the war in
Yemen.
