title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Maternal\_Health"
---
 
Today, as part of [Black Maternal Health
Week](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/10/a-proclamation-on-black-maternal-health-week-2023/),
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of
the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, Ambassador Susan
Rice, Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor, and
Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender
Policy Council, convened state legislators from across the country
working to advance legislation to improve maternal health.

The Biden-Harris Administration has long prioritized improving maternal
health, including releasing a [Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal
Health
Crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Maternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf),
which provides a whole-of-government strategy to combatting maternal
mortality and morbidity, reducing persistent disparities, and improving
the overall experience of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum for women in
this country. The [President’s Budget for Fiscal Year
2024](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/budget_fy2024.pdf)
includes $471 million to support ongoing implementation of the Blueprint
and requires all States to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12
months postpartum, eliminating gaps in health insurance at a critical
time.

In addition, today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
[announced](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/13/hhs-celebrates-black-maternal-health-week-2023.html)
the availability of as much as $468 million in funding related to
maternal and child health that will support home visiting programs,
innovative efforts developed at the state level, and a research
collaborative supporting Minority-Serving Institutions focused on
addressing and finding community-based solutions to maternal health
disparities.

State leaders continue to serve on the frontlines of developing and
advancing policies to address maternal mortality and morbidity and
protect women’s access to reproductive health care. Thanks to progress
so far in the 2023 legislative session and actions taken by the
Administration, more than 30 states and the District of Columbia have
implemented or will implement a 12-month extension of Medicaid
postpartum coverage, ensuring women have the coverage they need to stay
healthy. In addition, legislators are advancing bills to expand access
to midwives and doulas, establish and strengthen maternal mortality
review committees, improve maternal mental health, and ensure workplace
protections for pregnant women and mothers.

Senior White House officials thanked the legislators for their
leadership and affirmed the Administration’s support and partnership in
addressing the maternal health crisis, particularly in the wake of
historic attacks on women’s access to reproductive health care and
ability to make their own decisions about their bodies.  
   
Participating state legislative leaders included:

-   Kansas State Senator Oletha Faust-Goudeau
-   Michigan State Senator Erika Geiss
-   Nevada State Assemblywoman Danielle Monroe-Moreno
-   North Carolina State Senator Natalie Murdock
-   Pennsylvania State Representative Morgan Cephas
-   Tennessee State Senator London Lamar
-   Utah State Representative Ashlee Matthews
-   Wisconsin State Representative Shelia Stubbs
