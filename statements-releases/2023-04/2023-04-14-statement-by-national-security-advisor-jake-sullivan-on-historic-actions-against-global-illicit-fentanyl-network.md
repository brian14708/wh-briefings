title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Historic Actions Against\
  \ Global Illicit Fentanyl\_Network"
---
 
Today, the United States is taking significant and historic actions to
disrupt the trafficking of synthetic drugs, representing a major
contribution to a government-wide effort to save lives and pursue
justice and accountability. Earlier today, the Department of Justice
announced criminal charges against over two dozen defendants for their
alleged involvement in or support to the production and proliferation of
illicit fentanyl worldwide. This law enforcement action is the result of
extraordinary work by the Department of Justice, including the Drug
Enforcement Administration, to dismantle a global network of individuals
engaged in the illicit fentanyl drug trade. This is one of the most
significant grouping of fentanyl-focused criminal charges ever brought.

Additionally, the Department of the Treasury announced complementary
sanctions against two companies and five individuals linked to the
global proliferation of precursor chemicals for the synthesis of illicit
fentanyl. The Department of State also announced the submission of over
two dozen individuals to its Narcotics Rewards Program, which offers
rewards for information leading to the arrest or conviction of narcotics
traffickers operating primarily outside the U.S. in major violation of
our narcotics laws.

These actions represent yet another step in our efforts to counter
fentanyl trafficking worldwide and work with Mexico and other key
partners to combat the devastating threat this activity poses. We remain
steadfast in our belief that the global illicit drug trade is a threat
to our public health and safety, national security, and economy. We also
remain steadfast in our commitment to hold accountable those supporting
this deadly enterprise. We commend the Department of Justice, the Drug
Enforcement Administration, the Department of the Treasury, and the
Department of State for their unrelenting pursuit of justice and
accountability and their unwavering commitment to keeping Americans
safe.
