title: "Chair\u2019s Summary of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Held\
  \ by President Joe\_Biden"
---
 
On April 20, 2023, President Biden convened the Major Economies Forum on
Energy and Climate (MEF) for a fourth time to galvanize efforts needed
during this critical decade to stem the climate crisis by keeping a
1.5°C limit on warming within reach. 

Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, People’s Republic of China, Egypt,
the European Commission, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy,
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United
Nations Secretary-General, and the International Energy Agency Executive
Director participated in the virtual meeting.

Special Presidential Envoy for Climate (SPEC) John Kerry opened the
meeting by noting the progress made over the last two years toward
keeping a 1.5°C limit within reach.  He emphasized, at the same time,
that the latest findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change underscore that there is a need for greater ambition and action
during this critical decade and that the window for decisive action is
quickly narrowing.

President Biden noted recent domestic actions by the United States to
meet its 1.5°C-aligned 2030 emissions target.  He called on fellow
leaders to “recommit ourselves to action while we still have the time,”
inviting them to join the United States in a set of joint efforts
targeting four urgent priorities that are critical to keeping 1.5°C
within reach: decarbonizing energy, ending deforestation, reducing
non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and advancing carbon management.  He also
urged leaders to support strengthened efforts this year to fully
leverage the capacity of the multilateral development banks (MDBs) to
address global challenges, including climate change.

The President announced that the United States is providing $1 billion
to the Green Climate Fund and will request $500 million over five years
for the Amazon Fund and related activities in the context of Brazil’s
efforts to end deforestation by 2030.  He also announced the U.S. is
working to invest alongside partners in a private sector-led effort to
mobilize an additional $1 billion to help conserve the Amazon and other
critical ecosystems in Latin America.

Dr. Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency,
briefed leaders on its new report outlining the four “pillars for
action” in the 2020s addressed by President Biden.  He made clear that a
credible pathway to 1.5°C necessitates strong, immediate action on each
of these pillars and stressed that while 1.5°C is still within reach,
the world must peak emissions before 2025 and then pursue a rapid
trajectory to bring them to zero by mid-century.

Participants spoke to the urgency of addressing the climate crisis
during this decade, including through a wide range of intensified
efforts related to mitigation, adaptation, and support for developing
countries.  They stressed the need for accelerating the energy
transition across multiple sectors, including by scaling up renewable
energy. Participants highlighted the economic opportunities that come
along with climate-related efforts and the importance of major economies
showing the way.  They also recalled the COP 27 outcome in Sharm
el-Sheikh, including the decision to establish funding arrangements for
loss and damage, including a fund.

Participants announced support for joint efforts targeting the four
pillars of action, as well as the urgent need to scale up climate
finance from the MDBs (joined in some cases by countries not
participating in the MEF meeting):

-   **<u>Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs)</u>** – MEF participants Canada,
    the European Union, France, Germany, Indonesia, the United Kingdom,
    and the United States, as well as Norway, announced a **collective
    zero-emissions vehicles goal** that, by 2030, over 50 percent of
    light-duty vehicles (LDVs) sold globally, and at least 30 percent of
    medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) sold globally, will be ZEVs
    (battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, fuel cell electric
    vehicles, and others), with a view to setting their own national LDV
    and MHDV market share goals by COP 28.  Germany noted the role that
    carbon neutral e-fuels could play in meeting this goal.   
-   **<u>Decarbonizing Shipping</u>** – Australia, Canada, the European
    Union, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United
    Kingdom, and the United States supported the adoption of
    **1.5°C-aligned goals for the shipping sector** in July 2023 at the
    International Maritime Organization, including a goal of zero
    emissions from international shipping no later than 2050.  
-   **<u>Ending Deforestation</u>** – MEF participants Australia, the
    European Union, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the
    United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as Norway, said they
    will work together through the **Forest and Climate Leaders’
    Partnership** to coordinate investment and support for ambitious
    forest, nature, and climate action in forest countries.  
-   **<u>Reducing Methane Emissions</u>** – MEF participants Canada, the
    European Union, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States, as
    well as Ireland and Norway, joined in launching the **Methane
    Finance Sprint,** which aims to scale up methane finance.  This
    includes mobilizing, by COP 28, at least $200 million in new public
    and philanthropic support for methane abatement activities, with a
    view to developing a pipeline of projects.  Philanthropies have
    committed $100 million in new funding through the Global Methane Hub
    towards the $200 million goal.  
-   **<u>Phasing Down HFCs</u>** – Australia, Canada, the European
    Union, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
    States expressed support for a robust upcoming replenishment of the
    Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund to incentivize **early action on
    hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) reductions** and to maximize parallel
    cooling efficiency improvements. The Kigali Amendment will expedite
    the phasedown of super-polluting HFCs to avoid up to half a degree
    Celsius of warming by 2100.  
-   **<u>Advancing Carbon Management</u>** – MEF participants Australia,
    Canada, Egypt, the European Union, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi
    Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, as well as
    Norway and Denmark, joined in launching a **Carbon Management
    Challenge** with the aim of coming forward by COP 28 with concrete
    announcements to accelerate the development and deployment of carbon
    capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and carbon dioxide removal
    (CDR) technologies. In addition to full-scale mitigation efforts –
    including accelerated deployment of clean energy, ending
    deforestation, and cutting non-CO2 emissions – keeping 1.5°C within
    reach will require broader deployment of CCUS and CDR to deal with
    emissions that cannot otherwise be avoided.    
-   **<u>Scaling Up MDB Climate Finance</u>** – Argentina, Australia,
    Canada, Egypt, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
    the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom,
    and the United States support a strengthened effort this year to
    fully **leverage the capacity of the multilateral development banks
    to address global challenges, including climate change**, while also
    maintaining their focus on poverty reduction and achieving the
    Sustainable Development Goals.  The multilateral development banks
    are doing this by expanding their visions, creating the right
    incentive structures, improving their operational approaches, and
    increasing their financial capacity.

In addition, participants announced national and regional efforts, and
called for further joint efforts, to strengthen climate action,
including, for example:

-   **Brazil** reiterated its commitment to reach zero deforestation by
    2030 and to reforest 12 million hectares of degraded lands,
    highlighting the role of the Action Plan for the Prevention and
    Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAM) in setting out
    a framework to help achieve this goal, including by guaranteeing the
    protection of presently undesignated federal lands.  It welcomed
    global efforts to scale up finance for forests and will review
    options at the jurisdictional level, including, e.g., the Lowering
    Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, in
    consultation with local stakeholders, including states.  LEAF
    estimates over $400 million in demand for jurisdictional REDD+
    credits from Brazil.      
-   **Canada** announced that it intends to reach at least 60% EV sales
    by 2030 and 100% by 2035 for light-duty vehicles and 100% by 2040
    for medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Canada also intends to provide
    $3.5 million to help Fiji and Samoa reduce methane emissions and
    achieve their Paris Agreement targets.  
-   **Egypt,** the President of COP 27, highlighted that it has joined
    the Kigali Amendment and intends to update its NDC under the Paris
    Agreement by June 2023, including a goal of 42% of power from
    renewable energy by 2030.  
-   The **European Commission** proposed a new initiative to develop
    global targets for energy efficiency and renewable energy by COP 28.
    It also announced that the EU plans to invest 1 billion Euros by
    next year towards ending deforestation, including in the Amazon
    Fund.  
-   **France** highlighted that it will host in June a summit on
    development finance, including in relation to climate.  
-   **Germany** called for an ambitious global renewables goal and
    recalled the establishment last year of an open “Climate Club” for
    those committed to the ambitious implementation of the Paris
    Agreement to promote decarbonization and complement other climate
    efforts.  
-   **Indonesia** committed to new efforts to minimize methane emissions
    from the oil and gas sector by identifying opportunities to
    eliminate routine flaring and venting and controlling methane leaks
    with international best practice measures, supported by strengthened
    policy and regulatory action.  
-   **Italy** will join other G7 nations and 14 other countries in the
    “[Net-Zero Government
    Initiative](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fceq%2Fnews-updates%2F2022%2F11%2F17%2Fceq-launches-global-net-zero-government-initiative-announces-18-countries-joining-u-s-to-slash-emissions-from-government-operations%2F&data=05%7C01%7CMoffatAS%40state.gov%7C2760ea3fb15347cb158608db40493574%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638174455395279222%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=q4w2eUibiIlAqrim9BSORAb6p4QD0NTdLTItGHNUlJ8%3D&reserved=0),”
    committing to achieve net-zero emissions from government operations
    by no later than 2050.  
-   **Türkiye** announced that it plans to launch in 2024 a national
    strategy on mitigation that will include greenhouse gases beyond
    CO2, including HFCs.  

The United Arab Emirates, the incoming President of COP 28, underscored
the imperative for COP 28 to provide a definitive turning point in the
fight against the climate crisis.  U.N. Secretary-General António
Guterres stressed the need to rise above political disagreements to
confront the climate crisis.  He urged an “acceleration agenda” by major
emitters and wealthier countries with respect to net zero deadlines,
decarbonization of key sectors, and the need to “turbo-charge” climate
finance from the multilateral development banks.  
  
In closing remarks, SPEC Kerry reviewed the many positive commitments
made, including with respect to the joint initiatives.  He noted that
several participants had spoken to the importance of following the
science and that the major economies had generally “sounded the same
alarm bells.”  He closed by thanking the participants, stressing that
while the 1.5°C aim is “within our grasp,” nations need to summon the
necessary political will to achieve it.
