title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Non-Consensually Distributed\
  \ Intimate\_Images"

Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council chaired a working meeting with bipartisan state
legislators from 12 states, alongside survivors, legal experts and
practitioners, on proposed actions to strengthen protections for
survivors of non-consensually distributed intimate images (NDII) and
hold offenders accountable.  
  
As online harassment and abuse have become common features of the
digital world, the non-consensual sharing, dissemination, and
monetization of intimate videos and images has become alarmingly
widespread. In a
[survey](https://www.thehotline.org/wp-content/uploads/media/2022/07/2022_Online_Abuse_and_Harassment-Survey.pdf)
conducted by the National Domestic Violence Hotline in 2022, 27% of
respondents reported being threatened with the posting of
intimate/sexual pictures without permission, and 17% reported having
such images posted without permission. To address this scourge, on June
16, 2022, President Biden signed a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/16/memorandum-on-the-establishment-of-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
establishing the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and
Abuse. Vice President Harris

the Task Force by hosting a survivor and expert roundtable.  
  
Forty-eight states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam have
laws against NDII. However, since the first law against NDII passed in
2004, much has been learned about what makes these laws effective, and
how to strengthen them.  At the convening, legal experts underscored
that in their experience, the most effective laws define the offense
without a motive requirement and apply to both threats and actual acts
of NDII. Practitioners who have represented survivors emphasized that
these crimes should be treated as a serious offense under the law, given
the significant harms they cause.  
  
Survivors of NDII have experienced significant disruptions to their
education, career, and relationships, along with severe mental health
consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,
anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm, and suicide. Florida Senate
Democratic Leader Lauren Book highlighted her experience being
threatened with the non-consensual disclosure of intimate images,
alongside other forms of online harassment and abuse, citing the need
for modern laws to reflect the vast proliferation of
technology-facilitated gender-based violence. Several legislators
discussed new and emerging forms of technology, like generative
artificial intelligence (AI). Illinois legislators spoke about their
work this session on the Digital Forgeries Act which would address
synthetically generated NDII, also known as “deepfakes”.  
  
In the convening, experts also highlighted the federal civil cause of
action for individuals whose intimate visual images are disclosed
without their consent, established by the 2022 reauthorization of the
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Several participants further noted
that they see an urgent need for a complementary law to establish
federal criminal liability for the distribution of private, explicit
images of someone without their consent, citing the Stopping Harmful
Image Exploitation and Limiting Distribution (SHIELD) Act, which has
been re-introduced this Congress with bipartisan support.  
  
White House officials thanked the legislators, experts, and survivors,
and shared that the Administration will continue to pursue meaningful
actions to address online harassment and abuse in all its forms, and
continue working with Congress and stakeholders to make bipartisan
progress on these issues.  
  
Today’s Legislative Convening on Non-Consensually Distributed Intimate
Images was hosted as part of the White House Task Force to Address
Online Harassment and Abuse. White House officials from the Gender
Policy Council, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and Office of the
Vice President joined. Participants included:
