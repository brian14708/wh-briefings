title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019s Engagement with President Yoon on\
  \ Space\_Cooperation"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by President Yoon Suk
Yeol of the Republic of Korea (ROK) at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Maryland, where they reaffirmed their determination to strengthen
U.S.-ROK space cooperation across all sectors – civil, commercial, and
national security.  They received briefings regarding bilateral
cooperation to address the climate crisis as well as space science.
 Additionally, the Vice President and President Yoon met with
Korean-American space experts and discussed their contributions to
strengthen the bilateral space partnership.  
   
This builds on their September 2022 meeting in Seoul, where the two
leaders discussed deepening joint work on space issues, the ROK’s
efforts to grow its own space program, and the importance of
establishing and defending international norms in space.  As part of our
shared efforts on rules and norms, in their September meeting, the Vice
President welcomed President Yoon’s commitment not to conduct
destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing, a commitment
that Vice President Harris announced in April 2022 on behalf of the
United States.  
   
Their visit to Goddard occurred as the nations mark the 70<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the U.S.-ROK alliance, and highlights the strong and
growing U.S.-ROK partnership in outer space.
