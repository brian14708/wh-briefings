Vice President Kamala Harris today met with Prime Minister Mateusz
Morawiecki of Poland.  The Vice President reaffirmed our ironclad
commitment to NATO’s Article 5, welcomed our growing defense cooperation
with Poland, and thanked the Prime Minister for Poland’s leadership in
supporting Ukraine’s security and for its significant contributions to
the provision of humanitarian assistance.  The two leaders condemned
Russia’s continued brutal aggression against Ukraine and discussed their
shared determination to continue imposing costs on Russia for its
violation of international rules and norms as well as on the Belarusian
regime for its malign activities.  The leaders discussed the importance
of a shared commitment to democratic values, which underpins our close
and growing cooperation in other areas.  The Vice President expressed
appreciation for Poland’s leadership in reducing European dependence on
Russian energy and congratulated Poland on its selection of a U.S.
technology partner for development of its civil nuclear power program,
which will strengthen our bilateral ties and European energy security,
help address the climate crisis, and create thousands of jobs in each of
our countries. They also discussed the importance of close transatlantic
alignment on the challenges posed by China.
