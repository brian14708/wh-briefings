title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on World Malaria\_Day"
---
 
No one should fear losing someone they love—a child, a parent, a
partner—because of a mosquito bite. The United States eliminated malaria
in our country in 1951, yet for too many people around the world, that
fear remains part of daily life. Malaria still threatens more than half
the global population, and claims the life of a child nearly every
minute. And, as climate change leads to rising temperatures, new areas
will become vulnerable to malaria in the coming decades. Today, on World
Malaria Day, we recommit to ending the disease worldwide.

Thanks to the generosity of the American people and the strong and
sustained bipartisan leadership on this issue in Congress, the United
States and our global partners have helped save more than 11.7 million
lives and prevent 2 billion malaria infections around the
world—strengthening families, communities, and nations. In FY 2022, the
President’s Malaria Initiative provided an estimated $33 million to
support approximately 100,000 community health workers through training
and supervision, equipment, and, in some countries, payment. And, we are
working closely with public and private partners to support local
manufacturing of mosquito nets and malaria medicines, which will help to
save lives while building more sustainable health systems and spurring
economic growth.

We have made incredible gains, but we must do more to eliminate this
disease for everyone, everywhere. I am proud that the President’s
Malaria Initiative—which supports U.S. efforts of 27 nations across
Africa and Southeast Asia—is adding three new partners: Burundi, The
Gambia, and Togo. This will help bring life-saving tools and treatments
to more people in need. My FY 2024 Budget includes an increase in our
ongoing support for Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which is accelerating
efforts to roll out a new malaria vaccine. And, through the success of
the recent replenishment conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which the United States hosted last year, we
raised the largest amount ever for the Global Fund—which will save tens
of millions of lives from these three diseases.

We can—and we will—end malaria. And together, we will build a more
healthy, secure, and prosperous world for future generations.
