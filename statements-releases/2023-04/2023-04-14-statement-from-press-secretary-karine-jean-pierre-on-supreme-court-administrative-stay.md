title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Supreme Court Administrative\_\
  Stay"
---
 
The Supreme Court temporarily paused a lower court decision that
attempted to override FDA’s decades-old approval of mifepristone. For
now, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and effective
use. The President and his Administration continue to stand by FDA’s
evidence-based approval of mifepristone, and we will continue to support
the FDA’s independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate
a wide range of prescription drugs. The stakes of this fight could not
be higher in the face of ongoing attacks on women’s health, and we will
continue to fight to restore the protections of *Roe* v. Wade.
