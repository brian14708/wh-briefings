title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Decision in Alliance for Hippocratic\
  \ Medicine v.\_FDA"
---
 
Today’s unprecedented decision threatens the rights of women nationwide
to make decisions about their health care and the ability to access
medication prescribed to them by their doctors. Simply put: this
decision undermines the FDA’s ability to approve safe and effective
medications—from chemotherapy drugs, to asthma medicine, to blood
pressure pills, to insulin—based on science, not politics. This decision
threatens the rights of Americans across the country, who can look in
their medicine cabinets and find medication prescribed by a doctor
because the FDA engaged in a process to determine the efficacy and
safety of that medication.

At the same time as the court in Texas issued the decision to try to
restrict access to FDA-approved medication, a court in Washington state
reached a different conclusion.

Each person in our nation should have the right to access safe and
effective medication which has been approved by the FDA. In the face of
attacks on a woman’s right to access an abortion, our Administration
will continue to fight to protect reproductive freedom and the ability
of all Americans to make health care decisions with their doctors free
from political interference.
