title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Welcoming Bahrain and\
  \ Qatar\u2019s Restoration of Diplomatic\_Ties"
---
 
We welcome the restoration of diplomatic ties between Bahrain and Qatar,
two close U.S. partners and Major Non-NATO Allies. The United States has
been working since the start of the Biden Administration to encourage
regional integration, de-escalation, and rapprochement between U.S.
partners. A fully unified Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Bahrain and
Qatar are key members, is also an important step towards establishing a
more stable and prosperous Middle East region, including through more
integrated commercial, economic, and defense arrangements. The United
States looks forward to working with all of our partners as we advance
this shared vision of a more integrated, stable, and prosperous region,
which ultimately serves the interests of the United States and the
American people.Â
