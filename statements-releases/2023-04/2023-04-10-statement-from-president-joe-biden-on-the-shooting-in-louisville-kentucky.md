title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Shooting in Louisville,\_Kentucky"
---
 
Once again, our nation is in mourning after a senseless act of gun
violence. Jill and I are praying for those killed and injured in the
tragic shooting in Louisville, and for the survivors who will carry
grief and trauma for the rest of their lives. We are grateful to the
Louisville Metropolitan Police Department officers who quickly and
courageously stepped into the line of fire to save others.

How many more Americans must die before Republicans in Congress will act
to protect our communities? It’s long past time that we require safe
storage of firearms. Require background checks for all gun sales.
Eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability. We can and must do
these things now.

A strong majority of Americans want lawmakers to act on commonsense gun
safety reforms. Instead, from Florida to North Carolina to the U.S.
House of Representatives, we’ve watched Republican officials double down
on dangerous bills that make our schools, places of worship, and
communities less safe. It’s unconscionable, it’s reckless, and too many
Americans are paying with their lives.
