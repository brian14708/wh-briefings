title: "Readout of White\_House Roundtable Affirming Transgender\_Kids"
---
 
Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice and U.S. Surgeon General
Dr. Vivek Murthy hosted a roundtable at the White House about the joys,
hopes, and challenges that transgender children are experiencing.
Transgender kids and their parents traveled to the White House from
states that have attacked the rights of transgender kids, including
Arizona, Texas, and Virginia, and shared the devastating effects these
political attacks are having on their mental health and wellbeing. As
one round table participant shared, it feels scary when the politicians
elected to represent you don’t care about your wellbeing. Families
participating in today’s roundtable also highlighted that transgender
kids can thrive when parents love and affirm their transgender children,
and when transgender kids have access to the support they need at school
and in their communities. Ambassador Rice and Dr. Murthy reiterated the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to standing up for the rights
of transgender kids and their parents, and to challenging state laws
that harm transgender kids. They also thanked the families for their
unwavering advocacy and bravery in challenging these discriminatory
laws.
