title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Speaker McCarthy\u2019\
  s\_Proposal"
---
 
Yesterday, Speaker McCarthy sided with the extreme MAGA wing of his
conference and released a blueprint to devastate hard-working American
families. MAGA House Republicans are holding the American economy
hostage in order to take a hatchet to programs Americans rely on every
day to make ends meet.

Every House Republican who votes for this bill is voting to cut
education, veterans medical care, cancer research, meals on wheels, food
safety, and law enforcement. To offshore American manufacturing and kill
good-paying jobs. To take health care away from millions of Americans
and threaten food assistance for hundreds of thousands of older people.
To increase energy bills and raise taxes for hard-working families. To
slash programs hard-working Americans depend on even as they protect
wealthy tax cheats and continue to push tax giveaways for the wealthiest
and big corporations.

That stands in stark contrast with President Biden’s Budget, which
Invests in America, lowers costs for hardworking families, and cuts the
deficit by asking the super-wealthy and largest corporations to pay
their fair share. House Republicans must avoid default and stop playing
economic brinkmanship with the American people’s livelihoods and
retirements. The American people have made clear which economic vision
they support.
