Today, we pause to remember the lives lost during
the *Meds Yeghern*—the Armenian genocide— and renew our pledge to never
forget.

On April 24, 1915, Ottoman authorities arrested Armenian intellectuals
and community leaders in Constantinople—the start of
a systematic campaign of violence against the Armenian community. In the
years that followed, one and a half million Armenians were deported,
massacred, or marched to their deaths—a tragedy that forever
affected generations of Armenian families. 

As we join nations around the world in remembering this painful
history, we also reflect on the resilience and resolve of the
Armenian people. So many of those who survived were forced to begin new
lives in new lands—including the United States. Here and around the
world, the Armenian people have met the evil of hate with hope. They
rebuilt their communities. They nurtured their families and preserved
their culture. They strengthened our nation. They
also told their stories—and those of their ancestors—to remember and to
ensure that genocide like the one that happened 108 years ago is
never again repeated.  

Today, let us renew this pledge. Let us recommit to speaking out against
hate, standing up for human rights, and preventing atrocities. And
together, let us redouble our efforts to forge a better future—one
where all people can live with dignity, security, and respect.
