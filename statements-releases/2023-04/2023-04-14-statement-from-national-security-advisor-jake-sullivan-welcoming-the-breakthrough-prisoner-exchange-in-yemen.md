title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Welcoming the Breakthrough\
  \ Prisoner Exchange in\_Yemen"
---
 
The United States welcomes the exchange of nearly 900 prisoners across
both sides of the conflict today in Yemen. This breakthrough prisoner
exchange is being overseen by the ICRC and was the result of many months
of constructive engagement and mediation overseen by the UN’s Special
Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg. The United States is proud to support
this UN-led engagement, and we will continue to do all we can to help
consolidate the truce that’s now been in effect for over one year,
helping to set the conditions for a more enduring peace. The past year
in Yemen has been the quietest since the war began, saving thousands of
Yemeni lives and allowing for vast increases in humanitarian assistance,
fuel imports, and civilian flights to and from Sanaa. Building on the
prisoner exchange today, we encourage all parties to further consolidate
these positive trends and ultimately forge a diplomatic resolution to
the conflict.
