title: "Statement from White\_House Communications Director Ben LaBolt on Cut Growth\
  \ Act Overnight\_Deals"
---
 
Speaker McCarthy has cut a deal with the most extreme MAGA elements of
his party to accelerate taking food assistance from hundreds of
thousands of older Americans and to carve out one industry from his
draconian cuts without making a single change to provisions that will
strip away health care services for veterans, cut access to Meals on
Wheels, eliminate health care coverage for millions of Americans, and
ship manufacturing jobs overseas. House Republicans are selling out
hard-working Americans in order to defend their top priority: restoring
the Trump tax cuts for the wealthiest and corporations at a cost of over
$3 trillion. President Biden will never sacrifice opportunity and
economic security for working and middle-class families in order to pay
for tax cuts for the wealthiest and corporations. Budgets are a
statement of values â€” and House Republicans have made clear who they are
fighting for.
