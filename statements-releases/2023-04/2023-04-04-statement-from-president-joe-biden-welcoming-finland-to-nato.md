title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Welcoming Finland to\_NATO"
---
 
Today, I am proud to welcome Finland as NATO’s 31<sup>st</sup> Ally.   
   
Seventy-four years ago today—as the United States and 11 other nations
came together to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—President
Truman said, “if there is anything inevitable in the future, it is the
will of the people of the world for freedom and for peace.” Today, that
will is stronger than ever with the addition of Finland to NATO.  
   
In May 2022, Finland and Sweden applied for NATO membership. Both
countries are strong democracies with highly capable militaries, who
share our values and vision for the world.  Less than a year later, we
are welcoming Finland as a member—the fastest ratification process in
NATO’s modern history. I look forward to welcoming Sweden as a NATO
member as soon as possible, and encourage Turkiye and Hungary to
conclude their ratification processes without delay.  
   
When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of
Ukraine, he thought he could divide Europe and NATO. He was wrong.
Today, we are more united than ever. And together—strengthened by our
newest Ally Finland—we will continue to preserve transatlantic security,
defend every inch of NATO territory, and meet any and all challenges we
face.
