***The First Lady Continues “EGGucation” Theme for Easter Egg Roll
with*** ***Fun Learning Activities Filling the South*** ***Lawn on April
10, 2023***

The White House announced today the full program of activities for the
2023 White House Easter Egg Roll, a tradition dating back to 1878.  A
teacher for more than 30 years, First Lady Jill Biden is continuing her
theme of “EGGucation” for the event held on April 10, 2023, transforming
the South Lawn and Ellipse into a school community, full of fun
educational activities for children of all ages to enjoy.   
   
In addition to the time-honored traditions of rolling and hunting eggs,
this year’s White House Easter “EGGucation” Roll will also feature a
School House Activity Area, Reading Nook, Talent Show, Field Trip to the
Farm, Picture Day, a Physical “EGGucation” Zone, a Snack Time Tent and
more. In a nod to the First Lady’s “EGGucation” theme, NASA sent one of
the wooden Official White House Easter Eggs up to the International
Space Station, where astronauts could demonstrate the laws of gravity to
students everywhere. Videos of the Official White House Easter Egg in
space will be available on the White House’s social media platforms
leading up to the event.* *

In total, approximately 30,000 people will take part in this year’s
Easter “EGGucation” Roll, including thousands of military and veteran
families, caregivers, and survivors. Families of the U.S.S. *Delaware*
and U.S.S. *Gabrielle Giffords*, the U.S. Naval vessels for which the
First Lady is the sponsor, are among those invited to attend. Tickets
for the general public were distributed to guests from all across the
country through an online public lottery. The American Egg Board is
continuing its 45-year legacy of participation in the event and support
of the Egg Roll.   

This year’s event will be broken into nine sessions, beginning at 7:00
AM ET and ending at 7:00 PM ET.  Follow along with the White House
Easter “EGGucation” Roll activities with \#EasterEggRoll and
\#EGGucation, and the official @White House, @POTUS, @FLOTUS social
media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

This event will be open to pre-credentialed media. For interested media
