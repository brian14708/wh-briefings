Jill and I extend our best wishes to Muslim communities across the
country and around the world as you celebrate Eid al-Fitr and conclude
the holy month of Ramadan.  
   
With the sighting of the crescent moon, Eid al-Fitr is a festive
celebration where Muslims feast after the holy month of fasting,
decorate their homes, give gifts to loved ones, wear new clothes, and
visit family and friends. I am moved by the generosity that is shown
from families that can provide food and give charity to those in need
through Zakat-al-Fitr.  
   
Eid al-Fitr marks the completion of a holy month dedicated to devotion,
charity, and reflection—a time when we also remember Muslim communities
around the world that are enduring conflict, poverty, hunger, and
disease, and those that are displaced from their homes. As we celebrate
our blessings this Eid, let us also recommit ourselves to the timeless
work of building peace and standing up for the rights and dignity of all
people. My Administration is also committed to addressing all forms of
hate, including Islamophobia. This is why I established an interagency
task force with senior government officials to tackle this and related
challenges and encourage every American to build a more inclusive
nation.  
  
We are proud to celebrate Eid al-Fitr at the White House again this year
to honor inspiring Muslim Americans who are making contributions across
our country. They are in laboratories and on factory floors, working to
create and manufacture cutting edge technologies and initiatives to
build a future made in America. They are artists and caregivers, adding
to the beautiful mosaic of our nation’s creativity and compassion. They
are teachers and firefighters and community members, pioneering efforts
to build greater understanding and unity across our country. They are
athletes, journalists, comedians, academics, proud members of our
military—and so many other parts of what makes up America’s fabric.  
  
To all celebrating, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a happy and
blessed Eid al-Fitr. Eid Mubarak!
