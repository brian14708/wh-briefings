National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud of Saudi Arabia today.  They
discussed a number of global and regional matters, to include ongoing
diplomacy related to ending the war in Yemen.  Mr. Sullivan highlighted
the remarkable progress in Yemen over the past year, during which
fighting has nearly ceased under a UN-mediated truce.  He welcomed Saudi
Arabia’s extraordinary efforts to pursue a more comprehensive roadmap
for ending the war and offered full U.S. support for those efforts,
noting that Special Envoy Tim Lenderking will be in the region over the
coming days.  Mr. Sullivan and Crown Prince Salman also discussed
broader trends toward de-escalation in the region, while underscoring
the need to maintain deterrence against threats from Iran and
elsewhere.  Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed President Biden’s unwavering
commitment to ensure Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon.  Mr.
Sullivan and Crown Prince Salman committed to stay in regular contact
and to accelerate contact between the Saudi and U.S. national security
teams on issues including the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
Investment (PGII), clean energy cooperation, and development and
investment in cutting-edge Open Radio Access Network (O-Ran) 5G and 6G
technologies.
