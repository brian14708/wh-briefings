title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Last Night\u2019s Gun\_Violence"
---
 
This morning, our nation is once again grieving for at least four
Americans tragically killed at a teen’s birthday party in Dadeville,
Alabama as well as two others killed last night in a crowded public park
in Louisville. Jill and I are praying for their families, and for the
many others injured and fighting for their lives in the wake of this
weekend’s gun violence.   
   
What has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party
without fear? When parents have to worry every time their kids walk out
the door to school, to the movie theater, or to the park?  
   
Guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are
rising – not declining.  
   
This is outrageous and unacceptable. Americans agree and want lawmakers
to act on commonsense gun safety reforms. Instead, this past week
Americans saw national Republican elected leaders stand alongside the
NRA in a race to the bottom on dangerous laws that further erode gun
safety. Our communities need and deserve better.   
   
I commend Tennessee Governor Bill Lee for signing an Executive Order to
expand background checks and calling on the Tennessee statehouse to pass
a red flag law. I hope more Republican officials will follow suit and
take action.   
   
I stand ready, as I always have been, to work across the aisle in good
faith on federal legislation that will save lives. It is within
Congress’ power to require safe storage of firearms, require background
checks for all gun sales, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from
liability, and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines – and
this should happen without delay.
