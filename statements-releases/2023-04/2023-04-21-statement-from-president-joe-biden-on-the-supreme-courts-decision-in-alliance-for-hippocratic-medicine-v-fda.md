title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in\
  \ Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v.\_FDA"
---
 
Today, the Supreme Court granted the Department of Justice’s emergency
stay application in *Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA*,
preventing a lower court decision from going into effect that would have
undermined FDA’s medical judgment and put women’s health at risk.

As a result of the Supreme Court’s stay, mifepristone remains available
and approved for safe and effective use while we continue this fight in
the courts. I continue to stand by FDA’s evidence-based approval of
mifepristone, and my Administration will continue to defend FDA’s
independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide
range of prescription drugs.

The stakes could not be higher for women across America. I will continue
to fight politically-driven attacks on women’s health. But let’s be
clear – the American people must continue to use their vote as their
voice, and elect a Congress who will pass a law restoring the
protections of *Roe v Wade*.
