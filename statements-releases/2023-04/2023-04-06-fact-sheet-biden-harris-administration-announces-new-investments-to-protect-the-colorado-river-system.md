*President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda is Enhancing Drought
Resilience and Strengthening Water Security in the West*

The Biden-Harris Administration is leading a whole-of-government effort
to make Western communities more resilient to climate change and the
ongoing megadrought by harnessing the full resources of the President’s
historic Investing in America agenda. The Inflation Reduction Act and
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law together include $15.4 billion to enhance
the West’s resilience to drought, the largest investment in climate
resilience in our nation’s history.

This week, senior officials from the White House and the Department of
the Interior traveled to Arizona, California, Colorado, and Nevada to
highlight the Administration’s unprecedented investments in drought
resilience and close collaboration with Colorado River Basin states,
Tribes, water managers, farmers, irrigators, and other stakeholders.

The Administration is announcing new investments for water-saving
projects and other conservation efforts in the Colorado River Basin that
will immediately yield hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water
savings. These water savings will grow rapidly in the years ahead as
additional, longer-term water efficiency infrastructure and resilience
strategies come online:

-   **Up to $233 million in water conservation funding for the Gila
    River Indian Community,** including $83 million for a water pipeline
    project that will reuse approximately 20,000 acre-feet of water per
    year and help shore up elevations at Lake Mead. An additional $50
    million from the Inflation Reduction Act through Bureau of
    Reclamation’s Lower Colorado River Basin System Conservation and
    Efficiency Program will also save 125,000 acre-feet of water this
    year and provide similar investment and water saving opportunities
    in 2024 and 2025 for the benefit of the Colorado River System.
-   **Up to $36 million for water conservation in the Coachella
    Valley.** The Bureau of Reclamation’s Lower Colorado River Basin
    System Conservation and Efficiency Program, funded through the
    Inflation Reduction Act, will be entering into an $12 million
    agreement in the coming weeks with the Coachella Valley Water
    District to conserve 30,000 acre-feet of water in Lake Mead this
    year and will provide similar investment and water saving
    opportunities in 2024 and 2025.
-   **$20 million for four small surface water storage and groundwater
    storage projects in California and Utah,** **including one near the
    Salton Sea.** Funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these
    projects are essential tools for stretching limited water supplies
    and increasing conservation in the Colorado River Basin. This
    includes $9.5 million to maximize the Imperial Irrigation District’s
    water management efficiency within California’s Imperial Valley and
    $4.7 million to Washington County, Utah.
-   **Over $54 million for repairs to aging infrastructure to improve
    water delivery, including $8.3 million for the Imperial Dam.**
    Funding announced this week from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    will go to 14 projects in the Colorado River System in fiscal year
    2023 to improve water conveyance and storage, increase safety,
    improve hydropower generation, and provide water treatment through
    the Bureau of Reclamation.
-   **Expanded drought-focused outreach and technical assistance to
    communities in the Colorado River Basin.** In the coming weeks,
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leadership will convene the
    environmental and infrastructure Secretaries from all seven Colorado
    River Basin states to discuss strategies to maximize long-term water
    savings. EPA will also leverage its network of regional
    Environmental Finance Centers, the Creating Resilient Water
    Utilities initiative, and other technical assistance efforts to
    expand targeted outreach and enhance federal-state collaboration.

The Colorado River Basin provides water for more than 40 million
Americans, fuels hydropower resources in eight states, supports
agriculture and agricultural communities across the West, and is a
crucial resource for 30 Tribal Nations. Despite recent heavy rain and
snow, the historic 23-year drought has led to record low water levels at
Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

The Administration is deploying these resources and more to protect the
stability and sustainability of the Colorado River System now and into
the future by:

-   **Immediately reducing water demand** throughout the Colorado River
    System through incentives for voluntary water conservation;
-   **Maximizing water resources** by investing in infrastructure
    upgrades and long-term strategies to improve water efficiency,
    desalination, reuse, storage, and recycling; and,
-   **Protecting the Colorado River Basin’s communities for the long
    term,** including farmers, ranchers, Tribal Nations, rural
    communities, and cities that will continue to face the impacts of
    drought and climate change.

**<u>Support to Immediately Reduce Water Demand in the Colorado River
Basin</u>**  
President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is supporting voluntary water
conservation measures to immediately reduce water demand throughout the
Colorado River System. Ongoing investments from the Inflation Reduction
Act’s $4.6 billion for drought resilience and other efforts to support
short-term conservation include:

-   **Lower Colorado River Basin System Conservation and Efficiency
    Program Funding to Immediately Reduce Water Use:** In addition to
    the Coachella Valley and Gila River Indian Community agreements
    announced today, the Bureau of Reclamation this spring will announce
    [additional agreements for short-term water
    reduction](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-steps-drought-mitigation-funding-inflation)
    by Colorado River water delivery contract or entitlement holders in
    the Lower Basin that mitigate drought, protect important natural
    resources, and ensure a reliable source of water and power.
-   **Up to 1 Million Acre-feet of Water Conservation in the Imperial
    Valley:** The Bureau of Reclamation’s Lower Colorado River Basin
    System Conservation and Efficiency Program, funded through the
    Inflation Reduction Act, is working with the Imperial Irrigation
    District on an agreement to conserve 250,000 acre-feet of water per
    year in 2023 through 2026 for the benefit of the Colorado River
    System.
-   **Upper Basin System Conservation Pilot Program:** The Bureau of
    Reclamation is making available [up to $125
    million](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-delivers-728-million-historic-investments-address-western#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20As%20part%20of%20the,support%20water%20conservation%20in%20the)
    to support the relaunch of a System Conservation Pilot Program, a
    voluntary conservation program in the Upper Colorado River Basin.
    The Upper Colorado River Commission is currently reviewing 2023
    applications.

**<u>Infrastructure Upgrades and Strategies for Mid- and Long-Term
Conservation</u>**  
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $8.3 billion
for the Bureau of Reclamation’s water infrastructure programs. These
investments and other resources, including from the Inflation Reduction
Act, are supporting infrastructure upgrades and other long-term
strategies to improve water efficiency, reuse, storage, and recycling.
Initiatives to make scarce water supplies go further include:

-   **WaterSMART Program**: Interior’s WaterSMART Initiative is
    investing over $427 million for 127 projects across all seven
    Colorado River Basin states in fiscal year 2022 to help farmers and
    ranchers conserve water and build drought resilience in their
    communities. WaterSMART partners with the Department of
    Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service to coordinate
    investments in [priority
    areas](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs-initiatives/eqip-watersmart/priority-areas)
    and help accelerate water conservation in individual communities to
    make a bigger impact where it is needed most.
-   **Lower Colorado River Basin System Conservation and Efficiency
    Program Funding for Long-term Water Conservation:** The Bureau of
    Reclamation will announce this spring that it is accepting proposals
    for long-term system efficiency improvements that will result in
    multi-year water conservation in the Lower Basin.
-   **Salton Sea Restoration:** The Inflation Reduction Act is providing
    [$250
    million](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/inflation-reduction-act-funds-landmark-agreements-accelerate-salton-sea-restoration)
    to restore California’s largest lake, the Salton Sea, and help
    maintain water levels at Lake Mead. Exposed lakebed is contributing
    to harmful dust emissions in the surrounding communities and
    reducing important environmental habitat for wildlife.
-   **Upgrades to Aging Infrastructure:** In addition to the $54 million
    for repairs to aging infrastructure announced this week, Interior
    has already invested $19.3 million in critically-needed upgrades to
    aging water infrastructure in the Colorado River Basin. This
    includes repairs to improve water supplies and delivery systems,
    including over $5 million for canal lining in western Colorado.
-   **Water Recycling:** Interior has invested $281 million in 21 water
    recycling projects in Colorado River Basin states through the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These projects will advance drought
    resilience and are expected to increase annual capacity by about
    172,000 acre-feet of water.
-   **Drought Resiliency Projects:** Interior has invested $71 million
    in 32 drought resiliency projects in Colorado River Basin states.
    These projects will help bring clean, reliable drinking water to
    communities across the West through investments in innovative
    drought resilience efforts, such as groundwater storage, rainwater
    harvesting, aquifer recharge, water reuse, ion exchange treatment,
    and other methods to stretch existing water supplies.
-   **Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds:** Since
    2021, EPA has provided nearly $2 billion to Colorado River Basin
    states through EPA’s Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving
    Funds (SRFs), including funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law. Water systems and communities can leverage these resources to
    support projects such as aquifer storage and recovery, water reuse,
    green infrastructure, flood diversion and storage, water loss
    audits, meter replacement, groundwater replenishment, and
    nature-based solutions. EPA has released resources to help states
    and communities understand important drought-related eligibilities
    for the SRFs, including EPA’s [Drinking Water
    SRF](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-05/Addressing%20and%20Mitigating%20Drought%20with%20the%20DWSRF-May2022.pdf),
    [Clean Water
    SRF](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-08/Funding%20Drought%20Resiliency%20Projects%20with%20the%20CWSRF.pdf),
    and [Water
    Reuse](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/documents/addressing_water_reuse_with_the_dwsrf.pdf).  
-   **Leveraging EPA Financing for Drought Resilience:** EPA’s [Water
    Infrastructure Finance and Innovation (WIFIA)
    program](https://www.epa.gov/wifia) has helped finance 17 projects
    leveraging over $5 billion for water infrastructure improvements
    that address drought resilience and water supply in Colorado River
    Basin states. These projects include efforts to recycle wastewater,
    increase water storage, install water meters, and prevent saltwater
    intrusion in aquifers. The program is currently reviewing
    applications to support another seven drought-related initiatives
    totaling an additional $1.3 billion and will open additional funding
    opportunities this summer.
-   **Initiatives to Enhance Water Efficiency:** EPA’s WaterSense
    partnership, a voluntary program to help households save water, is
    carrying out targeted efforts within Colorado River Basin states to
    advance its Labeled Homes program and reduce household water
    consumption. Based on some studies, WaterSense labeled homes can
    reduce household water use by up to 45 percent.
-   **Climate-Smart Agriculture:** The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) is accepting applications for [$850
    million](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/02/13/biden-harris-administration-announces-availability-inflation)
    in fiscal year 2023 funding opportunities for producers in Western
    states and across the nation who want to participate in Natural
    Resources Conservation Service conservation programs and adopt
    climate-smart agriculture practices. This is part of a $19.5 billion
    investment through the Inflation Reduction Act for climate-smart
    agriculture. These investments provide resources for farmers,
    ranchers and forest owners to implement conservation practices for
    their land.

**<u>Collaborative Planning to Protect Communities Now and into the
Future</u>**  
As the Biden-Harris Administration deploys unprecedented investments to
increase water security and resilience throughout the Colorado River
Basin, the Administration is also working collaboratively with all
stakeholders to ensure the Colorado River Basin’s farmers, ranchers,
Tribal Nations, rural communities, and cities have the tools and
resources they need to manage the impacts of drought and changing
climate conditions today and into the future. These efforts include:

-   **Updated Operating Guidelines for Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams:**
    Interior is working to update the operating guidelines for the
    Colorado River System to address ongoing water scarcity and to
    ensure continued water deliveries and hydropower production.
    Interior will soon be inviting public input on options for operating
    the Colorado River System beginning in August 2023. This plan will
    incorporate the ideas and input of states, Tribes, and stakeholders;
    the latest science and hydrological forecasting; and the expected
    water savings and efficiency improvements that will come from the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s unprecedented investments in water
    security.
-   **Support for Farmers and Ranchers:** Secretary of Agriculture Tom
    Vilsack [convened the leaders of the seven basin states Departments
    of
    Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/03/23/secretary-vilsack-convenes-state-agriculture-leaders-colorado-river)
    last month to discuss the challenges faced by farmers and ranchers
    in the Colorado River Basin and USDA resources and programs
    available to mitigate the impact of historic megadrought. In 2022,
    producers in the seven basin states have received [over $1.8
    billion](https://www.rma.usda.gov/) in federal crop insurance
    indemnity payments due to drought and drought-related impacts. USDA
    has also provided [nearly $680
    million](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/2022/fsa_erp_factsheet_2022_051222_final_v2.pdf)
    in Emergency Relief Program funding for producers impacted by
    natural disasters in the seven Colorado River Basin states,
    including drought, in 2020 and 2021. Through the Emergency Livestock
    Relief Program, USDA has provided nearly $180.9 million in payments
    for livestock producers impacted by drought in 2020 and 2021. USDA’s
    Farm Service Agency and Risk Management Agency are also working to
    implement an additional $3.7 billion in disaster relief for 2022
    disasters, which includes drought impacts.
-   **Resilient Water Utilities:** EPA is working with water utilities
    across the Colorado River Basin to ensure continued water supplies
    into the future. EPA has provided technical assistance and held
    workshops to support water systems working to build drought
    resilience into their operations and capital planning efforts. EPA
    also offers [community level
    training](https://www.epa.gov/waterutilityresponse/get-training-your-water-utility-flood-or-drought-resilience),
    [case
    studies](https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=22ce8bf3bcd742b68101d679828a00d7),
    and resources to help state and utility partners such as an
