title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Passage of Florida\u2019\
  s Abortion\_Ban"
---
 
Today, Florida’s Republican supermajority-controlled legislature sent an
extreme and dangerous new abortion ban to Governor DeSantis’s desk for
signature. The ban flies in the face of fundamental freedoms and is out
of step with the views of the vast majority of the people of Florida and
of all the United States.  
   
This ban would prevent four million Florida women of reproductive age
from accessing abortion care after six weeks — before many women even
know they’re pregnant. This ban would also impact the nearly 15 million
women of reproductive age who live in abortion-banning states throughout
the South, many of whom have previously relied on travel to Florida as
an option to access care.  
   
At every opportunity following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn
*Roe v. Wade*, from the Kansas ballot initiative in August, to five
abortion ballot initiatives in November, to last week’s elections in
Wisconsin, the message has been clear: Americans demand the freedom to
make their own decisions about their own bodies without government
interference.  
   
Despite this, Republican elected officials continue their work to
dismantle our fundamental freedoms, including through attempts to ban
abortion nationwide. President Biden and his Administration stand with
women and physicians—and we will continue to fight to protect access to
abortion and defend reproductive rights.
