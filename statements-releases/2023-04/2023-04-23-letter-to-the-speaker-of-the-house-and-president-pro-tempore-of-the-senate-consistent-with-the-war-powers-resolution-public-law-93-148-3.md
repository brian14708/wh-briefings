Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
At my direction, United States Armed Forces personnel have conducted an
operation to evacuate United States personnel and others from Khartoum,
Sudan, in response to the deteriorating security situation in Sudan.  To
conduct and support this operation, United States Armed Forces personnel
with appropriate combat equipment deployed to Djibouti, Ethiopia,
and Sudan.  United States Armed Forces personnel will remain deployed in
Djibouti to protect United States personnel and others until
the security situation no longer requires their presence, and additional
forces are prepared to deploy to the region if required.

I directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect
United States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of
United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant
to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive
and to conduct United States foreign relations.

I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions.

                             Sincerely,   
  
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
