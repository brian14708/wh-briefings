title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on March Jobs\_Report"
---
 
This is a good jobs report for hard-working Americans. Today’s report
shows that we continue to face economic challenges from a position of
strength, with the economy adding 236,000 jobs last month and the
unemployment rate at 3.5%. My economic agenda has powered an historic
economic recovery. We’ve created 12.6 million jobs since I took office.
The unemployment rate is close to the lowest it has been in more than 50
years and a record low for African Americans. Thanks to the policies we
have put in place, the recovery is creating good jobs that you can raise
a family on, which is pulling more Americans into the labor force. In
fact, the share of working age Americans in the labor force is at a 15
year high.  
   
But there is more work to do. My Administration is working each day to
lower costs for families and to make our economy even stronger, now and
for the long term, with investments in infrastructure, innovation, and
clean energy. Just this week, because of my agenda, companies announced
new manufacturing investments in Georgia, New Mexico, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. My Investing in
America agenda is building an economy that benefits hard-working
Americans in every community across the country, not just those at the
top.  
   
Extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress, on the other hand, are threatening
to wreak havoc on our economy with debt limit brinkmanship. Their
extreme agenda would send the unprecedented investments we’ve made here
in America – along with the jobs that come with it – overseas. And it’s
all to pay for even more giveaways to the wealthiest Americans and
largest corporations. Make no mistake, I will stop those efforts to put
our economy at risk and take us back to the failed policies of the past.
