Investing in America Tour.

Memorial Bridge which connects Virginia to the nation’s capital and
announced $300 million from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure

members of his Administration held over 50 events across nearly 30
states and territories to highlight how President Biden’s policies are
spurring private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments,
driving small business growth, and investing in infrastructure and
