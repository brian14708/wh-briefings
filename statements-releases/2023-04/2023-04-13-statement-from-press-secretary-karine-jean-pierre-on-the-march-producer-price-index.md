title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the March Producer Price\_\
  Index"
---
 
Today’s report is further evidence that we are making progress bringing
inflation down. The annual inflation rate for producers is 2.7 percent —
the lowest rate in more than two years. On average, prices set by
businesses actually fell last month. This follows yesterday’s news that
inflation for consumers is down substantially from its peak last summer.
There is more work to do, but this is important progress for our economy
and for American families.
