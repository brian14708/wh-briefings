title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on New Steps to Punish and Deter Wrongful\
  \ Detention and\_Hostage-Taking"

Today, I am proud to announce that my Administration will for the first
time deploy a new tool to impose severe economic costs on governments
and groups that hold hostage or wrongfully detain Americans around the
world.  
  
Since the first day of my Administration, we have prioritized the safe
return of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. We have
now brought home dozens of Americans, many of whom had been held since
before I took office. Still, too many are suffering and separated from
their loved ones—including Americans who remain wrongfully detained in
Russia, Iran, and elsewhere. We remain unflinching in our efforts to
keep faith with them and their families, to pursue new ways to bring
them home until we succeed, and to prevent this from happening to other
families in the future.  
  
Today, the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury have
announced the U.S. Government’s first-ever sanctions against actors for
engaging in the wrongful detention of Americans.  These sanctions
against four individuals and two security services in Russia and Iran
mean that all of the designees’ property and interests in property in
the possession or control of U.S. persons are now blocked.  These steps
to cut off these actors from the legitimate financial system make use of
the Executive Order that I issued last summer that, itself, built on the
2020 Hostage Recovery and Hostage Taking Accountability Act. That law
passed in large part due to the perseverance of the families and so many
others in this community who have worked to turn pain into purpose.  
  
Today – and every day – our message to Russia, Iran, and the world is
holding hostage or wrongfully detaining Americans is unacceptable.
Release them immediately.
