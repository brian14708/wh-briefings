This $1.5 billion investment will bring down costs, strengthen our
electric vehicle supply chain, help rebuild American manufacturing, and
create economic opportunity for the working families of California. And
it will put more electric vehicles on the road, a priority I have worked
on since I served in the United States Senate. All of this was made
possible by our Administration’s Investing in America agenda.
Unfortunately, House Republicans are working to undo our progress. They
want to defund American manufacturing and ship jobs overseas. President
Biden and I will never let that happen.
