title: "Joint Statement from the Presidents of the United\_States of America and the\
  \ Republic of Korea on the Identification of Medal of Honor Recipient from Korean\_\
  War"

The United States of America and Republic of Korea are honored to
announce that Army Corporal Luther H. Story, of Buena Vista, Georgia,
killed during the Korean War and missing for 73 years, has been
accounted for.   
   
In late August 1950, U.S. forces in Korea were primarily located along
the Pusan Perimeter, a defensive formation around the towns of Pusan and
Yeongsan, South Korea, along the eastern shore of the Naktong River.  On
August 31, members of A and B Companies of the 1st Battalion, 9th
Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division took the brunt of large-scale
attack by the North Korean People’s Army.  A member of A Company,
Corporal Story displayed conspicuous bravery during intense combat on
September 1.   
   
Corporal Story was awarded the nation’s highest award for his heroic
actions that day.  Within his Medal of Honor Citation are statements of
his gallantry: “he fearlessly stood in the middle of the road, throwing
grenades into the truck.  Out of grenades, he crawled to his squad,
gathered up additional grenades, and again attacked the vehicle . . .
During the withdrawal the company was attacked by such superior numbers
that it was forced to deploy in a rice field . . . \[he\] was wounded in
this action, but, disregarding his wounds, rallied the men about him and
repelled the attack.  Realizing that his wounds would hamper his
comrades, he refused to retire to the next position but remained to
cover the company’s withdrawal. When last seen he was firing every
weapon available and fighting off another hostile assault.”  
   
In the weeks and months following the September 1 battle, Corporal
Story’s remains could not be located or identified nor was he recorded
as being taken prisoner.  On January 16, 1956, after he could not be
associated with any of the remains exchanged by both sides during
Operation GLORY in 1954, Corporal Story was declared unrecoverable.  
   
In June 2021, as part of the plan to disinter 652 Korean War Unknowns
from the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (NMCP), the Defense
POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) inspected Unknown X-260 Tanggok, a set
of remains recovered near Sangde-po, South Korea.    
Scientists from the DPAA used dental and anthropological analyses while
scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used
mitochondrial DNA analysis to identify these remains as Corporal
Story.  
   
General of the Army Omar Bradley presented Corporal Story’s father the
Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the Pentagon on June 21, 1951.  He is
survived by his niece, Mrs. Judy Wade of Americus, Georgia, whose mother
was his younger sister.    
   
The supreme sacrifice and heroism of Corporal Luther Story is
illustrative of the freedom, security, and prosperity the South Korean
people have today.  
   
Both countries will continue making every effort to identify service
members missing in action like Army Corporal Story. On this
70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Korean War Armistice and the U.S.-ROK
alliance, our two countries take this joint statement as an opportunity
to reaffirm our respect and gratitude for the courageous acts of our
service members in defense of our freedom, values and democracy.
