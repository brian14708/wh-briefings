title: "Readout from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Senior Official Travel to\
  \ Saudi\_Arabia"

NSC Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk and
Special Presidential Coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Energy
Security Amos Hochstein visited Saudi Arabia April 13 and 14, joined for
Yemen-related engagements by Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking.    
   
They held constructive talks with Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Mohammed bin Salman, Minister of Energy AbdulAziz bin Salman, Minister
of Defense Khalid bin Salman, Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, and
other senior Saudi officials.  Their discussions focused on the
critical progress being made toward a diplomatic resolution to the
conflict in Yemen, which President Biden has long prioritized.  Both
sides welcomed their close coordination that supported a UN-led truce
one year ago and that has helped forge conditions for a more enduring
peace.  The U.S. side confirmed its support for the defense of Saudi
Arabia against threats from Yemen and elsewhere.   
   
They also discussed a range of global matters and the establishment of a
more integrated, stable and prosperous Middle East region, including
through investments in the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
Investment (PGII) and Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) projects to
support accessible 5G and 6G technologies.  The two sides committed to
remain in regular contact over the coming period.
