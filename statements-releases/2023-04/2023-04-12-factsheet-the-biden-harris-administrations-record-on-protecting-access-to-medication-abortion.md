title: "FACTSHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Record on Protecting\
  \ Access to Medication\_Abortion"
---
 
Protecting access to reproductive health care has been a priority since
the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, made even more urgent
by the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. The President
and Vice President are focused on ensuring access to mifepristone, which
the FDA first approved as safe and effective to end early pregnancy more
than twenty years ago and which accounts for more than half of abortions
in the United States.  

Despite this decades-long safety record, a single court in Texas has
taken the dangerous step of attempting to override FDA’s approval of
medication abortion—which is used not only for abortion but also for
helping women manage miscarriages. If this decision stands, it will put
women’s health at risk and undermine FDA’s ability to ensure patients
have access to safe and effective medications when they need them.

This lawsuit is part of broader efforts to ban abortion nationwide and
to prevent women from making their own decisions about their own bodies
without government interference.

The Administration is fighting this ruling in the courts, and stands by
FDA’s scientific and evidence-based judgment that mifepristone is safe
and effective. Shortly after the ruling last Friday, the Justice
Department filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth Circuit and sought a
stay of the injunction pending appeal. A wide range of stakeholders,
including FDA scholars, leading medical organizations, and
pharmaceutical companies, have expressed their support for maintaining
access to this FDA-approved medication.

In addition to defending in court FDA’s ability to approve safe and
effective medications, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken the
following steps to protect access to medication abortion:

-   **Elevating Medication Abortion in the Administration’s Response to
    the *Dobbs *Decision. **On the day of the Supreme Court’s decision
    to overturn *Roe v. Wade* in June 2022, the President identified
    preserving access to medication abortion as one of two key
    priorities to guide the Administration’s immediate response to the
    ruling. President
    Biden [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-actions-in-light-of-todays-supreme-court-decision-on-dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/) the
    Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to
    ensure that mifepristone is as widely accessible as possible in
    light of the FDA’s determination that the drug is safe and
    effective. He
    also [emphasized](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/) the
    need to protect access to medication abortion in the face of attacks
    and to stand with medical experts who have stressed that
    restrictions on medication abortion are not based in science. On the
    same day, the Attorney General [made
    clear](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s) that
    states may not ban mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortion,
    based on disagreement with the FDA’s expert judgment about its
    safety and efficacy.
-   **Issuing an Executive Order to Protect Access to Abortion,
    including Medication Abortion. **In an [Executive Order on
    Protecting Access to Reproductive
    Healthcare Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/07/08/executive-order-on-protecting-access-to-reproductive-healthcare-services/) issued
    in July 2022, President Biden reiterated the importance of
    medication abortion and directed the Secretary of HHS to identify
    potential actions to protect and expand access to abortion care,
    including medication abortion. In response, HHS developed an [action
    plan](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hhs-report-reproductive-health.pdf) to
    protect and strengthen access to reproductive care and has made
    significant progress in executing this plan and protecting access to
    care nationwide.
-   **Addressing Barriers to Accessing Care. **In his second [Executive
    Order on Securing Access to Reproductive and Other Healthcare
    Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/08/03/executive-order-on-securing-access-to-reproductive-and-other-healthcare-services/) issued
    in August 2022, President Biden addressed the challenges that women
    have faced in accessing prescription medication at pharmacies in the
    wake of *Dobbs*, including medication abortion, which is also used
    to manage miscarriages. These included reports of women of
    reproductive age being denied prescription medication at
    pharmacies—including medication that is used to treat stomach
    ulcers, lupus, arthritis, and cancer—due to concerns that these
    medications, some of which can be used in medication abortion, could
    be used to terminate a pregnancy. To help ensure access to
    medication, HHS
    issued [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/13/hhs-issues-guidance-nations-retail-pharmacies-clarifying-their-obligations-ensure-access-comprehensive-reproductive-health-care-services.html) to
    roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies to emphasize their obligations
    under federal civil rights laws to ensure access to comprehensive
    reproductive health care services.
-   **Directing Further Efforts to Ensure Safe Access to Medication
    Abortion. **On what would have been the 50th anniversary of *Roe v.
    Wade* in January 2023, President Biden issued a [Presidential
    Memorandum on Further Efforts to Protect Access to Reproductive
    Healthcare
    Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/01/22/memorandum-on-further-efforts-to-protect-access-to-reproductive-healthcare-services/) to
    further protect access to medication abortion. The Presidential
    Memorandum directed the Attorney General, the Secretary of the
    Department of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of HHS to
    consider new actions to protect the safety and security of patients,
    providers, and pharmacies who wish to legally access or provide
    mifepristone.

This Presidential Memorandum was issued in the face of attacks by state
officials to prevent women from accessing mifepristone and discourage
pharmacies from becoming certified to dispense the medication. These
attacks, and the Presidential Memorandum, followed
independent, [evidence-based
action](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/information-about-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation) taken
by FDA to allow mifepristone to continue to be prescribed by telehealth
and sent by mail as well as to enable interested pharmacies to become
certified.

-   **Engaging Medical Experts and Reproductive Rights Leaders to
    Underscore the Need for Medication Abortion. **In February 2023,
    Vice President
    Harris [convened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/24/readout-of-vice-president-harris-meeting-on-threats-to-medication-abortion/) a
    roundtable of leading medical experts and reproductive rights
    advocates to discuss how a court decision to invalidate the approval
    of mifepristone would affect patients and providers. Participants
    represented Physicians for Reproductive Health, American Medical
    Women’s Association, the Society of Family Planning, the American
    Academy of Family Physicians, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan DC,
    the National Women’s Law Center, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the
    Center for Reproductive Rights, the American College of
    Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the ACLU, and Sister Song.
