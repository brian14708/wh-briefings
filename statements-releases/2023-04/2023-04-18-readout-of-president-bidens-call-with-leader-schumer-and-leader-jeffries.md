title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with Leader Schumer and Leader\_Jeffries"
---
 
This afternoon, President Biden spoke with Leaders Schumer and Jeffries
by phone about the spring work period. They discussed Congressional
Democrats’ efforts to lower costs for hardworking families, protect
essential programs that make communities safer, and confirm the
President’s nominees.   
  
The President, Leader Schumer, and Leader Jeffries also discussed House
Republicans’ brinkmanship over default and how their recklessness could
crash the economy. President Biden, Leader Schumer, and Leader Jeffries
agree that we won’t negotiate over default and Republicans should pass a
clean bill like they did three times in the previous administration.  
  
The President told Leader Schumer and Leader Jeffries that he was ready
to have a separate negotiation over the budget once Republicans present
their plan, as has been done by both parties in Congress and the White
House in the past. His Budget cuts the deficit by nearly $3 trillion
over 10 years, asks the super-wealthy and corporations to pay their fair
share, lowers costs for hardworking families, and invests in America.
They discussed what we know about House Republicans’ extreme MAGA
spending cuts, which include devastating cuts to veterans and education,
taking food assistance and health care away from millions of people, and
sending manufacturing overseas — all just to pay for their tax cuts for
the super-wealthy and corporations.
