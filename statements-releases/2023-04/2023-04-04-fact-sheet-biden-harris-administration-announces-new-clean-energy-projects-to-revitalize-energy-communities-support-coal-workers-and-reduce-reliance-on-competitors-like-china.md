*President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda is Creating Jobs,
Lowering Costs, and Driving Historic Economic Growth and More Than $14
Billion in Federal Investments in Energy Communities  
*

Today, at a White House convening with energy communities, the
Biden-Harris Administration will announce historic new actions to create
jobs, lower costs, and invest in the energy communities that powered
this nation for generations.

President Biden came to the White House to end years of big words but
little action to help energy-producing parts of the country, who for
decades saw jobs exported out and products imported in, all while other
countries surpassed the United States in critical sectors like
infrastructure, clean energy, and semiconductors. President Biden’s
Investing in America Agenda is already turning the tide, bringing
manufacturing jobs back home and ensuring we rebuild our economy from
the bottom-up and the middle-out, not top-down, so that no community is
left behind.

The actions announced today will drive new investments in energy
communities to support their economic revitalization, strengthen
American supply chains, and help ensure coal, oil, and gas workers
benefit from the new clean energy economy.

These investments build on the more than **$14 billion** from across
federal agencies that the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power
Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization has driven to the
hardest-hit energy communities across the country. They also build on
the **more than $7.4 billion** that [companies have
invested](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/) in energy communities to
spur clean energy manufacturing, steel production, and critical minerals
processing.

The actions announced today will:

-   **Drive New Opportunities to Coal Communities.  
    **
    -   The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service
        today is releasing detailed guidance that will allow developers
        of clean energy projects and facilities to take advantage of
        **billions in bonuses on top of the investment and production
        tax credits** through the Inflation Reduction Act for locating
        projects in an energy community. These bonuses will incentivize
        more clean energy investment in energy communities, particularly
        coal communities.  
    -   As part of this release, Treasury and IRS have partnered with
        the Interagency Working Group on Energy Communities to provide a
        [searchable mapping
        tool](https://energycommunities.gov/energy-community-tax-credit-bonus/)
        that helps identify areas that may be eligible for the energy
        community bonus.  
    -   The Energy Communities IWG today is also releasing a Memorandum
        of Understanding between 11 federal agencies to work together to
        get new resources into energy communities. Agencies will support
        [Rapid Response
        Teams](https://energycommunities.gov/technical-assistance/rapid-response-teams/),
        which provide more targeted, on-the-ground assistance,
        resources, and technical guidance to communities and regions
        facing acute and unique challenges.  
    -   Additionally, the Department of Energy announced the release of
        a [Coal Power Plant Redevelopment Visualization
        Tool](https://energycommunities.gov/coal-power-plant-redevelopment-visualization-tool/)
        enabling stakeholders to identify opportunities for
        redevelopment of shuttered coal power plants and community
        reinvestment.  
    -   These multi-agency efforts demonstrate the Biden-Harris
        Administration’s whole-of-government approach to partnering with
        energy communities to build stronger local economies.  
-   **Deploy New Clean Energy Project on Mine Lands.** The Department of
    Energy announced it is making **$450 million** available through the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to advance clean energy demonstration
    projects on current and former mine land, providing new economic
    opportunities for historic coal and mining communities.
    Approximately 17,750 mine land sites are located across 1.5 million
    acres in the United States, which expose local populations to
    harmful pollutants and contaminate the air, land, and water quality
    in the surrounding areas. Repurposing this extensive area of land
    for clean energy projects is estimated to generate up to 90 GW of
    clean energy—enough to power nearly 30 million American homes.  
-   **Bring Critical Mineral Supply Chains to America.** The Department
    of Energy announced it is making **$16 million** available through
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to the University of North Dakota
    and West Virginia University to complete design studies for the
    first-ever full-scale domestic demonstration refinery that will
    extract and separate rare earth elements and other critical minerals
    from coal ash, acid mine drainage, and other mine waste. This
    project will help strengthen American supply chains, revitalize
    energy communities, and reduce reliance on competitors like China.

**<u>Today’s actions build on two years of historic investment in energy
communities through the Energy Communities IWG:  
</u>**  
Building on these historic investments, today the Energy Communities IWG
released a new public report, [***Revitalizing Energy Communities:
Two-Year Report to the
President***](https://energycommunities.gov/revitalizing-energy-communities-two-year-report/),
to mark two years of meaningful partnership with energy communities and
the Administration’s continued momentum in building a clean energy
future made in America and by American workers.

To date, the Energy Communities IWG has driven **more than $14.1
billion** in federal investment to energy communities, including $480
million in American Rescue Plan funds for economic development, $877
million for abandoned mine land reclamation, and $134 million in the
largest-ever Appalachian Regional Commission awards to coal communities.
The President’s economic agenda has also helped drive more than **$7.4
billion** in private sector investments to spur the creation and
retention of good-paying jobs, strengthen our energy security, and lower
energy costs for families. These investments include:

-   **Berkshire Hathaway Energy** recently broke ground on a $522
    million project in Jackson County, West Virginia to establish an
    aerospace manufacturing hub on the site of a former aluminum plant.
    BHE will build a new solar energy microgrid and Our Next Energy, a
    Michigan-based battery manufacturer, will build a large-scale
    battery operation that will employ about 300 people and use 100%
    renewable energy.  
-   **TerraPower** intends to invest $2 billion, in addition to $1.5
    billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and annual
    appropriations, to build an advanced nuclear reactor on a retiring
    coal plant in Kemmerer, Wyoming. This first-of-a-kind reactor will
    create an expected 2,000 construction jobs and 250 full-time jobs.  
-   **Novelis** recently started construction on its $365 million
    investment into an advanced aluminum recycling center in Todd
    County, Kentucky, that is projected to create 140 quality jobs for
    Kentucky residents.

The Energy Communities IWG maintains a searchable clearinghouse of
federal funding opportunities at
[EnergyCommunities.Gov](https://energycommunities.gov/funding-opportunities/)
which has identified **over $500 billion** in relevant or targeted
funding opportunities for energy communities – up from $38 billion in
April of 2021.
