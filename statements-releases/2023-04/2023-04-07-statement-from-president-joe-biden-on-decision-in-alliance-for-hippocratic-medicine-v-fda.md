title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Decision in Alliance for Hippocratic\
  \ Medicine v.\_FDA"
---
 
Today a single federal district judge in Texas ruled that a prescription
medication that has been available for more than 22 years, approved by
the FDA and used safely and effectively by millions of women here and
around the world, should no longer be approved in the United States. 
The Court in this case has substituted its judgment for FDA, the expert
agency that approves drugs. If this ruling were to stand, then there
will be virtually no prescription, approved by the FDA, that would be
safe from these kinds of political, ideological attacks.   
   
The prescription medication in question in this case is used for
medication abortion, and medication abortion accounts for over half the
abortions in America.  The lawsuit, and this ruling, is another
unprecedented step in taking away basic freedoms from women and putting
their health at risk.  This does not just affect women in Texas – if it
stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the
medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state.  It is
the next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican
elected officials have vowed to make law in America.  
   
My Administration will fight this ruling.  The Department of Justice has
already filed an appeal and will seek an immediate stay of the
decision.  But let’s be clear – the only way to stop those who are
committed to taking away women’s rights and freedoms in every state is
to elect a Congress who will pass a law restoring Roe versus Wade.  Vice
President Harris and I will continue to lead the fight to protect a
woman’s right to an abortion, and to make her own decisions about her
own health.  That is our commitment.
