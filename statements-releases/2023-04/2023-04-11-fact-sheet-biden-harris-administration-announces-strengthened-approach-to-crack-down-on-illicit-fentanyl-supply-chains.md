title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Strengthened Approach\
  \ to Crack Down on Illicit Fentanyl Supply\_Chains"
---
 
At a time when the global illicit fentanyl supply chain has changed how
illicit substances are produced and trafficked, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing a strengthened whole-of-government approach
to save lives by disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its
precursors into American communities.  This approach builds on the
President’s [*National Drug Control
Strategy*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/21/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-2022-national-drug-control-strategy-that-outlines-comprehensive-path-forward-to-address-addiction-and-the-overdose-epidemic/#:~:text=The%20Strategy%20focuses%20on%20two,to%20guide%20all%20these%20efforts.)
and helps deliver on his State of the Union call to beat the opioid and
overdose epidemic by cracking down on the production, sale, and
trafficking of illicit fentanyl to help save lives, protect the public
health, and improve the public safety of our communities.  
  
Less than a decade ago, the supply of illicit drugs was dominated by
plant-based drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, or illicit synthetic
stimulants, like methamphetamine. These drugs were produced in crude
labs, packaged, and then moved into the United States through an illicit
production and distribution process managed by established, hierarchical
drug trafficking organizations.  
  
Today, the drugs most responsible for killing Americans are illicit
synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its analogues, which are easier to
produce and transport and also significantly more lethal. The nature of
these drugs, and their ease of access and potency, presents a national
security, public safety, and public health threat.  While the old
trafficking structures still exist, the producers and traffickers of
these illicit synthetic drugs now regularly exploit lawful global
commercial distribution networks to sustain and enhance their illicit
business.  
  
Over the last two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized
a whole-of-government evidence-based strategy to address untreated
addiction, prevent drug deaths, and dismantle drug trafficking
production and supply chains. In close collaboration with State,
Territorial, Local, and Tribal partners, this Administration has
expanded access to prevention, harm reduction where not prohibited by
law, treatment, and recovery services; emphasized private sector
collaboration; invested significant amounts of funding for law
enforcement efforts to combat illicit fentanyl trafficking; and enabled
historic seizures of illicit fentanyl on the border. These actions have
contributed to a steady decrease or flattening in overdose deaths for
seven straight months of reporting.  
  
To build on the trend of decreasing overdose deaths, the Administration
is cracking down on illicit fentanyl supply chains by:

-   **Leading a coordinated global effort with international partners to
    disrupt the illicit synthetic drug trade**. Building on the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s work to successfully schedule nearly a
    dozen precursor chemicals with global partners through the United
    Nations’ Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the United States is building
    a global coalition to accelerate efforts against illicit synthetic
    drugs and employing bilateral and multilateral approaches to prevent
    illicit drug manufacturing, detect emerging drug threats, disrupt
    trafficking, address illicit finance, and respond to public safety
    and public health impacts. This global coalition will develop
    solutions, drive national actions, and create synergies and leverage
    among like-minded countries who agree that countering illicit
    synthetic drugs must be a global policy priority. 
-   **Strengthening coordination and information-sharing among U.S.
    intelligence and domestic law enforcement agencies.** It is
    essential to improve coordination and information/intelligence
    sharing across the Federal government and with State, Territorial,
    Local, and Tribal partners to strengthen our ongoing investigative
    and analytical efforts to target drug traffickers and dismantle
    their networks. The Biden-Harris Administration will improve
    tracking of pill presses and their spare parts, including die molds,
    used to transform powder fentanyl into pills, in collaboration with
    state and local law enforcement; strengthen Federal law enforcement
    coordination to increase seizures of bulk cash being smuggled at the
    Southwest Border; and better track and target the origins,
    shipments, and destinations of precursors and equipment used to
    produce illicit fentanyl and its analogues, including by enhancing
    collaboration across the Federal government’s targeting, screening,
    and analysis programs.
-   **Accelerating work with the private sector globally.** Illicit drug
    traffickers often use legitimate commercial enterprises to access
    significant capital resources, collaborate with raw material
    suppliers across international borders, use technology to fund and
    conduct business, and innovate production and distribution
    strategies to expand their markets. To disrupt these criminals’
    access to capital and materials, the Biden-Harris Administration is
    launching a whole-of-government effort, in partnership with the
    private sector, to strengthen cooperation with international and
    domestic express consignment carriers to interdict more illicit
    substances and production materials; educate companies on
    safeguarding against the sale and distribution of dual-use chemicals
    and equipment that could be used to produce illicit fentanyl; and
    intensify global engagement with private chemical industries.
-   **Further protect the U.S. financial system from use and abuse by
    drug traffickers**. Drug traffickers, who are primarily driven by
    profits, require significant funds to operate their illicit supply
    chains. The Biden-Harris Administration will expand its efforts to
    disrupt the illicit financial activities that fund these criminals
    by increasing accountability measures, including financial
    sanctions, on key targets to obstruct drug traffickers’ access to
    the U.S. financial system and illicit financial flows. We will also
    strengthen collaboration with international partners on illicit
    finance and anti-money laundering efforts related to drug
    trafficking.
-   **Continue to call on Congress to close legal loopholes for illicit
    synthetic drugs.**  Traffickers are continually altering the
    chemical structure of fentanyl to evade regulation and prosecution
    under the Analogue Act, sometimes with tragic results.  Congress
    temporarily closed this loophole by making all fentanyl-related
    substances Schedule I. However, this measure expires on December 31,
    2024.  The Administration continues to call on Congress to
    permanently schedule all illicitly produced fentanyl-related
    substances into Schedule I and to take other complementary actions
    to enhance public health and public safety, consistent with the
    [comprehensive proposal developed jointly in 2021 by the Department
    of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office
    of National Drug Control
    Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2021/09/02/biden-harris-administration-provides-recommendations-to-congress-on-reducing-illicit-fentanyl-related-substances/).
     

These actions build on the progress made by the Biden-Harris
Administration to reduce the supply of illicit drugs:

-   The Department of Justice-led Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task
    Forces coordinated 427 joint investigations involving fentanyl in
    Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, leading to 3,961 defendants, 3,337
    convictions, and 130 fentanyl network disruptions or dismantlements.
-   The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Operation Blue Lotus, a
    new and robust surge operation, launched on March 13<sup>th</sup> to
    target illicit fentanyl. Led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection
    (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland
    Security Investigations (HSI), and working with federal, state,
    tribal and local partners, DHS is investing additional personnel,
    technology, and other resources along the southwest border to detect
    and seize illicit fentanyl at and between ports of entry.  In its
    first week, Operation Blue Lotus stopped more than 900 pounds of
    illicit fentanyl from coming into the United States.
-   The Drug Enforcement Administration seized over 57.5 million
    fentanyl-laced, fake prescription pills and 13,740 pounds of
    fentanyl powder in calendar year 2022.
-   CBP seized 14,700 pounds of fentanyl in FY 2022, which is an
    approximate 31 percent increase from the amount seized in FY 2021
    (11,201 pounds).  
-   HSI seized more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl in FY 2022 by
    targeting the supply chains responsible for foreign-origin shipments
    of fentanyl and their precursor chemicals. 
-   The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) seized approximately 150
    percent more fentanyl in FY 2022 than the prior year.  The majority
    of these seizures were mailed domestically from the Southwest Border
    region of the United States.  USPIS has created a Southwest Border
    Initiative to stop the influx of illicit synthetic opioids smuggled
    across the U.S.-Mexico border then placed in the domestic mail
    system to be distributed within the United States.
-   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)’s
    High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program reported seizures of
    more than 26,000 pounds of fentanyl in the last year.
-   The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
    has designated nearly 100  individuals and entities for their role
    in the illicit drug trade, including trafficking fentanyl and
    precursor chemicals, pursuant to Executive Order 14059 “[Imposing
    Sanctions on Foreign Persons Involved in the Global Illicit Drug
    Trade](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27505/imposing-sanctions-on-foreign-persons-involved-in-the-global-illicit-drug-trade),”
    signed by President Biden in December 2021.  This E.O. builds on two
    decades of deliberate and impactful sanctions imposed pursuant to
    the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. These designations
    included individuals and entities tied to major trafficking
    organizations such as the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation
    cartels, along with their key global enablers and facilitators.
-   The Department of State has rallied the global community at the UN
    Commission on Narcotic Drugs to place international controls on 14
    key fentanyl analogues and precursors since 2016, leading efforts
    around the world to stop the spread of illicit synthetic opioids
    through more consistent controls by foreign governments.

In addition to these actions to reduce the supply of drugs, the
Administration is accelerating public health initiatives to save lives,
for example by:

-   Equitably expanding availability and access to opioid overdose
    reversal products, including the first nonprescription drug approval
    of naloxone, and delivering more life-saving naloxone to communities
    hit hard by fentanyl.
-   Launching a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers
    of fentanyl and how naloxone can save their lives.
-   Working to close the addiction treatment gap by working with medical
    professionals to make prescribing proven treatments for opioid use
    disorder part of routine health care delivery, and ensuring that
    manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies are making medications
    available to everyone with a prescription. This also includes
    providing addiction treatment while individuals are in jails and
    prisons, and continuing their treatment in their communities, which
    has been proven to decrease overdose deaths, reduce crime, and
    increase employment during reentry.

To support this Administration’s *Strategy* and to address illicit
fentanyl, President Biden has called on Congress to make [an historic
investment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/03/09/president-biden-calls-for-historic-funding-to-beat-the-overdose-epidemic-being-driven-by-fentanyl/)
of $46.1 billion for National Drug Control Program agencies, overseen by
the White House ONDCP. The FY24 budget request represents a $5 billion
increase from the FY22 request and a $2.3 billion increase over the FY23
enacted level. The FY24 budget includes more funding for efforts to
reduce the supply of illicit drugs like fentanyl and stop drug
trafficking. It also includes greater funding to support the expansion
of prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services.
