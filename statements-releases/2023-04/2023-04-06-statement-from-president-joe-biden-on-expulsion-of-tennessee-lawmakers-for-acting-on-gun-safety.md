title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Expulsion of Tennessee Lawmakers for\
  \ Acting on Gun\_Safety"
---
 
Last week, three more students and three school officials were gunned
down in yet another tragic mass shooting in Nashville. On Monday, 7,000
Tennesseans, many of them students, marched to their state capitol to
call on their lawmakers to take action and keep them safe.  
   
Instead, state Republican lawmakers called votes today to expel three
Democratic legislators who stood in solidarity with students and
families and helped lift their voices. Today’s expulsion of lawmakers
who engaged in peaceful protest is shocking, undemocratic, and without
precedent. Rather than debating the merits of the issue, these
Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel
duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee.  
   
A strong majority of Americans want lawmakers to act on commonsense gun
safety reforms that we know will save lives. But instead, we’ve
continued to see Republican officials across America double down on
dangerous bills that make our schools, places of worship, and
communities less safe. Our kids continue to pay the price.  
   
Congress must ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines, require
safe storage of firearms, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from
liability, and require background checks for all gun sales, and state
officials must do the same.
