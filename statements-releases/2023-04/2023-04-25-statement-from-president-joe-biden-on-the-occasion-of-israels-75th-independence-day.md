  \ Independence\_Day"

On behalf of the people of the United States, I extend our best wishes
to the people of Israel as they celebrate 75 years of statehood.    
   
When David Ben-Gurion declared Israel’s independence in 1948, he
announced the birth of a state “based on freedom, justice and peace.” 
Just 11 minutes later, President Truman announced that the United States
would be the first nation to recognize the government of Israel. Today,
we are still proud to be counted among the first of Israel’s friends and
allies.  And the United States recognizes the resilience of Israel’s
democracy—the bedrock for our robust and special relationship.   
   
As a life-long friend and supporter of the State of Israel, I have
worked my entire career to deepen and strengthen our partnership.  And I
have seen first-hand the benefits to both our nations. Together, we have
achieved remarkable advances in science, medicine, and technology that
will benefit our people for generations to come.   We’ve continued to
work together to create a more prosperous, peaceful, and integrated
Middle East.  And as strong partners, we are working together to build
new alliances to meet 21<sup>st</sup> century challenges like climate
change and global health.   
   
Today, as we mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the State of
Israel, we reaffirm our enduring friendship and commitment to Israel’s
security. Yom Ha’atzmaut Sameach!
