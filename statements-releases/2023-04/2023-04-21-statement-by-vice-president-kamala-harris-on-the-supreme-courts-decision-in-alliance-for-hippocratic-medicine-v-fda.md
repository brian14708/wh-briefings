title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision\
  \ in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v.\_FDA"
---
 
We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision to grant a stay in *Alliance for
Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA*, and our fight to defend reproductive
freedom continues. The Court’s announcement preserves access to
mifepristone—a safe and effective medication that was approved by the
FDA more than two decades ago.

Our Administration will not waver in our commitment to preserving access
to essential medication and defending the FDA’s ability to approve safe
and effective drugs. Americans need to look no further than their
medicine cabinet to see how many FDA-approved medications are at risk if
lower court decisions disregarding the FDA’s scientific judgment are
allowed to stand.

The President and I will continue to fight to protect a woman’s freedom
to make decisions about her own body and access to reproductive health
care, including medication abortion. No one should stand between a woman
and her doctor.
