title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves California Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of California and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe winter storms, straight-line winds, flooding, landslides, and
mudslides beginning on February 21, 2023, and continuing.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Kern, Mariposa, Monterey, San Benito,
Santa Cruz, Tulare, and Tuolumne.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding also is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe winter storms, straight-line winds,
flooding, landslides, and mudslides in the counties of Calaveras, Los
Angeles, Monterey, and Tulare.  
  
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Andrew F. Grant of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional
counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are
fully completed.
