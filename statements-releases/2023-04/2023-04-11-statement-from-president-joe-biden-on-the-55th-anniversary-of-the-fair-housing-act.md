title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 55th Anniversary of the Fair Housing\_\
  Act"

Today, we commemorate the 55<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Fair
Housing Act — a landmark law that guarantees that all people in America
have the right to obtain the housing of their choice, free from
discrimination. The importance of this law cannot be overstated, but we
have far to go to meet its full promise.  
   
Many neighborhoods across the country remain as segregated today as they
were 55 years ago. Disparities in homeownership rates by race and
ethnicity persist, and the racial wealth gap is wider now than it was
when the Fair Housing Act was passed.    
   
A fair housing market is critical to the fulfillment of the American
dream. That is why, as Senator, I was proud to co-sponsor the 1988 Fair
Housing Act amendments that extended the law’s protections to Americans
with disabilities and families with children. During the Obama-Biden
Administration, we instituted the first historic rule to implement the
Fair Housing Act’s requirement to Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.
And during the first week of the Biden-Harris Administration, I directed
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to fully implement
that rule after it was weakened during the prior administration, and I
am proud the proposed rule was published this past January.
Additionally, my administration made clear in 2021 that the Fair Housing
Act guards against discrimination targeting LGBTQ+ Americans.  
   
As we celebrate the ways in which the Fair Housing Act has empowered
millions of Americans with a fair shot at accessing housing
opportunities over the last 55 years, let’s continue the work to ensure
everyone has free and fair housing choice. Let’s join together to make
the American dream a reality for all Americans.
