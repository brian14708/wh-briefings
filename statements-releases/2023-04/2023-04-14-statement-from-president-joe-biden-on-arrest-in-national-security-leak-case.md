title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Arrest in National Security Leak\_\
  Case"

I commend the rapid action taken by law enforcement to investigate and
respond to the recent dissemination of classified U.S. government
documents. While we are still determining the validity of those
documents, I have directed our military and intelligence community to
take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive
information, and our national security team is closely coordinating with
our partners and allies.
