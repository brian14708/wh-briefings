House Republicans have passed a bill that cuts veterans’ health care,
education, Meals on Wheels, and public safety, takes away health care
from millions of Americans, and sends manufacturing jobs overseas while
they fight to extend the Trump tax cuts for the wealthiest and
profitable corporations. President Biden will never force middle class
and working families to bear the burden of tax cuts for the wealthiest,
as this bill does.  The President has made clear this bill has no chance
of becoming law.  
   
In our history, we have never defaulted on our debt or failed to pay our
bills.  Congressional Republicans must act immediately and without
conditions to avoid default and ensure that the full faith and credit of
the United States is not put at risk.  That is their job. Economists
have warned that default could spark a dangerous financial crisis, lead
to a recession costing millions of Americans their jobs, endanger
hard-working Americans’ retirement savings, and increase long-term
federal borrowing costs, adding to deficits and debt.  We are not a
deadbeat nation. As President Reagan said: “The United States has a
special responsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations. 
It means we have a well-earned reputation for reliability and
credibility — two things that set us apart in much of the world.” We pay
our bills. Congressional Republicans must do that again now and act to
avoid default.
