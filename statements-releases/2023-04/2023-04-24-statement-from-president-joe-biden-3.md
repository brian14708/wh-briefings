I surprised a lot of people when I named Ambassador Susan Rice as my
Domestic Policy Advisor. Susan was synonymous with foreign policy,
having previously served as National Security Advisor and UN Ambassador.
But what I knew then and what we all know now – after more than two
years of her steady leadership of the Domestic Policy Council – it’s
clear: there is no one more capable, and more determined to get
important things done for the American people than Susan Rice. 

Thanks to her tireless efforts, we expanded and strengthened the
Affordable Care Act, released a comprehensive national mental health
strategy, and finally enabled Medicare to negotiate lower prescription
drug prices for seniors and cap the cost of insulin at $35. We’ve taken
historic actions to reduce gun violence and advance police reform. We
are addressing our failed approach to marijuana. We have embedded equity
into the work of the entire federal government. We are making college
more affordable and accessible and providing student debt relief. We are
increasing access to high quality child care and long-term care. We have
committed to a bold national strategy to end hunger and reduce
diet-related disease by 2030. We reversed the harmful immigration
policies of the previous Administration, reunified more than 670
children separated from their families, and rebuilt the broken system of
care for unaccompanied children, putting their safety and well-being
first and foremost. The list goes on, and would not have been possible
without Susan. 

As the only person to serve as both National Security Advisor and
Domestic Policy Advisor, Susan’s record of public service makes history.
But what sets her apart as a leader and colleague is the seriousness
with which she takes her role and the urgency and tenacity she brings,
her bias towards action and results, and the integrity, humility and
humor with which she does this work. I thank Susan for her service, her
counsel and her friendship. I will miss her. 

I also want to thank her husband Ian and her children Jake and Maris for
yet again sharing Susan with us.
