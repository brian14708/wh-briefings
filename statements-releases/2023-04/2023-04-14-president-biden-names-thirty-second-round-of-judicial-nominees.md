title: "President\_Biden Names Thirty-Second Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate two federal judicial
nominees—both of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
  
If confirmed, this slate would include:

-   The first Hispanic woman to serve on the United States Court of
    Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the only active Hispanic judge on
    the Fifth Circuit.  
-   The fourth Hispanic woman to serve on the United States Court of
    Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

This will be President Biden’s thirty-second round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 163.
