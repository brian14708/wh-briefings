Jill and I send warm wishes to all those in the Orthodox Christian
community who are celebrating Easter, and rejoice with you in the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the triumph of light over darkness.  
   
Today, as we pray for all those suffering from war and persecution, we
also give thanks for people around the world who are binding up the
wounds of the injured and working to protect the dignity of
all—including by welcoming refugees and standing up for human rights.
Together, let us all recommit to this work and to forging a better
future—one where there is security, liberty, and justice for everyone.  
   
Orthodox Christians continue to strengthen communities across our
country and around the world—from fostering understanding across
different faiths, to advocating responsible stewardship of the
environment, to serving others with dignity and respect. During this
sacred season and the years ahead, we look forward to continuing to work
together to build a more just and compassionate world for all God’s
children.
