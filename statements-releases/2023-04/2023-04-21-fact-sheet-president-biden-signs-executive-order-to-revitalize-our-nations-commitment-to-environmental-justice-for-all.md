title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs Executive Order to Revitalize Our Nation\u2019\
  s Commitment to Environmental Justice for\_All"
---
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that every person has
a right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live in a healthy
community – now and into the future. During his first week in office,
President Biden launched the most ambitious environmental justice agenda
in our nation’s history. To continue delivering on that vision, today
the President will sign an executive order further embedding
environmental justice into the work of federal agencies to achieve real,
measurable progress that communities can count on.  
  
The Executive Order is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
whole-of-government effort to confront longstanding environmental
injustices and inequities. For far too long, communities across our
country have faced persistent environmental injustice through toxic
pollution, underinvestment in infrastructure and critical services, and
other disproportionate environmental harms often due to a legacy of
racial discrimination including redlining. These communities with
environmental justice concerns face even greater burdens due to climate
change.  
  
With this action, the President is working to ensure that all people –
regardless of race, background, income, ability, Tribal affiliation, or
zip code – can benefit from the vital safeguards enshrined in our
nation’s foundational environmental and civil rights laws. That means
cleaner air and water, reduced risk for asthma, cancer, and other health
burdens, and better access to green space, safe and affordable housing,
and clean transportation.  
  
For President Biden, protecting our planet starts with ensuring everyone
lives in a safe and healthy environment. Throughout Earth Week,
President Biden, Vice President Harris, and other Cabinet-level
officials are holding events and announcing commitments focused on how
the President’s Investing in America agenda is creating good-paying
clean energy jobs, lowering costs, meeting our climate goals, advancing
environmental justice and conservation, and strengthening communities
that for too long were left behind or left out.  
  
The new Executive Order, *Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to
Environmental Justice for All,* will:

-   **Deepen the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government
    commitment to environmental justice.** The new Executive Order makes
    clear that the pursuit of environmental justice is a duty of all
    executive branch agencies and should be incorporated into their
    missions. It also affirms that environmental justice is central to
    the implementation of our bedrock civil rights and environmental
    laws.
-   **Better protect overburdened communities from pollution and
    environmental harms**. The Executive Order directs agencies to
    consider measures to address and prevent disproportionate and
    adverse environmental and health impacts on communities, including
    the cumulative impacts of pollution and other burdens like climate
    change. Additionally, it requires agencies to notify nearby
    communities in the event of a release of toxic substances from a
    federal facility, and to hold a public meeting to share information
    on resulting health risks and necessary precautions.
-   **Strengthen engagement with communities and mobilize federal
    agencies to confront existing and legacy barriers and injustices**.
    Communities with environmental justice concerns have long
    experienced exclusion and other significant barriers to having a
    voice in federal decision-making. The Executive Order recognizes
    this reality and that racism is a fundamental driver of
    environmental injustice. It directs agencies to actively facilitate
    meaningful public participation and just treatment of all people in
    agency decision-making. The Executive Order also underscores the
    vital importance of Tribal consultation and coordination, including
    to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships on issues involving
    environmental justice.
-   **Promote the latest science, data, and research, including on
    cumulative impacts**. The Executive Order directs agencies to
    identify and address gaps in science, data, and research related to
    environmental justice, to advance the analysis of cumulative
    impacts, and to make information on environmental and health
    concerns more publicly accessible to communities. To address the
    need for a coordinated strategy for identifying and filling
    environmental justice data and research gaps, the Executive Order
    establishes a new Environmental Justice Subcommittee within the
    National Science and Technology Council, led by the Office of
    Science and Technology Policy.
-   **Expand interagency coordination and launch a new Office of
    Environmental Justice within the White House Council on
    Environmental Quality.** Building on Executive Order 14008, the
    Executive Order adds agencies to the White House Environmental
    Justice Interagency Council to further a whole-of-government
    strategy to address current and historic environmental injustice.
    The Executive Order also establishes the White House Office of
    Environmental Justice, led by the Federal Chief Environmental
    Justice Officer, and tasks it with coordinating the implementation
    of environmental justice policy across the federal government,
    ensuring that federal efforts can evolve alongside our understanding
    of environmental justice.
-   **Increase accountability and transparency in federal environmental
    justice policy.** The Executive Order charges federal agencies with
    conducting new assessments of their environmental justice efforts
    and developing, implementing, and periodically updating an
    environmental justice strategic plan. These Environmental Justice
    Strategic Plans and Assessments will be submitted to the White House
    Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and made public on a regular
    basis, including through the Environmental Justice Scorecard, a new
    government-wide assessment of federal agencies’ efforts to advance
    environmental justice.
-   **Honor and build on the foundation of ongoing environmental justice
    work.** Under the Executive Order, agencies will continue their
    efforts to advance environmental justice in ways that complement and
    deepen prior work. The Executive Order uses the term
    “disproportionate and adverse” as a simpler, modernized version of
    the phrase “disproportionately high and adverse” used in Executive
    Order 12898. Those phrases have the same meaning, but removing the
    word “high” eliminates potential misunderstanding that agencies
    should only be considering large disproportionate effects.

This action follows through on President Biden’s promise to modernize
and improve how the federal government confronts environmental injustice
to address the needs of present and future generations – a promise he
made following meaningful engagement with communities with environmental
justice concerns and solidified in Executive Order 14008, [*Tackling the
Climate Crisis at Home and
Abroad*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).
The Executive Order reflects the values, goals, and recommendations of
the [White House Environmental Justice Advisory
Council](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council/)
(WHEJAC), an expert body of leaders, researchers, practitioners, and
community members. In line with the WHEJAC’s recommendations, the
Executive Order outlines an ambitious approach to environmental justice
that is informed by scientific research, high-quality data, and
meaningful engagement with communities. It also reaffirms that the
federal government must continue to be transparent and accountable for
its actions.  
  
The Executive Order builds on and supplements the foundational efforts
of Executive Order 12898, signed by President Bill Clinton nearly 30
years ago*.* For the first time in our nation’s history, Executive Order
12898 recognized and sought to address what community members and
leaders had been saying for decades: harmful pollution disproportionally
impacts low-income communities and communities of color, among other
vulnerable communities.  
  
In addition to the Executive Order, today the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing other new steps to further the President’s
historic commitment to environmental justice:

-   **Publishing the first-ever Environmental Justice Scorecard**. The
    Office of Management and Budget (OMB), CEQ, and the U.S. Digital
    Service are publishing [Phase One of the Environmental Justice
    Scorecard](https://ejscorecard.geoplatform.gov/scorecard/), the
    first government-wide assessment of federal agencies’ efforts to
    advance environmental justice. The first version of the Scorecard
    establishes a baseline for tracking the federal government’s efforts
    through 24 agencies to secure environmental justice, including to
    advance the Justice40 Initiative. Over time, it will show how the
    Administration’s actions are making meaningful changes in
    communities. The Scorecard incorporates recommendations from the
    WHEJAC and feedback from the public, environmental justice
    stakeholders, and experts.
-   **Launching the White House Campaign for Environmental Justice.**
    The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that people
    are seeing and experiencing the impacts of the President’s
    environmental justice agenda in their communities. To strengthen
    partnerships with communities that have been left behind for too
    long, the Administration is announcing the White House Campaign for
    Environmental Justice. The campaign, which is being kicked off today
    at [the launch of the 21<sup>st</sup> Urban Waters Federal
    Partnership in Raleigh, North
    Carolina](https://www.epa.gov/urbanwaterspartners), will redouble
    the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to meet people where they
    are and better focus agency resources and attention on the needs of
    marginalized and overburdened communities.
-   **Announcing new Justice40 covered programs.** Through
    the [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    the Biden-Harris Administration is reshaping hundreds of federal
    programs to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of
    certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities. Today
    [three additional
    agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Justice40-Covered-Programs-List_v1.4_04-20-2023.pdf),
    the Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation, and the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), announced
    their Justice40 covered programs. Now nearly 470 programs across
    nineteen federal agencies are covered under the President’s
    Justice40 Initiative.
-   **Taking new steps to combat plastic pollution in communities.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that the plastic pollution
    crisis is an environmental justice issue, with disadvantaged
    communities in the U.S. and globally bearing social, economic, and
    public health burdens across the entire lifecycle of plastics. Today
    the Environmental Protection Agency is releasing a draft National
    Strategy on Preventing Plastic Pollution to combat the disparate
    impacts on communities affected by plastic from production to waste.
    The White House is also announcing a new Interagency Policy
    Committee (IPC) on Plastic Pollution and a Circular Economy. The IPC
    will coordinate federal efforts on plastic pollution, prioritizing
    public health, economic development, and equity to ensure that the
    benefits of acting on plastic pollution – including jobs, minimized
    exposure to harmful chemicals, and clean communities – are available
    to all.

Today’s announcements build on more than two years of progress under
President Biden’s leadership to advance environmental justice. That
progress includes:

-   **Delivering on the Justice40 Initiative.** Through President
    Biden’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    the Administration is delivering 40 percent of the overall benefits
    of federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable
    housing, clean water, and other investments to disadvantaged
    communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution. In
    total, hundreds of federal programs are being reimagined and
    transformed to meet the Justice40 goal. Agencies are using the
    [Climate and Economic Justice Screening
    Tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5) to
    identify disadvantaged communities.
-   **Making historic investments in environmental justice.** The
    President’s Investing in America agenda includes historic funding
    for environmental justice. This week the Environmental Protection
    Agency released [new details about the design of the $27 billion
    Greenhouse Gas Reduction
    Fund](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-framework-implementation-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-part-president),
    which will leverage public investment with private capital and
    finance clean energy projects that reduce pollution and energy
    costs, increase energy security, and create good-paying jobs,
    especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Through the
    [Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/)
    and the [Inflation Reduction
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/17/fact-sheet-inflation-reduction-act-advances-environmental-justice/),
    agencies are investing billions to [plug orphaned oil and gas

    [purchase zero-emissions school
    buses](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-1-billion-epas-clean-school-bus-program),
    and more.
-   **Advancing an ambitious regulatory agenda.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration is advancing an ambitious regulatory agenda to
    protect public health and secure environmental justice. The
    Environmental Protection Agency is working to combat air and water
    pollution by proposing the first-ever [national drinking water
    standard for
    PFAS](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-first-ever-national-standard-protect-communities),
    proposing to strengthen [the Mercury and Air Toxics
    Standards](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-strengthen-mercury-and-air-toxics-standards-power),
    addressing elevated cancer risks with [stronger standards for
    chemical
    manufacturers](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-strengthen-standards-chemical-and-polymers-plants),
    and developing [new health protections to reduce exposure to
    ethylene
    oxide](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-new-standards-protect-public-health-reduce-exposure-ethylene-oxide#:~:text=EPA%20is%20proposing%20unprecedented%20real,be%20required%20to%20wear%20PPE.).
     
-   **Strengthening enforcement of environmental laws.** The Department
    of Justice (DOJ) is implementing [a comprehensive environmental
    justice enforcement
    strategy](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-comprehensive-environmental-justice-strategy)
    to enhance civil and criminal enforcement of environmental
    violations in communities overburdened by pollution. Examples of
    DOJ’s enforcement work include [a complaint filed and interim
    solution](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-complaint-and-reaches-agreement-proposal-city-jackson-and-state)
    reached for the court to appoint a third party to manage and
    stabilize the City of Jackson, Mississippi’s public drinking water
    system, [an environmental justice
    investigation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-environmental-justice-investigation-city-houston-texas)
    into the City of Houston’s operations, policies and practices
    related to illegal dumping, and an [environmental justice
    investigation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-environmental-justice-investigation-alabama-department-public)
    into the wastewater disposal and infectious disease and outbreaks
    programs of the Alabama Department of Public Health and the Health
    Department of Lowndes County, Alabama. 
-   **Increasing technical assistance and capacity building.** In direct
    response to feedback from communities, the Biden-Harris
    Administration has established a network of assistance centers to
    support communities and their partners as they work to access
    federal resources. Last week the Administration [announced 17 new
    Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance
    Centers](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-177-million-17-new-technical-assistance-centers)
    to help unlock federal resources in communities across the country.
    The program is part of the [Federal Interagency Thriving Communities
    Network](https://www.transportation.gov/federal-interagency-thriving-communities-network),
    which is working toward a holistic government-wide framework for
    technical assistance and capacity building.
-   **Respecting and elevating Indigenous Knowledge.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration has formally recognized Indigenous Knowledge as one
    of the many important bodies of knowledge that contributes to the
    scientific, technical, social, and economic advancements of the
    United States and our collective understanding of the natural world.
    The White House engaged more than a thousand individuals,
    organizations, and Tribal Nations to develop [guidance on elevating
    Indigenous
    Knowledge](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2022/12/01/white-house-releases-first-of-a-kind-indigenous-knowledge-guidance-for-federal-agencies/)
    in federal research, policy, and decision-making.
-   **Strengthening our regulatory system for the 21<sup>st</sup>
    century**. Earlier this month, the Biden-Harris Administration
    rolled out new efforts to promote equitable and meaningful
    participation in the regulatory process, and OMB’s Office of
    Information and Regulatory Affairs [proposed new
    guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/04/06/strengthening-our-regulatory-system-for-the-21st-century/)
    to help agencies better account for the full range of benefits and
    costs of their regulatory actions. These new steps will produce a
    more efficient, effective regulatory review process that will help
    improve people’s lives – from protecting children from harmful
    toxins to growing our economy.
