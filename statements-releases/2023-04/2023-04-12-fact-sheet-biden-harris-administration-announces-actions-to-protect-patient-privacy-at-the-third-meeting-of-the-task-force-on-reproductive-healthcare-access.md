title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Actions to Protect\
  \ Patient Privacy at the Third Meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare\_\
  Access"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will announce new actions to
safeguard patient privacy at the third meeting of the Task Force on
Reproductive Healthcare Access with Vice President Harris. These
announcements build on actions that the Administration has taken to
protect privacy and access to accurate information in the wake of the
Supreme Court’s decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health
Organization,* as the President directed in his first Executive Order to
protect access to reproductive health care, including abortion. Efforts
to protect sensitive health information, including related to
reproductive health care, have taken on renewed importance, as states
seek to penalize and criminalize health care providers and interfere in
deeply personal medical decisions.

At the meeting, the Cabinet will discuss their ongoing efforts to defend
reproductive rights and support access to reproductive health care more
broadly. The Task Force will also discuss updates on the
Administration’s response to *Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v.
FDA, *as well as efforts to implement the Presidential Memorandum on
ensuring safe access to medication abortion, which has been approved by
the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for over two
decades.

Today, the Administration announced actions to:

-   **Strengthen Reproductive Health Privacy under HIPAA.** The
    Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is [issuing a Notice
    of Proposed
    Rulemaking](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/regulatory-initiatives/hipaa-reproductive-health-fact-sheet/index.html) to
    strengthen privacy protections under the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This rule would prohibit
    doctors, other health care providers, and health plans from
    disclosing individuals’ protected health information, including
    information related to reproductive health care, under certain
    circumstances. Specifically, the rule would prevent an individual’s
    information from being disclosed to investigate, sue, or prosecute
    an individual, a health care provider, or a loved one simply because
    that person sought, obtained, provided, or facilitated legal
    reproductive health care, including abortion. By safeguarding
    sensitive information related to reproductive health care, the rule
    will strengthen patient-provider confidentiality and help health
    care providers give complete and accurate information to patients.

-   **Protect Students’ Health Information**. The Department of
    Education (ED) is [issuing guidance to over 20,000 school
    officials](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-guidance-school-officials-student-health-records) to
    remind them of their obligations to protect student privacy under
    the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The guidance
    helps ensure that school officials—including those at federally
    funded school districts, colleges, and universities—know that, with
    certain exceptions, they must obtain written consent from eligible
    students or parents before disclosing personally identifiable
    information from students’ educational records, which may include
    student health information. The guidance encourages school officials
    to consider the importance of student privacy, including health
    privacy, with respect to disclosing student records. ED is
    also [issuing a know-your-rights
    resource](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/resources/know-your-rights-ferpa-protections-student-health-records) to
    help students understand their privacy rights for health records at
    school.

-   **Support Consumer Privacy. **The Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) is [launching a new guide for
    consumers](https://www.fcc.gov/protecting-your-personal-data) on
    best practices for protecting their personal data on mobile phones.
    The guide also explains how existing FCC requirements protect
    against the disclosure of consumers’ sensitive information,
    including geolocation data, which can be especially important in the
    context of accessing reproductive health care. The guide follows a
    recent [Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-22-102A1.pdf) issued
    by FCC that is aimed at updating and strengthening data breach rules
    to provide greater protections to personal data.

<!-- -->

-   **Safeguard Patients’ Electronic Health Information. **HHS
    is[ issuing
    guidance](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/information-blocking/information-blocking-regulations-work-in-concert-with-hipaa-rules-and-other-privacy-laws-to-support-health-information-privacy) affirming
    that doctors and other medical providers can take steps to protect
    patients’ electronic health information, including their information
    related to reproductive health care. HHS will make clear that
    patients have the right to ask that their electronic health
    information generally not be disclosed by their physician, hospital,
    or other health care provider—including to other health care
    providers. The guidance also reminds health care providers that
    HIPAA’s privacy protections continue to apply to patients’
    electronic health information.

The Administration also announced related efforts to provide access to
accurate information and bolster data related to women’s health more
broadly:

-   **Leverage Maternal Health Data to Address Disparities.** FCC
    is [committing to the swift
    implementation](https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-letter-cdc-director-maternal-health-collaboration) of
    the Data Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act, which directs FCC, in
    coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to
    incorporate publicly available data on maternal mortality and
    morbidity into its Mapping Broadband Health in America platform.
    This innovation will support women’s health by informing efforts to
    expand broadband access—including access to telehealth—in areas with
    poor maternal health outcomes. This builds on the [Administration’s
    work](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Maternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf) to
    improve maternal health and address long-standing disparities,
    including those spotlighted this Black Maternal Health Week. FCC
    will continue to explore opportunities to improve research, data
    collection, data analysis, and interpretation in the context of
    reproductive health care and maternal health outcomes.

-   **Promote Accurate Information About Reproductive Care. **HHS
    is [announcing](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=347425) that
    it will issue a new Notice of Funding Opportunity to establish a
    safe and secure national hotline to provide referral services to
    women in need of accurate information about their legal reproductive
    health care options. The nondirective hotline would provide
    information to patients served by the Title X family planning
    program who request information related to prenatal care and
    delivery; infant care, foster care, or adoption; or pregnancy
    termination.

Today’s announcements build on previous actions to protect patient
privacy and access to accurate information. The Administration has taken
action to:

-   **Prevent Illegal Use and Sharing of Sensitive Health
    Information. **The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
    has [committed](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/location-health-and-other-sensitive-information-ftc-committed-fully-enforcing-law-against-illegal) to
    enforcing the law against illegal use and sharing of highly
    sensitive data, including information related to reproductive health
    care. Consistent with this commitment, the FTC recently
    took [first-of-its-kind enforcement
    action](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/first-ftc-health-breach-notification-rule-case-addresses-goodrxs-not-so-good-privacy-practices) against
    companies for disclosing consumers’ personal health information
    without permission to Facebook, Google, and others. The FTC has also
    urged companies to consider that sensitive data is protected by
    numerous state and federal laws and that claims that data is
    “anonymous” are often deceptive.

-   **Reinforce Existing Protections under the HIPAA Privacy
    Rule. **Immediately after *Dobbs, *HHS [issued
    guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/06/29/hhs-issues-guidance-to-protect-patient-privacy-in-wake-of-supreme-court-decision-on-roe.html) to
    help ensure doctors and other health care providers and health plans
    know that, with limited exceptions, they are not required—and in
    many cases, are not permitted—to disclose individuals’ health
    information, including to law enforcement. This guidance, which
    helps protect individuals seeking or receiving reproductive health
    care, remains in effect while today’s rulemaking is underway. The
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking noted above would further strengthen
    privacy protections under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

<!-- -->

-   **Protect Individuals’ Health Information Online. **HHS issued
    a [bulletin](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/hipaa-online-tracking/index.html) to
    affirm that HIPAA’s privacy protections extend to the use of online
    tools offered by or on behalf of covered entities that collect
    protected health information through websites and mobile apps. These
    tools, such as “cookies” on a website, can be used to track online
    activity and information about website and app users, sometimes in
    ways that collect or reveal protected health information. This can
    include information about reproductive health care, such as the
    location of where an individual sought medical treatment. The
    bulletin makes clear that health care providers and health plans—as
    well as many of the entities that these organizations do business
    with—cannot use online tracking tools or share patient information
    with third parties in a way that violates HIPAA.

<!-- -->

-   **Help Consumers Protect Their Personal Data. **HHS issued [a how-to
    guide](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/cell-phone-hipaa/index.html) for
    consumers on steps they can take to make sure they are protecting
    their personal data on personal cell phones or tablets. HHS also
    provided tips for protecting individuals’ privacy when using mobile
    health apps, like period trackers. This resource helps ensure that
    consumers have the information they need to better protect their
    health information when it is accessed or stored on their personal
    cell phones or tablets, which are generally not protected under
    HIPAA. 

<!-- -->

-   **Promote the Privacy of Service Members. **The Department of
    Defense issued an [updated
    policy](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Feb/16/2003163306/-1/-1/1/MEMORANDUM-CHANGES-TO-COMMAND-NOTIFICATION-OF-PREGNANCY-POLICY.PDF) to
    provide Service members with time and flexibility to make private
    health care decisions while accounting for the responsibility placed
    on commanders to meet operational requirements and protect the
    health and safety of those in their care. This policy standardized
    the timeframe for Service members to inform their commanders about a
    pregnancy, generally allowing Service members until up to 20 weeks
    of pregnancy to notify their commanders of their pregnancy status,
    with limited exceptions to account for specific military duties,
    occupational health hazards, and medical conditions.

<!-- -->

-   **Provide Access to Accurate Information and Legal Resources. **On
    the day of the Supreme Court’s *Dobbs *decision, HHS
    launched [ReproductiveRights.gov](https://reproductiverights.gov/),
    which provides timely and accurate information about reproductive
    rights and access to reproductive health care. This includes
    know-your-rights information for patients and providers and promotes
    awareness of and access to family planning services, as well as
    guidance for [how to file a patient privacy or nondiscrimination
    complaint](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html) with its
    Office for Civil Rights. DOJ also launched
    justice.gov/reproductive-rights,
    a [webpage](https://www.justice.gov/reproductive-rights?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) that
    provides a centralized online resource of the Department’s work to
    protect reproductive freedom under federal law.
