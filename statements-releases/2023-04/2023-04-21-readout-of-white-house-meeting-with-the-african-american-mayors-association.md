title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with the African American Mayors\_Association"
---
 
Today, President Biden dropped by a meeting with a group of five mayors
representing the African American Mayors Association (AAMA) to thank
them for their strong partnership this past year. The President
highlighted his commitment to working with mayors on a range of priority
issues impacting all Americans, including the continued implementation
of the President’s Investing in America Agenda, which includes his
American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, and Inflation Reduction Act – all of which
are delivering for working families and America’s mayors.  
  
The mayors were at the White House to meet with Julie Chavez
Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the White
House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and Steve Benjamin, Senior
Advisor to the President and Director of the White House Office of
Public Engagement, to discuss key initiatives around public safety,
housing, and environmental justice following the President’s executive
order signing earlier today. They also discussed the positive impact of
the President’s Investing in America agenda in their communities.   
  
The mayors are in town for the African American Mayors Association’s 9th
Annual Conference. Vice President Kamala Harris hosted over 80 AAMA
mayors for a reception at the Vice President’s residence earlier this
week.   
  
Today’s meeting highlighted the importance the Biden-Harris
Administration places on working with mayors to deliver results for the
American people in communities across the country.   
Mayors and stakeholders participating in today’s meeting included:  
  
     1. Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard, Mount Vernon, NY and AAMA
President  
  
     2. Mayor Steven Reed, Montgomery, AL  
  
     3. Mayor Byron Brown, Buffalo, NY
