title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Florida\
  \ Permitless Concealed Carry\_Law"

It is shameful that so soon after another tragic school shooting,
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law a permitless concealed
carry bill behind closed doors, which eliminates the need to get a
license to carry a concealed weapon.  
   
This is the opposite of commonsense gun safety.  The people of Florida —
who have paid a steep price for state and Congressional inaction on guns
from Parkland to Pulse Nightclub to Pine Hills — deserve better.  
   
President Biden has been clear: too many lives are being ripped apart by
gun violence.  The President continues to call on Congress to ban
assault weapons and high capacity magazines, require safe storage of
firearms, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability, and
require background checks for all gun sales, and for state officials to
take action at the state level.
