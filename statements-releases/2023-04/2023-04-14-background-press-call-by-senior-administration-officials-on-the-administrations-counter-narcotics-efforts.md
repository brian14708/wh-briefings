title: "Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on the Administration\u2019\
  s Counter-Narcotics\_Efforts"
---
 
*Via Teleconference*

12:04 P.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you, everyone, for joining this call.  We’re going to
discuss the Biden-Harris administration’s counter-narcotics work.  
   
I’m sure you’ve seen the various announcements today.  This is a good
opportunity to ask questions of our folks.  
   
As a reminder, this call will be on background and attributable to
“senior administration officials.”  The embargo of the call will lift at
the conclusion of the call.  
   
We have a number of speakers on today’s call.  And this is for your
awareness, not for your reporting, but we have \[senior administration
official\] at the White House.  We have \[senior administration
official\].  We have \[senior administration official\] at DEA, \[senior
administration official\] at the FBI.  We have \[senior administration
official\] of OFAC at Treasury, \[senior administration official\],
\[senior administration official\], and \[senior administration
official\] of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and \[senior
administration official\] at ONDCP.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to \[senior administration official\] to
kick us off.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you so much.  And thanks to all
of you for making time for this call.  I will keep this relatively brief
because, as you heard, there are a lot of folks you’ll get to hear from
today.  And I think that reflects the priority with which this
administration and this government is treating the fentanyl crisis.  It
is something that we have mobilized as a challenge for which the various
authorities, tools, talents, experience across the executive branch must
be mobilized.  And what you’ll hear today is a reflection of that
cross-government effort.  
   
More specifically, you have seen the announcements this morning, I
suspect, by the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury,
and the Department of State about historic actions the U.S. government
has taken against a global illicit fentanyl network.  
   
The Department of Justice announced criminal charges against over two
dozen defendants for their alleged involvement in, or support to, the
production and proliferation of illicit fentanyl worldwide.   
   
The Treasury Department announced complementary sanctions against two
companies and five individuals linked to the global proliferation of
precursor chemicals used for the synthesis of illicit fentanyl.   
   
And the State Department announced the submission of over two dozen
individuals to the Narcotics Rewards Program.  
   
Taken together, today’s actions represent an extraordinary
government-wide effort to counter the global threat that’s posed by the
trafficking of illicit drugs, including into the United States.   
   
These efforts demonstrate the U.S. government’s commitment to
dismantling this deadly criminal enterprise at every level, from those
who willingly ship illicit precursor chemicals from overseas to those
who traffic pills right into our homeland, killing tens of thousands of
Americans every year.  
   
President Biden has been very clear, including in his State of the Union
remarks, that addressing the national security and the public health
threat posed by the flow of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs
is a priority of the highest order.  And President Biden has repeatedly
called for international cooperation to combat what is truly a global
problem.   
   
Today’s actions directly align with steps the President committed to
take during the North America Leaders’ Summit in January, alongside
President Lopez Obrador of Mexico and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada. 
Those commitments included intensifying efforts to prosecute drug
traffickers, disrupt the supply of precursor chemicals, and prevent the
trafficking of drugs and firearms across our shared borders.  
   
Last month, Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall led a
high-level U.S. delegation to Mexico to further increase cooperation to
combat illicit fentanyl production and to target the synthetic drug
supply chain.  
   
And just yesterday, Dr. Sherwood-Randall, joined by colleagues from
departments and agencies at the highest levels, hosted a delegation from
Mexico to continue discussing ways we can combat the cartels and
transnational criminal organizations that are devastating both our
countries and have claimed too many lives.  
   
This partnership is and will continue to be critical to our
counter-fentanyl efforts, and we look forward to continuing
collaborative efforts to counter fentanyl trafficking and illicit drug
consumption across North America.  
   
We will continue to work tirelessly to hold accountable those
responsible for advancing the loss of life caused by the global illicit
drug trade.  
   
President Biden commends the Department of Justice and the Drug
Enforcement Administration for their relentless pursuit of justice and
accountability, and is grateful to all of those at the State Department,
the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, and
ONDCP, among others, for collaboration against this global threat.  
   
And with that, I’ll turn things over to my colleague at DEA.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\].  And thank you, everyone, for being on the call.  So, as
\[senior administration official\] said, we at the DEA are looking at
this, obviously, because fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat that our
country has ever faced.  
   
And what we’re seeing is that all of the fentanyl in the United States
comes from Mexico, and most of it is trafficked by the Sinaloa cartel.  
   
I’ll give a little bit of background, and then I’ll talk about this
particular investigation with the indictments that we unsealed today.  
   
Our top operational priority is to map the network of the two cartels
that are responsible for the vast majority of the fentanyl coming into
the United States that’s killing so many Americans: the Sinaloa and
Jalisco cartels.  
   
This mapping of the network is critical for us to work with our
interagency partners and across the whole of government to map the
network, identify all the nodes, and then target those nodes with
operational activity and bring justice to these types of cases.  
   
As you all know, the cartel — Sinaloa cartel is based in Mexico, but it
has members, associates, facilitators, and brokers in all 50 states in
the U.S. and in over 47 countries around the world.  
   
The cartel was formally led by “El Chapo” Guzman, who is now serving a
life sentence in U.S. prison.  Three of his sons that are subject of
this investigation and these indictments — Ovidio, Ivan, and Alfredo —
are known as the “Chapitos.”  They now lead the cartel.  
   
They pioneered the manufacture and trafficking of fentanyl and are
responsible for the massive influx of fentanyl into the United States
over the last eight years.  They know that they’re poisoning their
customers, often without the customer’s knowledge, and they don’t
care.  
   
They’re also highly organized and a sophisticated business, employing
military-grade weapons and vehicles and hundreds of people to protect
the cartel and its leaders at all costs.  
   
So what we did was, when we mapped the networks, we decided to target
every single node within that “Chapitos” faction of the Sinaloa cartel. 
The DEA had operational activity in 10 countries, operational activity
in 28 domestic cities.  Thirty-two of our domestic and foreign offices
were involved in this case.  We had seizures in eight cities around the
country, money laundering activity in 10 different states and 12
different cities.  
   
We uncovered a weapon for fentanyl case, hundreds of kilos of fentanyl
for 500 AR-15 rifles, grenade launchers, rocket-propelled grenade.  
   
We also were able to identify the entire supply chain and all the
members of the Sinaloa cartel: the cartel leaders — as I mentioned
before, the three sons of El Chapo; their precursor chemical suppliers
in China and Guatemala, five of them that were supplying the precursors
for the Chapitos network; the clandestine laboratory managers, four of
them that were charged; the *sicarios* and security leaders, brutally
violent enforcers for the cartel in Mexico, operating in Mexico and
around the world; the fentanyl trafficker leaders, another five that we
were able to infiltrate, indict, and capture some of; and the weapons
trafficking leaders, another five that are Mexican nationals and one
U.S. national; and the money laundering activities.  
   
So we were able to uncover all those and work with our partners in the
Southern District of New York and bring CCE charges, fentanyl
importation conspiracy charges, fentanyl trafficking conspiracy charges,
and possession of machine guns and destructive device charges.  
   
Seven of the targets of this investigation have been arrested in
Colombia, Greece, and Guatemala several weeks ago.  Ovidio was
previously trapped — arrested by our Mexican counterparts.  
   
We also want to recognize the sacrifices of the brave men and women in
Mexican law enforcement and the military that have conducted these
enforcement operations over the last year to two years and the
sacrifices that they have made.  Our condolences to their families and
to their other loved ones.  
   
That’s pretty much the whole investigation.  And I’ll pause there and
turn it over to the next speaker.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Next up, we’ll have \[senior administration
official\] of OFAC.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Well, we’re very enthused today
to join DOJ’s action here targeting the federal network.  
   
As \[senior administration official\] mentioned at the outset, we today
impose sanctions on two companies and five individuals.   
   
Those companies are China-based.  They are involved in the development
and sale of fentanyl precursors to Mexico.   
   
And the individuals are a little bit more broadly spread out but mainly
in China.  Two of the individuals are sales reps for one of the
companies that we sanctioned.  Another one of the individuals is a
person who, effectively, owns the company.  And then a fourth individual
based in China controlled the cryptocurrency wallet that bad been used
to receive bitcoin that it — really had become increasingly active in
this space in trying to facility narcotics sales around the world.  
   
We also had the opportunity to include in our sanctions today an
individual based in Guatemala, who had been working with the
Mexican-based cartels to help sell and secure fentanyl.  
   
The point that I think we would just stress from Treasury, as you all
may be aware, is that our counter-narcotics program has been around for
a number of years, really more than a quarter century at this stage. 
But in the last five years or so, we’ve really seen an increased effort
to try to target our authorities, thanks to an executive order that
President Biden issued in December of 2021, to really expand and to
address the rising fentanyl crisis.  
   
That involves trying to disrupt these networks around the world — and
not just target individual traffickers but also, as we’re doing here,
those who are involved in selling the chemicals and the precursors and
other elements that really go into manufacturing and ultimately the
distribution of fentanyl around the world.  
   
We’re happy to partner, of course, with DOJ, as we do on a number of
different narcotics actions, as well as our colleagues at the State
Department, and happy to sort of really emphasize that we see this as a
whole-of-government process.  
   
For those who aren’t familiar with what we do at Treasury, what our
designations and sanctions mean today is that, effectively, any assets
that the parties that we have targeted today, that might be in the
United States, are now frozen.  
   
In addition, individuals around the world who may decide to do business
with some of the people that we have targeted now themselves could be
subject to sanctions.  
   
And overall, when we look at our narcotics authorities throughout the
year, we’ve actually found that sanctions are a fairly effective
complementary tool to the law enforcement action.  Because what happens
is a lot of these individuals and companies, because they’re trying to
sell narcotics to the United States, have a vested interest and
sometimes have money in the U.S.  
   
And so, we’re excited to participate in today’s action.  And we think
we’ll be able to sort of leverage our authorities to hopefully put
ourselves in a position where we can take actions in the future to try
to disrupt these networks.  
   
And with that just broad overview, I think I’ll pass it to \[senior
administration official\] at State so he can give an overview of their
action today.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hello.  Good morning.  
   
The U.S. Department of State announced today an unprecedented 27 reward
offers through our Narcotics Rewards Program, including increases in
reward offers for two high-level leaders of the Sinaloa cartel, Ivan
Archivaldo and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar.  
   
The reward offers range from up to $1 million from — up to $1 million to
$10 million for information that leads to an arrest and/or conviction of
these targets.  
   
These target trafficked fentanyl from around the world, including from
Mexico, PRC, and Guatemala.  
   
These reward offers are part of a government-wide attempt to put a halt
to trafficking in illicit fentanyl and its precursors.   
   
The only other thing I will say is we are addressing — the Department is
intensifying efforts with international partners to confront the illicit
fentanyl supply chain as a top public health and national security
priority.  
   
We are addressing the urgent global challenge of synthetic drug use by
deploying our diplomats to create a global network of partners to
disrupt the synthetic drug supply chain.  
   
The United States is grateful to our partners around the world for their
help in putting a stop to these appalling outcomes.   
   
INL is committed to counternarcotics programming globally.  As an
example, in the Western Hemisphere last year, we dedicated approximately
$20 million to combat synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl.  And an
additional $17 million is dedicated to transnational drug supply
reduction programs to combat synthetic drugs, especially fentanyl.  And
$20 million is dedicated to drug use prevention, treatment, and recovery
— and recovery support initiatives worldwide.  
   
Thanks.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Next up we’ll go to \[senior administration
official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good afternoon.  And thank you for the
opportunity to speak with you all about the significant work across DHS,
CBP, and HSI to combat the fentanyl epidemic.  
   
As \[senior administration official\] stated, fentanyl is one of the
deadliest drug threats our nation has ever faced.  DHS is on the
frontline combating this dangerous drug every single day.   
   
CBP’s fentanyl seizures have increased more than 400 percent since
fiscal year 2019.  CBP’s fiscal year 2023 seizures of fentanyl have
already surpassed our fiscal year 2022 seizure totals.  
   
At our borders, we employ a layered targeting and screening network to
interdict fentanyl as individuals attempt to smuggle fentanyl into the
country and to take action against the groups responsible for this.  
   
This includes increasing our use of non-intrusive inspection equipment
to scan vehicles to detect contraband and other advanced techniques that
allow us to detect and interdict dangerous narcotics.  
   
We have increased our focus on targeting the shipments of chemical
precursors from source countries by working with HSI, foreign partners,
and industry to analyze and target illicit movements in the air and
maritime cargo environments.  This targeting allows law enforcement
personnel to seize these precursors before they can be synthesized into
fentanyl.  
   
Through expanding our use of technology and machine learning to identify
risky shipments, CBP has been able to increase interdictions of illicit
shipments in the mail and express consignment facilities in an
environment with millions of shipments per day and an ever-growing
volume as the e-commerce industry continues to grow.  
   
DHS’s strategy to counter fentanyl also focuses on identifying and
interdicting the equipment used in fentanyl production, specifically
targeting machine pill presses — pill presses, the die molds that
produce these counterfeit pills, and encapsulation machines.  
   
On March 13th, DHS announced the launch of Operation Blue Lotus, a new
coordinated and surge operation targeting the smuggling of fentanyl. 
Currently, the operation is responsible for the seizure of more than
2,400 pounds of fentanyl from coming into the United States at our ports
of entry.  The U.S. Border Patrol has also seized over 800 pounds of
fentanyl in a concurrent operation.  
   
Operation Blue Lotus — led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security
Investigations, along with federal, state, tribal, and local partners —
is investing additional personnel, technology, and resources along the
southwest border to detect and seize this dangerous drug at and between
our ports of entry.  
   
The operation brings together the unique resources and authorities
across DHS to implement a multi-pronged approach to combat fentanyl
precursor procurement, fentanyl synthesis, and fentanyl movements into
the United States.  
   
Blue Lotus increases the number of targeted inspections conducted by CBP
officers and HSI agents, canine units, as well as promoting advanced
technology at locations along the border.  
   
Operation Blue Lotus leverages advanced analytics and intelligence
capabilities across DHS, including the deployment of HSI personnel
alongside CBP officers at ports of entry, allowing immediate pursuit of
investigations and unprecedented elimination of illicit networks.  
   
In a direct effort to support investigations, we are utilizing
forward-operating labs at ports of entry to conduct real-time analysis
of unknown substances, enabling DHS to target, identify, and examine
unknown powders, pills, crystalline substances, or organic materials for
hard narcotics, precursor chemicals, and components associated with the
manufacturing or processing of synthetic drugs.  
   
The intelligence gained through Operation Blue Lotus has and will
continue to enhance the targeting of drug traffickers at the borders,
allowing DHS to continue to build criminal cases against the
transnational criminal organizations behind the networks and
facilitators dealing in this deadly substance.  
   
Operation Blue Lotus seizures have led to 74 arrests and provided
invaluable intelligence regarding the networks who manage the production
and distribution of dangerous narcotics.  
   
Today’s briefing highlights the importance and necessity of working with
our partners across the U.S. government and abroad to combat a fentanyl
epidemic that has exploited the global supply chain.  
   
We have been fortunate to work closely with our foreign partners and a
group of skilled investigators and prosecutors to ensure appropriate
consequences for those smuggling drugs like fentanyl across our borders
and into the United States.   
   
I can assure you that CBP will continue to disrupt these smuggling
networks, shipments of precursor chemicals, and take action against
those producing this deadly poison and bring them to justice.   
   
I again thank you for the opportunity to be here today and to reiterate
CBP and DHS’s commitment to the U.S. people and our partners, both
foreign and domestic, to prevent the movement of dangerous narcotics
like fentanyl from entering the United States.   
   
Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Next up, we’ll go to \[senior administration
official\] with ONDCP.  
   
Q    Great, thank you.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I’m here to talk
about how these announcements — these historic announcements today
complement our ongoing efforts to invest in public health, because we’re
taking a two-pronged approach to defeating illicit fentanyl and this
epidemic.   
   
Disrupting the trafficking of illicit drugs into the U.S. not only keeps
them from harming our citizens and denying profits of drug traffickers,
but it also allows our historic investments in public health
interventions to take hold so we can save more lives.   
   
This announcement today comes on the heels of significant actions we’ve
taken to improve access to public health.  In the last few months alone,
we’ve made life-saving naloxone over the counter while ensuring state
and local public health providers can purchase more naloxone using
federal dollars.   
   
We worked with Congress in a bipartisan fashion to remove barriers to
treatment.   
   
We’ve launched a prevention campaign with the Ad Council that taps
social media influencers to raise awareness of the dangers of fentanyl
and connects them to life-saving resources.   
   
And we’ve tracked drug threats that could undo the progress we’ve made
and just this week declared the combination of xylazine and illicit
fentanyl as an emerging drug threat.   
   
To support these efforts, President Biden has requested $46 billion from
Congress in its FY24 budget request for National Drug Control programs. 
That’s an increase of $2 billion over current enacted levels.  That
includes increases for every type of action and activity you’ve heard
about today, from interdiction, to domestic law enforcement, to
prevention, treatment, harm reduction and recovery support services.  
   
Today’s announcement helps highlight our two-pronged approach: going
after drug traffickers and their profits and tackling untreated
addiction.  This approach has helped this administration oversee eight
straight months of flattening or decreasing overdose deaths.   
   
Now, to be clear, a lot of work remains to be done to drive down
overdoses.  From President Biden on down to the rest of the people on
this call, we are committed to tackling illicit fentanyl and driving
down overdoses to save lives.   
   
Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And thanks to all of our speakers.  Moderator, I
think we’re ready to queue up some questions.   
   
Q    Hi.  Maybe \[senior administration official\] or any of you could
weigh in on this, but I was just hoping to get — I know the both the
U.S. and Mexican government have asked China  
to start nailing down and limiting the ability of precursor chemicals to
get transferred.  What progress, if any, has been made on that front? 
Are the Chinese at all being helpful?  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, Aamer, for the good and
important question.  And let me say a word on it and then invite
\[senior administration official\] or anyone else to say more if they’d
like.   
   
Look, you heard this from the Justice Department leadership at the press
conference earlier today: We have repeatedly, as the government, urged
the PRC to take actions to address the serious problem, the serious
challenge of illicit synthetic drug production and trafficking and, in
particular, to tackle the precursor chemicals that far too often do
emerge from the PRC and then, after being turned into powder and to
pills, find their way to American communities and ultimately cause
American deaths.   
   
And, of course, you saw aspects of that implicated in the charges
announced today by our law enforcement colleagues.  
   
We will continue to press countries around the world to do their part in
stepping up in the face of what really is a global challenge — yes, to
American citizens, but also to citizens of other countries who suffer
from this drug devastating, in some instances, communities.   
   
And we think the role of the PRC looms large in trying to get countries
to step up, do more, and confront elements of this challenge, especially
that emerge from their soil.  
   
\[Senior administration official\], is there more you want to say on
that?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  Yeah.  The only thing I would
mention is, you know, obviously, for a lot of different reasons, it’s
been difficult for the United States to talk directly to the PRC.  So as
part of this building of the global coalition to find synthetic opioids,
we have been asking our friends and partners around the world — our
diplomats have been engaging with our friends and partners around the
world, those of — many of whom speak directly with China, and asking
them to raise this issue so that China doesn’t just think it’s, you
know, a United States problem or a North American problem, but it’s a
global problem.   
   
And the fact is it is a global problem.  In the United States and North
America, it’s fentanyl.  In the Middle East, it’s captagon.  In Europe,
it’s methamphetamines.   
   
So this is really a global problem.  We’re looking for global
solutions.  We are working closely with our friends and partners, and we
are encouraging them and asking them to raise this issue — the issue of
precursor chemicals — with the PRC.  
   
Over.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is \[senior administration
official\].  I just want to jump in from the DEA’s perspective.  And I
echo what \[senior administration official\] and \[senior administration
official\] have said.   
   
But the bottom line is: For fentanyl threat, nearly all the precursor
chemicals that are needed to make fentanyl are coming from China.  And
as we said earlier, those precursors are going into Mexico, and then
it’s being manufactured.   
   
So we would obviously call on China to do more and cut off that fentanyl
supply chain where it starts, in their country.  So that’s the DEA’s
perspective on that.  
   
Q    Hey, everyone.  Thanks for doing this call.  Everyone here has
probably heard the President of Mexico say his country is not producing
fentanyl.  I think, you know, he’s referring to the synthesis process. 
But I wanted to know, when this delegation was there yesterday, did
anyone challenge that assertion?  What did the United States say to
Mexican officials, who don’t appear to acknowledge that the country is
producing this enormous quantity of fentanyl (inaudible)?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’m happy to take, again, a first stab
at the question and then others are welcome to chime in.   
   
For those who haven’t seen it, I realized it was relatively late
yesterday evening, but there is a joint statement out from the
government of Mexico and the U.S. government on yesterday’s productive
and constructive and, frankly, important conversations.  And it begins
by pointing to the fact that we do have a framework under which we are
tackling what is a shared security priority of dealing with the fentanyl
trafficking and consumption.  It’s the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial
Framework for Security, Public Heath, and Safe Communities.  We think
that provides the umbrella structure in which to get at this issue.   
   
I would also emphasize that the day before these meetings — meaning, on
April 12th — the government of Mexico and indeed the President issued a
decree creating or permitting the creation of a presidential commission
to fight the trafficking of illicit synthetic drugs, firearms, and
ammunition.   
   
And as the statement yesterday indicated from both governments, we
commit, ourselves — they — and the Mexican government commits to joint
work — continued joint work to dismantle the fentanyl supply chain and,
in particular, the two cartels — Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation —
that are — account for so much of the damage being wrought on Americans
and on Mexicans by this deadly drug and others related to it.   
   
So we will continue to have constructive, productive conversations like
that, as well as operational coordination where that’s appropriate, and
get at what our two governments are treating as a shared challenge.   
   
Others may want to chime in as well.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, yeah, this is \[senior
administration official\] again.  I would just say, you know, two
things.  One, I was in Mexico two weeks ago, and the Mexican military
was really generous in showing me around Sinaloa and actually taking me
to two production facilities — I think we should stop calling them labs
because, you know, they’re not laboratories — in Sinaloa.  And it is —
it was clear from both of those trips that they know production,
synthesizing is going on in Mexico.   
   
And I think they recognized that while they were here as well.  You
know, I don’t know what information the President has — the President of
Mexico has, but our information clearly indicates what we saw on the
ground.   
   
And in our meetings, both in Mexico and here in Washington, we don’t
spend a whole lot of time talking about that because we understand that
the evidence is clear, and we know what’s going on with CJNG and
Sinaloa.  
   
Over.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you so much for taking my question.  I have a couple of
questions if that’s okay.  I just needed a little bit of clarification. 
I understand more than two dozen defendants were charged — and then
there was the two companies out in China — for this.  And it also sounds
like there’s multiple indictments.  Can you give me a little bit of
clarification just so we make sure that we can see the number of
defendants charged for the specific indictment correctly?  
   
And you also mentioned there is a $20 million increase for prevention
initiatives worldwide.  A little bit of clarification on that one.   
   
And then I think I missed part of the response from \[senior
administration official\] saying CBP fentanyl seizures increased more
than 400 percent.  Did I get that number right?  Just wanted to get some
clarification on that.   
   
And then the last, last question is: How difficult is it going to be to
extradite these defendants that have been charged?  And has that process
been initiated?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  This is \[senior administration
official\] from DEA.  I’ll jump in and take the first part of that
question.   
   
So DEA, working with our partners in the Southern District of New York —
when we say there are three indictments that were all contemporaneous
investigations, 28 members and associates of the Sinaloa cartel.  So
they’re broken out into cartel leaders; chemical suppliers; lab
managers, or as \[senior administration official\] correctly says,
“production managers”; *sicarios*; fentanyl traffickers; weapons
traffickers; and illicit financiers.  
   
So, Ovidio obviously was arrested back in January by the great work that
the Mexican military did.  So that was one that was unsealed.   
   
The longer investigation had approximately 23 of the 28 that I
referenced, and that involved arrest operations we had in a number of
countries that I referenced.   
   
And the final one is a separate indictment.  It’s a fentanyl for weapons
conspiracy that involved significant quantities of fentanyl and
weapons.  They are Sinaloa associates linked to the Mayo Zambada arm of
the Sinaloa cartel.   
   
So those are all with Southern District of New York.   
   
There were also some other indictments unsealed that were historical and
did not focus on fentanyl at today’s press conference.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, I can take the —  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And that —  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, sorry.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, so sorry, this is \[senior
administration official\].  I’ll just take the last — the last part of
the question for CBP.   
   
Fiscal Year ‘23 seizures are 400 percent over Fiscal Year ‘19 seizures. 
And to date this year, we have already seized more fentanyl than we did
all of last fiscal year.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think — \[senior administration
official\], I thought you had one last question.  This is \[senior
administration official\], again, from DEA.  
   
On the extradition more broadly, we look forward to working with our
Mexican counterparts to arrest and then expeditiously extradite any of
the people that we unsealed the indictment on today.  We’re hopeful that
that will take place.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, folks.  And this is \[senior
administration official\] from (inaudible).  I want to echo what
\[senior administration official\] said about the seizure numbers for
FY23.   
   
So far, we’ve exceeded all of FY22 numbers for both the seizure and, you
know, quite frankly, all the other enforcement actions we’re doing. 
Pretty historic numbers we’re seeing and, you know, a
whole-of-government effort going towards the fentanyl problem.  
   
And, you know, as \[senior administration official\] mentioned before,
the Operation Blue Lotus and other efforts are going on.  We’re making
unprecedented gains against the cartel and related criminality going on
down there.   
   
So a lot of great efforts around the board.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  I would just add — taking on the
financial part of this: We have $20 million in the  
Western Hemisphere, last year, dedicated to combating synthetic opioids,
especially fentanyl.  An additional $17 million dedicated to
transnational drug supply reduction programs to combat synthetic drugs,
especially fentanyl in the Western Hemisphere.  And another $20 million
is dedicated to drug use prevention, treatment, and recovery support
initiatives.  That’s worldwide.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks, everyone.  That’s all the time we have.  And thanks
to all of our speakers for joining as well.   
   
As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials.”  And the embargo has now lifted.   
   
Thanks, everyone, for joining.
