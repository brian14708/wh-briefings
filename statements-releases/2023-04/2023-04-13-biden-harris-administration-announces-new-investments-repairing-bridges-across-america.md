title: "BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES NEW INVESTMENTS REPAIRING BRIDGES ACROSS\_\
  AMERICA"
---
 
  
*Nearly $300 Million in Funding for Nine Projects, Serving 230,000
Vehicles Daily*  
*Over 4,600 Bridge Repair or Replacement Projects Already in Progress*

President Biden’s *Investing in America* agenda is growing the American
economy from the bottom up and middle-out, not top-down, and as part of
that is rebuilding our nation’s bridges in cities and towns across
America.  Today, to close out the *Investing in America* tour, Vice
President Harris and senior administration officials will announce
nearly $300 million for nine bridge projects in both rural and urban
areas in eight states and the District of Columbia, funded by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Bridge Investment Program. These bridges
serve over 230,000 vehicles combined per day, and the investments will
save taxpayers time and money by reducing congestion and making
long-overdue improvements.  
  
To highlight this important announcement, Vice President Kamala Harris
will visit the Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge in Washington,
D.C., Transportation Secretary Buttigieg will visit upstate New York,
Senior Advisor and White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu
will visit Madison, Wisconsin, and other senior Biden-Harris
Administration officials will fan out across the country to highlight
additional bridge projects receiving grant funds today.    
  
Bridges are lifelines for communities, connecting families to their
loved ones, students to school, workers to their jobs, goods to stores,
and providing critical access and evacuation routes in case of an
emergency. Bridge projects also create good-paying construction jobs.
That is why the Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running
to rebuild bridges across the country. To date, the Administration has
funded over 4,600 bridge repair and replacement projects across the
country.  
  
Over the course of the three-week *Investing in America* tour, President
Biden, Vice President Harris, and twenty senior Administration Officials
traveled to over 50 cities and towns in 25 states and territories across
the country that are benefiting directly from the President’s *Investing
in America* agenda – including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the
Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the American
Rescue Plan. During the tour, Administration officials have touted how
the *Investing in America* agenda has unleashed over $435 billion in
private sector manufacturing investments, funded 23,000 infrastructure
projects across 4,500 cities and towns, spurred record small business
starts, and has helped create over 12 million jobs since President Biden
and Vice President Harris took office.  
  
**BRIDGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM GRANTS**  
   
The nearly $300 million announced today will go to nine bridge projects
that serve over 230,000 vehicles combined per day. The projects include
the repair, rehabilitation, and/or replacement of the following bridge
projects:  
 

-   **Palm Avenue Overcrossing Bridge in San Diego, California** will
    receive $24 million to make improvements that will reduce traffic
    delays and increase freight movements, while reducing long-term
    maintenance costs. Over 38,000 vehicles cross this bridge every day
    and it is estimated that this project will create over $30 million
    in benefits from reduced congestion and traffic delays on this
    critical route.
-   **Lafayette Avenue Bascule Bridge in Bay City, Michigan** will
    receive $73 million to replace the 85-year-old bridge that serves
    16,000 vehicles per day in the Great Lakes Bay Region. The project
    is expected to save tens of millions of dollars in costs associated
    with travel time and safety improvements.
-   **Castleton-on-Hudson Bridge near Albany, New York** will receive
    $21 million to repair the bridge connecting I-87 in Albany County to
    the New York State/Massachusetts State line, which serves an
    estimated 17,000 vehicles per day. The improvements are projected to
    save tens of millions of dollars in travel time and maintenance
    costs.
-   **Rural bridges in Northwest Oklahoma** will receive $11.5 million
    to replace seven bridges that serve 3,000 vehicles per day,
    improving reliability and capacity for the region’s farmers,
    ranchers and energy workers.
-   **Burgard Bridge in Portland, Oregon** will receive $13.9 million to
    replace a 93-year-old viaduct in the St. John’s neighborhood of
    Portland, which 8,000 vehicles cross every day.
-   **Rural bridges in Northwest South Carolina**, will receive $51.2
    million to replace six bridges ranging from 68 to 101 years old that
    serve an estimated 13,000 vehicles per day and communities that
    heavily rely on these bridges to travel to work and school and
    transport goods across the region. Without the project, these
    bridges would have to close to traffic, causing long delays,
    detours, and travel costs.
-   **The US-59 San Antonio River Bridge in San Antonio, Texas** will
    receive $14 million to replace a bridge that serves over 4,200
    vehicles per day, including many traveling to and from major water
    ports in the area. Without the project the bridge would have to
    close for at least 9 months, leading to a 50-mile detour.
-   **Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge which carries the
    northbound lanes of I-395** will receive $72 million to rehabilitate
    the bridge that serves over 88,000 vehicles per day and connects
    people and goods from Arlington, Virginia to Washington, D.C.
-   **The John Nolen Drive Bridges in Madison, Wisconsin** will receive
    $15.1 million to replace six bridges that serve 45,000 vehicles per
    day along a major artery into downtown Madison.

   
This competitive grant program was limited to bridge projects with
eligible costs of up to $100 million.  
  
**BUILDING BRIDGES FROM COAST TO COAST**  
  
There are more than 43,000 bridges in poor condition across the United
States in need of repair. For decades, American presidents have promised
to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure but did not deliver. President
Biden and Vice President Harris brought together Democrats,
Independents, and Republicans to pass the most transformative investment
in transportation infrastructure since passage of the Eisenhower-era
Interstate Highway Act of 1956. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
includes a historic $40 billion in dedicated investment to repair or
replace bridges across the country, with additional funding streams to
advance major and rural-focused bridge repair. This funding will help us
fix some of the nation’s most significant bridges and at least 15,000
smaller bridges across the country.  
  
Today’s grant announcements come on top of billions of dollars in other
bridge and highway funding already flowing to every U.S. state and
territory that is helping communities rebuild, repair, and replace 
thousands of bridges across the nation and restoring connections that
are vital to commuters, emergency responders, truck drivers, public
transit riders, and more.

-   In January 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the
    new Bridge Formula Program, which provides funding for states,
    tribes, and territories to repair bridges over five years, including
    $5.5 billion in 2022. Another $5.5 billion was released for 2023. 
    Several projects already benefitting from this funding include:
    -   Rehabilitation of the West Mission Bay Drive Bridge in San
        Diego, California, which Infrastructure Coordinator Landrieu and
        Federal Highways Administrator Shailen Bhatt cut a ribbon on
        last week;
    -   Repair of the I-270 Bridge over the Mississippi River which
        connects St. Louis, Missouri and Madison County, Illinois;
    -   Repair of the Dare Country Bridge in North Carolina which
        connects Roanoke Island to the mainland of North Carolina and is
        one of the longest bridges in the state; and,
    -   Repair of the I-65 Bridge over the Sepulga River in Alabama
        which was built in 1960 and is an important transportation route
        for this rural community.
-   In October 2022, FHWA announced $20 million in [bridge
    planning](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-bipartisan-infrastructure-laws-first-bridge)
    grants for 24 projects in 24 states.  Those grants were designed to
    create a pipeline of construction-ready bridge projects that are now
    in the early stages of project development.
-   In January 2023, FHWA announced $2.1 billion in
    [large-bridge](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-21-billion-improve-four-nationally-significant)
    project grants to make critical improvements to four nationally
    significant bridges: the Brent Spence Bridge connecting Kentucky and
    Ohio; the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California; the Gold
    Star Memorial Bridge in New London, Connecticut; and the Calumet
    River Bridges in Chicago, Illinois. These bridges serve as a vital
    link for local residents, communities, and both the regional and
    national economy. In addition to the four FY22 large-bridge project
    grants, FHWA also announced an additional bridge planning grant to
    the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the amount of $1.6 million to
    advance critical planning work in support of replacement of the
    Bourne and Sagamore Bridges over the Cape Cod Canal.
-   Regionally or nationally significant bridges have also received
    funding under other Department of Transportation grant programs,
    including the “RAISE”, “INFRA”, “RURAL”, and “MEGA” programs
    including:
    -   Replacement of the Calcasieu River I-10 Bridge Replacement in
        Louisiana;
    -   Replacement of the Alligator River Bridge on U.S. Highway 64
        with a modern high-rise fixed span bridge along the primary
        east-west route in northeastern North Carolina between I-95 and
        the Outer Banks;
    -   Replacement of the existing I-39/90/94 Wisconsin River Bridge
        with two new bridge spans;
    -   Rehabilitation of the Newport Pell Bridge, a 4-lane suspension
        bridge that carries Route 138 over the Narragansett Bay and
        connects mainland Rhode Island to Newport;
    -   Replacement of the Winooski River Bridge that carries US Routes
        2 and 7 between Winooski and Burlington, Vermont; and,
    -   Reconstruction of the Stillwater River Bridge on West Reserve
        Drive in Kalispell, Montana.

In his first State of the Union Address in 2022, President Biden
highlighted how our historic federal investments in infrastructure would
create a visible impact in the lives of American families by committing
to start repair on 1,500 bridges. In his 2023 State of the Union, he was
able to outline how the Administration surpassed these goals, launching
over 3,700 bridge repair and replacement projects across the country.
Today, the number of bridge repair and replacement projects started
through support from the Biden-Harris Administration has passed 4,600.
