title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Holding Gun Manufacturers\_\
  Accountable"
---
 
Yesterday, Stefanie Feldman, Deputy Assistant to the President and
Senior Advisor to the Domestic Policy Advisor, and Morgan Mohr, Senior
Advisor to the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, met with state
legislators from across the country to discuss state efforts to hold gun
manufacturers accountable. As the President continues to call for the
repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) — a
federal law that denies many victims of gun violence their day in court
and prevents the public from holding gunmakers accountable — the White
House is also working with state and local officials to advance
strategies to hold gun manufacturers and dealers accountable for
unlawful conduct. During yesterday’s meeting, White House officials and
state legislators discussed nationwide efforts to hold the gun industry
accountable, the implementation of existing gun industry accountability
laws in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, and California, and legislative
measures under consideration in states including Colorado and Illinois.
White House officials also thanked the legislators for their leadership
and continued partnership in the effort to protect communities across
the country from gun violence. The convening follows a
