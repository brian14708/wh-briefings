title: "Readout of Second Meeting of the Ukraine Donor Coordination Platform Steering\_\
  Committee"
---
 
Today, Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Mike
Pyle, together with Finance Minister of Ukraine, Sergii Marchenko, and
European Commission Director-General for Neighborhood and Enlargement
Negotiations, Gert Jan Koopman, co-chaired the second meeting of the
Steering Committee of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for
Ukraine. The Government of Ukraine and G7 Members of the Steering
Committee, and representatives from international financial
institutions, discussed coordination of economic support for Ukraine’s
financing needs and future economic recovery and reconstruction efforts.
Ukraine highlighted its early recovery priorities for 2023 in the areas
of energy infrastructure, civilian demining, critical and social
infrastructure, housing, and support to the private sector. Ukraine also
provided an update on its reform agenda, supported by the recently
approved IMF program, to underpin its recovery on the path toward EU
accession. Deputy National Security Advisor Pyle reiterated the United
States’ commitment to support Ukraine for as long as it takes and
ensuring that funding is effectively overseen. He concurred with the
Steering Committee members and participants on the Platform’s important
role as a catalyst for mobilizing the international commitments required
to respond to Ukraine’s needs in 2023 and beyond. Collaboration will
continue in the coming weeks, and the Steering Committee will hold its
next meeting in May.
