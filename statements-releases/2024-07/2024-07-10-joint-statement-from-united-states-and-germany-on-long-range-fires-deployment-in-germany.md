title: "Joint Statement from United\_States and Germany on Long-Range Fires Deployment\
  \ in\_Germany"
---
 
*Following discussions ahead of the NATO Summit, the governments of the
United States and Germany released the following joint statement:*

The United States will begin episodic deployments of the long-range
fires capabilities of its Multi-Domain Task Force in Germany in 2026, as
part of planning for enduring stationing of these capabilities in the
future.  When fully developed, these conventional long-range fires units
will include SM-6, Tomahawk, and developmental hypersonic weapons, which
have significantly longer range than current land-based fires in
Europe.  Exercising these advanced capabilities will demonstrate the
United States’ commitment to NATO and its contributions to European
integrated deterrence.
