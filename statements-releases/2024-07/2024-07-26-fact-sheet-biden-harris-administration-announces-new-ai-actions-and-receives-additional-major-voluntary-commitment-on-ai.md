title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New AI Actions and\
  \ Receives Additional Major Voluntary Commitment on\_AI"
---
 
Nine months ago, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order to
ensure that America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing
the risks of artificial intelligence (AI).  
  
This Executive Order built on the voluntary commitments he and Vice
President Harris received from 15 leading U.S. AI companies last year.
**Today, the administration announced that Apple has signed onto the
voluntary commitments, further cementing these commitments as
cornerstones of responsible AI innovation.**  
  
**In addition, federal agencies reported that they completed all of the
270-day actions in the Executive Order on schedule, following their
on-time completion of every other task required to date**. Agencies also
progressed on other work directed for longer timeframes.  
  
**Following the Executive Order and a series of** [**calls to action
made by Vice President
Harris**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/01/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-new-u-s-initiatives-to-advance-the-safe-and-responsible-use-of-artificial-intelligence/)
**as part of her** [**major policy
speech**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/11/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-london-united-kingdom/)
**before the Global Summit on AI Safety, agencies all across government
have acted boldly. They have taken steps to mitigate AI’s safety and
security risks, protect Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil
rights, stand up for consumers and workers, promote innovation and
competition, advance American leadership around the world, and more.**
Actions that agencies reported today as complete include the
following:  
  
**<u>Managing Risks to Safety and Security:</u>**  
Over 270 days, the Executive Order directed agencies to take sweeping
action to address AI’s safety and security risks, including by releasing
vital safety guidance and building capacity to test and evaluate AI. To
protect safety and security, agencies have:

1.  **Released for public comment new technical guidelines from the AI
    Safety Institute (AISI) for leading AI developers in managing the
    evaluation of misuse of dual-use foundation models.** AISI’s
    guidelines detail how leading AI developers can help prevent
    increasingly capable AI systems from being misused to harm
    individuals, public safety, and national security, as well as how
    developers can increase transparency about their products.  
2.  **Published final frameworks on managing generative AI risks and
    securely developing generative AI systems and dual-use foundation
    models.** These documents by the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) will provide additional guidance that builds on
    NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework, which offered individuals,
    organizations, and society a framework to manage AI risks and has
    been widely adopted both in the U.S. and globally. NIST also
    submitted a report to the White House outlining tools and techniques
    to reduce the risks from synthetic content.  
3.  **Developed and expanded AI testbeds and model evaluation tools at
    the Department of Energy (DOE).** DOE, in coordination with
    interagency partners, is using its
    [testbeds](https://energy.gov/cet/artificial-intelligence-testbeds-doe)
    to evaluate AI model safety and security, especially for risks that
    AI models might pose to critical infrastructure, energy security,
    and national security. DOE’s testbeds are also being used to explore
    novel AI hardware and software systems, including privacy-enhancing
    technologies that improve AI trustworthiness. The National Science
    Foundation (NSF) also launched an
    [initiative](https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-new-ai-test-beds-initiative-advance?auHash=B8eQ9x13mVVw7GoLz2gJoDiqAIMygddt_s7Hojlh9M8)
    to help fund researchers outside the federal government design and
    plan AI-ready testbeds.  
4.  **Reported results of piloting AI to protect vital government
    software. **The Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of
    Homeland Security (DHS) reported findings from their AI pilots to
    address vulnerabilities in government networks used, respectively,
    for national security purposes and for civilian government. These
    steps build on previous work to advance such pilots within 180 days
    of the Executive Order.  
5.  **Issued a** [**call to
    action**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2024/05/23/a-call-to-action-to-combat-image-based-sexual-abuse/)
    **from the Gender Policy Council and Office of Science and
    Technology Policy to combat image-based sexual abuse, including
    synthetic content generated by AI.** Image-based sexual abuse has
    emerged as one of the fastest growing harmful uses of AI to-date,
    and the call to action invites technology companies and other
    industry stakeholders to curb it. This call flowed from [Vice
    President Harris’s
    remarks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/11/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-london-united-kingdom/)
    in London before the AI Safety Summit, which underscored that
    deepfake image-based sexual abuse is an urgent threat that demands
    global action.

**Bringing AI Talent into Government**  
Last year, the Executive Order launched a government-wide AI Talent
Surge that is bringing hundreds of AI and AI-enabling professionals into
government. Hired individuals are working on critical AI missions, such
as informing efforts to use AI for permitting, advising on AI
investments across the federal government, and writing policy for the
use of AI in government.

1.  To increase AI capacity across the federal government for both
    national security and non-national security missions, the AI Talent
    Surge has made over 200 hires to-date, including through the
    [Presidential Innovation Fellows AI
    cohort](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/presidential-innovation-fellows-launches-first-cohort-focused-exclusively-on-artificial-intelligence-06172024)
    and the [DHS AI
    Corps](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/06/25/dhs-hires-first-10-experts-ai-corps-recruiting-sprint).  
2.  Building on the [AI Talent Surge 6-month
    report](https://ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Talent-Surge-Progress-Report.pdf),
    the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy [announced
    new
    commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/07/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-commitments-from-across-technology-ecosystem-including-nearly-100-million-to-advance-public-interest-technology/)
    from across the technology ecosystem, including nearly $100 million
    in funding, to bolster the broader public interest technology
    ecosystem and build infrastructure for bringing technologists into
    government service.

**Advancing Responsible AI Innovation**  
President Biden’s Executive Order directed further actions to seize AI’s
promise and deepen the U.S. lead in AI innovation while ensuring AI’s
responsible development and use across our economy and society. Within
270 days, agencies have:

1.  **Prepared and will soon release a report on the potential benefits,
    risks, and implications of dual-use foundation models for which the
    model weights are widely available, including related policy
    recommendations.** The Department of Commerce’s report draws on
    extensive outreach to experts and stakeholders, including hundreds
    of public comments submitted on this topic.  
2.  **Awarded over 80 research teams’ access to computational and other
    AI resources through the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR)
    pilot**—a national infrastructure led by NSF, in partnership with
    DOE, NIH, and other governmental and nongovernmental partners, that
    makes available resources to support the nation’s AI research and
    education community. Supported projects will tackle deepfake
    detection, advance AI safety, enable next-generation medical
    diagnoses and further other critical AI priorities.
3.  **Released a**
    [**guide**](https://tech.ed.gov/files/2024/07/Designing-for-Education-with-Artificial-Intelligence-An-Essential-Guide-for-Developers.pdf)
    **for designing safe, secure, and trustworthy AI tools for use in
    education.** The Department of Education’s guide discusses how
    developers of educational technologies can design AI that benefits
    students and teachers while advancing equity, civil rights, trust,
    and transparency. This work builds on the Department’s 2023
    [report](https://tech.ed.gov/files/2023/05/ai-future-of-teaching-and-learning-report.pdf)
    outlining recommendations for the use of AI in teaching and
    learning.  
4.  **Published guidance on evaluating the eligibility of patent claims
    involving inventions related to AI technology, **as well as other
    emerging technologies. The guidance by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
    Office will guide those inventing in the AI space to protect their
    AI inventions and assist patent examiners reviewing applications for
    patents on AI inventions.
5.  **Issued a**
    [**report**](https://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/AI-Research-and-Development-Progress-Report-2020-2024.pdf)
    **on federal research and development (R&D) to advance trustworthy
    AI over the past four years.** The report by the National Science
    and Technology Council examines an annual federal AI R&D budget of
    nearly $3 billion.  
6.  **Launched a $23 million initiative to promote the use of
    privacy-enhancing technologies to solve real-world problems,
    including related to AI.** Working with industry and agency
    partners, NSF will invest through its new Privacy-preserving Data
    Sharing in Practice program in efforts to apply, mature, and scale
    privacy-enhancing technologies for specific use cases and establish
    testbeds to accelerate their adoption.  
7.  **Announced millions of dollars in further investments to advance
    responsible AI development and use throughout our society.** These
    include $30 million invested through NSF’s Experiential Learning in
    Emerging and Novel Technologies program—which supports inclusive
    experiential learning in fields like AI—and $10 million through
    NSF’s ExpandAI program, which helps build capacity in AI research at
    minority-serving institutions while fostering the development of a
    diverse, AI-ready workforce.

**Advancing U.S. Leadership Abroad**  
President Biden’s Executive Order emphasized that the United States lead
global efforts to unlock AI’s potential and meet its challenges. To
advance U.S. leadership on AI, agencies have:

1.  **Issued a comprehensive plan for U.S. engagement on global AI
    standards.** The plan, developed by the NIST, incorporates broad
    public and private-sector input, identifies objectives and priority
    areas for AI standards work, and lays out actions for U.S.
    stakeholders including U.S. agencies. NIST and others agencies will
    report on priority actions in 180 days.   
2.  **Developed**
    [**guidance**](https://www.state.gov/risk-management-profile-for-ai-and-human-rights/)
    **for managing risks to human rights posed by AI.** The Department
    of State’s “Risk Management Profile for AI and Human
    Rights”—developed in close coordination with NIST and the U.S.
    Agency for International Development—recommends actions based on the
    NIST AI Risk Management Framework to governments, the private
    sector, and civil society worldwide, to identify and manage risks to
    human rights arising from the design, development, deployment, and
    use of AI. 
3.  **Launched a global network of AI Safety Institutes and other
    government-backed scientific offices** to advance AI safety at a
    technical level. This network will accelerate critical information
    exchange and drive toward common or compatible safety evaluations
    and policies.  
4.  **Launched a landmark United Nations General Assembly resolution**.
    The unanimously adopted resolution, with more than 100 co-sponsors,
    lays out a common vision for countries around the world to promote
    the safe and secure use of AI to address global challenges.  
5.  **Expanded global support for the U.S.-led Political Declaration on
    the Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and
    Autonomy.**  Fifty-five nations now endorse the political
    declaration, which outlines a set of norms for the responsible
    development, deployment, and use of military AI capabilities.

The Table below summarizes many of the activities that federal agencies
have completed in response to the Executive Order:
