Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad and unwavering against
all Iran-backed threats, including Lebanese Hezbollah. The attack by
Lebanese Hezbollah this weekend, which killed 12 children and teenagers
playing soccer, was horrific. Israel has a right to defend itself
against the severe threats it faces. At the same time, the United States
is continuing to work on a diplomatic solution to end these terrible
attacks and allow citizens on both sides to safely return to their
homes.
