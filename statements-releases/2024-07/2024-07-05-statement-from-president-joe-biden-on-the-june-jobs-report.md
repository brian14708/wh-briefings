title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the June Jobs\_Report"
---
 
With today’s report that 206,000 jobs were created last month, a record
15.7 million jobs have been created during my Administration. We have
more work to do, but wages are growing faster than prices and more
Americans are joining the workforce, with the highest share of
working-age Americans in the workforce in over 20 years. That’s real
progress for hardworking families who have the dignity and respect that
comes with earning a paycheck and putting food on the table.

Too many Americans are still feeling squeezed by the cost of the living.
I’m fighting to lower costs by taking on corporate price gouging,
capping the cost of insulin and prescription drugs, and calling on
Congress to lower rent by building 2 million new homes. Congressional
Republicans have a different vision that sides with billionaires and
special interests and will supercharge inflation. They’ll impose high
consumer tariffs that will cost middle class families thousands of
dollars each year,  give a giant tax cut to the wealthy, repeal the
Affordable Care Act, and allow big corporations to keep ripping off
Americans. While they fight for Park Avenue, I’ll keep fighting for
working families like the ones I grew up with in Scranton.
