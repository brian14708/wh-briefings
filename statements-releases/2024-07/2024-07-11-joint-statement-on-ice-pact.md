title: "Joint Statement on ICE\_Pact"
---
 
As leaders of Arctic nations, Canada, Finland, and the United States,
recognizing the enduring importance of the region to our collective
economic, climate, and national security, we resolve to deepen our
cooperation to ensure thepolar and Arctic regions remain peaceful,
cooperative, and prosperous. As part of this effort, we are announcing
an enhanced trilateral partnership called the Icebreaker Collaboration
Effort or ICE Pact.

Through ICE Pact, our governments will build on our longstanding and
ongoing bilateral ties. As the first initiative under ICE Pact, we will
commit to a collaborative effort to continue building best-in-class
Arctic and polar icebreakers and other Arctic and polar capabilities in
each of our respective countries by sharing expertise, information, and
capabilities. Over the next six months, we also will jointly develop an
implementation plan for this collaboration to build these highly complex
and critical vessels for our allies and partners with interests and
responsibilities in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.

This partnership will strengthen the shipbuilding industries in each
nation with the goal of creating good-paying jobs in shipyards, marine
equipment manufacturers, and many other related services across all
three countries. In the Arctic, new, faster shipping lanes hold the
potential to create new economic opportunities and drive down shipping
costs. And in the Antarctic, our partnership can also foster increased
scientific research and international collaboration.

This partnership is about more than the collective production of polar
icebreakers and capabilities, including Arctic and polar-capable ships.
It is about providing the capability for like-minded nations to uphold
international rules, norms, and standards to sustain peace and stability
in the Arctic and Antarctic regions for generations to come.
