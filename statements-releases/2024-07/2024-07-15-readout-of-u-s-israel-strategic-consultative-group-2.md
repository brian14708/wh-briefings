Today at the White House, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and
Secretary of State Antony Blinken hosted Israeli National Security
Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, and a
senior Israeli interagency delegation for a meeting of the U.S.-Israel
Strategic Consultative Group. They were joined by senior representatives
from their respective foreign policy, defense, and intelligence
agencies. The discussion centered on countering Iran’s threats to Israel
and the broader region. Mr. Sullivan affirmed President Biden’s ironclad
commitment to Israel’s security, including in the face of ongoing and
reckless attacks against Israel by Lebanese Hezbollah. He emphasized
that Israel has every right to defend itself against these attacks, and
affirmed U.S. support for a diplomatic resolution that permits Israeli
and Lebanese families to safely and securely return to their homes. They
also discussed developments with respect to Iran’s nuclear program, and
discussed mutual coordination on a series of measures to ensure that
Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon. Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Blinken, Mr.
Dermer, and Mr. Hanegbi also discussed developments in Gaza and progress
towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The Israeli side affirmed
its full support for the deal as outlined by President Biden and
endorsed by the UN Security Council, G7, and countries around the
world.
