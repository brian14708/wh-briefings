title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Next Steps on Student Debt\_Cancellation"
---
 
Today, my Administration took another major step to cancel student debt
for approximately 30 million Americans.  By providing more information
to borrowers on how they can take advantage of our upcoming debt relief
programs, borrowers will be prepared to benefit swiftly once the rules
are final. Despite attempts led by Republican elected officials to block
our efforts, we won’t stop fighting to provide relief to student loan
borrowers, fix the broken student loan system, and help borrowers get
out from under the burden of student debt. 

Today’s announcement comes on top of the significant progress we’ve made
for students and borrowers over the past three years. That includes
canceling student debt for nearly 5 million Americans so far through
various actions; providing the largest increases to the maximum Pell
Grant in over a decade; fixing Income-Driven Repayment so borrowers get
the relief they are entitled to under the law; and holding colleges
accountable for taking advantage of students and families.

From day one of my Administration, I promised to fight to ensure higher
education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.
I will never stop working to make higher education affordable and to
make sure our Administration delivers for the American people.
