title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Arrest of Two Drug Trafficker Leaders\
  \ of the Sinaloa\_Cartel"

Yesterday, [the Department of
Justice arrested](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-arrests-alleged-leaders-sinaloa-cartel-ismael) Ismael
Zambada Garcia (AKA “El Mayo”) and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, two of the most
notorious leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the deadliest
enterprises in the world. They are being charged for leading the
Cartel’s deadly drug manufacturing and trafficking networks. I commend
the work of our law enforcement officials who made this arrest for their
ongoing work to bring Sinaloa Cartel leaders to justice. 

  
Too many of our citizens have lost their lives to the scourge of
fentanyl. Too many families have been broken and are suffering because
of this destructive drug. My Administration will continue doing
everything we can to hold deadly drug traffickers to account and to save
American lives.
