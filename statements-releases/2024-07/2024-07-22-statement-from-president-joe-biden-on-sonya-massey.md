title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Sonya\_Massey"
---
 
Sonya Massey, a beloved mother, friend, daughter, and young Black woman,
should be alive today. Sonya called the police because she was concerned
about a potential intruder. When we call for help, all of us as
Americans – regardless of who we are or where we live – should be able
to do so without fearing for our lives. Sonya’s death at the hands of a
responding officer reminds us that all too often Black Americans face
fears for their safety in ways many of the rest of us do not.

Sonya’s family deserves justice. I am heartbroken for her children and
her entire family as they face this unthinkable and senseless loss. Jill
and I mourn with the rest of the country and our prayers are with
Sonya’s family, loved ones, and community during this devastating time.

I commend the swift actions that were taken by the Springfield State’s
Attorney’s office. While we wait for the case to be prosecuted, let us
pray to comfort the grieving. Congress must pass the George Floyd
Justice in Policing Act now. Our fundamental commitment to justice is at
stake.
