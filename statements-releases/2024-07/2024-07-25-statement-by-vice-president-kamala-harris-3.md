title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris"
---
 
Yesterday, at Union Station in Washington, D.C. we saw despicable
acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.    
   
I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist
organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel
and kill Jews. Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must
not tolerate it in our nation.   
   
I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our
highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It
should never be desecrated in that way.   
   
I support the right to peacefully protest, but let’s be
clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our
nation.
