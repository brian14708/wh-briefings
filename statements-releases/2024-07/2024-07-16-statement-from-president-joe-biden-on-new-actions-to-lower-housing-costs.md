title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on New Actions to Lower Housing\_Costs"
---
 
Families deserve housing that’s affordable—it’s part of the American
Dream. Rent is too high and buying a home is out of reach for too many
working families and young Americans, after decades of failure to build
enough homes. I’m determined to turn that around.

Today, I’m sending a clear message to corporate landlords: If you raise
rents more than 5% on existing units, you should lose valuable tax
breaks. My Administration is also taking action to cut red tape and
repurpose public land to build more affordable homes—including thousands
of new homes in Nevada—and announcing new grants to build thousands of
homes from Las Vegas to Syracuse. And I’m reiterating my call for
Congress to pass my plan to build 2 million new homes—to lower housing
costs for good, we need to build, build, build.

While the prior administration gave special tax breaks to corporate
landlords, I’m working to lower housing costs for families. Republicans
in Congress should join Democrats to pass my plan to lower housing costs
for Americans who need relief now.
