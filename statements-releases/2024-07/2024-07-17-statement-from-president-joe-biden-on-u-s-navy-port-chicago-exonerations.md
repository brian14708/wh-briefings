Today, the U.S. Navy is righting an historic wrong by announcing the
exoneration of 258 Black Sailors who were unjustly tried and convicted
of mutiny and disobeying orders following the tragic explosion at Port
Chicago, California nearly 80 years ago. At the time, future Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall represented the “Port Chicago 50” in
their appeal of their courts-martial convictions, writing that, “justice
can only be done in this case by a complete reversal of findings.” With
this action, we are answering that call.

On July 17, 1944, two U.S. Navy ships were destroyed when the S.S. E.A.
Bryan cargo ship exploded at Port Chicago while being loaded with
ammunition. This explosion, the deadliest home-front disaster in the
U.S. during World War II, led to the tragic deaths of 320 Sailors and
civilians, with hundreds more injured. In the wake of that tragedy,
Black Sailors were required to clean up the carnage and return to the
dangerous work of handling munitions without adequate training and
protective equipment while white Sailors were granted leave. In the face
of this injustice, 258 Black Sailors refused orders to load ammunition
and soon after were convicted at courts-martials for disobeying orders
and mutiny.

After conducting a careful and deliberative review, the U.S. Navy has
determined that the courts-martials for all 258 Black Sailors were
fundamentally unfair, plagued by legal errors, and tainted by racial
discrimination. Today’s announcement marks the end of a long and arduous
journey for these Black Sailors and their families, who fought for a
nation that denied them equal justice under law. May we all remember
their courage, sacrifice, and service to our Nation.
