title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the June Consumer Price\_Index"
---
 
Today’s report shows that we are making significant progress fighting
inflation. Overall prices fell last month, after staying flat in May,
and core inflation is the lowest in more than three years. Prices are
falling for cars, appliances, and airfares, and grocery prices have
fallen since the beginning of the year. Thanks to my economic plan,
wages are rising faster than prices, we’ve created 15.7 million jobs,
and communities that were left behind by my predecessor are making “a
remarkable comeback.”

Prices are still too high. Big corporations making record profits need
to do more to lower prices. I’m fighting to give families more breathing
room by taking on Big Pharma to cap insulin at $35 per month, taking on
Big Oil to lower prices at the pump, and taking on Wall Street to make
the wealthy pay their fair share. Republicans are only looking after
themselves. They want to cut taxes for billionaires and raise costs for
the middle class by $2,500, which Nobel economists and business leaders
agree will “reignite” inflation. While Republicans side with special
interests, I’ll do everything I can for the working people that built
our economy.
