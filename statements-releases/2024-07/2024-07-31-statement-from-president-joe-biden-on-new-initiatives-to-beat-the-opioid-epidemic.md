  Epidemic"

[Our Administration’s
efforts ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/31/fact-sheet-biden-%e2%81%a0harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-counter-the-scourge-of-fentanyl-and-other-synthetic-drugs/)have
helped lead to the first decline in overdose deaths in five years.  We
have seized more fentanyl at our border in the last two years than in
the last five years combined, arrested and prosecuted dozens of
high-level drug traffickers and cartel leaders, sanctioned over 300
entities and individuals involved in the global illicit drug trade, and
forged historic counternarcotics cooperation with China. Still, far too
many of our fellow Americans continue to lose loved ones to fentanyl.
This is a time to act. And this is a time to stand together—for all
those we have lost, and for all the lives we can still save.  
   
Today, I will issue a National Security Memorandum directing every
federal Department and Agency to do even more to stop the flow of
narcotics—including fentanyl—into our country.  
   
This Memorandum builds on my [Unity
Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/08/fact-sheet-president-bidens-unity-agenda-for-the-nation/),
which made ending the opioid epidemic a top priority. It will enable our
government to disrupt drug cartels—and their suppliers and
financiers—more quickly and effectively. It will increase intelligence
collection on traffickers’ evolving tactics to smuggle narcotics into
our country. And it will help our law enforcement personnel seize more
deadly drugs before they reach our communities. This Memorandum will
also complement our historic work to expand access to treatment,
including by making naloxone—the life-saving medication that reverses
the effects of opioids—widely available over the counter for the first
time.   
   
I’m calling on Congress to do their part—including passing the
Biden-Harris Administration’s “Detect and Defeat” proposals. These
bipartisan proposals increase penalties on drug smugglers, give border
officials key tools they need to target fentanyl at our border, and
close other loopholes that traffickers exploit. I also once again urge
Congress to pass the bipartisan border security agreement which provides
funding for more border agents and more drug detection machines. These
are the key investments needed to stop fentanyl from reaching our
communities.
