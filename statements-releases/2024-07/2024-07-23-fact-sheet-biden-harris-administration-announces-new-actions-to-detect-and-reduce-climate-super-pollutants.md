title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Detect\
  \ and Reduce Climate Super\_Pollutants"
---
 
Half of today’s climate change is caused by super pollutant greenhouse
gases—including methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and nitrous oxide
(N<sub>2</sub>O)—that are far more potent than carbon dioxide
(CO<sub>2</sub>). Slashing emissions of these super-pollutants is the
fastest way to tackle climate change and a critical complement to
reducing carbon dioxide—while creating good-paying clean energy jobs,
preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths annually due to respiratory
illnesses, and boosting food security. 

Since Day One in office, President Biden has taken historic action to
dramatically reduce U.S. and global super pollutant emissions. For
example, domestically the Biden-Harris administration is implementing
the November 2021 [U.S. Methane Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Methane-Action-Plan-2023-Topper.pdf)
that takes a whole-of-government approach to cut consumer costs, protect
workers and communities, maintain and create high-quality,
union-friendly jobs, and promote U.S. innovation and manufacturing of
critical new technologies essential to tackling the climate crisis.

Globally, President Biden has rallied the world to tackle methane
emissions through the Global Methane Pledge to reduce global methane
emissions 30 percent by 2030, and he signed the [U.S.
ratification](https://www.state.gov/u-s-ratification-of-the-kigali-amendment/)
of the Kigali Amendment, an international agreement to phase down
super-polluting HFCs and avoid up to 0.5 °C of global warming by 2100.
In total, this administration has taken actions that will reduce super
pollutants by nearly 300 megatons per year domestically by 2030,
equivalent to 70 million gasoline-powered cars.

Meanwhile, many Republicans in Congress continue to deny the very
existence of climate change and remain committed to repealing the
President’s Inflation Reduction Act—the biggest climate investment in
history—which would put good-paying jobs in jeopardy and undermine the
health and safety of their own constituents.

**Today the Biden-Harris Administration is hosting a White House Super
Pollutants Summit with U.S. officials, companies, environmental
organizations, unions, philanthropies, and international partners to
announce new domestic and international actions to tackle climate super
pollutants and celebrate successes in reducing super pollutants to date,
including:**

**<u>New Efforts to Advance Detection and Reporting of Super
Pollutants</u>**

-   **The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s
    Global Monitoring Lab and United Airlines **[announced an
    agreement](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-and-united-airlines-partner-to-measure-greenhouse-gases-pollutants)
    on a pioneering collaboration that will use commercial aircraft to
    significantly enhance monitoring of climate pollutants, including
    carbon dioxide and methane, and carbon monoxide and water vapor,
    which will improve understanding of greenhouse gas emissions. The
    Cooperative Research and Development Agreement will aid in the
    development of a new Commercial Aircraft Greenhouse Gas Monitoring
    Program within the Global Monitoring Laboratory.

<!-- -->

-   The **State Department and the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA)** committed to deploy 10 state-of-the-art
    monitoring systems to U.S. embassies and consulates to measure ozone
    and its precursors. The data from these sensors will be used to
    improve the capabilities of climate and air quality satellites and
    develop a new tropospheric ozone forecasting model.

<!-- -->

-   **Carbon Mapper** – a non-profit that leads a public-private
    partnership—including the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA), Planet Labs PBC, and other partners—announced
    the upcoming launch of the first Carbon Mapper Coalition satellite,
    further expanding tools to monitor methane emissions across all
    sectors. The Carbon Mapper Coalition satellites, which are designed
    to detect methane super-emitters at facility-scale from space, will
    build on U.S. private sector and non-profit organization detection
    capability with the launch of **MethaneSAT** by the Environmental
    Defense Fund earlier this year. At the Summit, the Bezos Earth Fund
    announced $10 million in new funding to support MethaneSAT to
    continue to advance satellite-based detection of methane emissions.

**<u>New Industry Leadership to Reduce Nitrous Oxide Emissions</u>**

-   Leading U.S. companies showcased new actions that, by early 2025,
    will reduce overall U.S. industrial emissions of nitrous oxide by
    over 50% since 2020.
    -   **Ascend Performance Materials**, the largest producer of adipic
        acid in the United States, announced the installation of an
        additional thermal reduction unit that has virtually eliminated
        N2O emissions at their Florida facility.

    <!-- -->

    -   **ClimeCo**, a global sustainability company and the largest
        developer of industrial N2O abatement projects in the United
        States, announced three new emissions reduction projects that
        will come online by early 2025 and reduce nitrous oxide
        emissions at the three facilities by approximately 95%.  

**<u>New Initiatives to Reduce Domestic Methane Emissions</u>**

-   As a key part of the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**’s new
    [Clean Air Act rules to reduce methane emissions from oil and
    natural gas
    operations](https://www.epa.gov/controlling-air-pollution-oil-and-natural-gas-operations/epas-final-rule-oil-and-natural-gas)
    by nearly 80% compared to emissions without the rule, the Super
    Emitter Program leverages data collected by EPA-certified
    third-party experts using approved remote sensing technologies (such
    as satellites) to find large methane leaks and releases and notify
    owners and operators. Once notified, owners and operators must
    investigate to find the source of the super emitter event, report
    the results of that investigation to EPA, and repair any leaks or
    releases covered by an EPA standard. To keep the public informed,
    EPA will make the super-emitter data publicly available on a timely
    basis. EPA has begun accepting applications to become certified
    third-party notifiers, and is working with a number of organizations
    that are interested in developing applications.

<!-- -->

-   **EPA** announced it will issue a proposed rule to update its Clean
    Air Act emission standards for new and existing municipal solid
    waste landfills in 2025 to cut and other harmful landfill gas
    emissions, including through incorporating new technologies that
    will better measure and address emissions and reduce harmful air
    pollution in frontline communities.

**<u>New Initiatives to Reduce Global Methane Emissions</u>**

-   Building on three years of international leadership on integrating
    methane reduction into development programming, the **U.S. Agency
    for International Development (USAID)** has formed new partnerships
    with nine private companies to address food loss and waste under its
    Food Loss and Waste Accelerator launched last year. Food loss and
    waste contributes 8-10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,
    including highly toxic methane emissions when discarded or leftover
    food decomposes. USAID will work with nine businesses in Kenya,
    Nepal, and Tanzania over the next two years to upcycle or otherwise
    prevent over 85,000 metric tons of food loss through practices like
    innovative food processing and storage and improved post-harvest
    handling. This will create more than 600 jobs, at least 45 percent
    of which will be held by women, and brings the total number of
    public-private partnerships under the Accelerator to 12.

<!-- -->

-   A consortium of philanthropies – represented by the High Tide
    Foundation – announced more than $300 million to support the
    **Global Methane Hub**, which will catalyze billions of dollars in
    crucial project investments and will be dedicated to reducing
    methane emissions across key sectors, with an emphasis on low- and
    middle-income countries.  The Global Methane Hub was established by
    philanthropies alongside the launch of the Global Methane Pledge and
    has already helped catalyze over $10 billion in methane reducing
    project investments by strategically regranting $200 million to 114
    grantees conducting work in 152 countries.

<!-- -->

-   The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP’s) **International Methane
    Emissions Observatory** (IMEO) announced new participation in the
    Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) since its launch in
    December 2023. Countries representing over two-thirds of oil and gas
    emissions events detected by MARS in 2023 now participate in the
    program with nominated focal points.  These focal points span the
    over 140 member companies of UNEP’s Oil and Gas Methane Partnership
    2.0 and 15 governments of major oil and gas producing countries,
    which represent more than 60% of global oil and gas production.

<!-- -->

-   The **World Bank** announced that, with $10 million in US funding,
    they are advancing the work of mainstreaming methane into their
    global development programming with a first batch of 15 country-led
    programs focused on reducing 10 million tons of methane from the
    livestock, rice, waste and sanitation sectors and benefiting over
    100 million people.

Today’s new actions build on more than three years of work by the
Biden-Harris administration to tackle super-pollutants at home and
abroad.

**Domestic highlights include:**

-   In 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration took [nearly 100 actions to
    dramatically reduce methane
    emissions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Methane-Action-Plan-2023-Topper.pdf)
    under the **U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan**. These
    actions included plugging leaks and regulating emissions in the oil
    and gas sector, reclaiming abandoned coal mines, reducing food waste
    and agricultural emissions, investing in cleaner buildings and
    industrial processes, and launching innovative technologies to
    detect and halt large methane emissions.
-   Yesterday, as part of [$4.3 billion in **Climate Pollution Reduction
    Grants**](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-43-billion-grants-community-driven-solutions-cut)
    from the Inflation Reduction Act, EPA announced several grants to
    reduce super pollutant emissions in states across the country,
    including to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
    to reduce industrial greenhouse gas emissions, to the Hudson Valley
    Regional Council to reduce fugitive methane emissions from closed
    landfills, and to the Colorado Energy Office to reduce methane
    emissions from landfills, coal mines, and natural seepage. In total,
    Climate Pollution Reduction Grant projects are estimated to reduce
    super pollutant emissions through 2030 equivalent to the annual
    energy use of approximately 3.5 million homes.
-   EPA is implementing a national program under the bipartisan
    [American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM)
    Act](https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction/background-hfcs-and-aim-act)
    to achieve an **85% phasedown by 2036 of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)**
    – potent greenhouse gases used in refrigeration, heating and cooling
    equipment, and other sectors. This phasedown will cumulatively
    achieve emissions reductions equivalent to 4.6 billion metric tons
    of carbon dioxide from 2022 to 2050 – equal to approximately three
    years of U.S. power sector emissions at 2019 levels.
-   Last summer, EPA issued a [final
    rule](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-takes-latest-step-national-phasedown-climate-damaging)
    to implement a **40% phasedown of HFCs** starting in 2024. This
    builds on the success of the 10% phasedown that EPA implemented for
    2022 and 2023. The 2024 phasedown establishes a similar allowance
    methodology to provide regulatory certainty to industry and
    stakeholders, ensuring efficient implementation.
-   The Administration’s **Interagency Task Force on Illegal HFC Trade**
    continues to work diligently on robust enforcement mechanisms to
    ensure a level playing field for U.S. companies complying with the
    phasedown requirements. Since the start of the phasedown in January
    2022, the Task Force has prevented illegal HFC shipments at the
    border equivalent to more than 1 million metric tons of carbon
    dioxide – more than the emissions from over 200,000 homes’
    electricity use for one year.
-   In April 2024, **PHMSA** announced nearly $400 million in grants to
    fund 130 projects in 26 states to repair, rehabilitate, or replace
    gas distribution pipelines that are prone to methane leaks and
    ruptures and other safety hazards in predominantly underserved
    communities as part of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law’s first-of-its-kind [**Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure
    and Modernization Grant
    Program**](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/about-phmsa/working-phmsa/grants/pipeline/natural-gas-distribution-infrastructure-safety-and-modernization-grants)**.**

<!-- -->

-   In June 2024, the White House and several federal agencies released
    a [**National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and
    Recycling
    Organics**](https://www.epa.gov/circulareconomy/national-strategy-reducing-food-loss-and-waste-and-recycling-organics)
    which lays out a path for the U.S. to meet its national goal of
    reducing food loss and waste by 50% by 2030. Preventing food loss
    and waste and increasing recycling of food and other organic
    materials has important benefits including reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions, saving households and businesses money, and building
    cleaner, healthier communities.

<!-- -->

-   In May 2024, EPA issued a final rule to strengthen, expand and
    update methane emissions reporting requirements for petroleum and
    natural gas systems under [**their Greenhouse Gas Reporting
    Program**](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-rule-cut-methane-emissions-strengthen-and),
    as required by the IRA. The final revisions will ensure greater
    transparency and accountability for methane pollution from oil and
    natural gas facilities by improving the accuracy of annual emissions
    reporting from these operations. 
-   In June 2024, EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [announced
    the
    availability](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-doe-announce-850-million-reduce-methane-pollution-oil-and-gas-sector)
    of $850 million in Inflation Reduction Act funding through the
    [**Methane Emissions Reduction
    Program**](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/methane-emissions-reduction-program)
    to help oil and natural gas sector operators reduce methane
    emissions and transition to available and innovative methane
    emissions reduction technologies. The program also aims to improve
    emissions data collection and measurement at all scales (ground
    level, aerial, and satellite) and provide accurate, transparent data
    and monitoring capability to impacted communities.
-   In the first half of 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration has been
    supporting the development of measurement, modeling, and data
    standards for detecting methane concentrations and quantifying point
    source emissions through the [**2023 National Strategy to Advance an
    Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring and
    Information
    System**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NationalGHGMMISStrategy-2023.pdf).

**International highlights include:**

-   At COP26 in Glasgow, alongside European Commission President von der
    Leyen, **President Biden**
    [launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-tackles-methane-emissions-spurs-innovations-and-supports-sustainable-agriculture-to-build-a-clean-energy-economy-and-create-jobs/)
    the Global Methane Pledge, which now has 157 countries committed to
    the global goal of reducing methane 30 percent by 2030.
-   At the Major Economies Forum in 2022, President Biden unveiled the
    [**Methane Finance
    Sprint**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-catalyze-global-climate-action-through-the-major-economies-forum-on-energy-and-climate/),
    which catalyzed over $1 billion in new grant funding in 2023 to help
    developing countries reduce methane across sectors.
-   After the successful ratification of the Kigali Amendment, the Biden
    Administration worked with partners to leverage U.S. contributions
    to the **Montreal Protocol’s Multilateral Fund** to raise nearly $1
    billion to support HFC phasedown and related energy efficiency
    measures.
-   Thanks to U.S. leadership in driving consensus, all parties agreed
    as part of the **Global Stocktake** outcome at COP28 to include all
    greenhouse gases – including super pollutants – in their 2035
    Nationally Determined Contributions due in early 2025.
