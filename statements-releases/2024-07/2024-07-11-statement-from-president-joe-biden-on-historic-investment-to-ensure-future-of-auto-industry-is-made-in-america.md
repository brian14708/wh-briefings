title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic Investment to Ensure Future\
  \ of Auto Industry is Made in\_America"
---
 
Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union
autoworkers and automakers. This investment will create thousands of
good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more—from Lansing,
Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia – by helping auto companies retool,
reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities. This delivers
on my commitment to never give up on the manufacturing communities and
workers that were left behind by my predecessor and are now making a
comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion
grants my administration is announcing today. These grants will help
ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American
union workers. I’ll never stop fighting for the American auto industry
and American autoworkers.
