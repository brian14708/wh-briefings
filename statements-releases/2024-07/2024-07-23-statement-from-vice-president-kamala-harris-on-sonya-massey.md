title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Sonya\_Massey"
---
 
Sonya Massey deserved to be safe. After she called the police for help,
she was tragically killed in her own home at the hands of a responding
officer sworn to protect and serve. Doug and I send strength and prayers
to Sonya’s family and friends, and we join them in grieving her
senseless death.  
   
Our thoughts are also with the communities across our nation whose calls
for help are often met with suspicion, distrust, and even violence. The
disturbing footage released yesterday confirms what we know from the
lived experiences of so many – we have much work to do to ensure that
our justice system fully lives up to its name.  
   
I join President Biden in commending the swift action of the State’s
Attorney’s Office and in calling on Congress to pass the George Floyd
Justice in Policing Act, a bill that I coauthored in the Senate. In this
moment, in honor of Sonya’s memory and the memory of so many more whose
names we may never know, we must come together to achieve meaningful
reforms that advance the safety of all communities.
