title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on United\_States Secret Service Director\
  \ Kim\_Cheatle"
---
 
Jill and I are grateful to Director Kim Cheatle for her decades of
public service. She has selflessly dedicated and risked her life to
protect our nation throughout her career in the United States Secret
Service. We especially thank her for answering the call to lead the
Secret Service during our Administration and we are grateful for her
service to our family.

As a leader, it takes honor, courage, and incredible integrity to take
full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most
challenging jobs in public service.Â 

The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13
continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know
what happened that day can never happen again. As we move forward, I
wish Kim all the best, and I will plan to appoint a new Director soon.
