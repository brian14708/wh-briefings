title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Delivers Environmental Justice\
  \ with Cleaner Air, Clean Water, and Healthier\_Communities"
---
 
President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that every person has
a right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live in a healthy
community – now and into the future. During his first week in office,
President Biden launched the most ambitious environmental justice agenda
in our nation’s history. Today, at the first-ever White House Summit on
Environmental Justice in Action, the Biden-Harris Administration
released detailed progress reports from 24 federal agencies showcasing
how the President is delivering for communities that have faced
longstanding environmental injustices and inequities.

The second annual [Environmental Justice
Scorecard](https://ejscorecard.geoplatform.gov/scorecard/) describes the
impacts and benefits of more than $600 billion in federal investments
that President Biden has secured over Fiscal Years 2022-2027, including
through his [Investing in America
agenda](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/), for programs that are part
of the [Justice40
Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).
The goal of the President’s Justice40 Initiative is to deliver 40
percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to
disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and
overburdened by pollution.

The federal agency updates released today outline how these investments
– along with new regulatory protections, stronger enforcement of
environmental laws, and environmental justice reforms across government
– are resulting in cleaner air and water, more affordable clean energy,
good-paying jobs, and other real-world benefits that people are
experiencing today and will continue to experience for decades to come.

In addition to highlighting the unprecedented progress on environmental
justice that has been made over three and a half years under President
Biden’s leadership, the Administration has in recent days – as part of
its [fifth Investing in America
tour](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/17/white-house-launches-fifth-investing-in-america-tour-to-highlight-how-president-bidens-agenda-is-lowering-costs-creating-good-jobs-and-revitalizing-communities-across-the-country/)
– announced nearly $5 billion in funding awards from programs covered by
the Justice40 Initiative. These include the following:

-   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [announced over $4.3
    billion in Climate Pollution Reduction
    Grants](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-43-billion-grants-community-driven-solutions-cut)
    to implement community-driven solutions that tackle the climate
    crisis, reduce air pollution, advance environmental justice, and
    accelerate America’s clean energy transition.

-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development [announced $19
    million](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_190)
    in new grant and loan awards under its [Green and Resilient Retrofit
    Program](https://www.hud.gov/grrp) after [announcing more than $142
    million](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_24_159)
    last month, bringing the total funding awarded under this program to
    more than $773 million. This funding supports significant energy
    efficiency and climate resilience renovations in more than 4,200
    homes at properties housing low-income individuals, families, and
    seniors bringing the total number of homes supported under this
    program to over 20,000.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of the Interior (DOI) [awarded $20
    million](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-204-million-presidents-investing-america-agenda)
    in funding to Alabama to address dangerous and polluting abandoned
    mine lands, create good-paying, family-sustaining jobs, and catalyze
    economic opportunity across the state. With this announcement, DOI
    has now awarded over $1.4 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law to states to remediate abandoned mine lands.

-   Tomorrow, EPA will announce the first round of [Environmental and
    Climate Justice Community Change Grants
    Program](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/inflation-reduction-act-community-change-grants-program)
    selections, the single largest investment in environmental justice
    ever to go directly to communities. These selections will advance
    collaborative efforts to achieve a healthier, safer, and more
    prosperous future for all. EPA has made $2 billion available and
    organizations are [encouraged to
    apply](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/inflation-reduction-act-community-change-grants-program)
    for awards by November 21, 2024. EPA will make selections on a
    rolling basis.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced additional new steps to
further the President’s historic commitment to environmental justice,
including new actions to advance [Executive Order
14096](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-revitalize-our-nations-commitment-to-environmental-justice-for-all/)
on *Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for
All*:

-   The Office of Management and Budget, in coordination with the
    Council on Environmental Quality, published the second annual
    [Environmental Justice
    Scorecard](https://ejscorecard.geoplatform.gov/scorecard/), a
    government-wide assessment of what 24 federal agencies did to
    advance environmental justice in Fiscal Year 2023. The Environmental
    Justice Scorecard incorporates recommendations from the [White House
    Environmental Justice Advisory
    Council](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council/)
    and feedback from the public, environmental justice stakeholders,
    and experts.

<!-- -->

-   The White House Office of Environmental Justice, within the Council
    on Environmental Quality, launched
    [EnvironmentalJustice.gov](https://www.environmentaljustice.gov/), a
    new website that highlights the Administration’s actions on
    environmental justice, features stories of progress across America,
    and shares tools, resources, and funding opportunities to empower
    communities to navigate federal programs and advance environmental
    justice in their neighborhoods.

<!-- -->

-   The Office of Science and Technology Policy, in coordination with
    the Council on Environmental Quality, announced the release of the
    inaugural [Environmental Justice Science, Data, and Research
    Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NSTC-EJ-Research-Plan-July-2024.pdf).
    Directed by President Biden, this plan provides actionable
    recommendations for federal agencies to identify and address
    longstanding barriers and data gaps that relate to environmental
    justice. The plan was developed by 11 agencies and three components
    of the Executive Office of the President that participate in the
    National Science and Technology Council’s Environmental Justice
    Subcommittee and was informed by public input.

<!-- -->

-   The [White House Environmental Justice Interagency
    Council](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-interagency-council/)
    (IAC) adopted a [Memorandum of
    Understanding](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Memorandum-of-Understanding_White-House-Environmental-Justice-Interagency-Council_2024.07.24_FINAL.pdf)
    across 24 principals of 16 federal agencies and eight components of
    the Executive Office of the President to support and advance the
    IAC’s mission to facilitate robust and effective interagency
    coordination on environmental justice.

These announcements build on three and a half years of progress to
advance environmental justice under President Biden’s leadership. Other
recent highlights include:

-   **Delivering on the Justice40 Initiative.** Through President
    Biden’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    the Administration is working hard to deliver 40 percent of the
    overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy,
    affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other
    investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by
    underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. In total, [more than
    500 federal programs across 19 federal
    agencies](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/11/29/biden-harris-administration-continues-to-accelerate-environmental-justice-in-disadvantaged-communities-through-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
    are being reimagined and transformed to meet the Justice40 goal.
    Agencies are using the [Climate and Economic Justice Screening
    Tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5) to
    identify disadvantaged communities.
-   **Making historic investments in environmental justice.** The
    President’s Investing in America agenda makes historic investments
    to advance environmental justice. This includes [$7 billion in Solar
    for All
    Grants](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-7-billion-solar-all-grants-deliver-residential)
    to deliver residential solar, which is saving money for households
    in low-income and disadvantaged communities as part of the [$27
    billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction
    Fund](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-framework-implementation-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-part-president),
    the over [$3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice block grant
    program](https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/inflation-reduction-act-environmental-and-climate-justice-program),
    and [$4 billion to revitalize and reconnect
    communities](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/13/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-over-3-billion-to-reconnect-communities-that-have-been-left-behind-and-divided-by-transportation-infrastructure/)
    that have been left behind and divided by transportation
    infrastructure. Through the [Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-advances-environmental-justice/) and

<!-- -->

-   **Finalizing ambitious regulatory protections for clean air, clean
    water, and fenceline communities.** The Biden-Harris Administration
    has taken broad regulatory action to protect public health and
    secure environmental justice. The EPA established the
    first-ever [national drinking water standard for
    PFAS](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard),
    banned [ongoing uses of
    asbestos](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-ban-ongoing-uses-asbestos-protect-people-cancer),
    and [strengthened lead
    protections](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-strengthens-safeguards-protect-families-and-children-lead)
    and[Mercury and Air Toxics
    Standards](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel).
    To address elevated cancer risk and other harms to fenceline
    communities, the EPA finalized [new health protections to reduce
    exposure to ethylene
    oxide](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-final-rule-slash-toxic-emissions-ethylene-oxide-and-reduce-cancer-risk),
    issued strong standards to [reduce pollution from fossil fuel-fired
    power
    plants](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel),
    finalized [stronger clean air standards for chemical
    plants](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-stronger-clean-air-standards-chemical-plants),
    and improved safety standards to [protect at-risk communities from
    chemical
    accidents](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-stronger-safety-standards-protect-risk-communities-chemical-accidents).
    The EPA also took action to adopt [stronger standards for harmful
    soot
    pollution](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-stronger-standards-harmful-soot-pollution-significantly-increasing),
    which will prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and yield up to $46
    billion in net health benefits, and finalized [national pollution
    standards for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
    vehicles](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-position)
    as well as [heavy-duty
    vehicles](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strongest-ever-greenhouse-gas-standards-heavy)
    that will deliver $13 billion of annual public health benefits due
    to improved air quality.
-   **Prioritizing resilience, jobs, and workers with historic climate
    action.** President Biden has led and delivered on the most
    ambitious climate and environmental justice agenda in history,
    including securing the biggest climate protection bill ever. The
    President launched the [American Climate
    Corps](https://www.acc.gov/), a workforce training and service
    initiative that will ensure more young people have access to the
    skills-based training they need for good-paying careers in the clean
    energy and climate resilience economy. The Climate Corps focuses on
    creating good-paying jobs and advancing environmental justice,
    prioritizing communities traditionally left behind. To protect all
    communities in harm’s way due to extreme weather and climate
    disasters, the Biden-Harris Administration has placed environmental
    and economic justice at the center of its [climate resilience
    agenda](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/National-Climate-Resilience-Framework-FINAL.pdf).
    For example, the [President’s Fiscal Year 2025 Budget invests $23
    billion in climate adaptation and
    resilience](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025/)
    across the federal government to help protect the most vulnerable
    Americans from the economic and physical impacts of climate change.
    Further, the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration proposed a new rule that, if finalized, would
    establish [the nation’s first-ever federal safety standard to
    protect workers from extreme heat in the
    workplace](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-workers-and-communities-from-extreme-weather/).
-   **Expanding the White House Environmental Justice Advisory
    Council.** The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring
    that the voices, perspectives, and lived realities of communities
    with environmental justice concerns are heard in the White House and
    reflected in federal policies, investments, and decisions.
    [President Biden appointed 12 additional
    members](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/23/president-biden-announces-key-appointments-to-the-white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council/)
    to the [White House Environmental Justice Advisory
    Council](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council/)
    (WHEJAC), a federal advisory committee that President Biden
    established under [Executive Order
    14008](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/)
    on *Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad*. The
    establishment of the WHEJAC marked the first time that a
    Presidential advisory body has been tasked with providing
    recommendations to the federal government on environmental justice.
    The WHEJAC held its first joint public meeting with the White House
    Environmental Justice Interagency Council in June 2024.
-   **Increasing public engagement in environmental reviews and the
    regulatory process.** The Biden-Harris Administration finalized a
    rule to [advance environmental justice and promote meaningful public
    input in the federal environmental review
    process](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2024/04/30/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-reforms-to-modernize-environmental-reviews-accelerate-americas-clean-energy-future-simplify-the-process-to-rebuild-our-nations-infrastructure/)
    under the National Environmental Policy Act. The rule helps ensure
    projects are built smart from the start by promoting early and
    meaningful engagement with communities, fostering community buy-in,
    reducing or avoiding conflict, and improving project design.  In
    addition, the rule directs agencies – consistent with current best
    practices – to consider environmental justice in environmental
    reviews and to encourage measures to avoid or reduce
    disproportionate effects on communities, including the cumulative
    impacts of environmental and other burdens. The Office of Management
    and Budget also issued updated guidance to [broaden public
    engagement in the regulatory
    process](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/broadening-public-engagement-in-the-federal-regulatory-process/).
    The Administration will continue to [seek public
    input](https://www.performance.gov/participation/) as it develops a
    federal framework, guidelines, and leading practices for public
    participation and community engagement activities.
-   **Solidifying a whole-of-government commitment to environmental
    justice.** President Biden’s [Executive Order
    14096](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-revitalize-our-nations-commitment-to-environmental-justice-for-all/)
    on *Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice
    for All* makes clear that the pursuit of environmental justice is a
    duty of all executive branch agencies and should be incorporated
    into their missions. To support agencies in their work to further
    embed environmental justice into the federal DNA and deliver real,
    measurable progress, the Council on Environmental Quality
    [released](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/11/03/a-new-environmental-justice-playbook-for-federal-agencies/)
    a
    [template](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Strategic-Planning-to-Advance-Environmental-Justice_final-Oct.-2023.pdf)
    for agencies to help develop their Environmental Justice Strategic
    Plans. Agencies also incorporated environmental justice into updated
    versions of their [Climate Adaptation
    Plans](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-agency-climate-adaptation-plans-demonstrates-leadership-in-building-climate-resilience/).
    Additionally, the Administration is taking ambitious action to
    tackle plastic pollution and [released the first comprehensive,
    government-wide
    strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-new-strategy-to-tackle-plastic-pollution-takes-action-to-reduce-single-use-plastics-in-federal-operations/)
    to reduce the impact of plastic pollution throughout the plastics
    lifecycle, calling for sustained and coordinated work with
    communities with environmental justice concerns.
-   **Rapidly accelerating locally led efforts to conserve, protect, and
    expand access to lands and waters across America.** From [protecting
    Bristol Bay in
    Alaska](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/11/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-protection-of-bristol-bay-and-national-conservation/),

    President Biden is protecting and restoring lands and waters that
    are important to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples and creating
    more equitable access to nature. The Biden-Harris Administration has
    also undertaken [an all-of-government
    approach](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nature-Deprived-Communities-MOU.pdf)
    to engage more effectively in supporting local leaders’ efforts to
    improve access to and create, expand, steward, and conserve parks
    and green and blue spaces for communities that currently lack access
    to nature. The Administration released the first-ever [U.S. Ocean
    Justice
    Strategy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/12/08/biden-harris-administration-unveils-first-ever-strategy-to-advance-environmental-justice-for-communities-that-rely-on-the-ocean-and-marine-resources/)
    to advance environmental justice for communities that rely on the
    ocean and Great Lakes, and is in the process of evaluating the
    potential Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, the first
    Indigenous-led nomination for a National Marine Sanctuary.
-   **Strengthening enforcement of environmental and civil rights
    laws.** The Justice Department’s (DOJ) Office of Environmental
    Justice (OEJ) is engaging DOJ bureaus, components, and offices to
    ensure that DOJ utilizes the full set of legal tools at its disposal
    to secure environmental justice. OEJ is the central hub as DOJ
    implements [a comprehensive environmental justice enforcement
    strategy](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-environmental-justice-enforcement) to
    enhance civil and criminal enforcement of environmental violations
    in communities overburdened by pollution. For example, following an
    [interim
    resolution](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/04/departments-justice-health-human-services-announce-interim-resolution-agreement-environmental-justice-investigation-alabama-department-public-health.html)
    agreement, DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services
    announced that the Alabama Department of Public Health has made
    [progress in providing access to basic sanitation
    services](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-department-health-and-human-services-highlight-progress-state-alabama),
    abating exposure to raw sewage from inadequate onsite wastewater
    systems, and improving health outcomes for the predominantly Black
    communities of Lowndes County, Alabama. In addition, [the
    Environmental Protection Agency has strengthened its environmental
    justice
    enforcement](https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/environmental-justice-enforcement-and-compliance-assurance#accomplishments),
    such as by increasing the percentage of on-site inspections in
    communities with potential environmental justice concerns and
    finalizing Superfund settlement agreements for cleanup work near
    communities with potential environmental justice concerns.
-   **Increasing technical assistance and capacity
    building.** The Environmental Protection Agency
    [established](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-177-million-17-new-technical-assistance-centers)
    a [network of 16 environmental justice assistance
    centers](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-justice-thriving-communities-technical-assistance-centers)
    with over 160 partners to support communities and their partners as
    they work to access federal resources. The program is part of
    the [Federal Interagency Thriving Communities
    Network](https://www.transportation.gov/federal-interagency-thriving-communities-network),
    which is developing a holistic government-wide framework for
    technical assistance and capacity building. The Department of Energy
    also launched the [Regional Energy Democracy
    Initiative](https://www.energy.gov/justice/regional-energy-democracy-initiative-redi),
    or REDI, to help direct capacity building and technical assistance
    for community-based organizations and local stakeholders who are
    engaged in the coordination, development, and delivery of community
    benefits associated with Department-funded projects in the Gulf
    South region. Additionally, the White House published a [Technical
    Assistance
    Guide](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/build/technical-assistance-guide/)
    to make it easier for communities across the country to navigate,
    access, and deploy infrastructure, climate resilience, and clean
    energy funding. The Environmental Protection Agency also launched
    the [Environmental Justice
    Clearinghouse](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/forms/ej-clearinghouse),
    a first-of-its-kind online collection of resources related to
    environmental justice.
-   **Reforming federal funding and support for Tribal Nations**. To
    help ensure that the benefits of the Investing in America agenda
    reach Tribal Nations and Tribal communities, President Biden signed
