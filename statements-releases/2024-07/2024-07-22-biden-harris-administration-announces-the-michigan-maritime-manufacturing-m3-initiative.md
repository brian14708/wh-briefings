title: "Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces the Michigan Maritime Manufacturing\
  \ (M3)\_Initiative"
---
 
*M<sup>3</sup> will invest in workforce training in Michigan to boost
American submarine production*

The United States’ nuclear submarine force, and the industrial base
partners that help deliver and maintain that capability, are
foundational to our national security mission. However, America’s
submarine industry is limited by significant workforce needs. The
Biden-Harris Administration is making strategic investments in Michigan
as part of a national economic and defense policy initiative to meet the
Navy’s 5-fold increase in submarine production. These investments are
essential to protect the national security of the United States, support
our commitment to AUKUS partners, and restore the American maritime
industry as a world leader in submarine construction.

The State of Michigan has had manufacturing in its DNA since the turn of
the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The Michigan workers, unions, companies
that shaped this nation’s transportation and automotive revolution are
uniquely positioned to support the tremendous demand to build and
sustain our submarine fleet.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Navy, and the State of
Michigan announced the **[Michigan Maritime Manufacturing
(M<sup>3</sup>)](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/Press-Releases/display-pressreleases/Article/3845268/secnav-del-toro-announces-michigan-maritime-manufacturing-initiative/)**
initiative. **M<sup>3</sup>** will build skilled workforce pipelines and
programs to help meet our nation’s demand for over a hundred thousand
new workers in the submarine and maritime industries over the next
decade. This initiative will connect American workers with high-paying
jobs earlier in their careers, and implement training programs that
provide speed and scalability required to meet industry’s manufacturing
and engineering gaps.

***Rebuilding American Manufacturing***

The M<sup>3</sup> partnership will connect the Department of Defense
(DoD), state and local governments, prime and sub-prime defense industry
firms, and academic organizations across the state of Michigan. Navy and
DoD are moving to integrate key components of their industrial workforce
development programs, projects, and investments into the M<sup>3</sup>
initiative in addition to the more than **$50 million in near term
investments** committed to Michigan-based infrastructure, programs, and
advanced manufacturing technology efforts. Among these early efforts
are:

-   $16 million to implement an accelerated welding and computer
    numerical controlled (CNC) machining training program this fall,
    introducing a maritime-focused skilled trades pipeline aimed at
    meeting labor demand from hundreds of Michigan suppliers.
-   $2 million in educational outreach and engagement programs in
    Michigan K-12 schools to inspire interest in manufacturing careers
    and introduce career pathways to good maritime-focused jobs.
-   $750,000 aimed at collaboration with veteran placement agencies and
    the Department of Labor’s Veteran Employment and Training Service
    (VETS) programs to assist transitioning veterans returning to
    Michigan each year to join the submarine and maritime sectors as
    another way to serve their country.
-   $4.5 million for Project MFG activities to include expanding into
    Michigan.DoD’s flagship advanced manufacturing skills competition
    will serve as a catalyst to elevate the next generation of
    Michigan’s highly skilled trade professionals through its national
    machining and welding championships and new Maritime Series
    competitions beginning this fall.
-   Up to $10.75 million over five years in ACENet,to increasea novel
    and growing national hub-and-spoke network of advanced machining
    training centers that creates asynchronous pathways to train users
    through computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing
    (CAM) platforms.
-   $3 million for an attraction and recruitment campaign focusing on
    Michigan’s rich history in the manufacturing trades. This targeted
    recruitment initiative builds on the successful “Built to Last”
    campaign, which has drawn more than 8 million people to
    [BuildSubmarines.com](https://www.buildsubmarines.com/) since
    September 2023.

These initiatives will target a phased and aggressive approach to
maximize the throughput of trades trainees by both expanding and filling
state-level trades pipelines and programs. The educational initiatives
will leverage existing facilities at Macomb Community College and others
to provide a continuous talent pool, boosting the local economy and
America’s industrial base. The Navy, in coordination with scaling
partners, will take an active role in aligning the trades training
programs with the industry’s hiring demand, and graduates from these
programs will be provided career placement opportunities with suppliers
upon completion of their training.

***Strengthening America’s Subsurface and Advanced Manufacturing
Capabilities***

Undersea domain offers strategic advantages in stealth, surprise, and
survivability, allowing the U.S. Navy to maintain a decisive edge over
potential threats. Our submarines and the growing unmanned underwater
vehicle capability provide unparalleled reconnaissance,
intelligence-gathering, and covert strike capabilities, essential for
deterring aggression and ensuring freedom of the seas. As rival nations
invest heavily in their own undersea assets, the United States must
continue to innovate and produce its undersea warfare force at scale to
maintain maritime dominance and guarantee national security. The
Biden-Harris Administration, in partnership with the State of Michigan,
is pleased to announce the M<sup>3</sup>initiative to counter this
growing threat and reestablish American preeminence on the world’s
oceans through reinvesting and dramatically scaling American
manufacturing capacity and driving technological innovation.
