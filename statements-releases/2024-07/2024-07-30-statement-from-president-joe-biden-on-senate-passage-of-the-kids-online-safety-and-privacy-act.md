title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Senate Passage of the Kids Online Safety\
  \ and Privacy\_Act"
---
 
Today, the Senate took a crucial bipartisan step forward to make our
kids safer online. There is undeniable evidence that social media and
other online platforms contribute to our youth mental health crisis.
Today our children are subjected to a wild west online and our current
laws and regulations are insufficient to prevent this. It is past time
to act. While my Administration has taken important steps to address the
harms of social media and online platforms, we need action by Congress
to protect our kids online and hold Big Tech accountable for the
national experiment they are running on our children for profit. This
bill answers the call from the Unity Agenda of my first State of the
Union Address, when I said it was time to strengthen privacy
protections, ban targeted advertising to children, and demand tech
companies stop collecting personal data on our children.

The last time Congress took meaningful action to protect children and
teenagers online was in 1998 – before the ubiquity of social media and
smartphones. Our kids have been waiting too long for the safety and
privacy protections they deserve and which this bill would provide. This
is more important than ever with the growing use of AI. I want to thank
Senators Blumenthal, Blackburn, Markey, and Cassidy, along with Leader
Schumer, for their leadership on this legislation, and all of the
bipartisan lawmakers who voted for this bill. I encourage the House to
send this bill to my desk for signature without delay.
