Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden
tested positive for COVID-19. He is vaccinated and boosted and he is
experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he
will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully
during that time. The White House will provide regular updates on the
President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the
office while in isolation.  
   
**Note from the President’s Doctor:**  
   
The President presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms,
to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general
mailaise. He felt okay for his first event of the day, but given that he
was not feeling better, point of care testing for COVID-19 was
conducted, and the results were positive for the COVID-19 virus. Given
this, the President will be self-isolating in accordance with CDC
guidance for symptomatic individuals.  PCR confirmation testing will be
pending. His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16,
his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at
97%. The President has received his first dose of Paxlovid. He will be
self-isolating at his home in Rehoboth.
