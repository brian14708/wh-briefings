President Joe Biden spoke today with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva
of Brazil to discuss a range of bilateral and regional issues, including
the emerging political situation in Venezuela following the July 28
presidential election. President Biden thanked President Lula for his
leadership on Venezuela.  The two leaders agreed on the need for
immediate release of full, transparent, and detailed voting data at the
polling station level by the Venezuelan electoral authorities.  The two
leaders shared the perspective that the Venezuelan election outcome
represents a critical moment for democracy in the hemisphere, and they
pledged to remain in close coordination on the issue.  The presidents
also committed to deepen cooperation between our two countries on
accelerating the clean energy transition and to continue advancing the
Partnership for Workers’ Rights, which they launched together on the
margins of last year’s United Nations General Assembly to empower
workers and combat some of the most significant issues facing working
people.
