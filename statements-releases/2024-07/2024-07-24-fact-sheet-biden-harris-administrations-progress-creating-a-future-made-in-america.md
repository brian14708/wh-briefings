  \ Made in\_America"
---
 
Since day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris have worked to
make “Made in America” a reality. In his first week in office, President
Biden signed his [*Executive Order on Ensuring the Future is Made in All
of America by All of America’s
Workers*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/),
which established the first ever [Made in America
Office](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/01/25/one-year-anniversary-of-the-made-in-america-office/)
at the White House Office of Management and Budget, and launched a
whole-of-government initiative to support American manufacturing. The
President and Vice President secured historic legislation to make “Made
in America” a reality — including enacting legislation the last
administration failed to pass — and implemented the most robust change
to the Buy American Act in almost 70 years to ensure that taxpayer money
is supporting workers and manufacturing across America.

The Biden-Harris Investing in America agenda is a Made in America
agenda. The *Bipartisan Infrastructure Law* put Americans to work
rebuilding our nation with American-made materials, and included the
*Build America, Buy America Act* to require that all iron, steel,
manufactured products, and construction materials used in Federally
funded infrastructure projects are produced in the America. The *CHIPS
and Science Act* is making the United States once again a world leader
in manufacturing semiconductors that power our lives. And the *Inflation
Reduction Act* is powering a [manufacturing
revolution](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/10/23/bidenomics-in-action-clean-energy-jobs-and-investments-taking-hold-across-america/)
in clean energy industries of the future.

Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, businesses are building
factories that will power our economy for years to come. The private
sector has committed nearly [$900 billion](https://invest.gov/) in
investments in American manufacturing and our power sector, including
sectors central to our industrial strength. Construction of factories
has doubled — to a record high — after falling under the previous
administration. And the United States has created nearly 800,000
manufacturing jobs, after the last administration lost manufacturing
jobs.

These are the largest investments in American manufacturing in
generations, and they build on historic actions by the Biden-Harris
Administration that are making “Made in America” a reality.

***<u>The Biden-Harris Made in America Agenda</u>***

-   **Closing Loopholes:** In his 2024 State of the Union address, the
    President announced that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking a
    historic step to boost domestic manufacturing in transportation. The
    Department of Transportation published a proposal to discontinue a
    sweeping Reagan-era Buy America waiver for manufactured products in
    federal-aid highway projects. This proposal would close a giant
    loophole and further advance the President and Vice President’s
    commitment to support American manufacturers and good-paying jobs
    across the United States. This proposal will bolster our nation’s
    manufacturing and help create good-paying, American jobs that
    support the growth of domestic manufacturing.

<!-- -->

-   **CHIPS:** The CHIPS and Science Act has spurred a reshoring of
    high-tech semiconductor manufacturing capacity back to the United
    States. Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the future economy and
    are vital to our economic and national security. Since the President
    and Vice President took office, dozens of companies have committed
    to invest nearly $400 billion in total semiconductor investments
    across this country. These investments have been enabled by the
    Department of Commerce CHIPS incentive program, which has reached
    preliminary terms with 13 semiconductor manufacturers across the
    supply chain to provide nearly $30 billion in direct funding and $25
    billion in loans. The Department of Commerce has also launched the
    National Semiconductor Technology Center and announced billions in
    research and development funding opportunities; the National Science
    Foundation has catalyzed hundreds of millions in funding for
    workforce initiatives; and the Department of Defense has funded
    research hubs throughout the country to ensure America continues to
    lead industries of the future. America invented the semiconductor,
    and once again we are on track to revitalizing our domestic
    semiconductor industry through over a hundred thousand jobs all
    across the nation – helping ensure more chips are made in America by
    American workers.

-   **Buy American:** In 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration
    [announced](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-delivers-on-made-in-america-commitments/)
    the most robust updates to the implementation of the Buy American
    Act in nearly 70 years to ensure taxpayer dollars create good-paying
    jobs here at home, and strengthen critical supply chains. This rule
    increased the domestic content requirements for Made in America for
    federal procurement from 55 percent of the value of their component
    parts that are manufactured here to a threshold of 60 percent in
    2022, 65 percent in 2024, and 75 percent in 2029. This action also
    closed loopholes in the current regulation while allowing businesses
    time to onshore manufacturing and adjust their supply chains to
    increase the use of American-made components.

-   **Broadband:** The Biden-Harris [Investing in
    America](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
    agenda includes historic funding for high-speed internet access,
    spurring [hundreds of
    millions](https://www.ntia.gov/blog/2024/american-made-internet-all)
    of dollars in investments in broadband manufacturing as numerous
    companies onshore and expand domestic manufacturing capacity.As a
    result of these policies, close to 90% of the funding spent on
    equipment for the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and
    Deployment (BEAD) Program will be spent on equipment manufactured in
    the United States. Implementation of the BEAD Program is creating
    thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs across the
    [country](https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/baba-map-updated-022124.png)

    Wisconsin to Hickory, North Carolina and Gilbert, Arizona. Workers
    in these communities are now producing broadband equipment, like
    fiber optic cable and key electronics, necessary to bring
    affordable, reliable high-speed internet to everyone in America.

-   **Port Infrastructure: The Administration continues to deliver for
    the American people by rebuilding the U.S.’s industrial capacity to
    produce port cranes with trusted partners. **The Administration will
    invest over $20 billion, including through grants, into U.S. port
    infrastructure over the next 5 years through the Biden-Harris
    Investing in America agenda, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. As a result, **PACECO
    Corp.,** a U.S.-based subsidiary of Mitsui E&S Co., Ltd (Japan), is
    planning to onshore U.S. manufacturing capacity for its crane
    production. Leveraging over $20 billion in funding for America’s
    ports infrastructure over the next 5 years, alongside the recent
    [*Executive Order on Amending Regulations Relating to the
    Safeguarding of Vessels, Harbors, Ports, and Waterfront Facilities
    of the United
    States*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initiative-to-bolster-cybersecurity-of-u-s-ports/)
    to bolster the security of the nation’s ports, and [tariffs to
    protect American workers and businesses from China’s unfair trade
    practices](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/),
    these investments will support and better secure America’s critical
    infrastructure.  
-   **High Speed Rail:** The Brightline West High Speed Rail project is
    made possible by the Biden-Harris Administration’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law. The Department of Transportation plans to
    provide $3 billion in federal funding to Brightline West for the
    rail project, which will create 35,000 construction jobs and 1,000
    permanent positions when completed in 2028. The railroad is
    projected to carry 8 million passengers a year between Las Vegas and
    Los Angeles. Because of the work of the Biden-Harris Administration,
    it is estimated that more than 95 percent of the total direct dollar
    expenditures for the Project will be spent on domestically sourced
    products and labor. The project sponsors also established a
    commitment with several craft rail unions for the use of highly
    skilled union labor in critical operations and maintenance jobs. The
    memorandum of understanding with the High-Speed Rail Labor Coalition
    is comprised of 13 rail unions representing more than 160,000
    freight, regional, commuter, and passenger railroad workers in the
    United States.  
-   **Clean Energy Manufacturing:** The Biden-Harris climate and
    infrastructure laws have spurred a boom in American clean energy
    manufacturing as factories break ground nationwide to make electric
    vehicle batteries, solar and wind components, and other nuts and
    bolts of the growing clean energy economy. Since President Biden and
    Vice President Harris took office, companies have announced [more
    than $250
    billion](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
    in investments in American clean energy and electric vehicle
    manufacturing, creating new U.S. manufacturing jobs and helping
    communities that have been left behind make a comeback. While
    federal agencies deploy [unprecedented
    investments](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-6-billion-transform-americas-industrial-sector)
    to support [American
    manufacturing](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-2-billion-support-american-auto-workers),
    the Biden-Harris Administration has also taken bold action to
    protect America’s growing clean energy manufacturing workforce from
    unfair trade practices in China by increasing tariffs on imports
    from China in strategic sectors such as electric vehicles,
    batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, and steel and aluminum.

<!-- -->

-   **Electric Vehicle Chargers:** Under the Biden-Harris
    Administration, at least [40 Electric Vehicle (EV) charger
    factories](https://www.energy.gov/invest) in the United States have
    been announced or opened, representing at least half a billion
    dollars of investment in the American EV charging network. These
    investments are spurred by the successful implementation of the
    American manufacturing plan for EV chargers. This new policy for EV
    chargers restored Buy America standards for these products, while
    also giving time for supply chains to adjust — allowing newly
    announced manufacturing capacity for EV charger components the
    necessary time to ramp up production. This increased EV charger
    manufacturing helps enable the $7.5 billion that is going toward
    building the nation’s EV charging network.

Publicly available EV charging infrastructure has grown by over 93%
since the President and Vice President took office. There are now over
185,000 public EV chargers across the country. The United Steelworkers
said the approach to Buy America for EV chargers “creates demand signals
for companies to make investments in the United States knowing they will
benefit from the Buy America preference.”

-   **Tech Hubs:** The Department of Commerce Economic Development
    Administration [recently
    awarded](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-investment-in-twelve-regional-technology-hubs-creating-good-paying-jobs-and-driving-economic-opportunity-and-innovation-in-communities-across-the-cou/)
    $504 million to 12 Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs to
    accelerate the growth of manufacturing and innovative industries,
    such as clean energy, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and
    semiconductors, in communities across the country. These Tech Hubs
    will ensure that the benefits of innovation and technology
    development, which for too long have been concentrated in a few
    coastal cities, reach rural, industrial, and disadvantaged
    communities, growing regional economies from the bottom-up and the
    middle-out.  
-   **Industrial Mobilization:** The Office of Management and Budget
    issued guidance to agencies to [better
    leverage](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/13/omb-announces-pilot-to-better-leverage-federal-acquisition-to-strengthen-americas-critical-supply-chains/)
    federal procurement dollars to strengthen domestic sourcing for
    critical products and supply chains. This action is in furtherance
    of the President’s directive to develop enhanced price preferences
    and better leverage industrial mobilization authority to support
    American manufacturing. These actions will allow agencies to manage
    and mitigate supply chain risks as well as take a targeted approach
    to support competition and combat harm to domestic industries as a
    result of subsidies from non-market economies.  
-   **Invent it Here Make it Here:** The President’s [*Executive Order
    on Federal Research and Development in Support of Domestic
    Manufacturing and United States
    Jobs*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-amidst-manufacturing-boom-president-biden-will-sign-an-executive-order-on-federal-research-and-development-in-support-of-domestic-manufacturing-and-united-states-jobs-to-encourage/)
    furthers America’s policy of “invent it here, make it here”—
    benefitting American workers, communities, and global supply chain
    resilience. The EO will boost the incentive to manufacture new
    inventions in the United States when those inventions are developed
    using Federal funds and **encourages the expansion of domestic
    production for critical industries**. That means as we bring new
    inventions to market that were developed through taxpayer dollars,
    we’re prioritizing American workers, manufacturing, and American
    ingenuity.

<!-- -->

-   **Construction Materials:** The President announced in the 2023
    State of the Union that the Federal government would take steps to
    ensure construction materials that are used in projects that it
    funds, from copper and aluminum to fiber optic cable, lumber, and
    drywall, are made in America. The Biden-Harris Administration has
    since [delivered on that
    commitment](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/08/14/biden-harris-administration-releases-final-guidance-to-bolster-american-made-goods-in-federal-infrastructure-projects/),
    and these standards now apply to virtually all infrastructure
    spending supported by Federal financial assistance. Meanwhile,
    thanks to the historic investments in the Biden-Harris climate law,
    the Department of Energy [recently
    announced](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-6-billion-transform-americas-industrial-sector)
    more than $6 billion in industrial decarbonization grants to deploy
    game-changing technologies for steel, aluminum, cement, and other
    foundational materials. The Biden-Harris Administration also
    launched the [Federal Buy Clean
    Initiative](https://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean/), to leverage
    the U.S. government’s purchasing power to spur demand for clean
    construction materials, like concrete, asphalt, steel and glass.
    Federal agencies are currently deploying more than $4 billion under
    Buy Clean.

<!-- -->

-   **Personal Protective Equipment:** The Make PPE in America Act,
    which was signed into law as part of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
    requires the Departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human
    Services and Veterans Affairs, to purchase American-made personal
    protected equipment (PPE). The COVID-19 pandemic made clear the need
    to reduce U.S. reliance on essential foreign goods like PPE. To
    minimize this vulnerability, this law seeks to ensure that PPE will
    be made here in America, support domestic manufacturing, create
    good-paying jobs, and build resilient supply chains.
