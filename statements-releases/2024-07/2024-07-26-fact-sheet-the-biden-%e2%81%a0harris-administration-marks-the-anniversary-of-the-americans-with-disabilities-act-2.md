title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Marks the Anniversary of\
  \ the Americans with Disabilities\_Act"
---
 
Today, President Biden signed a proclamation marking the 34<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the landmark
civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with
disabilities in employment, public accommodations, and state and local
government services. For the more than 70 million Americans living with
a disability, the ADA is a source of inclusion, participation, respect,
and dignity. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Americans with
disabilities have seen historic increases in employment and earnings,
while the Administration has taken significant steps to protect civil
rights and promote full participation in society. The nation has made
significant progress since the law was signed, but there is more work to
do to live up to the promise of the ADA.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action to protect the
rights of people with disabilities and deliver on the promise of the
ADA.  
   
**Protecting Civil Rights**

-   **Access to Government Services. **The Administration is working to
    ensure full participation of people with disabilities in civic life.
    This spring DOJ issued a [final
    rule](https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/) under
    Title II of the ADA to ensure the accessibility of web content and
    mobile applications by state and local governments. This rule is
    ensuring that people with disabilities can access critical local
    services, like transit information and voter registration. In
    December, the Office of Management and Budget issued a
    [government-wide
    policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/m-24-08-strengthening-digital-accessibility-and-the-management-of-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act/)
    to agencies to improve the federal government’s digital
    accessibility. This month, the General Services Administration
    issued a [final
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/03/2024-14424/federal-management-regulation-accessibility-standard-for-pedestrian-facilities-in-the-public)
    to improve the accessibility of federal buildings.
-   **Access to Health Care.** This spring, HHS issued two final rules
    protecting the civil rights of people with disabilities in health
    care and human services programs under [Section
    504](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/disability/section-504-rehabilitation-act-of-1973/part-84-final-rule-fact-sheet/index.html)
    of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and [Section
    1557](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/1557-fact-sheet/index.html)
    of the Affordable Care Act. These rules ensure that all people have
    access to health care and human services that are safe, accessible,
    and free from discrimination for people with disabilities. In
    particular, the Section 504 rule makes it clear that medical
    treatment decisions may not be based on biases or stereotypes or a
    belief that the life of a person with a disability has less value
    than the life of a person without a disability.
-   **Dignity in Air Travel. **In 2022, the Department of Transportation
    (DOT) issued the first-ever [Airline Passengers with Disabilities
    Bill of
    Rights](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/disabilitybillofrights).
    Since then, DOT has delivered on these promises, including:
    -   A [final
        rule](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/final-rule-accessible-lavatories-single-aisle-aircraft-PDF#:~:text=This%20rulemaking%20requires%20airlines%20to,to%20use%20the%20aircraft%20lavatory.)
        in August 2023 to increase the size and accessibility of
        lavatories on single-aisle aircraft, promoting freedom to travel
        for people with disabilities.
    -   A [proposed
        rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/08/2024-09976/ensuring-safe-accommodations-for-air-travelers-with-disabilities-using-wheelchairs#:~:text=The%20proposed%20rulemaking%20also%20clarified,device%20a%20per%20se%20violation.)
        in February 2024 that would require airlines to provide prompt,
        safe, and dignified assistance to passengers with disabilities.
        The rule would protect travelers through new standards for
        airline response when wheelchairs are damaged and protect
        travelers and workers with new training standards for those who
        assist passengers with disabilities and handle wheelchairs.
-   **Accessible Transit**. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law created the [All Stations Accessibility
    Program](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ASAP), which has funded
    accessibility improvements at 111 rail stations across 11 states and
    will award $1.75 billion through FY26.

**Promoting Community Living**

-   **Home and Community-Based Services. ** President Biden’s American
    Rescue Plan is helping deliver a $37 billion investment in home and
    community-based services (HCBS), which states are using to reduce
    their waiting lists and improve wages for direct care workers. In
    2023, President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/)
    on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers,
    directing more than 50 agency actions, including to expand HCBS for
    veterans with disabilities, improve pay for direct support workers,
    and ensure access to HCBS. In April, the Centers for Medicare &
    Medicaid Services (CMS) issued [final
    rules](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/22/biden-harris-administration-takes-historic-action-increase-access-quality-care-support-families-care-workers.html)
    to expand and improve HCBS access, support family caregivers, and
    improve wages and job quality for care workers.
-   **Olmstead Enforcement. ** Last month, HHS and the Department of
    Justice (DOJ)
    [marked](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/community-living-and-olmstead/index.html)
    the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in
    *Olmstead v. L.C.* HHS and DOJ have recently engaged in Olmstead
    enforcement actions to improve community integration for people with
    disabilities, including findings in
    [Utah](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-utah-violates-federal-civil-rights-law-segregating-people)
    and [Rhode
    Island](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/state-rhode-island-and-rhode-island-department-children-youth-and-families). DOJ
    and HHS found that the states were violating the ADA by relying on
    segregated settings for employment, day services, and mental health
    care, and outlined steps the states could take to improve their
    services. 

**Strengthening Economic Security**

-   **Fair Wages.** Since the President took office, [median household
    income](https://www.disabilitystatistics.org/acs/6) for disabled
    Americans has risen by over $10,000. On July 21, 2022, the U.S.
    AbilityOne Commission issued a [final
    rule](https://www.abilityone.gov/commission/documents/14(c)%20Final%20Rule%20News%20Statement%2020220721%20post.pdf)
    ensuring that workers on federal contracts within the AbilityOne
    Program are paid at least the full minimum wage. The Department of
    Labor (DOL) is conducting a [comprehensive review of the Section
    14(c)
    program,](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/workers-with-disabilities/section14c-review)
    which allows employers to pay subminimum wages to certain workers
    with disabilities.
-   **Competitive Integrated Employment.  **Since the President took
    office, Americans with disabilities have seen a [historic high in
    employment](https://www.researchondisability.org/sites/default/files/media/2024-03/2024-annual-report-a11y-1.pdf),
    records in low unemployment and high labor force participation, and
    the number of people with disabilities in registered
    [apprenticeships](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/eeo/protected-characteristics/disability)
    has nearly tripled, from less than 2,500 at the end of FY20 to more
    than 6,800 today. The Administration has taken a multi-pronged,
    whole-of-government approach to advancing employment opportunities
    for people with disabilities. In 2022, DOL issued a [national
    plan](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ODEP/topics/NEON_National_Plan_to_Increase_CIE_WSPT_cleared-2022-01-18.pdf)
    to increase competitive integrated employment and eight federal
    agencies collaborated on
    [guidance](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ODEP/pdf/ResourceLeveragingServiceCoordinationToIncreaseCIE8-12-22.pdf)
    on how to leverage federal resources to promote employment. The
    Disability Innovation Fund, from the Department of Education’s
    Rehabilitation Services Administration, has invested $435 million to
    promote competitive integrated employment. 
-   **Employment Opportunity. ** Since the beginning of the
    Administration, employment of people with disabilities in the
    federal government has increased 20%. The Vocational Rehabilitation
    program, which helps people with disabilities prepare for and obtain
    employment, has shown a 15 percentage point increase in those
    obtaining a credential and an $850 increase in median quarterly
    earnings after exiting the program, compared to 2020.
-   **Social Security. **The Social Security Administration (SSA) is
    working to better serve Americans with disabilities. SSA is
    improving customer service by moving [more services
    online](https://blog.ssa.gov/celebrate-your-independence-with-our-online-applications/)
    and
    [streamlining](https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-to-simplify-disability-evaluation-process-agency-to-reduce-work-history-period-to-5-years/)
    the disability [application
    process](https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-updates-occupations-list-used-in-disability-evaluation-process/),
    as well as improving program equality and reducing burden through
    new rules simplifying policies for Supplemental Security Income
    recipients who get help from family and friends.   

**Improving Access to Health Care**

-   **Addressing Long COVID. ** As tasked by the President in his
    [Memorandum on Addressing the Long-Term Effects of
    COVID-19](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/04/05/memorandum-on-addressing-the-long-term-effects-of-covid-19/),
    HHS
    [established](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/07/31/hhs-announces-formation-office-long-covid-research-practice-launch-long-covid-clinical-trials-through-recover-initiative.html)
    the [Office of Long COVID Research and
    Practice](https://www.hhs.gov/longcovid/index.html), which is
    coordinating a whole-of-government response to the long-term impacts
    of COVID-19 and
    [responding](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/long-covid-update-2024.pdf)
    to the needs of those living with Long COVID. The National
    Institutes of Health (NIH)
    [RECOVER](https://recovercovid.org/impact) initiative has enrolled
    nearly 30,000 people to help us understand Long COVID and develop
    treatments.
-   **Prescription Drug Savings**. The President’s [Inflation Reduction
    Act](https://www.cms.gov/inflation-reduction-act-and-medicare) is
    helping the 7.6 million disabled Medicare beneficiaries under age 65
    access $0 vaccines, insulin for $35 a month per prescription, and
    could save thousands with the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on
    prescription drugs starting in 2025.
-   **Recognizing Health Disparities**. On September 26, 2023, NIH
    [announced](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-designates-people-disabilities-population-health-disparities)
    the designation of people with disabilities as a health disparities
    population, which will unlock research funding into disability
    health disparities throughout NIH.

**Improving Access to Education and Supportive Services**

-   **Historic Investments in Students with Disabilities.**  President
    Biden has increased annual funding by $1.4 billion for Individuals
    with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grants that support special
    education services for PreK-12 students since he came into office.
    The President has also continued to call for increased IDEA
    investment in each budget he has sent to Congress.
-   **Expanding School-based Services**. Under the President’s
    Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department of Education (ED)
    and HHS are working together to help schools leverage Medicaid
    funding to increase access to mental health and disability services
    in schools. On June 25, 2024, CMS announced that [18 states will
    receive
    funding](https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/medicaid-state-technical-assistance/medicaid-and-school-based-services/index.html)
    to implement, expand or enhance school-based services programs.
-   **Leveraging Technology**. In 2024, ED released the [National
    Educational Technology Plan](https://tech.ed.gov/netp/) with
    strategies for closing gaps in access to technology in education.
    The Office of Special Education Programs released a companion [Myths
    and Facts Surrounding Assistive Technology Devices and
    Services](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/files/Myths-and-Facts-Surrounding-Assistive-Technology-Devices-01-22-2024.pdf)
    to increase understanding of IDEA’s assistive technology
    requirements among parents and educators.
