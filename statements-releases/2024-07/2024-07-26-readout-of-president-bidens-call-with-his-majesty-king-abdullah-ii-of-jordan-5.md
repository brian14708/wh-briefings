President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with His Majesty King
Abdullah II of Jordan.  He commended Jordan’s extraordinary humanitarian
response in Gaza under His Majesty’s leadership, which has been critical
in addressing the humanitarian crisis in northern Gaza.  The President
updated King Abdullah on his ongoing efforts to secure a hostage release
and ceasefire deal, and preparations for a surge in humanitarian
assistance during a ceasefire period.  The two leaders discussed the
situation in the West Bank and the President’s efforts to enhance the
viability of the Palestinian Authority through encouragement of reforms
and ensuring the PA has the revenues it needs to deliver for the
Palestinian people.  The President finally thanked His Majesty for his
friendship, and affirmed unwavering U.S. support for Jordan as a partner
and ally in the promotion of a more stable, prosperous, and integrated
Middle East region.
