title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Second Quarter 2024\_GDP"
---
 
When I took office, we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression. Today’s GDP report makes clear we now have
the strongest economy in the world. Thanks to my and Vice President
Harris’s economic agenda, our economy grew a robust 2.8% over the last
quarter, based on strong American consumers and business investment.
We’ve created nearly 16 million jobs, wages are up, and inflation is
coming down. We’re rebuilding the Nation and bringing manufacturing back
to America.

But we have more to do. Over the next six months, I will continue doing
my job as President: lowering costs for hardworking families and growing
our economy. Congressional Republicans have a different plan—which would
drag our country backward by putting special interest first. The Vice
President and I will keep fighting for America’s future—a future of
promise and possibilities, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary
things.
