title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson Welcoming the Humanitarian\
  \ Truce in Eastern Democratic Republic of the\_Congo"
---
 
The United States welcomes the two-week humanitarian truce committed to
by the parties to the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC). The humanitarian situation in North Kivu is dire, with
close to 3 million internally displaced people (IDP) in the province.
The recent expansion of fighting in North Kivu has prevented
humanitarian workers from reaching hundreds of thousands of IDPs in the
area around Kanyabayonga and displaced more than 100,000 people from
their homes.

The two-week humanitarian truce, which will begin at midnight local
time on July 5 and will continue through July 19, commits the parties to
the conflict to silence their weapons, allow for the voluntary return of
displaced people, and provide humanitarian personnel unfettered access
to vulnerable populations. The truce covers areas of hostilities most
affecting civilian populations.

This development builds on the confidence building measures secured
during Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines’ travel to
the DRC and Rwanda in November of last year, and her subsequent
engagements with Presidents Felix Tshisekedi of the DRC and Paul Kagame
of Rwanda.  The United States remains fully in support of the Luanda
process and the Government of Angola’s efforts to address the current
and historic factors perpetuating this longstanding crisis.

The Governments of the DRC and Rwanda have expressed support for this
two-week humanitarian truce to ease the suffering of vulnerable
populations and set conditions for broader de-escalation of tensions in
eastern DRC.  The U.S. Government calls on all parties to honor the
spirit of the truce prior to it taking effect.

The U.S. Government will continue to use its intelligence and diplomatic
resources to monitor activities by armed forces and non-state armed
groups during the humanitarian truce.
