We are committed to providing Ukraine with additional air defense
capabilities as it defends itself against Russia’s continued aggression,
including Russia’s deliberate attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian
and critical infrastructure. 

Today, we are announcing that, collectively, we are providing Ukraine
with additional strategic air defense systems, including additional
Patriot batteries donated by the United States, Germany, and Romania;
Patriot components donated by the Netherlands and other partners to
enable the operation of an additional Patriot battery; and an additional
SAMP-T system donated by Italy. These five strategic air defense systems
will help to protect Ukrainian cities, civilians, and soldiers, and we
are coordinating closely with the Ukrainian government so that these
systems can be utilized rapidly. We are working on a further
announcement this year of additional strategic air defense systems for
Ukraine. 

In addition, in the coming months, the United States and partners intend
to provide Ukraine with dozens of tactical air defense systems,
including NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS, and Gepard systems.
These systems will further expand and strengthen Ukraine’s air defense
coverage. Several Allies – including Canada, Norway, Spain, and the
United Kingdom – will continue to play an integral role in the provision
of these systems, and many other supporters of Ukraine will assist in
the provision of interceptors. For its part, the United States will
re-sequence planned deliveries of Foreign Military Sales of critical air
defense interceptors in coordination with partners so they are delivered
to Ukraine, providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional air defense
interceptors over the next year. 

As we strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses, we are grateful to the
coalition of more than 50 countries that continues to provide security
assistance to Ukraine, as well as to the Immediate Action on Air Defense
Initiative – to which partners have pledged more than $1 billion in
support of air defense for Ukraine – and the Integrated Air and Missile
Defense Capability Coalition, co-led by Germany and France. We also
welcome NATO’s work to support Ukraine’s efforts to develop a
NATO-interoperable integrated air and missile defense architecture. Our
message to Moscow and the world is clear: Our support for Ukraine is
strong and unwavering.
