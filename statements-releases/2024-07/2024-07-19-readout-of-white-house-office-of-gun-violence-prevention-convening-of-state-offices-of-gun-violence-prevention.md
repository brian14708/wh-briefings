title: "Readout of White\_House Office of Gun Violence Prevention Convening of State\
  \ Offices of Gun Violence\_Prevention"
---
 
On July 17, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention convened
over 30 state government officials from 16 states, including leaders
from 12 state Offices of Gun Violence Prevention (OVPs). The convening
brought together key violence prevention leaders to

-   Share strategies around gun violence prevention that have
    contributed to the historic decrease in homicide across the nation;
-   Identify what collaboration with local, state, and federal offices
    can and should look like;
-   Discuss the importance of raising awareness around gun violence
    prevention work; and
-   Receive information on federal resources available to the state
    OVPs.

These conversations build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s long
record of empowering state government leaders, who know their
communities, to intervene against and prevent gun violence. In
attendance were representatives from California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina,
New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington,
and Wisconsin.  
  
Representatives from the United States Department of Justice, Department
of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention presented on the resources and programs their agencies
offer to support the work of gun violence prevention. The convening also
amplified the variety of [federal resources available to support

intervention](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CVI-Funding-Resources.pdf)
efforts and strategies, including through President’s Biden’s Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act, the most significant legislation to prevent gun
violence in nearly 30 years.  
  
The President continues to use every tool at his disposal to keep
Americans safe from violent crime, including the public health crisis of
gun violence. State OVPs, a solution recommended in White House Office
of Gun Violence Prevention’s [Safer States
Agenda](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OGVP-Safer-States-Policy-Agenda.pdf),
are a critical piece of a comprehensive effort to keep communities safe.
