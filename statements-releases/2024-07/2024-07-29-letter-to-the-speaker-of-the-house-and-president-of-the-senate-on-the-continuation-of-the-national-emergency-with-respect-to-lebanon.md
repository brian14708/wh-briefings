  \ of the National Emergency With Respect to\_Lebanon"

Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon declared in
Executive Order 13441 of August 1, 2007, is to continue in effect beyond
August 1, 2024.

Certain ongoing activities, such as Iran’s continuing arms transfers to
Hizballah — which include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems —
serve to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and
economic instability in the region, and continue to constitute an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.

Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13441 with respect to
Lebanon.

                              Sincerely,

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
