Vice President Kamala Harris today met with Prime Minister Netanyahu of
Israel at the White House. The Vice President reiterated her
longstanding and unwavering commitment to the security of the State of
Israel and the people of Israel. They discussed the Biden-Harris
Administration’s work to ensure Israel can defend itself from threats
from Iran and Iranian-backed terrorist groups, including Hamas, Lebanese
Hezbollah, and the Houthis, and the importance of combatting the rise in
Antisemitism globally. The Vice President again condemned Hamas as a
brutal terrorist organization as well as individuals associating with
Hamas, noting that pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and must
not be tolerated.  
  
The Vice President and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed developments
in Gaza and the ongoing negotiations on the ceasefire and hostage
release. The Vice President echoed President Biden in expressing the
need to close the remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible,
bring the hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza.  
  
The Vice President expressed concern regarding civilian casualties and
discussed the need to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The
Vice President also expressed her concern about actions that undermine
stability and security in the West Bank, such as extremist settler
violence and settlement expansion.
