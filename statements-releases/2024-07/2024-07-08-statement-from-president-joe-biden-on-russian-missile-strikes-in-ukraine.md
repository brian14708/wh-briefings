title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Russian Missile Strikes in\_Ukraine"
---
 
Russia’s missile strikes that today killed dozens of Ukrainian
civilians and caused damage and casualties at Kyiv’s largest children’s
hospital are a horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality. It is critical
that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment
and that we not ignore Russian aggression. This week, I will be
welcoming President Zelenskyy and NATO leaders to Washington D.C., and I
will be meeting with President Zelenskyy to make clear our support for
Ukraine is unshakeable. Together with our allies, we will be announcing
new measures to strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses to help protect their
cities and civilians from Russian strikes. The United States stands with
the people of Ukraine.
