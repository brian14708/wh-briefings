title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Agreement Between the Association of\
  \ Professional Flight Attendants and American\_Airlines"

Collective bargaining works. I congratulate the Association of
Professional Flight Attendants, their 25,000 members, and American
Airlines for reaching a tentative agreement. And I thank Acting
Secretary Su, Secretary Buttigieg, and other members of my
Administration for their efforts to help both sides secure this
agreement, which averts a strike that would have been devastating for
the industry and consumers. This is the culmination of over 5 years of
negotiations and proves once again that collective bargaining benefits
workers, companies, and our economy. As the most pro-union and
pro-worker president in American history, I’m proud of the record wages
and record contracts secured by workers during my Administration. When
unions are strong, our nation is strong.
