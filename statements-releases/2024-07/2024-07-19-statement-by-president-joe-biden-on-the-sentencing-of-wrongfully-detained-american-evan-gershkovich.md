title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Sentencing of Wrongfully Detained\
  \ American Evan\_Gershkovich"
---
 
Today, Evan Gershkovich received a sentence of 16 years in a Russian
prison, despite having committed no crime. Rather, he was targeted by
the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American. We
are pushing hard for Evan’s release and will continue to do so.

As I have long said and as the UN also concluded, there is no question
that Russia is wrongfully detaining Evan. Journalism is not a crime. We
will continue to stand strong for press freedom in Russia and worldwide,
and stand against all those who seek to attack the press or target
journalists. Additionally, since the very first day of my
Administration, I have had no higher priority than seeking the release
and safe return of Evan, Paul Whelan and all Americans wrongfully
detained and held hostage abroad. Evan has endured his ordeal with
remarkable strength. We will not cease in our efforts to bring him home.
And Jill and I are holding Evan and his family in our prayers.
