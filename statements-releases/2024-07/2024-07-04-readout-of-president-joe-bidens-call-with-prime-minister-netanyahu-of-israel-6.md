President Biden spoke this morning with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The
Prime Minister congratulated the United States on the occasion of
Independence Day, and thanked the President for his continued and
steadfast support for Israel’s security.   

President Biden and the Prime Minister discussed ongoing efforts to
finalize a ceasefire deal together with the release of hostages, as
outlined by President Biden and endorsed by the UN Security Council, the
G7, and countries around the world.

The leaders discussed the recent response received from Hamas. The
President welcomed the Prime Minister’s decision to authorize his
negotiators to engage with U.S., Qatari, and Egyptian mediators in an
effort to close out the deal. 

President Biden reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel’s security
including in the face of threats from Iranian-backed terrorist groups
such as Lebanese Hezbollah. 

Both leaders welcomed the meeting to take place on July 15 between their
national security teams in the Strategic Consultative Group format.
