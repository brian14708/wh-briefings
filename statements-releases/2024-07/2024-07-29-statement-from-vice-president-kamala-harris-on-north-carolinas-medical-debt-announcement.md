  \ Debt\_Announcement"

No one should be denied access to economic opportunity simply because
they experienced a medical emergency. Yet today, more than 100 million
Americans struggle with medical debt – making it more difficult for them
to be approved for a car loan, a home loan, or a small-business loan,
which makes it more difficult for them to just get by, much less get
ahead.  
   
That is why President Biden and I have already forgiven over $650
million in medical debt – part of our overall plan to forgive $7 billion
by 2026 – with support from our American Rescue Plan, legislation that I
was proud to advance with my tie-breaking vote in the Senate. In
addition to this, soon we will make it so medical debt can no longer be
included in your credit score, impacting millions of Americans. Last
month, I issued a call to states, cities, and hospitals across our
nation to join us in forgiving medical debt.  
   
I applaud North Carolina for setting an example that other states can
follow by advancing a plan that has the potential to relieve $4 billion
in medical debt for two million individuals and families. This critical
step also strengthens financial assistance for emergency medical
procedures moving forward.  
   
As someone who has spent my entire career fighting to protect consumers
and lower medical bills, I am committed to continuing to relieve the
burden of medical debt and creating a future where every person has the
opportunity to build wealth and thrive.
