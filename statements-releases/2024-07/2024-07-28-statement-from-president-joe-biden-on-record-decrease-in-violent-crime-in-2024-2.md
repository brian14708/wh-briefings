title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record Decrease in Violent Crime in\_\
  2024"
---
 
Every American deserves the freedom to feel safe in their community.
Since Vice President Harris and I took office, America has become safer.
According to preliminary data in two new reports, violent crime
continued to fall to historic lows in the first half of 2024. One report
from the University of Chicago shows ‘unprecedented’ declines in crime
across multiple categories, including homicides and motor vehicle
thefts, across more than 40 cities. Another report, from the Council on
Criminal Justice, found that homicides decreased by 13%, motor vehicle
theft fell by 18%, and violent crime fell overall in more than two dozen
cities.  
   
This progress is no accident. After the largest increase in murders ever
recorded during the previous Administration, my Administration got to
work protecting the American people. My American Rescue Plan – which
every Republican voted against – delivered more than $15 billion to
cities to hire and retain more cops, invest in community violence
interventions, and keep communities safe. My Administration took dozens
of actions to reduce gun violence and I signed the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act into law, the most significant gun violence legislation
in nearly 30 years.   
   
There is more work to do. I will continue fighting for funding for
100,000 additional police officers and crime prevention and community
violence intervention programs. And I will continue to call for Congress
to ban assault weapons and keep guns out of dangerous hands.
