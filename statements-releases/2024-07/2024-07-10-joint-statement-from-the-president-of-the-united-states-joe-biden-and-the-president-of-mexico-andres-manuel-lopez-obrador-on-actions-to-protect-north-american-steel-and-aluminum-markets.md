title: "Joint Statement from the President of the United\_States Joe\_Biden and the\
  \ President of Mexico Andr\xE9s Manuel L\xF3pez Obrador on Actions to Protect North\
  \ American Steel and Aluminum\_Markets"
---
 
Mexico and the United States are taking key measures today to protect
the North American steel and aluminum markets from unfair trade. Both
countries will implement policies to jointly prevent tariff evasion on
steel and aluminum, and strengthen North American steel and aluminum
supply chains (Mexico, United States, and Canada).  
   
To improve transparency of the origins of its imports, Mexico is
requiring importers to provide more information about the country of
origin of steel products.  
   
This action adds to Mexico’s recent tariff increases on steel from
non-free trade agreement countries.  To complement these actions and
further protect the North American market, the United States will
implement melt and pour, and smelt and cast requirements, respectively,
for certain steel and aluminum imports from Mexico in order for those
steel and aluminum imports to enter the United States tariff-free under
Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. 

In the coming weeks and months, Mexico and the United States will
continue to work together to protect the North American steel and
aluminum markets from unfair trade practices.
