title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on S. 138, the \u201CPromoting a Resolution\
  \ to the Tibet-China Dispute\_Act\u201D"

Today, I have signed into law S. 138, the “Promoting a Resolution to the
Tibet-China Dispute Act” (the “Act”).  I share the Congress’s bipartisan
commitment to advancing the human rights of Tibetans and supporting
efforts to preserve their distinct linguistic, cultural, and religious
heritage.  My Administration will continue to call on the People’s
Republic of China to resume direct dialogue, without preconditions, with
the Dalai Lama, or his representatives, to seek a settlement that
resolves differences and leads to a negotiated agreement on Tibet.  The
Act does not change longstanding bipartisan United States policy to
recognize the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas of China
as part of the People’s Republic of China –- a policy decision that
falls within my authority to recognize foreign states and the
territorial bounds of such states.  

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 12, 2024.
