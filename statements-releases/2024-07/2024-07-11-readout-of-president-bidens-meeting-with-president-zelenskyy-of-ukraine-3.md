President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of
Ukraine today to discuss U.S. support for Ukraine in response to
Russia’s continued aggression. The leaders discussed the state of the
battlefield and ongoing U.S. efforts to provide Ukraine with the
equipment it needs to defend itself. During the meeting, President Biden
announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine,
which includes a Patriot air defense system, air defense interceptors,
and artillery and HIMARS ammunition. This is the eighth security
assistance package authorized by President Biden since he signed the
national security supplemental. The leaders reviewed the concrete
outcomes for Ukraine at the NATO Summit, including announcements on
F-16s, air defense, and the Ukraine Compact, a shared pledge among more
than 20 countries to support Ukraine both now and for the long-term. The
leaders also committed to prioritize efforts to repair Ukraine’s energy
infrastructure and make it more resilient against Russian attacks.
