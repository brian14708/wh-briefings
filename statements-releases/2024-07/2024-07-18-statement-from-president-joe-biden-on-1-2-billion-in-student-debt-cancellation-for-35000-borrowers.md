title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on $1.2 Billion in Student Debt Cancellation\
  \ for 35,000\_Borrowers"
---
 
Today, my Administration is canceling student debt for 35,000 people
through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, bringing the total number of
Americans who have benefitted from our various debt relief actions to
4.76 million people. Each of those borrowers has received an average of
over $35,000 in debt cancellation. These 35,000 borrowers approved for
forgiveness today are public service workers – teachers, nurses, law
enforcement officials, and first responders who have dedicated their
lives to strengthening their communities, and because of the fixes we
made to Public Service Loan Forgiveness, they will now have more
breathing room to support themselves and their families.

Today’s announcement comes on top of the significant progress we’ve made
for students and borrowers over the past three years. That includes
providing the largest increases to the maximum Pell Grant in over a
decade; fixing Income-Driven Repayment so borrowers get the relief they
are entitled to under the law; and holding colleges accountable for
taking advantage of students and families. And earlier this year, I laid
out my Administration’s new plans that would cancel student debt for
more than 30 million Americans when combined with everything we’ve done
so far.

From day one of my Administration, I promised to fight to ensure higher
education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.
I will never stop working to make higher education affordable – no
matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stop us.
