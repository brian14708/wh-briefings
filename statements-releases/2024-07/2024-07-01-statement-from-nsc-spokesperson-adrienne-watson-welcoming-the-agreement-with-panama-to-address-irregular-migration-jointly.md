title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson Welcoming the Agreement with\
  \ Panama to Address Irregular Migration\_Jointly"
---
 
Today, the United States and Panama signed a Memorandum of Understanding
designed to jointly reduce the number of migrants being cruelly smuggled
through the Darien, usually en route to the United States. Specifically,
the United States will support Panama’s efforts to begin the swift,
safe, and humane repatriation of migrants who do not have a legal basis
to remain in Panama.  By returning such individuals to their country of
origin, we will help deter irregular migration in the region and at our
Southern border, and halt the enrichment of malign smuggling networks
that prey on vulnerable migrants.
