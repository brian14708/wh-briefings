title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Reaching an Agreement in Principle\
  \ on Modernization of the Columbia River Treaty\_Regime"
---
 
During my March 2023 visit to Ottawa, Prime Minister Trudeau and I
re-committed to modernize the Columbia River Treaty. 

Today, with Prime Minister Trudeau visiting Washington D.C., I am
pleased to announce that our countries have reached agreement in
principle on the key elements of a modernized Treaty.   
  
After 60 years, the Treaty needs updating to reflect our changing
climate and the changing needs of the communities that depend on this
vital waterway. The Columbia River and its tributaries are of great
importance to Tribal and Indigenous peoples, who have been sustained by
this ecosystem and the abundant resources it provides for time
immemorial. These waterways are also vitally important to our nation’s
economy, generating 40% of U.S. hydropower, irrigating $8 billion in
agriculture products, and moving 42 million tons of commercial cargo
every year. 

For 60 years, the United States and Canada have managed these waterways
together through the Columbia River Treaty.  Now, our two countries have
found common ground on how we will work together to care for them for
the next 20 years.

In modernizing this treaty, we will elevate U.S. Tribes’ and Canadian
Indigenous Nations’ voices. We’ll re-balance energy coordination between
the United States and Canada, allowing the United States to keep more
clean hydropower energy at home while giving Canada more opportunities
to import from and export to the U.S. market – critical to both
countries achieving our clean energy goals.

And the United States will benefit from pre-planned water storage at
Canadian Treaty dams, to help control flooding and protect vulnerable
communities.

In the coming weeks, the United States and Canada will continue our work
together to draft a Treaty amendment that reflects these key elements
and to begin the process in both our countries to get this done. 

Together, we will continue to steward this precious shared natural
resource, on behalf of all our people.
