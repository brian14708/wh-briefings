National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan hosted the inaugural meeting of
the Angel Investor Network announced by President Joe Biden, Uruguayan
President Luis Lacalle Pou, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
in November 2023 under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity
(Americas Partnership). At the meeting, the diverse group of experienced
and successful angel and venture capital investors pledged to
collectively invest more than $1 billion in early-stage companies and
entrepreneurs in Latin America and the Caribbean by 2030.  As a key part
of their broader investment pledge, these investors will provide
financing, mentoring, and advisory support to entrepreneurs in the
Americas Partnership Accelerator program, a program that President Biden
launched in November 2023 to link cohorts of innovative entrepreneurs in
Latin America and the Caribbean to capital, knowledge, and networks that
will help bring their business ideas to life.  National Security Advisor
Sullivan  reiterated the United States’ commitment to support efforts
that build entrepreneurial capacity, encourage innovation, and drive
inclusive growth in our hemisphere.  

U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power,
foreign ministers and senior officials of the eleven other Americas
Partnership countries, IDB Lab Chief Executive Officer Irene Arias, and
members of the Americas Partnership Angel Investor Network discussed how
to work together to mobilize more early-stage investments in startups
offering solutions to humanity’s biggest challenges, such as those in
deep tech, green tech, and biotech.

Administrator Power and International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen
of Canada described progress made in the Americas Partnership
Accelerator programs, including the selection of the first cohort of
entrepreneurs.  Foreign Minister Omar Paganini of Uruguay described the
activities and goals of the Network and encouraged the roundtable
participants to expand it to include more angel and venture capital
impact investors from throughout the region.
