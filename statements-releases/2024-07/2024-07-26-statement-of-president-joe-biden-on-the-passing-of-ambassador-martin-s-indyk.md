title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Ambassador Martin S.\_\
  Indyk"

Martin Indyk dedicated his life to the pursuit of peace. 

Raised in Australia, Martin made Aliyah in 1973, moving to Israel and
volunteering on a kibbutz. He chose to devote his career to the work of
building peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, inspired by the
aftermath of the Yom Kippur War. His commitment to peace was rooted in
witnessing that conflict and realizing that Israel’s existence is
fragile, peace is the only path to lasting security, and the United
States must be a part of that endeavor.

As a member of President Clinton’s National Security Council and
two-time U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Martin played an essential role in
the Oslo Accords and the follow-on negotiations – the closest that
Israelis and Palestinians have ever come to making peace. He was also
America’s Ambassador to Israel on that fateful day in 1995 when Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated. Martin rushed to the hospital
to console Rabin’s wife Leah – representing the American people’s
empathy and grief at a pivotal moment.

He and I worked together during the Obama-Biden Administration, when
Martin served as Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations –
the last time the two parties engaged seriously on final status
negotiations. More recently, he has been a voice of clarity and
conviction since the horrific October 7<sup>th</sup>attack by Hamas and
during the war in Gaza. His legacy lives on in the many officials across
my Administration who were mentored by Martin and learned firsthand from
his vast knowledge, integrity, and heart. His unshakeable optimism and
commitment to peace is as important today as it’s ever been.

Jill and I are holding Martin’s family in our thoughts – especially his
beloved wife Gahl, his children Jacob and Sarah, stepchildren
Christopher and Caroline, brother and sister, and five grandchildren.
May his memory be a blessing.
