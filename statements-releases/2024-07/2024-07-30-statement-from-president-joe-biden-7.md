title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden"
---
 
Four years ago, when I launched my campaign for the battle for the soul
of our nation, I was grateful Anita Dunn was right there with me.

I’ve known Anita throughout my career. She’s served our nation through
three Administrations and countless campaigns for candidates at every
level.

She’s not only a key senior member of our team that helped us win a
historic election in 2020 – she’s also been an invaluable part of our
White House. She’s tough and tested, and her experience and intellect
have helped us deliver historic results for the American people.

I deeply value her counsel and friendship and I will continue to rely on
her partnership and insights as we finish the job over the next six
months.
