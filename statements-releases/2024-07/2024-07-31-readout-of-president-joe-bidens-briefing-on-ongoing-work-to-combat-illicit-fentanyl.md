title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Briefing on Ongoing Work to Combat\
  \ Illicit\_Fentanyl"
---
 
Today, President Biden received a briefing on his Administration’s
ongoing work to crack down on the deadly scourge of illicit fentanyl and
other illicit drugs.  The President and his team discussed the successes
to date: more seizures of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids
in the last two years than the previous five combined; the arrest and
prosecution of dozens of high-level drug traffickers, cartel leaders,
and money launderers; the sanctioning of over 300 entities and
individuals involved in the global illicit drug trade; and the forging
of historic counternarcotics cooperation with China and Mexico, and with
more than 150 countries via the [Global Coalition to Address Synthetic
Drug
Threats](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/07/statement-from-homeland-security-advisor-dr-liz-sherwood-randall-on-launch-of-the-global-coalition-to-address-synthetic-drug-threats/).
 These efforts have led to the first decline in fentanyl overdose deaths
in the homeland in five years.

The President and his team also discussed the significance of his new
[National Security
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/07/31/memorandum-on-prioritizing-the-strategic-disruption-of-the-supply-chain-for-illicit-fentanyl-and-synthetic-opioids-through-a-coordinated-whole-of-government-information-driven-effort/),
in which the President directed his administration to do even more to
work across Departments and Agencies to disrupt drug networks and
increase the number of illicit drug seizures.  The President also
directed his team to continue to do everything possible – including
working closely with Congress – to shut down the supply chain for
illicit fentanyl and save American lives.

  
President Biden was briefed by Attorney General Garland, Secretary
Mayorkas, Director of National Intelligence Haines, Assistant to the
President and Chief of Staff Zients, Assistant to the President and
Deputy Chief of Staff Reed, Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief
of Staff Quillian, Assistant to the President and Homeland Security
Advisor Sherwood-Randall, and Deputy Assistant to the President and
Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Daskal.
