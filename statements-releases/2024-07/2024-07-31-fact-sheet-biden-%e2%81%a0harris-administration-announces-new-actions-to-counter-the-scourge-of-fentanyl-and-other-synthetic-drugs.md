title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Counter\
  \ the Scourge of Fentanyl and Other Synthetic\_Drugs"
---
 
Far too many Americans have lost children, spouses, and friends to
dangerous drugs like illicitly manufactured fentanyl. It is a scourge
that has no geographic or political boundaries, wreaking havoc on
families and communities in all parts of America. That’s why since day
one, the Biden-Harris Administration has made disrupting the supply of
illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs a core priority. As part of
their [Unity
Agenda](/Users/JCDaskal/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/BBCPZRNQ/Unity%20Agenda)
for the nation, President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken a
number of actions to combat the opioid epidemic:  
 

-   Border officials have stopped more illicit fentanyl at ports of
    entry in the past two fiscal years than in the previous five fiscal
    years combined.  In just the last five months, over 442 million
    potentially lethal doses of fentanyl were seized at U.S. borders.
    The Biden-Harris Administration continues to invest in detection
    technology at U.S. borders, adding dozens of new inspection systems,
    with dozens more coming online next year.

    a life-saving opioid overdose reversal medication, widely available
    over the counter, and has invested over $82 billion in treatment –
    40 percent more than the previous Administration.

<!-- -->

-   In 2021, President Biden issued an [Executive
    Order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/15/executive-order-on-imposing-sanctions-on-foreign-persons-involved-in-the-global-illicit-drug-trade/)
    targeting foreign persons engaged in the global illicit drug trade
    and has since sanctioned over 300 persons and entities under this
    authority, thereby cutting them off from the United States’
    financial system.

Due to these efforts, the number of overdose deaths in the United States
has started to decline for the first time in five years. But even one
death is one too many. And so today, President Biden will issue a new
National Security Memorandum calling on all relevant Federal Departments
and Agencies to do even more to stop the supply of illicit fentanyl and
other synthetic opioids in our country. President Biden and Vice
President Harris also are calling on Congress to enact legislation to
increase penalties on those who bring deadly drugs into our communities
and to close loopholes that drug traffickers exploit.  
  
*The National Security Memorandum*  
  
The National Security Memorandum (NSM) that the President will issue
calls on all relevant Federal Departments and Agencies to do even more
to stop the supply of illicit fentanyl other synthetic opioids into our
country.  As drug traffickers and suppliers adapt, we must do so as
well.  The NSM directs even more intelligence collection, even more
intensive coordination and cooperation across Departments and Agencies,
and even more actions to disrupt the production and distribution of
illicit fentanyl. The NSM is one more step forward in the Biden-Harris
Administration’s continued focus on dramatically reducing the supply of
illicit drugs and their precursor chemicals, and protecting American
lives.  
  
*Detect and Defeat Proposal*  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is also encouraging Congress to
take action to combat illicit fentanyl, including by passing the
Administration’s “Detect and Defeat” Counter-Fentanyl Proposal.  This
proposal incorporates many of the bipartisan ideas put forward by
Members of Congress, and will increase the United States’ ability to
detect and seize illicit drugs and hold drug traffickers accountable. 
The proposal would give border officials the tools they need to more
effectively track and target the millions of small-dollar shipments that
cross our borders every day—closing a loophole that drug traffickers
exploit.  It would establish a nation-wide pill press and tableting
machine registry so that law enforcement officials can track these
machines and protect against their illicit use in producing fake
fentanyl pills. And it would permanently regulate fentanyl-related
substances as “Schedule I” drugs—subjecting the distribution and
possession of these drugs to heightened penalties.   
  
**Today’s actions build on a series of additional steps the Biden-Harris
Administration has taken to combat the opioid epidemic, including:**  

-   Since 2021, the Justice Department has arrested and prosecuted
    dozens of high-level Mexican cartel leaders, drug traffickers, and
    money launderers, including Sinaloa Cartel’s co-founder [Ismael “El
    Mayo” Zambada

    Chapitos leader [Nestor Isidro “El Nini” Perez

    and [Cartel de Jalisco Nueva
    Generación](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1936)’s
    top chemical brokers—placing dangerous drug traffickers behind bars.

-   In November 2023, President Biden negotiated the resumption of
    [counternarcotics cooperation with the People’s Republic of China
    (PRC)](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-progress-on-fight-against-global-illicit-drug-trafficking/),
    spurring increased cooperation on law enforcement actions and
    ongoing efforts to shut down companies that fuel illicit fentanyl
    and synthetic drug trafficking and cause deaths in the United
    States.

-   The Biden-Harris Administration has [engaged with leaders around the
    world](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/29/g7-leaders-statement-on-synthetic-drugs-threats/)
    to spur global action in the fight against synthetic opioids,
    established a [Trilateral Fentanyl Committee with the Governments of
    Mexico and
    Canada](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/08/joint-statement-from-mexico-canada-and-the-united-states-reaffirming-our-shared-commitment-to-address-the-regional-challenge-of-synthetic-drugs-and-firearms-trafficking/),
    and launched a [Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug
    Threats](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/07/statement-from-homeland-security-advisor-dr-liz-sherwood-randall-on-launch-of-the-global-coalition-to-address-synthetic-drug-threats/)
    uniting more than 150 countries in this effort.

-   In 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration launched an information
    sharing partnership with financial institutions, law enforcement,
    and national security agencies as part of an ongoing effort to cut
    off drug traffickers’ access to the global financial system and
    disrupt the illicit financing of the drug trade.
