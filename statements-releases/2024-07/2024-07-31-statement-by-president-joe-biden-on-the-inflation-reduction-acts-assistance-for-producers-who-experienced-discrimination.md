title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s\
  \ Assistance for Producers Who Experienced Discrimination"
---
 
Farmers and ranchers work around the clock to put food on our tables and
steward our Nation’s land. But for too long, many farmers and ranchers
experienced discrimination in farm loan programs and have not had the
same access to federal resources and support. I promised to address this
inequity when I became President. Today that promise has become a
reality. My Inflation Reduction Act took a bold step to address the
effects of discrimination in farming and ranching, and today’s action
will enable more farmers and ranchers to support themselves and their
families, help grow the economy, and pursue their dreams.
