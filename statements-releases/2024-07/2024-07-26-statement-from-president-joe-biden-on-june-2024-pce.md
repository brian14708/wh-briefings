Today’s report shows we are making real progress fighting inflation.
Over the last year, inflation has come down to 2.5% at a time when the
economy has grown 3.1%, we’ve created 2.6 million new jobs, and wages
are rising faster than prices. The agenda that Vice President Harris and
I are fighting for has helped us come back strong from the worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression and deliver for working
families.

We’re going to keep building on this progress to lower costs for all
Americans by expanding on our success capping prescription drug costs
and building more homes to lower rents. Congressional Republicans have a
different plan, one that would “reignite” inflation by giving more
massive tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy while raising costs for working
families by taxing all imports. While they fight for special interests,
the Vice President and I will keep fighting to rebuild the middle class.
