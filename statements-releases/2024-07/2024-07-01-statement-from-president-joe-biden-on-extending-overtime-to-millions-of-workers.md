title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Extending Overtime to Millions of\_\
  Workers"
---
 
A hard day’s work should lead to a fair day’s pay. Today, we
are extending overtime protections to 1 million workers making less than
$43,888 a year. And next year, we will extend protections to another 3
million workers by increasing the overtime threshold to $58,656. That
means higher paychecks and more time with family for millions of
Americans. While Republicans side with big corporations and special
interests on Park Avenue to try to deny workers these protections, I
will always side with hardworking families like the ones I grew up with
in Scranton.
