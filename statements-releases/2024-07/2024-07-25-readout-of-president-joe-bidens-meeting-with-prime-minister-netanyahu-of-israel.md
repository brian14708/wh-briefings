President Biden met today with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White
House. The President and the Prime Minister discussed developments in
Gaza and the ongoing negotiations on the ceasefire and hostage release
deal in detail. President Biden expressed the need to close the
remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible, bring the
hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza. The President
also raised the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the need to remove any
obstacles to the flow of aid and restoring basic services for those in
need, and the critical importance of protecting civilian lives during
military operations. President Biden reaffirmed the United States’
ironclad commitment to Israel’s security against all threats from Iran
and its proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.
