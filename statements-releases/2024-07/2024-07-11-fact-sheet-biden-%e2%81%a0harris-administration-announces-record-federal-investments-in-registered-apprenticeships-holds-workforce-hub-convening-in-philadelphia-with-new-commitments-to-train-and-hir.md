Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to connect
Americans to the good-paying jobs created by the President’s Investing
in America agenda. White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden and
Acting Secretary Julie Su will travel to Williamsport, Pennsylvania to
announce more than $244 million to help modernize, diversify and expand
the Registered Apprenticeship system in growing U.S. industries. This
announcement marks the largest federal investment in US history in
Registered Apprenticeships—the gold-standard earn-and-learn training
pathway. Then, Director Tanden, Acting Secretary Su, and officials from
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of
Transportation (DOT) will also travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to
hold the inaugural convening of the city’s Investing in America
Workforce Hub and announce new policies and partnerships to ensure all
workers – including women, people of color, veterans, and those that
have been historically left behind–have equitable access to good-paying
jobs across nearly one billion dollars in investments from President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is laser-focused on creating training
pipelines that ensure all Americans can access the hundreds of thousands
of good-paying jobs created by the President’s Investing in America
agenda—whether they went to college or not. To do that, the
Administration launched nine Investing in America Workforce Hubs across
the country that are bringing together unions, local governments,
employers, training providers, schools, community colleges, and other
stakeholders to facilitate partnerships to train and connect workers to
jobs in high-demand sectors. First Lady Jill Biden

President Biden
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-workforce-hubs-to-train-and-connect-american-workers-to-good-jobs-created-by-the-presidents-investing-in-america-agenda/)
four new Workforce Hubs this year—upstate New York, Michigan, Milwaukee,
and Philadelphia.  
  
Across the state of Pennsylvania, the Administration has announced more
than $17 billion in federal investments in clean energy, infrastructure,
and manufacturing, which have catalyzed an additional $2.6 billion in
related private-sector investments. In Philadelphia alone, the
President’s Investing in America agenda is delivering over a billion
dollars in projects to rebuild public infrastructure, including
investing in transit, reconnecting neighborhoods, and replacing lead
pipes. These investments are generating demand for skilled workers in
the construction and related trades by creating good-paying jobs that
will support working families in the Philadelphia area.  
  
To deliver on the promise of these investments, the Administration—led
by the White House, DOT, and EPA—has partnered with the City of
Philadelphia to ensure the City has strong and diverse workforce
pipelines to support the hundreds of millions of dollars in public
infrastructure investments. Today, the City and the Administration are
announcing the following commitments to expand pathways into these
good-paying jobs:  
  
***New Policies to Promote Equitable Workforce Development***  
  
Today, the City of Philadelphia is announcing new efforts to build
workforce development pipelines that attract all Americans and spur
economic development through hiring preferences on City public works
projects for economically disadvantaged communities. The Geographic and
Economic Hiring Preference (GEHP) pilot program establishes goals for
hiring 50% of apprentices and 20% of journeypersons on select public
works projects from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in
Philadelphia. The new pilot program will apply to nearly $1 billion in
projects and ensure that approximately 200 new apprentices are created
in historically underserved communities. The hiring preference was made
possible by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which
changed the law to authorize such preferences for federally funded
projects as further highlighted in DOT’s [Best Practices to Expand
Access to Jobs and Economic Opportunity Through Transportation
Infrastructure
Investments](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-02/Best%20Practices%20to%20Expand%20Accessto%20Jobs%20and%20Economic%20Opportunity%20final_.pdf)
workforce report.  
  
The new policy will apply to:  

-   Approximately $165 million in Streets Department projects in the
    first year and $605 million if the pilot becomes permanent policy.  
-   Approximately $369 million for the Philadelphia International
    Airport over the next 18 months.  
-   Approximately $432 million in Water Department projects over the
    next year and $770 million in projects under a permanent policy. 

***Expanding Pre-Apprenticeship and Apprenticeship Programs***  
  
New investments in high-quality pre-apprenticeship programs will double
the current number of people moving into Registered Apprenticeships, and
additional investments will increase the supports and retention rates
for apprentices:  

-   Today, the Department of Labor announced the largest single federal
    investment in Registered Apprenticeships in US history. These
    investments will reach communities across the country through 52
    grantees located in 32 states. A companion formula grant program
    will also fund workforce development projects across Pennsylvania.  
-   Everybody Builds, a nonprofit created in partnership with
    developers, contractors, and unions focused on diversifying
    Philadelphia’s construction industry, will launch a new Construction
    Trades Career Fund. The Construction Trades Career Fund will support
    new apprentices from Philadelphia with supportive services like
    transportation, childcare, and hardship assistance. For major
    projects funded by the DOT, Everybody Builds and the City of
    Philadelphia will partner to support apprentices with federal
    funding. In 2023 JPMorganChase became an early supporter of
    Everybody Builds with a $500,000 philanthropic investment.
    JPMorganChase will continue to lend support to Everybody Builds as
    part of the financial institution’s commitment to creating a
    sustainable solution to diversifying this growing industry.  
-   The Department of Transportation has awarded the City of
    Philadelphia $2.9 million for workforce development and supportive
    services as part of major discretionary DOT grants.  
-   The Department of Commerce awarded a $22 million grant through the
    Good Jobs Challenge to Philadelphia Works. Philadelphia Works will
    announce that $8 million of this funding will be set aside for
    infrastructure training and supportive services, on top of the over
    100 pre-apprentices currently supported by federal funds through
    Philadelphia Works.  
-   Already, Philadelphia Works, backbone organizations, and Southeast
    Pennsylvania partners awarded more than $22 million to connect over
    3,000 job seekers to good jobs across healthcare, energy and
    infrastructure sector.

***Investing in the City’s Leadership and Partnerships***  
  
The City of Philadelphia will anchor the workforce hub moving forward,
taking accountability for making sure that there is a strong system of
pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship supports for construction careers.
This leadership role will be supported by strong investments from
philanthropy:  

-   The William Penn Foundation also recently announced additional
    investments in workforce development as part of a $5 million RFP to
    help remove barriers to accessing and completing training programs
    in Philadelphia.  
-   The City of Philadelphia is collaborating with Governor Josh
    Shapiro’s administration, including PennDOT and PENNVEST, to
    coordinate the implementation of federally funded infrastructure
    projects in Philadelphia and will continue to collaborate and
    explore workforce initiatives, including the GEHP pilot across
    various projects.

***New Workforce Development Investments***  
  
During the Biden-Harris Administration, more than 900,000 people have
entered apprenticeship programs that lead to good-paying, middle-class
jobs. While extreme Republicans in Congress have proposed gutting the
Department of Labor’s discretionary grant funding for registered
apprenticeships, today’s announcements come in the same week as the
Biden-Harris Administration announces the largest-ever investment in
Registered Apprenticeships:  

-   Nearly $195 million from the Apprenticeship Building America
    Program, which supports public-private partnerships to expand the
    use of Registered Apprenticeships across in-demand fields, such as
    clean energy, advanced manufacturing, IT and cybersecurity, K-12
    education, and more. These investments will reach communities across
    the country through 43 grantees in 26 states.  
-   $49 million from the competitive portion of State Apprenticeship
    Expansion Formula (SAEF) grants to 9 states, supporting these states
    to adopt proven and innovative strategies to expand Registered
    Apprenticeship opportunities.  
-   $39 million in base funding from SAEF grants to 46 states and
    territories to increase the capacity of Registered Apprenticeship
    Programs across key industries that give workers access to the
    good-paying jobs created by President Biden’s Investing in America
    agenda.  
-    $20 million in Innovative Water Workforce grants from the U.S.
    Environmental Protection Agency to 13 regional and national
    recipients, including nearly $5 million to Pennsylvania, to
    cultivate pre-apprenticeship, Registered Apprenticeship, and
    leadership development and mentorship programs to diversify and
    ensure the sustainability of the nation’s water utility workforce
