title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Climate Pollution Reduction\_Grants"
---
 
“When I think of climate change, I think about jobs – good-paying, union
jobs that put Americans to work, rebuild our nation’s aging
infrastructure, and support our transition to a clean energy future. As
climate change continues to fuel more extreme impacts on communities
across the country, we are using every tool in our toolbox to reduce
pollution, lower families’ energy costs, advance environmental justice,
and make our communities more resilient. Today my Administration is
empowering local communities across 30 states to cut pollution and fight
the climate crisis – from curbing greenhouse gas emissions in
Pennsylvania to flood-proofing infrastructure in North Carolina. Today
and every day, I will continue working to protect American families from
harmful pollution and build a clean energy future.”
