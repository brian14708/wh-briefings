title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Congresswoman\
  \ Sheila Jackson\_Lee"
---
 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was a tenacious advocate for justice
and a tireless fighter for the people of Houston and the people of
America.  
   
Her career in public service spanned well over three decades. As a judge
in Houston, a member of the Houston City Council, and a member of the
United States Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee’s work improved the lives of
millions of Americans.  
   
In the United States House of Representatives, Sheila Jackson Lee
distinguished herself as a dedicated advocate for her community, an
effective legislator, and a fiercely loyal colleague and friend. To work
alongside the Congresswoman was to marvel at her mastery of the
legislative process.  
   
Sheila Jackson Lee was, first and foremost, a leader dedicated to
serving the people of her beloved city. She secured critical funding for
much-needed infrastructure upgrades, coordinated disaster relief in the
wake of Hurricane Harvey, and helped to stand up testing and vaccination
sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. No task was too small so long as it
was the right thing to do.  
   
Congresswoman Jackson Lee was also a national leader. As a champion for
women’s rights, she played a vital role in reauthorizing the Violence
Against Women Act, landmark legislation that improved the lives of
millions of women and girls across the country. She also authored the
law that made Juneteenth a national holiday, a law I was proud to
co-sponsor as a United States Senator. She saw what could be—a nation
that is more equal, more fair, and more free—and she dedicated her life
to realizing that vision.  
   
Sheila Jackson Lee was a dear friend for many years, and a fellow member
of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. As a member of the
Congressional Black Caucus, I had the opportunity to work closely with
her on many issues and to observe her leadership firsthand. She was
relentless—one of our nation’s fiercest, smartest, and most strategic
leaders in the way she thought about how to make progress happen. There
was never a trite or trivial conversation with the Congresswoman. She
was always fighting for the people of Houston and the people of
America.  
   
When I called Congresswoman Jackson Lee earlier this week, I conveyed my
deep gratitude on behalf of our nation for her lifetime of leadership.  
   
Doug and I send our prayers to her husband, Dr. Elwyn Lee, her children,
Jason Lee and Erica Lee Carter, and her beloved grandchildren, Ellison
Bennett Carter and Roy Lee Carter, III.
