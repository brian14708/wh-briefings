My condolences to Madam Ngô Thị Mận and the people of Vietnam on the
loss of Communist Party of Vietnam General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng,
leader of Vietnam for the last 13 years.

General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng was a champion of the deep ties
between the American and Vietnamese people whose leadership helped
nurture the friendship and partnership our countries enjoy today. His
2015 historic visit to the White House was a milestone in our bilateral
relationship. Thanks to his vision, during my 2023 state visit to Hanoi,
Vietnam and the United States became “comprehensive strategic partners,”
the highest level of partnership in the Vietnamese system. The people of
Vietnam and the United States – and people across the Indo-Pacific
region – enjoy greater security and opportunity today because of the
friendship between our two countries. That is thanks to him.

The United States – and I personally – will remember and appreciate his
commitment to reconciliation and to building a future oriented toward
peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and around the world.  We
honor his legacy and mourn his passing alongside the people of Vietnam.
