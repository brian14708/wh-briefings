  \ Presidential Advisor Celso\_Amorim"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan hosted Brazilian Presidential
Advisor Celso Amorim for a meeting yesterday at the White House. The two
leaders discussed progress on deepening our bilateral relationship,
including through the Partnership for Workers’ Rights, which President
Biden and President Lula launched on the margins of last year’s United
Nations General Assembly to empower workers and combat some of the most
significant issues facing working people, such as forced labor,
workplace discrimination, and heat stress. National Security Advisor
Sullivan and Presidential Advisor Amorim also discussed several global
and regional priorities, including Haiti, Venezuela, Russia’s war
against Ukraine, and the Middle East.
