I congratulate President José Raúl Mulino of Panama on his
inauguration.  The ties between Panama and the United States are
long-standing and deep, based on our shared democratic values.  I look
forward to continuing our strong bilateral partnership as we work
together to promote good governance, advance inclusive economic growth,
and address irregular migration.  We are ready to support Panama as it
delivers a more prosperous, secure future for all Panamanians.
