title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson Welcoming an Extension of\
  \ the Humanitarian Truce in Eastern Democratic Republic of the\_Congo"
---
 
The United States welcomes a 15-day extension of the humanitarian truce
committed to by the parties to the conflict in eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).  This extension will be in effect until
11:59pm local time on August 3 and recommits the parties to the conflict
to silence their weapons and provide humanitarian personnel unfettered
access to vulnerable populations.

The United States has closely monitored allegations of truce violations
since July 5.  While the parties to the conflict have largely respected
the truce, we condemn the civilian loss of life in Bweremana and will
work with the Ad Hoc Verification Mechanism to investigate this and
other potential violations and to hold parties responsible.

In support of the Luanda Process, we commit to working with the
Governments of the DRC, Rwanda, and Angola to use this truce extension
to outline a series of steps to reach a durable cessation of hostilities
and set conditions for the voluntary return of displaced populations.
