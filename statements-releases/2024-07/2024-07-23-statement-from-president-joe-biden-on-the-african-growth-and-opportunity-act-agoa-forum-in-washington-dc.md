title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the African Growth and Opportunity\
  \ Act (AGOA) Forum in Washington,\_DC"
---
 
As stakeholders gather tomorrow for the African Growth and Opportunity
Act Forum in Washington, I call on Congress to quickly reauthorize and
modernize this landmark Act—which is set to expire in 2025. 

For more than two decades, the bipartisan African Growth and Opportunity
Act has formed the bedrock of America’s economic partnership with
African nations.  In sub-Saharan Africa, it has increased the
competitiveness of African products, led to the creation of tens of
thousands of quality jobs, and helped advance human rights. Here at
home, AGOA has created investment opportunities and new markets for
American businesses.  And on both sides of the Atlantic, AGOA has
promoted sustainable economic growth and resilient supply chains.  

As I’ve said before, America is all in on Africa.  This week—and in the
weeks to come—let’s prove it.  And together, let’s
ensure future generations of Americans and Africans can meet the
challenges and seize the opportunities of the decades ahead.
