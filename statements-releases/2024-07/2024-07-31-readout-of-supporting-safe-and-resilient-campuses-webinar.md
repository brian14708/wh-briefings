In response to the rise of antisemitism and other forms of hate on
college campuses last year, the Departments of Education, Justice, and
Homeland Security today held a virtual convening to support campuses as
they prepare for the return of students this fall. Second Gentleman
Douglas Emhoff, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, Homeland Security
Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona
provided remarks at the event.

During the convening, Departments shared new and updated resources
designed to support campuses as they engage in planning for the safe
return of students this fall. The Department of Education detailed its
[Free to Learn
toolkit](https://sites.ed.gov/cfbnp/files/2024/07/USDE_Campus-Toolkit_FINAL.pdf),
designed to support leaders to build communities that encourage
thoughtful debate and encouraged universities to develop, test, and
communicate policies and procedures regarding safety and security before
issues arise. The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security
emphasized the need to prepare for the coming academic year, including
by undertaking joint trainings and exercises among campus leadership and
law enforcement and other key campus and community stakeholders.
Administration leaders provided information about best practices,
available trainings, technical assistance, and grant programs; this
information is also [available

The federal government is making these resources available to support
campus leaders in creating a safe and secure environment in which
students can learn free from fear.

The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to engage campus
leadership, law enforcement and public safety officials as they seek to
ensure campus safety and enable students to have a productive academic
year.
