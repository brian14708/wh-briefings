title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Protecting 600,000 Teamster\_Pensions"
---
 
As of today, over 600,000 Teamster workers and retirees have pensions
protected from devastating cuts. They earned those pensions after
working for decades. And now they can retire with dignity.

This didn’t happen by accident. It’s because my Administration is
keeping our commitment to America’s workers.

Today’s action protects the pensions of 70,000 workers and retirees in
New England—including 6,000 in New Hampshire, where my team is making
this announcement alongside Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan
and the New England Teamsters Pension Fund. To date, we have protected
more than 40,000 Teamsters in Ohio and Michigan; more than 30,000 in
Illinois and Missouri; and more than 20,000 in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and
Pennsylvania.

Because of the American Rescue Plan and the support of Congressional
Democrats who passed it without a single Republican vote, over 1 million
union workers and retirees have already been protected from brutal cuts
of up to 75% to the pensions they sacrificed so much to secure.
