I have been briefed on the shooting at former President Trump’s event in
Pennsylvania.   
  
Doug and I are relieved that he is not seriously injured. We are praying
for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by
this senseless shooting.  
  
We are grateful to the United States Secret Service, first responders,
and local authorities for their immediate action.  
  
Violence such as this has no place in our nation. We must all condemn
this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to
more violence.
