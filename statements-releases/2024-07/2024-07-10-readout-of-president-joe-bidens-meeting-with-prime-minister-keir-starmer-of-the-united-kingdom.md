President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Keir
Starmer of the United Kingdom at the White House.  President
Biden congratulated Prime Minister Starmer on his appointment and noted
the United Kingdom’s role as a key U.S. ally on a wide range of global
issues.  The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening U.S.-UK
cooperation globally as they address shared challenges and
opportunities.  They underscored their shared commitment to supporting
Ukraine as it faces Russian aggression.  They also discussed the
importance of reaching a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that would
release the hostages and lead to the end of the conflict, and reaffirmed
their commitment to a two state solution.  They looked forward to
working together to deepen U.S.-UK cooperation on economic and climate
issues to build a more prosperous and resilient future for American and
British people alike.
