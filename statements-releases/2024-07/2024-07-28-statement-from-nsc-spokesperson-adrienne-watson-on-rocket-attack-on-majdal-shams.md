title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Rocket Attack on Majdal\_\
  Shams"

We have been in continuous discussions with Israeli and Lebanese
counterparts since the horrific attack yesterday in northern Israel that
killed a number of children playing soccer.  This attack was conducted
by Lebanese Hezbollah. It was their rocket, and launched from an area
they control.  It should be universally condemned. Hezbollah started
firing on Israel on October 8, claiming solidarity with Hamas, another
Iranian-backed terrorist group.  Our support for Israel’s security is
ironclad and unwavering against all Iran-backed threats, including
Hezbollah.  The United States is also working on a diplomatic solution
along the Blue Line that will end all attacks once and for all, and
allow citizens on both sides of the border to safely return to their
homes.
