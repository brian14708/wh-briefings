title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on\_Venezuela"
---
 
The United States has been closely monitoring Venezuela’s presidential
election that took place on Sunday, July 28 and the subsequent
announcements by Venezuela’s National Electoral Council.  
   
We continue to call for Venezuela’s electoral authorities to release
full, transparent, and detailed voting results, including by polling
station.  This is especially critical given that there are clear signs
that the election results announced by Venezuela’s National Electoral
Council do not reflect the will of the Venezuelan people as it was
expressed at the ballot box on July 28.  We are also reviewing other
electoral data shared by civil society organizations and the reports of
international election monitors.   
   
The United States stands on the side of the democratic aspirations of
the Venezuela people, including supporting their right to express their
views freely and without reprisal.
