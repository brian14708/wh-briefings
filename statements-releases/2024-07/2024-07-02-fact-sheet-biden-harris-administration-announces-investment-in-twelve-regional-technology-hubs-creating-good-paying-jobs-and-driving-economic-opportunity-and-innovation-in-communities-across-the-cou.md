title: "Fact Sheet: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Investment in Twelve\
  \ Regional Technology Hubs, Creating Good-paying Jobs and Driving Economic Opportunity\
  \ and Innovation in Communities Across the\_Country"
---
 
*Regional Tech Hubs will strengthen American leadership in industries of
the future, create jobs, and spur economic growth in all of America*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will announce funding for 12
Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs (Tech Hubs) to accelerate the
growth of innovative industries. The Tech Hubs program is bringing
innovation to every region of the country, creating new jobs, and
ultimately supporting economic development in previously underinvested
areas, as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda.

The $504 million in funding awarded to these twelve Tech Hubs will
position American workers, businesses, and communities to lead the
industries of the future, such as semiconductors, clean energy,
biotechnology, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and more,
strengthening national and economic security. Tech Hubs will create
good-paying jobs in these critical industries in communities across the
country and will build on the manufacturing and entrepreneurship boom
unleashed by President Biden, which has attracted more than $877 billion
in investment in clean energy and manufacturing and spurred more than 18
million new business applications.

“Every American deserves the opportunity to thrive, no matter where they
live. Today’s announcement that the Department of Commerce is investing
$504 million in Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs across the
country will ensure that the benefits of the industries of the future –
from artificial intelligence and clean energy, to biotechnology and more
– are shared with communities that have been overlooked for far too
long, including rural, Tribal, industrial, and disadvantaged
communities,” **said Vice President Kamala Harris.** “These Tech Hubs
will give regions across our nation the resources and opportunities
necessary to lead in the economy of tomorrow while creating good-paying
jobs for American workers.”

Authorized by President Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, the Tech Hubs
program brings together companies, state, local, and Tribal governments,
institutions of higher education, labor unions, and nonprofit
organizations around a common vision for regional economic growth. These
Tech Hubs will ensure that the benefits of innovation and technology
development, which for too long have been concentrated in a few coastal
cities, reach rural, industrial, and disadvantaged communities, growing
regional economies from the bottom-up and the middle-out. Tech Hubs are
a flagship example of the President’s place-based approach; emphasizing
that America’s economy is stronger when we invest in communities rather
than leave them behind.

Last year, President Biden announced the designation of 31 Tech Hubs in
communities across the country. Today’s announcement will designate 12
winners of implementation grants of up to $51 million each to help
accelerate and grow industries in these regions. These awardees span 14
states: Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, Nevada,
New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and
Wisconsin.
