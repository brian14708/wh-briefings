President Biden will welcome Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on July

States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering
Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region. Following the leaders’
meeting, they will meet together with the families of Americans held
hostage by Hamas. The Vice President will also meet separately with
Prime Minister Netanyahu on July 25.
