title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Approving a Major Disaster Declaration\
  \ for\_Texas"
---
 
I spoke today with Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell.  
  
On the call, I raised the need for an emergency declaration
and immediately approved a Major Disaster Declaration for the damage
sustained from the hurricane, which ripped through Texas’ Gulf Coast and
Houston yesterday.  
  
FEMA has had resources on the ground since well before the storm and
will support the needs of the state.  
  
The greatest concern right now is the power outages and extreme heat
that is impacting Texans. As you all know, extreme heat kills more
Americans than all the other natural disasters combined.  
  
As part of the federal support, we pre-positioned generators and are
moving in additional ones to support any power outages, which will help
Texans as the extreme heat arrives.   
  
With this Major Disaster Declaration in place, we will provide
life-saving and life-sustaining activities, and any other Federal
resource that Texas needs. We will be with the people of Texas for as
long as it takes to recover.
