  \ Jackson\_Lee"

Sheila Jackson Lee was a great American.

I had the honor of working with her during her nearly 30 years in
Congress. No matter the issue – from delivering racial justice to
building an economy for working people – she was unrelenting in her
leadership.

Always fearless, she spoke truth to power and represented the power of
the people of her district in Houston with dignity and grace.

Those character traits established her as a towering figure in our
politics. We saw it through her efforts to reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act, make Juneteenth a federal holiday, reintroduce the
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and so much more.

Her character revealed itself time and again, including in her battle
against cancer. Her brilliant spirit was unbreakable.

Sheila Jackson Lee is part of a long line of patriots who delivered the
promise of America to all Americans.

Jill and I send our love and condolences to her family, her
constituents, and beloved colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus.

May God bless our friend, Sheila Jackson Lee.
