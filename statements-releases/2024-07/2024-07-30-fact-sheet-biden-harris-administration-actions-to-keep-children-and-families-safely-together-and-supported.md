  \ Families Safely Together and\_Supported"

*The White House hosts a convening on transforming child welfare and
announces new policy to prevent family separation due to poverty*

The President and Vice President believe every child should have the
opportunity to reach their full potential and grow up in a safe and
loving home with their families. Over four million families are referred
to child protective services each year, and around 200,000 children
enter foster care.  Child welfare systems are prepared to step in when a
child’s safety is at risk, but they are frequently tasked with
intervening when families are simply impoverished and could  be best
helped in the long run by helping meet their economic and service needs.
Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to
improving child and family well-being by keeping families together
safely, including through helping connect them to community and economic
supports, increasing the use of kinship care, and improving foster care
so that when it is needed, it preserves and strengthens lasting
emotional bonds.

Today, the White House hosted a **convening on transforming child
welfare** to announce new policies that focus on preventing family
separation and supporting and creating opportunities for families and
youth. The convening brought together policymakers across federal,
state, local, and tribal governments, philanthropy, child welfare and
family support organizations, and young people and families who have
personal experiences, to encourage further innovation, build new
partnerships, and exchange best practices. The new announcements focus
on four key areas:

**Separating Poverty and Neglect**

Children should not be separated from their families due to financial
hardship alone. Several states, like Kentucky, Indiana, South Carolina,
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Kansas have already clarified
that poverty alone should not cause child removal. And there is emerging
evidence connecting these actions to improvements in family outcomes.
The Biden-Harris Administration is encouraging states to follow their
lead and make clear the distinctions between child maltreatment and
financial hardship. Today, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) is:

-   Issuing new policy guidance that encourages states to update their
    maltreatment definitions under the Child Abuse Prevention and
    Treatment Act to exclude the inability to provide adequate housing,
    child care and other material needs if the family has insufficient
    financial means to do so from the definition of child neglect. The
    state should first seek to help the family. 
-   Committing to develop guidance on training mandated reporters so
    that they recognize the need to connect economically fragile
    families to supports and know these changes to neglect definitions.

**Prevention Services**

Prevention services, including services to help families economically
and provide parenting and behavioral health treatment, need to be well
resourced, tailored to best meet the needs of families and grounded in
evidence. New Biden-Harris actions will expand how states and Tribes can
use federal funding for prevention activities to provide greater
assistance to children and families before a crisis point. These actions
include new policies to:  

-   Provide more flexibility to Tribal governments to use Tribally
    accepted prevention services when they collaborate with state child
    welfare agencies.
-   Permit federal administrative funding to help families get to and
    engage with prevention programs, such as case management, peer
    navigation and transportation to help families engage with services.
    Policy will also clarify how federal funds can support evaluations
    of interventions and activities that improve service implementation.
-   As well as, forthcoming new guidance on ways to integrate and
    leverage the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to
    prevent involvement in the child welfare system.

**Prioritizing Kin and Youth Needs**

Children who cannot be with their parents but live with relatives and
other kin have better outcomes than those who are not, including in
stability, behavioral health, and education. New Biden-Harris actions
will incentivize jurisdictions to do more to ensure children can live
with kin, and meet youth needs by:

-   Allowing child welfare agencies to draw on federal funds to finance
    background check operations to facilitate quicker licensing for kin
    and others who provide foster care.
-   Rolling out a new website spotlights states and Tribes that have
    adopted new kinship licensing rules, as well as data on their
    kinship placement rates.
-   Publishing a resource guide on federal programs that provide
    supports to grandparents and kin in their caregiving roles. 
-   Conducting a series of listening sessions to identify federal
    flexibilities needed for states and Tribes to adopt kinship
    licensing rules and kinship first approaches.

**Innovations and Research**

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to further developing
actionable research on the intersection between prevention, family
support and child well-being outcomes. HHS announced several projects
that:

-   Highlight innovative prevention approaches that rely on service
    integration and agency collaboration to prevent homelessness among
    youth aging out of foster care and to build family resilience.
-   Enable researchers to study linked Medicaid and child welfare data
    to understand the health needs of children and parents involved in
    child welfare.
-   Examine the characteristics and experiences of certain families who
    relinquished or voluntarily placed their children in child welfare
    custody to better identify the needs for community-based behavioral
    health and disability services.

**THE BIDEN-HARRIS RECORD ON CHILD WELFARE**

The Biden-Harris Administration has a [long record of
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-support-children-and-families-in-foster-care/)
consistent with its commitment to keeping families together safely,
providing supports as an alternative to child removals, and increasing
the use of kinship care and other foster care best practices:

-   **Accelerating uptake of the Title IV-E Prevention Program**. This
    groundbreaking program provides open-ended funding for proven
    approaches to keeping children with their families.  This
    Administration has approved 38 prevention plans, bringing the total
    to 42 states, the District of Columbia, and four Tribes. 
-   **Expanding evidenced-based services to use in the Prevention
    Program**.  This month HHS announced [changes to the title IV-E
    Prevention Services Clearinghouse review
    procedures](https://preventionservices.acf.hhs.gov/resources/handbook-of-standards-and-procedures-2)
    that will enable the review and approval of diverse new programs
    that can be funded through the Prevention Program, beyond the 85
    already approved.  These changes clarify how services that include
    economic supports can be reviewed, offer more flexible evaluation
    designs to meet evidence standards, and create more engagement and
    transparency in the review process.
-   **Respecting Tribal sovereignty**. The Administration [expanded the
    scope of Public Law 102-477
    plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-delivers-new-memorandum-of-agreement-to-streamline-employment-and-job-training-funding-for-tribal-nations/),
    which now deliver over $300 million in flexible funding to 298
    Indian Tribes to strengthen the economic stability and mobility of
    families in Indian Country – including by braiding child welfare
    funding with workforce funding to help preserve families. And just
    over a year ago, the [President celebrated the Supreme Court’s
    decision in Haaland v.
    Brackeen](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/15/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-supreme-court-decision-in-haaland-v-brackeen/),
    which upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act as a necessary safeguard
    to ensure that whenever possible, children should be kept with their
    extended families or community.
-   **Expanding home visiting**. The Administration has doubled total
    authorized funding for home visits from $400 million in FY 2022 to
    $800 million by FY 2027 in the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood
    Home Visiting Program and quadrupled funding to $48 million to
    Tribes over the same period, increasing efforts that can identify
    challenges facing families and enable solutions that keep children
    healthy and families together.  Most recently, HHS announced [$3
    million in grant
    funding](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2024/acf-announces-awards-tribal-home-visiting)
    to six new tribal entities for a home visiting programs to support
    and promote the well-being of expectant families and those with
    young children in Indigenous communities.
-   **Prioritizing kinship care**. In September 2023, HHS issued a
    [final rule that allows a child welfare agency to adopt simpler
    licensing or approval standards for all kin foster family
    homes](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2023/media/hhs-announces-new-proposed-foster-family-licensing-regulation-help-expand).
    The rule also requires that states provide kinship caregivers with
    the same level of financial assistance that any other foster care
    provider receives, an important step forward to strengthen the
    financial security of kinship families. In April 2024, HHS hosted [a
    national convening on kinship
    care](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/blog/2024/05/national-convening-kinship-care-forging-future-kin-first-approach-child-welfare)
    to highlight innovative strategies to bolster kinship care. Six
    states and three Tribes have taken up the kinship licensing rules in
    the first six months, and three more are pending approvals to do so.
     
-   **Supporting young people in foster care**. HUD has increased public
    housing authority uptake of the Foster Youth to Independence
    Program, which provides housing vouchers for up to three years for
    older youth transitioning from foster care. Since the beginning of
    the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD awarded $60.3 million,
    providing 4,364 vouchers for older youth. HHS also funded [11 state
    and Tribal demonstration
    grants](https://acfmain-stage.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2023/fysbs-runaway-and-homeless-youth-program-funding-11-youth-homeless-prevention)
    to test community approaches to prevent youth from becoming
    homeless. And USDA and HHS are working to ensure that young people
    experiencing homelessness or transitioning out of foster care can
    keep their SNAP benefits without work reporting requirements, as
    secured by the President through the Fiscal Responsibility Act of
    2023.
-   **Protecting parents and children with disabilities from
    discrimination.** HHS issued a [final
    rule](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/disability/section-504-rehabilitation-act-of-1973/part-84-final-rule-fact-sheet/index.html)
    to protect parents and children with disabilities involved with the
    child welfare system. The final rule seeks to ensure that children
    with disabilities are served in the most integrated setting
    appropriate to their needs, and that parents and prospective parents
    do not face discrimination in visitation, reunification, child
    placement, and other child welfare services based on stereotypes
    about their disability.
-   **Cutting child poverty. The Biden-Harris Administration saved
    nearly **[40 million working
    families ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/08/fact-sheet-state-by-state-analysis-of-american-rescue-plan-tax-credits-for-families-and-workers/)with
    **65 million children an average of $2,600** by expanding the Child
    Tax Credit in 2021—helping to cut child poverty nearly in half,
    lifting 1.2 million Hispanic children, 800,000 Black children, and
    almost 100,000 Asian American children out of poverty.
-   **Providing affordable child care for families**. The President has
    secured nearly a 50% increase in child care funding, keeping
    providers [open during the pandemic and bolstering women’s labor
    force
    participation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/11/07/child-care-stabilization/).
    HHS made changes to the [child care subsidy program to lower costs
    for families with
    low-incomes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/29/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-action-to-lower-child-care-costs-for-more-than-100000-families/#:~:text=The%20final%20rule%20will%20reduce,consistent%20with%20HHS%27s%20longstanding%20recommendation.)
    by capping their out of pocket child care costs to 7% of their
    income. 
-   **Providing housing relief for families**. **The Biden-Harris
    Administration has provided rental assistance** to more** **than 5
    million households, including an additional [100,000 low-income
    families](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-plan-to-lower-housing-costs-for-working-families/).
    The Administration established a ceiling for annual rent increases
    for the two million apartments that are financed by federal tax
    credits—reducing the maximum allowable annual rent increase for
    those renters by an average of nearly $500 this year. And during the
    pandemic, the Administration p**rovided rental assistance to **[8
    million
    renters](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/11/the-american-rescue-plan-arp-top-highlights-from-3-years-of-recovery/)** **to

    keep them in their homes, and cover utilities bills.
