I have been briefed on the shooting at Donald Trump’s rally in
Pennsylvania. 

I’m grateful to hear that he’s safe and doing well. I’m praying for him
and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await
further information.

Jill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety.
There’s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as
one nation to condemn it.
