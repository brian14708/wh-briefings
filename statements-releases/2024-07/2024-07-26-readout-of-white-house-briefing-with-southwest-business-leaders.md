On Thursday, July 25, the White House welcomed small business owners and
leaders of local business organizations from Arizona, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico, and Utah for a discussion with senior officials on the
Biden-Harris Administration’s actions to grow the economy from the
middle out and bottom up. More than 40 individuals representing small
businesses, local chambers of commerce, and economic and community
development organizations met with senior officials from the White
House, Treasury Department, and Small Business Administration to discuss
how the Administration is investing in local communities, expanding
access to capital, and helping small businesses in the region adapt to
climate change through incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, more than 1.2 million
jobs have been created and more than $161 billion has been
[invested](https://invest.gov/) by the private sector in the [states
represented](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/resources/state-fact-sheets/)
in Thursday’s meeting. The Administration’s efforts to support
entrepreneurs and communities have powered a small business boom, with
more than 18 million new business applications filed since the President
and Vice President took office, including more than 1.3 million in these
five states alone.

Thursday’s meeting was the third in a series of White House Regional
Business Briefings, following a convening of Mid-Atlantic business
leaders in March and an convening of [Midwest business leaders in
May](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/03/readout-of-white-house-briefing-with-midwest-business-leaders/).
Additional meetings are planned for this fall.

    Administration
-   Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury
-   John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International
    Climate Policy
