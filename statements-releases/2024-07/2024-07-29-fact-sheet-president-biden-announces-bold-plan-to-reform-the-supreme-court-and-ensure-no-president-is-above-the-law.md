title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces Bold Plan to Reform the Supreme Court\
  \ and Ensure No President Is Above the\_Law"
---
 
From his first day in office—and every day since then—President Biden
has taken action to strengthen American democracy and protect the rule
of law.

In recent years, the Supreme Court has overturned long-established legal
precedents protecting fundamental rights. This Court has gutted civil
rights protections, taken away a woman’s right to choose, and now
granted Presidents broad immunity from prosecution for crimes they
commit in office.

At the same time, recent ethics scandals involving some Justices have
caused the public to question the fairness and independence that are
essential for the Court to faithfully carry out its mission to deliver
justice for all Americans.

President Biden believes that no one—neither the President nor the
Supreme Court—is above the law.

In the face of this crisis of confidence in America’s democratic
institutions, President Biden is calling for three bold reforms to
restore trust and accountability:

1.  **No Immunity for Crimes a Former President Committed in Office:**
    President Biden shares the Founders’ belief that the President’s
    power is limited—not absolute—and must ultimately reside with the
    people. He is calling for a constitutional amendment that makes
    clear no President is above the law or immune from prosecution for
    crimes committed while in office. This **No One Is Above the Law
    Amendment** will state that the Constitution does not confer any
    immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or
    sentencing by virtue of previously serving as President.

1.  **Term Limits for Supreme Court Justices:** Congress approved term
    limits for the Presidency over 75 years ago, and President Biden
    believes they should do the same for the Supreme Court. The United
    States is the only major constitutional democracy that gives
    lifetime seats to its high court Justices. Term limits would help
    ensure that the Court’s membership changes with some regularity;
    make timing for Court nominations more predictable and less
    arbitrary; and reduce the chance that any single Presidency imposes
    undue influence for generations to come. President Biden supports a
    system in which the President would appoint a Justice every two
    years to spend eighteen years in active service on the Supreme
    Court.

1.  **Binding Code of Conduct for the Supreme Court:** President Biden
    believes that Congress should pass binding, enforceable conduct and
    ethics rules that require Justices to disclose gifts, refrain from
    public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which
    they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.
    Supreme Court Justices should not be exempt from the enforceable
    code of conduct that applies to every other federal judge.

President Biden and Vice President Harris look forward to working with
Congress and empowering the American people to prevent the abuse of
Presidential power, restore faith in the Supreme Court, and strengthen
the guardrails of democracy. President Biden thanks the Presidential
Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States for its insightful
analysis of Supreme Court reform proposals. The Administration will
continue its work to ensure that no one is above the law – and in
America, the people rule.
