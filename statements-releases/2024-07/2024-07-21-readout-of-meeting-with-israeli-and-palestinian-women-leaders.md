title: "Readout of Meeting with Israeli and Palestinian Women\_Leaders"
---
 
On Friday, Director of the White House Gender Policy Council Jennifer
Klein, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, and U.S.
Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues Geeta Rao Gupta met with
Israeli and Palestinian women leaders working to advance peace and
security efforts in the region. Participants discussed the impact of the
current conflict and humanitarian crisis on women and girls and offered
their perspective on the critical role of women leaders, particularly
from civil society, in resolving the conflict and sustaining long-term
peace. The meeting highlighted the Biden-Harris Administration’s
commitment to end the conflict in Gaza through the ceasefire and hostage
release deal, advance the rights and address the needs of women and
girls, and prioritize women’s meaningful participation in peace and
security processes, whose inclusion leads to more effective policies,
stronger countries, and enhanced regional and global stability.    
   
Last month, the White House held a [meeting on June
17](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/17/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administrations-actions-to-address-conflict-related-sexual-violence/) on
conflict-related sexual violence, including the sexual violence and
atrocities that have been committed by Hamas on and after October 7.
