title: "Joint Statement on F-16s for Ukraine from U.S. President Joseph R. Biden,\
  \ Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, and Danish Prime Minister Mette\_Frederiksen"
---
 
We, the co-leaders of the Air Force Capability Coalition for Ukraine,
have been working to provide operational F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. 

The Danish and Dutch governments are in the process of donating
American-made F-16s to Ukraine, with the support of the United States. 

The transfer process for these F-16s is now underway, and Ukraine will
be flying operational F-16s this summer. We are unable to
provide additional details at this time due to operational security
concerns.

We are grateful to Belgium and Norway for committing to provide further
aircraft, and to the other members of the Air Force Capability Coalition
for their support. 

We are committed to further enhancing Ukraine’s air capabilities, which
will include squadrons of modern fourth generation F-16 multi-role
aircraft. The coalition intends to support their sustainment and
armament, as well as further associated training for
pilots to enhance operational effectiveness.

We will continue to coordinate jointly in support of Ukraine’s ability
to defend itself against Russian aggression.
