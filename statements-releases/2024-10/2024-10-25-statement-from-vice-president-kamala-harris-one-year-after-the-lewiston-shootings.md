title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris One Year After the Lewiston\_\
  Shootings"
---
 
One year ago, an act of senseless violence carried out with a weapon of
war took the lives of 18 loved ones and injured 13 others in Lewiston,
Maine. Doug and I join all Mainers in remembering those who lost their
lives on that fall night, standing with their families, and thinking of
the survivors of this horrific mass shooting.  
   
In the 12 months since this tragedy took place at a local restaurant and
a bowling alley, the Lewiston community has shown incredible unity,
resilience, and strength. They have responded by reminding the nation of
the unacceptable fact that far too many families have experienced the
tremendous pain and trauma caused by the epidemic of gun violence. This
is exactly why I have worked to take action to address this issue with
the urgency it demands and keep our loved ones safe.  
   
With the help of gun violence survivors, families of those who have lost
loved ones, young leaders, and local advocates, our administration
fought to enact the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — the first major
gun safety law in nearly 30 years. We expanded background checks, closed
the gun show loophole, made the largest investment in youth mental
health in history, supported the implementation of red flag laws across
the country, and invested in community violence intervention.
Additionally, we launched the first-ever White House Office of Gun
Violence Prevention, an office that I am proud to oversee. Following the
tragic shooting in Lewiston, this office coordinated the first-ever
federal interagency response – listening to survivors’ needs and
ensuring victim services are tailored to meet them.  
   
While we have made critical progress, there is still work to do to keep
our kids and communities safe. I continue to call on Congress to pass
universal background checks, red flag and safe storage laws, a ban on
bump stocks, and a renewal of the assault weapons ban. In the meantime,
I will continue our work to save lives and ensure that every person in
our nation can live free from violence, fear, and hate.
