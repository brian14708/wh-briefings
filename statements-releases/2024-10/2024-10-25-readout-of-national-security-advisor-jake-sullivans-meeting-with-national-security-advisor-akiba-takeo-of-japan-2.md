National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Japanese National
Security Advisor Akiba Takeo on October 25, 2024, in Washington, D.C.,
to discuss bilateral cooperation and global and regional security
issues.

National Security Advisor Sullivan looks forward to working with Prime
Minister Ishiba’s administration to continue strengthening the
U.S.-Japan global partnership that was celebrated during former Prime
Minister Kishida’s Official Visit to Washington, D.C., last April. Both
National Security Advisors discussed progress on implementing key
initiatives announced during that visit, including efforts to enhance
bilateral defense cooperation and economic security cooperation.

The National Security Advisors also discussed global and regional
security challenges, including Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. 
They expressed grave concern over troop deployments by the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to Russia, potentially for use on the
battlefield against Ukraine. They reaffirmed the central importance of
the U.S.-Japan Alliance in maintaining deterrence in the Indo-Pacific
region and in upholding a free and open, rules-based order.
