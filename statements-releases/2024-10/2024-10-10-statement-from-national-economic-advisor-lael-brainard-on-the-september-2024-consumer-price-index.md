Today’s report shows inflation has fallen back down to 2.4%, the same
rate as right before the pandemic. We keep making progress, with
inflation returning to pre-pandemic levels, 16 million jobs created,
lower interest rates, and low unemployment. Our economy has grown 3.2%
per year under the Biden Harris Administration—stronger than during the
previous administration. Incomes are up almost $4,000, after adjusting
for inflation. We are working around the clock to help the families
affected by Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene recover and rebuild,
supported by our strong and resilient recovery.

President Biden and Vice President Harris will keep fighting to lower
costs—by building new homes to lower rents, capping prescription drug
costs and reducing health insurance premiums, and lowering taxes for
middle-class families—as Congressional Republicans keep pushing
trickle-down economics that would raise costs by nearly $4,000 per
family while cutting taxes for billionaires and big corporations.
