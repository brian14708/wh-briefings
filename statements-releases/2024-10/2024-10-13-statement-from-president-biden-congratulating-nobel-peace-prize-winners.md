title: "Statement from President\_Biden Congratulating Nobel Peace Prize\_Winners"
---
 
This year’s Nobel Peace Prize winners embody determination and
resilience in the face of tragedy. For decades, the members of Nihon
Hidankyo have served as a human testament to the catastrophic human toll
of nuclear weapons, telling a story that humanity needs to hear. On
behalf of the United States, I congratulate them on being awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize for their historic work to ensure that nuclear weapons
are never used again. We also congratulate Japan for this recognition of
the moral clarity and steadfast commitment of its people and government
to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons. 

As I was powerfully reminded last year when I visited Hiroshima and met
with a survivor of the bombing, we must continue making progress toward
the day when we can finally and forever rid the world of nuclear
weapons. The United States stands ready to engage in talks with Russia,
China, and North Korea without preconditions to reduce the nuclear
threat. There is no benefit to our nations or the world to forestall
progress on reducing nuclear arsenals. Reducing the nuclear threat is
important not despite the dangers of today’s world but precisely because
of them. These nuclear risks erode the norms and agreements we have
worked collectively to put in place and run counter to the vital work of
today’s Nobel Laureates.  

Yesterday’s announcement by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee reminds us
that we must continue our progress toward a world free from the threat
of nuclear weapons. Let us all take inspiration from this year’s Nobel
Peace Prize winners and recommit ourselves to the vital work of building
a safer world.
