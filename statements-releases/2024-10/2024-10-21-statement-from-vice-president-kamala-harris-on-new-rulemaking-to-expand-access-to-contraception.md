title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on New Rulemaking to Expand Access\
  \ to Contraception"
---
 
Every woman in every state must have reproductive freedom and access to
the health care they need. That is why I have fought to lower health
care costs and protect the ability of every woman to make her own
decisions about her own body.  
   
Today, our Administration is proposing the largest expansion of
contraception coverage in more than a decade. This new proposed rule
will build on our Administration’s work to protect reproductive freedom
by providing millions of women with more options for the affordable
contraception they need and deserve. That includes coverage for no-cost
over-the-counter contraception without a prescription for the first time
in our nation’s history. These lower contraception costs would be in
addition to the billions of dollars that women have already saved on
contraception under the Affordable Care Act which President Biden and I
have strengthened since taking office.  
   
While we fight to protect and expand health care, extremist so-called
leaders are attacking reproductive freedom at every turn. Republicans in
Congress have repeatedly blocked legislation to protect the right to
contraception across the country. They have also consistently refused to
protect access to IVF, and continue to propose national abortion bans.  
   
President Biden and I stand with the majority of Americans – Republicans
and Democrats alike – who support access to contraception. And we
continue to call on Congress to pass federal legislation that restores
reproductive freedom nationwide.
