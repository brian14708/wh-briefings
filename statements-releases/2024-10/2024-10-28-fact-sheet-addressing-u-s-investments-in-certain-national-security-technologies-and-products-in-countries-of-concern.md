title: "FACT SHEET: Addressing U.S. Investments in Certain National Security Technologies\
  \ and Products in Countries of\_Concern"
---
 
Cross-border investment flows and the United States’ open investment
policy contribute to our economic vitality. Countries of concern,
however, are exploiting certain U.S. outbound investments in ways that
threaten to accelerate the development of sensitive technologies and
products that undermine our national security interests. The
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to keeping America safe by
preventing countries of concern—namely the People’s Republic of
China—from advancing in key technologies that are critical to their
military modernization.

Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a Final Rule to
implement President Biden’s Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023,
“Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security
Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern.”  The Final Rule
provides the operative regulations and a detailed explanatory discussion
regarding its intent and application. 

As directed in the President’s Executive Order, the Final Rule prohibits
U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions involving a defined
set of technologies and products that pose a particularly acute national
security threat to the United States.  The Final Rule also requires U.S.
persons to notify the Department of the Treasury of certain other
transactions involving a defined set of technologies and products that
may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United
States. 

Covered technologies fall into three categories: semiconductors and
microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial
intelligence.  This narrow set of technologies is core to the next
generation of military, cybersecurity, surveillance, and intelligence
applications. 

The United States already prohibits or restricts the export to countries
of concern of many of the technologies and products covered by the Final
Rule.  This program complements the United States’ existing export
control and inbound screening tools by preventing U.S. investment from
advancing the development of sensitive technologies and products in
countries of concern.

Today’s announcement follows extensive and thorough consultations with
hundreds of stakeholders, bipartisan members of Congress, industry
members, and foreign allies and partners and two rounds of formal
comments from the public. The announcement is the final step in the
process President Biden announced in August of 2023 when he signed the
Executive Order.
