National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Director of National
Security Shin Wonsik of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on October 24, 2024,
in Washington, D.C., to discuss bilateral cooperation and global and
regional security issues, particularly regarding the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and its deployment of troops to Russia.

The two officials condemned in the strongest possible terms the DPRK’s
ongoing support to Russia’s brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,
including the deployment of troops to Russia as well as the transfer of
ballistic missiles to Russia and Russia’s use of these missiles against
Ukraine. The DPRK’s support is directly increasing the suffering of the
Ukrainian people, violates multiple United Nations Security Council
resolutions, undermines the global non-proliferation regime, and has
significant security implications for Europe, the Korean Peninsula, and
the Indo-Pacific region. The two officials committed to continuing close
cooperation in support of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.

The two officials discussed recent concerning actions taken by the DPRK,
including changes to its constitution to define the ROK as a hostile
state and the bombing of roads and railways connecting the South and
North. The two officials reaffirmed that the United States and the ROK
will maintain a strong combined defense posture in the face of the
DPRK’s activities in border areas. National Security Advisor Sullivan
reiterated the U.S. ironclad commitment to the ROK.

National Security Advisor Sullivan noted the precedent-setting
cooperation between the United States that has been spearheaded by the
leadership of President Biden and President Yoon. In particular, they
noted the adoption of the U.S.-ROK Guidelines for Nuclear Deterrence and
Nuclear Operations on the Korean Peninsula in July. The U.S.-ROK
Alliance has expanded into a truly global partnership. From cooperation
on the world’s most challenging security threats to setting the
foundation for a clean energy future, the two officials agreed that the
Alliance is poised to stand the test of time.
