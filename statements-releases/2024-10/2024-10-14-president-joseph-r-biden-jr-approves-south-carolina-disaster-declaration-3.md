President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster exists in
the State of South Carolina and ordered Federal assistance to supplement
state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
Tropical Storm Debby from August 4 to August 22, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by Tropical Storm Debby in the counties of Bamberg,
Barnwell, Berkeley, Colleton, Dillon, Dorchester, Georgetown, Hampton,
Horry, Jasper, Orangeburg, and Union.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Brett H. Howard of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
