title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Lilly\_Ledbetter"
---
 
Lilly Ledbetter was a fearless leader and advocate for equal pay. Her
fight began on the factory floor and reached the Supreme Court and
Congress, and she never stopped fighting for all Americans to be paid
what they deserve. Before she was a household name, Lilly was like so
many other women in the workforce: she worked hard, with dignity, only
to find out she was being paid less than a man for the same work.

Because of Lilly’s tireless efforts, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act—a
critical step forward in the fight to close the gender and racial wage
gaps—became the first bill signed in the Obama-Biden Administration. It
was an honor to stand with Lilly as the bill that bears her name was
made law.

Lilly’s decades of relentless advocacy inspired us all and have brought
us closer to living up to our Nation’s core values of equality and
fairness. Vice President Harris and I remain committed to building on
Lilly’s legacy and to strengthening equal pay protections for all
workers.

Jill and I send our love and condolences to Lilly’s family and all of
the women she empowered and continues to inspire.
