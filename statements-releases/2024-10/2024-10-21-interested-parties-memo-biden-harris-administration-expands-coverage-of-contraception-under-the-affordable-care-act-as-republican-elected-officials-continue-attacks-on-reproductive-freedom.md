title: "Interested Parties Memo: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Expands Coverage\
  \ of Contraception Under the Affordable Care Act as Republican Elected Officials\
  \ Continue Attacks on Reproductive\_Freedom"
---
 
*Jennifer Klein, Director, White House Gender Policy Council*

Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership, the
Administration is taking bold action to expand coverage of contraception
for the 52 million women of reproductive age with private health
insurance, marking the most significant expansion of contraception
benefits under the Affordable Care Act in more than a decade. Today’s
announcement builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s strong record
of defending access to reproductive health care and commitment to
ensuring that women have the freedom to make deeply personal health care
decisions, including if and when to start or grow their family.  
  
Meanwhile, Republican elected officials continue to threaten women’s
health, lives, and freedom through extreme abortion bans, some with no
exceptions for rape or incest. Women are being denied essential medical
care while doctors and nurses are threatened with jail time. Abortion,
contraception, and IVF are under attack, while Republicans in Congress
refuse to protect nationwide access to this vital reproductive health
care. This extreme agenda is out-of-touch with the American people—which
is why voters have overwhelmingly chosen to protect reproductive freedom
in every state where abortion has been on the ballot.  
President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the vast majority
of Americans in supporting a woman’s right to choose, and they will
continue the fight against a national abortion ban and call on Congress
to restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law once and for
all.  
  
**Women’s Health and Lives at Risk  
**From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris knew that
state abortion bans would have devastating consequences for women’s
health and lives. Since *Roe* was overturned, more than 1 in 3 women of
reproductive age live in the more than 20 states with dangerous and
extreme abortion bans in effect.

-   **<u>Abortion bans are leaving women without emergency care.</u>**
    Courageous women and their families have shared harrowing stories
    about being denied urgently needed care because of state abortion
    bans. Women have died because they did not get the care they
    needed—or women only received care after developing sepsis or losing
    more than half of their blood. Some women are suing their states so
    other women with severe and dangerous pregnancy complications will
    not be similarly forced to the brink of death before they can
    receive an abortion.  
-   **<u>Abortion bans are</u>** **worsening** **maternal mortality.**
    States with abortion bans have [higher rates of maternal
    mortality](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/dec/us-maternal-health-divide-limited-services-worse-outcomes)
    than states where abortion remains legal. For instance, after a
    dangerous Texas abortion ban went into effect in 2021, maternal
    mortality [increased by
    56%](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/texas-abortion-ban-deaths-pregnant-women-sb8-analysis-rcna171631)
    (compared to 11% nationwide). One year after *Dobbs*, [two-thirds of
    OBGYNs](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/report/a-national-survey-of-obgyns-experiences-after-dobbs/)
    reported that the Court’s decision worsened pregnancy-related
    mortality and their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies.
    And criminal and civil penalties under state abortion bans are
    causing [doctors to flee abortion ban
    states](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/23/1177542605/abortion-bans-drive-off-doctors-and-put-other-health-care-at-risk),
    exacerbating the maternal health crisis and creating maternity care
    deserts that impact entire communities.   
-   **<u>Abortion bans are making it even harder to access contraception
    and other essential care.</u>** Since *Roe* was overturned, abortion
    bans have caused
    [dozens](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/06/abortion-clinics-closure-roe-bans)
    of reproductive health care clinics to shutter, jeopardizing access
    to abortion, contraception, and preventive care that women rely on.
    In states with abortion bans, there were over 4% fewer filled
    prescriptions for oral contraception in the first year after *Roe*
    was overturned. Some states had far greater declines: Texas, for
    instance, had a [28%
    decline](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820370?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2024.18620)
    in filled prescriptions for oral contraception.  
-   **<u>Abortion bans are forcing women to travel hundreds of miles for
    care.</u>** State abortion bans are forcing many women to travel to
    another state to obtain care that would have been available in their
    state if *Roe* were still the law of the land. Women in [nearly a
    quarter of
    counties](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/24/abortion-travel-distances-200-miles-post-roe)
    in America—especially in the South—have been forced to travel more
    than 200 miles to get the essential care they need.  
-   **<u>Abortion bans are jeopardizing our ability to train the next
    generation of medical providers.</u>** States with abortion bans
    continue to see a
    [decrease](https://www.aamcresearchinstitute.org/our-work/data-snapshot/post-dobbs-2024)
    in medical and residency student applications, especially among
    prospective OBGYNs. [Nearly
    60%](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/states-abortion-bans-young-doctors-survey-rcna84899)
    of third- and fourth-year medical students said they were unlikely
    or very unlikely to apply to a single residency program in a state
    with abortion restrictions, while nearly 80% said that access to
    abortion care would influence where they would pursue their
    residency. And about [1 in 5 OBGYN
    residents](https://www.acog.org/advocacy/abortion-is-essential/trending-issues/issue-brief-training-and-workforce-after-dobbs)
    said that the overturning of *Roe* changed where they had planned to
    practice medicine, and those who had planned to practice in a state
    with abortion bans were eight times more likely to change their
    intended practice location.

**Republican Officials’ Extreme Agenda  
  
**Despite the devastating impact of state abortion bans, Republican
officials continue to push for a nationwide abortion ban to restrict the
rights of women in every state, deny access to emergency medical care,
and eliminate access to safe and effective, FDA-approved medication
abortion.

-   Republicans in Congress have proposed **four** **national abortion
    bans that would deny every woman in America the right to choose**,
    regardless of where she lives. This includes a [nationwide abortion
    ban](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/22/fact-sheet-house-republicans-endorse-a-national-abortion-ban-with-zero-exceptions-in-latest-budget/)
    with no exceptions for rape or incest that puts IVF treatment
    squarely at risk. House Republicans have also **attacked
    contraception access nationwide** by repeatedly proposing to defund
    the Title X Family Planning Program. And Senate Republicans continue
    to **block federal legislation that would safeguard nationwide
    access to abortion, contraception, and IVF**.  
-   Republican elected officials **have enacted or enforced abortion
    bans in more than 20 states.** Republican attorneys general have
    made clear they seek to **access women’s medical records**—even for
    out-of-state care—and have tried to **discourage women from
    traveling out-of-state** to receive lawful abortion care by
    [threatening](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alabama-reproductive-rights-advocates-battle-threat-prosecution-rcna164036)
    those who help them with **criminal charges**.  
-   Republican elected officials **filed more than 350 bills restricting
    abortion during the 2024 legislative session.** In Louisiana,
    Republican officials
    [classified](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-louisiana-controlled-dangerous-substances-0984bfed536a5110997dd9c8264bf9e3)
    medications used in abortion and miscarriage management as
    controlled substances, making it even harder to access these
    critical medications during an emergency. In Florida, state
    officials are attempting to
    [undermine](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/florida-abortion-ballot-measure-under-fire-by-state-government)
    support for a reproductive freedom ballot measure, including by
    [threatening](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-abortion-rights-florida-amendment-4-caroline-ad-rcna174387)
    TV stations that run ads with criminal charges. And Republican state
    legislators are proposing legislation that would [jeopardize access
    to
    IVF](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/personhood-bills-ivf-restrictions-alabama-rcna140228).  
-   Republican elected officials want to **ban** **medication abortion
    nationwide**, including in states where abortion remains lawful.
    They are also fighting to prevent **women from receiving the
    emergency medical care** they are entitled to under federal law—
    including abortion care when necessary to save a woman’s health or
    life.

No attempt to “rebrand” can change the fact that Republican elected
officials have spent decades undermining reproductive freedom.
Republican elected officials will not stop pursuing extreme policies
until there is a national abortion ban in place.
