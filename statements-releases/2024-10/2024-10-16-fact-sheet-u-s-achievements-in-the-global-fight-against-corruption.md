title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. Achievements in the Global Fight Against\_Corruption"
---
 
Corruption poses a grave and enduring threat to U.S. national interests
and those of our partners. When officials abuse their entrusted power
for personal or political gain, the interests of authoritarians and
corrupt actors win – at the expense of citizens, honest businesses, and
healthy societies. As the Biden-Harris Administration took office, this
longstanding challenge had metastasized. In some countries, oligarchs
were teaming up with foreign kleptocrats to warp policy and procurement
decisions in exchange for kickbacks – with no accountability. Corrupt
officials were laundering stolen assets through the U.S. and global
financial systems, while local investigators were ill-equipped to follow
the money. Reformers in countries saddled with corruption had scarce
public resources to actually address development needs. The Biden-Harris
Administration tackled these challenges starting Day One, to ensure
democracy delivers and corrupt actors are held to account.

The first [National Security Study
Memorandum ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/memorandum-on-establishing-the-fight-against-corruption-as-a-core-united-states-national-security-interest/)of
the Biden-Harris Administration established countering corruption as a
“core U.S. national security interest,” leading to the issuance in
December 2021 of the first [United States Strategy on Countering
Corruption](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/06/fact-sheet-u-s-strategy-on-countering-corruption/).
Since then, the United States has taken action at home and around the
world to curb illicit finance, hold corrupt actors accountable, forge
multilateral partnerships, and equip frontline leaders to take on
transnational corruption. The result has been historic progress in
protecting the U.S. financial system from money-laundering, including in
the residential real estate sector, while enhancing corporate
transparency. This Administration has mobilized record levels of foreign
assistance dedicated to anti-corruption, including $339 million in
Fiscal Year 2023 alone – almost double the yearly average during the
previous four years. This new assistance has unlocked support for
anti-corruption institutions, leveled the playing field for law-abiding
businesses, enabled journalists to team up across borders, and more.
Expanded law enforcement cooperation and capacity-building have
generated convictions of corrupt actors as well as the seizure,
forfeiture, and return of criminal proceeds, while new anti-corruption
offices at the Department of State (State) and the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) energized diplomatic and stakeholder
engagement. The United States imposed sanctions on more than 500
individuals and entities for corruption and related activities, and
established – for the first time in any jurisdiction globally – a new
visa restriction for those who enable corrupt activity.

U.S. progress on anti-corruption has produced concrete benefits for the
American people and stakeholders around the world – enhancing
**prosperity**, **economic security**, **safety**, and **democracy**, as
outlined below. To bolster and sustain this work, the U.S. government
has also **modernized** its approach to addressing corruption as a
cross-cutting priority. Today, Deputy National Security Advisor for
International Economics Daleep Singh will highlight the benefits of this
work to American businesses and workers at a White House anti-corruption
roundtable with leaders from 15 major U.S. companies.

***<u>Advancing economic opportunity abroad</u>***

-   **Improving the business enabling environment:** U.S. assistance
    advanced governments’ capacity to prevent, detect, investigate, and
    prosecute corruption, while encouraging anti-bribery compliance.
    State expanded its Fiscal Transparency Innovation Fund – to help
    willing partners improve budget transparency – while holding
    countries to account for progress in its Fiscal Transparency Report.
    In the past two years alone, a newly expanded State-Federal Bureau
    of Investigations (FBI) program facilitated U.S. collaboration with
    foreign counterparts on more than 50 transnational corruption and
    money laundering cases with a U.S. nexus. In coordination with
    State, experienced legal advisors from the U.S. Department of
    Justice (DOJ) assisted foreign justice partners around the world in
    investigating and prosecuting corruption and money laundering cases,
    and recovering assets. And DOJ’s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery
    Initiative, in partnership with the FBI and the Department of
    Homeland Security, has recovered more than $1.7 billion and returned
    or assisted in returning more than $1.6 billion for the benefit of
    the people harmed by the corruption.
-   **Enforcing our bans on foreign bribery and money-laundering – and
    pressing other countries to do the same:** To enable honest
    companies to compete overseas, the United States upheld its
    commitments under the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention by enforcing its
    foreign bribery and related laws and working with partners to
    monitor other countries’ progress in implementing the Convention,
    which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2024. Since the start of
    the Administration, DOJ has imposed more than $3.5 billion in total
    monetary sanctions under the Foreign Corruption Practices Act (FCPA)
    in 16 corporate resolutions, and announced charges against more than
    70 individuals. For instance, this April the former Comptroller
    General of Ecuador was convicted of money laundering relating to his
    receipt of over $10 million in bribes from, among others, the
    Brazil-based construction conglomerate Odebrecht S.A. The Securities
    and Exchange Commission continued civil enforcement of the FCPA,
    with approximately $1 billion in total monetary sanctions in 22
    corporate resolutions, spanning conduct in 24 countries, since the
    start of the Administration. DOJ is also enforcing the recently
    enacted Foreign Extortion Prevention Act, which criminalizes demands
    for bribes by foreign officials from U.S. companies and others. In
    addition, this August DOJ announced a new Corporate Whistleblower
    Awards Pilot Program to uncover and prosecute corporate crime – with
    a particular focus on foreign and domestic corruption, as well as
    violations by financial institutions of their obligations to take
    steps to detect and deter money laundering.
-   **Seizing windows of opportunity:** U.S. assistance has become more
    agile via the establishment of USAID’s Anti-Corruption Response Fund
    (providing flexible support to countries experiencing new
    opportunities or backsliding), the State-DOJ Global Anti-Corruption
    Rapid Response Fund (providing assistance and case mentoring to
    foreign partners on short notice), and USAID’s Democracy Delivers
    initiative (which has marshalled $500 million in funding from the
    United States and others to help reformers deliver, including on
    their anti-corruption commitments). These innovations, informed by
    USAID’s Dekleptification Guide, are enabling the U.S. government to
    more nimbly pivot toward environments where local momentum can be
    bolstered by outside assistance.
-   **Bolstering integrity in high-risk sectors:** In April 2024, the
    United States and its partners launched the Blue Dot Network – a
    mechanism to certify infrastructure projects that have met global
    standards for quality and sustainability, including transparency in
    procurement and provisions to limit opportunities for corruption.
    The United States also supported the launch of PROTECT, a collective
    action project to address corruption risk in the supply chain for
    critical minerals.
-   **Strengthening corruption safeguards in the Indo-Pacific:** In
    June, the United States and thirteen other partners held a signing
    ceremony, after concluding eight rounds of negotiations in record
    time, for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)
    Fair Economy Agreement. The Agreement aims to create a more
    transparent, predictable trade and investment environment across
    IPEF partners’ markets, including through binding obligations to
    prevent and combat corruption. The Department of Commerce (Commerce)
    and State are accelerating implementation by offering new
    anti-corruption technical assistance to IPEF partners, including
    workshops on procurement corruption.
-   **Dialoguing with the private sector:** In 2021, State launched the
    Galvanizing the Private Sector as Partners in Combatting Corruption
    initiative, which connects companies and governments to strengthen
    business integrity and encourage governance reform. Commerce’s
    International Trade Administration organized the 2024 forum of the
    Business Ethics for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Small
    and Medium Enterprises Initiative – the world’s largest
    public-private partnership on ethical business conduct – at which
    stakeholders formalized policy recommendations on business integrity
    in public procurement.

***<u>Protecting the U.S. financial system from abuse</u>***

-   **Expanding corporate transparency:** To deter kleptocrats and
    criminals from laundering money through anonymous shell companies,
    the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) operationalized a new
    filing system for certain companies operating in the United States
    to report their beneficial owners – the real people who own or
    control them – pursuant to the bipartisan Corporate Transparency
    Act. Treasury held hundreds of outreach events across all states and
    territories, reaching thousands of stakeholders, to enable companies
    to quickly and easily comply with this reporting requirement.
-   **Closing loopholes for money-laundering:** Treasury finalized rules
    to close two major loopholes in the U.S. financial system: (1) to
    increase transparency in the U.S. residential real estate sector, to
    ensure that law-abiding homebuyers are not disadvantaged by
    individuals laundering their ill-gotten gains, and (2) to safeguard
    the investment adviser industry from illicit finance. Treasury also
    proposed a rule to modernize financial institutions’
    anti-money-laundering/countering the financing of terrorism
    (AML/CFT) programs, to make them more effective and risk-based.
    Together, these rulemakings represent historic advances for the U.S.
    AML/CFT regime, in line with international standards, that will help
    the United States urge other countries to undertake similar reforms
    to curb illicit finance. The Biden-Harris Administration has also
    called on Congress to close even more loopholes that facilitate
    money-laundering by passing the ENABLERS Act.
-   **Blocking assets and denying entry to corrupt actors:** Since the
    start of the Administration, Treasury has designated more than 500
    individuals and entities for corruption and related activities,
    across six continents. That includes blocking the assets of 20
    individuals and 48 companies in Fiscal Year 2024 for corruption in
    Afghanistan, Guatemala, Guyana, Paraguay, Western Balkans, and
    Zimbabwe. In tandem, State publicly issued corruption-related visa
    restrictions for 76 foreign officials and family members in Fiscal
    Year 2024, and 292 over the course of the Administration. These
    actions have protected the U.S. financial system from corrupt actors
    and promoted accountability in domestic jurisdictions. For example,
    just one week after the U.S. issuance of a public visa restriction
    on former Director of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) Intelligence Services
    Osman Mehmedagic for significant corruption, he was arrested by BiH
    authorities for abuse of office.
-   **Taking aim at enablers of corruption:** In December 2023,
    President Biden issued an historic Presidential Proclamation
    establishing a visa restriction for those who facilitate and enable
    significant corruption and their immediate family members. This new
    visa restriction complements existing commitments to use sanction
    and law enforcement capabilities to target private enablers of
    public corruption. Earlier this year, the FBI and DOJ secured a
    guilty plea and a criminal penalty of $661 million from Gunvor – one
    of the largest commodities trading firms in the world – for
    facilitating bribery of Ecuadorian officials and laundering those
    bribes through U.S. banks. In addition, USAID launched new
    activities to incentivize integrity within professions that serve as
    gatekeepers to the international financial system.
-   **Upholding international standards:** The United States has helped
    lead efforts to expand anti-corruption work at the Financial Action
    Task Force (FATF), including improving assessment tools, mitigating
    risks associated with “golden passport” programs, and highlighting
    how non-financial sectors can be abused by corrupt actors.

***<u>Keeping America and our partners safe</u>* **

-   **Addressing corruption risk in the security sector:** Security
    sector corruption can divert essential supplies, empower malign
    actors, threaten the safety of U.S. service members, and undermine
    U.S. military missions writ large. In the past year, the Department
    of Defense (DOD) incorporated corruption risk into its security
    cooperation planning – subjecting certain proposals to further
    scrutiny and identifying risk mitigation measures as needed. State
    also created new resources to weigh corruption risk as part of
    security sector assistance decision-making. In addition, State’s
    Global Defense Reform Program and DOD’s institutional capacity
    building programs advanced more transparent, accountable, and
    professional defense institutions. DOD continued running a training
    course on combatting corruption for partner military commanders and
    civilian leaders.
-   **Tackling organized crime and corruption:** Transnational criminal
    organizations often rely on corruption to enable their criminal
    activities and evade accountability – which fuels narcotrafficking
    into the United States, human smuggling, cybercrimes, and more. The
    U.S. government is deploying anti-corruption tools to target
    criminal networks and their financial enablers, in line with the
    2023 White House Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime.
-   **Standing up to Russia’s aggression:** The United States has
    adapted to address the wartime needs of Ukraine’s anti-corruption
    stakeholders, as they close off a key vector for Russian dominance
    and advance Ukraine’s democratic future. In 2023, Ukrainian
    anti-corruption investigators and prosecutors achieved an 80 percent
    increase in prosecutions and a 50 percent increase in convictions,
    plus opened cases against high-ranking officials including the
    former head of the Ukrainian Supreme Court.  With U.S. support,
    Ukraine has advanced significant reforms on asset disclosure,
    launched a whistleblower portal, strengthened the National
    Anti-Corruption Bureau, and enhanced transparency and integrity in
    reconstruction.
-   **Securing a greener future:** The United States has integrated an
    anti-corruption lens across sectors, with particular emphasis on
    addressing corruption vulnerabilities that threaten a secure, just
    energy transition for all. This includes USAID support to the
    Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), increased
    mining transparency in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia,
    and innovations that address transnational corruption in green
    energy mineral supply chains across 15 countries.
-   **Protecting global health:** Corruption curtails the ability of
    states to respond to pandemics and undercuts access to basic
    healthcare. USAID is tackling this challenge by releasing
    cutting-edge guidance on anti-corruption in the health sector and
    launching integrated programming. For example, in Liberia the United
    States is working with the government to curb theft of
    pharmaceuticals through civil society monitoring, law enforcement
    trainings, and public awareness campaigns.
-   **Addressing the root causes of migration:** Combating corruption is
    a core component of improving conditions in El Salvador, Guatemala,
    and Honduras – so people do not feel compelled to leave their homes,
    in line with the U.S. Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of
    Migration in Central America. Recent U.S. actions have included
    training up to 27,000 justice sector stakeholders in those countries
    to more effectively address corruption.

***<u>Defending democracy by rooting out corruption</u>***

-   **Tackling electoral corruption:** When candidates can be bankrolled
    by foreign adversaries and institutions captured by kleptocrats,
    citizens lose faith in their governments—or even in democracy
    itself. In response, USAID has launched new programs to bolster
    electoral integrity, strengthen independent media, and increase the
    transparency of political finance in high-risk locations.
-   **Lifting up civil society and independent media:** The U.S.
    government has substantially expanded support to frontline activists
    and journalists, including through the Global Anti-Corruption
    Consortium. In addition, a new State Department initiative is
    training hundreds of journalists in transnational corruption
    investigations, while USAID’s new investigative journalist networks
    in Asia and Southern Africa are building capacity to track
    corruption across sectors and across borders. The Secretary of State
    established a new award for Anti-Corruption Champions, which has
    honored dozens of courageous civil society leaders and embattled
    reformers. In 2022, the United States also hosted the largest
    regular gathering of civil society activists fighting corruption –
    the International Anti-Corruption Conference – in Washington, DC,
    with keynote remarks from APNSA Jake Sullivan.
-   **Protecting sovereignty:** Authoritarian actors like Russia and the
    PRC use bribery to interfere in the policy, procurement, debt, and
    electoral processes of other countries – undermining both
    sovereignty and democracy. The United States is standing up to this
    tactic by building the resilience of frontline actors to detect and
    deflect foreign-backed strategic corruption, educating partners
    about the kleptocrats’ playbook, harnessing sanction tools to deter
    threats, and increasing collaboration between practitioners working
    on anti-corruption and those addressing foreign malign influence –
    both within the USG and with likeminded partners. For example, in
    June the United States joined with Canada and the UK to expose
    Russia’s use of corruption and covert financing, among other
    tactics, to undermine democratic processes in Moldova.
-   **Restoring trust in American democracy:** The Biden-Harris
    Administration has established the strongest ethics standards of any
    U.S. presidency. On his first day in office, the President signed an
    Executive Order requiring administration officials to take a
    stringent ethics pledge, which extends lobbying bans, limits shadow
    lobbying, and makes ethics waivers more transparent. The
    Administration also restored longstanding democratic norms by
    protecting DOJ cases from political interference, releasing the
    President’s and Vice-President’s taxes, and voluntarily disclosing
    White House visitor logs. And in the last year, the Office of
    Government Ethics finalized rules updating the standards for ethical
    conduct and legal expense funds for executive branch employees.
-   **Protecting American democracy from malign finance:** Just as we
    defend democracy around the world, the U.S. government is working to
    keep American democracy safe from foreign adversaries. Actions to
    curb money laundering in the United States can help reduce the
    ability of foreign and domestic actors to make illegal campaign
    contributions and evade U.S. election laws. President Biden has
    called on Congress to go even further by passing the DISCLOSE Act,
    which would curb the ability of foreign entities and special
    interests to use dark money loopholes to influence our elections.
-   **Revitalizing participation in the Open Government Partnership
    (OGP):** The United States rejoined the Steering Committee of OGP –
    a platform for civil society and governments to forge joint
    commitments and learn from each other– and provided assistance for
    OGP’s work on anti-corruption. Domestically, the United States has
    turbocharged OGP implementation by creating the U.S. Open Government
    Secretariat at the General Services Administration, an Open
    Government Federal Advisory Committee, an Interagency Community of
    Practice – spanning federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial
    governments, and engaged with hundreds of stakeholders to exchange
    lessons and expand transparency, accountability, and public
    participation. The United States also launched the first-ever
    Request for Information to feed into the 6<sup>th</sup> U.S. OGP
    National Action Plan and announced development of a toolkit to help
    federal agencies more meaningfully engage with the public.

***<u>Modernizing and coordinating U.S. government efforts to fight
corruption</u>***

-   **Institutionalizing anti-corruption as an enduring priority:** Over
    the past four years, Departments and Agencies have made substantial
    organizational improvements to elevate corruption concerns. For
    example:
    -   The State Department’s new Office of the Coordinator on Global
        Anti-Corruption leads the i**ntegration of anti-corruption
        priorities into bilateral and other policy processes, conducts
        targeted diplomatic engagements, and drives strategic planning,
        including through the Department’s senior-level**
        Anti-Corruption Policy Board. In the past year, the Office
        jumpstarted implementation of **the Combating Global Corruption
        Act** and completed an analysis of anti-corruption assistance to
        inform future State Department decision-making.
    -   USAID’s new Anti-Corruption Center, within the newly established
        Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance, serves as a
        hub of technical expertise and thought leadership – driving the
        integration of corruption considerations across USAID’s
        portfolio, supporting USAID Missions in developing localized
        approaches, managing a suite of programming focused on
        transnational corruption, and using its convening power and
        policy insights to forge strategic partnerships. Since 2022,
        USAID has released its first-ever
        [](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/policy) Anti-Corruption
        Policy, which outlines a cross-sectoral approach to constraining
        opportunities for corruption, raising the costs of corruption,
        and incentivizing integrity – plus a host of tools to drive
        uptake across USAID.
    -   FBI’s International Corruption Unit expanded an agreement with
        the State Department to deploy six regional anti-corruption
        advisors to strategic locations around the world, where they
        organize regional working groups with local law enforcement
        officials, provide case-base mentorship, and facilitate
        coordination with the International Anti-Corruption Coordination
        Centre.

Expanded interagency capacity has been complemented by the National
Security Council’s establishment of a dedicated Director for
Anti-Corruption position, for the first time, to ensure
whole-of-government coordination and advance anti-corruption within key
policy processes.

-   **Leading in multilateral fora:** The United States has regained its
    leadership role in the international bodies that shape
    anti-corruption norms globally and can sustain momentum across time.
    In particular, the United States stepped into the presidency of the
    UN Convention against Corruption Conference of States Parties (UNCAC
    COSP), proudly hosting in December 2023 thousands of stakeholders in
    Atlanta, Georgia, led by the U.S. Representative to the United
    Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield. As part of its commitment to
    championing the role of non-governmental actors in the fight against
    corruption, the United States facilitated record civil society
    participation in UNCAC working group meetings, hosted the first
    UNCAC Private Sector Forum, and supported inclusive implementation
    of UNCAC commitments in Latin America, East Africa, and Southeast
    Asia. The United States also participated in several peer reviews of
    our own anti-corruption practices over the last three years, and
    proudly made these results public. Alongside these multilateral
    fora, we convened the Global Forum on Asset Recovery action series
    to accelerate practitioner cooperation across the United States,
    Algeria, Honduras, Iraq, Moldova, Nigeria, Seychelles, Ukraine, the
    United Kingdom, and Zambia.
-   **Understanding corruption dynamics:** The Intelligence Community
    developed and disseminated new resources to bolster intelligence
    prioritization, collection and analysis on corrupt actors and their
    networks. USAID commissioned research on topics like countering
    corruption through social and behavioral change and State initiated
    an interagency anti-corruption learning agenda and a small grants
    program to support it.
-   **Deepening external partnerships:** The United States convened a
    series of coordination meetings with other bilateral donors and
    philanthropies in order to harmonize our anti-corruption approaches
    and galvanized anti-corruption resources across the donor community
    through the Integrity for Development campaign. USAID’s Countering
    Transnational Corruption Grand Challenge for Development brought
    together technologists, businesses, activists, and others to
    collaboratively address concrete corruption challenges.
