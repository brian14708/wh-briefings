title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Negotiations Between USMX and the\
  \ International Longshoremen\u2019s Association"
---
 
Collective bargaining is the best way for workers to get the pay and
benefits they deserve. I have urged USMX, which represents a group of
foreign-owned carriers, to come to the table and present a fair offer to
the workers of the International Longshoremen’s Association that ensures
they are paid appropriately in line with their invaluable contributions.
Ocean carriers have made record profits since the pandemic and in some
cases profits grew in excess of 800 percent compared to their profits
prior to the pandemic. Executive compensation has grown in line with
those profits and profits have been returned to shareholders at record
rates. It’s only fair that workers, who put themselves at risk during
the pandemic to keep ports open, see a meaningful increase in their
wages as well.

As our nation climbs out of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene,
dockworkers will play an essential role in getting communities the
resources they need. Now is not the time for ocean carriers to refuse to
negotiate a fair wage for these essential workers while raking in record
profits. My Administration will be monitoring for any price gouging
activity that benefits foreign ocean carriers, including those on the
USMX board.

It is time for USMX to negotiate a fair contract with the longshoremen
that reflects the substantial contribution they’ve been making to our
economic comeback.
