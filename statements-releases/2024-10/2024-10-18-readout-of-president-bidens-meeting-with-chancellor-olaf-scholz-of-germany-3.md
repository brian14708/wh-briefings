  Germany"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of
Germany at the Chancellery to discuss the longstanding U.S.-German
relationship, grounded in our shared democratic values.  The two leaders
coordinated on support for Ukraine in its self-defense against Russian
aggression; efforts to counter antisemitism and other forms of hate at
home and abroad; the Middle East; amongst other global issues. 
President Biden expressed his appreciation for Chancellor Scholz’s
leadership in increasing Germany’s investment in NATO’s collective
defense and in securing the release of wrongfully detained Americans,
along with other human rights activists and political dissidents from
Russian prison, earlier this year. He also underscored the U.S.
commitment to continue working together to address the challenges of
today and tomorrow and deliver results for both our peoples.
