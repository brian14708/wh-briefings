On the occasion of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s visit to Germany, the
United States reaffirms its commitment to deepening the close and
historic bond between the two nations as Allies and friends.  For over
75 years, Germany has been a crucial partner in ensuring the stability,
security, and prosperity of the transatlantic alliance.  In October
2023, President Biden welcomed President Steinmeier to Washington during
[German-American
Day,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/06/joint-statement-from-the-president-of-the-united-states-joseph-r-biden-jr-and-the-president-of-germany-frank-walter-steinmeier-on-german-american-day/)
underscoring the enduring people-to-people ties between our two
countries, including the over 40 million Americans who claim German
heritage and strengthen the diverse fabric of the United States.  In
February 2024, President Biden welcomed Chancellor Olaf Scholz to the
White House, where the two leaders reaffirmed their support for
Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s war of aggression, discussed regional
stability in the Middle East, and prepared for the NATO Summit in
Washington.

During his visit to Germany, President Biden will underscore our mutual
commitment to upholding democracy, combating antisemitism and hatred,
and expanding collaboration to promote economic growth and technological
innovation.  In addition, he will express gratitude to Germany for its
role in hosting approximately 39,000 U.S. service members and its vital
contributions to the security of NATO and the broader transatlantic
community. 

The United States and Germany are partners in a wide range of new and
continuing initiatives to address the most pressing challenges of our
time, some of which are listed below.

**SECURITY AND DEFENSE**

-   The United States and Germany cooperate through several multilateral
    institutions including NATO, the G7, the OSCE, and the UN, to
    advance security, democracy, and the rule of law globally.
-   As host to the largest U.S. troop presence in Europe and second
    largest globally, Germany continues to play a critical role as a
    platform for U.S. military force projection, including support for
    NATO’s eastern flank and training for Ukrainian soldiers. 
-   Germany has been a key provider of [military assistance to
    Ukraine](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/military-support-ukraine-2054992)
    in its defense against the Kremlin’s aggression.  Contributions
    include advanced weaponry such as Leopard 2 tanks, air defense
    systems (such as IRIS-T), artillery, and ammunition. Germany also
    supplies medical aid, vehicles, and training for Ukrainian forces,
    continuously adapting its support to Ukraine’s evolving needs in
    coordination with NATO allies.
-   As announced by President Biden and Chancellor Scholz on July 10,
    2024, the United States looks forward to beginning the episodic
    deployments of its Multi-Domain Task Force in Germany in 2026, as
    part of planning for enduring stationing of these conventional
    long-range fire capabilities in the future.
-   Germany plays a key role in the [U.S-Italy
    co-led](https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-ukraine-energy-sector-support/)
    G7+ Coordination Group for Ukraine Energy Security Support.  Germany
    has been a leading provider of financial assistance and critical
    components such as transformers and power generators to support the
    repair and strengthening of Ukraine’s energy sector in response to
    Russia’s continued brutal attacks on civilian infrastructure.
-   Germany is a robust partner in the fight against terrorism and
    terrorism financing, in the Financial Action Task Force, and as part

    assistance to countries undergoing democratic renewal, including
    Guatemala, Armenia, and Moldova, with the aim of strengthening
    global democratic resilience.
-   Germany has increasingly recognized the importance of supporting
    Taiwan as a like-minded democratic partner.  Education Minister
    Stark-Watzinger’s visit to Taiwan in 2023 marked the first visit by
    a German minister to Taiwan in 26 years.  Two German warships
    recently transited the Taiwan Strait, a visible demonstration of
    Germany’s commitment to upholding international laws and norms and
    increasing engagement to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific
    region.
-   Germany was one of the first of twenty-one countries to endorse the
    U.S. government’s Framework to Counter Foreign State Information
    Manipulation, the U.S. Department of State’s key initiative to

    **USA For You** program brings youth from underserved German
    communities to the United States for a two-week homestay and
    community service experience.  The program promotes civic engagement
    and helps counter extremism and xenophobia by fostering cultural
    understanding.  In 2023, the German government launched a reciprocal
    **Germany for You** program, allowing American high school students
    to visit Germany for a similar exchange, further strengthening
    transatlantic ties.
-   The **Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX)**, jointly funded by
    the United States and German governments, supports the transatlantic
    relationship by fostering year-long academic, homestay, and
    community service opportunities for 700 American and German youth
    annually.  Since 1983, CBYX has promoted cross-cultural
    understanding, professional skills, and mutual awareness of each
    nation’s history, politics, and society.  With around 15,000 German
    and 14,000 American participants to date, the program strengthens
    ties and deepens the transatlantic partnership between the next
    generation of leaders.
-   **The German Bundestag-Bundesrat exchange (CBBSX)** program is an
    annual two-way exchange between German Bundestag and Bundesrat staff
    and U.S. Congressional staff members.  It was initiated during the
    1983 German-American Tricentennial celebration and first implemented
    in 1984.  Participants focus on the U.S. legislative process and
    U.S.-German relations; examining U.S. Congress and the U.S.
    political system.  In 2024 the IVLP brought 10 German Bundestag and
    Bundesrat staff members to the United States.  For the first time,
    CBBSX participants also engaged with state and local government.
