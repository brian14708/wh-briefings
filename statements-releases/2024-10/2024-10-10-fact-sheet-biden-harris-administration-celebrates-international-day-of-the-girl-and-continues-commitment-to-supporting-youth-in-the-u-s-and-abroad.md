title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Celebrates International Day\
  \ of the Girl and Continues Commitment to Supporting Youth in the U.S. and\_Abroad"
---
 
International Day of the Girl provides an opportunity to celebrate the
leadership of girls around the world and recommit to addressing the
barriers that continue to limit their full participation. Today, to
commemorate International Day of the Girl, First Lady Jill Biden will
host the second “Girls Leading Change” event at the White House to
recognize outstanding young women from across the United States who are
making a difference in their communities. This year’s event will
honor <u>[10 young women
leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/10/first-lady-jill-biden-announces-2024-girls-leading-change-honorees/)</u>,
selected by the White House Gender Policy Council, who are leading
change and shaping a brighter future for generations to come.  

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that girls can
pursue their dreams free from fear, discrimination, violence, or abuse;
and to advancing the safety, education, health, and wellbeing of girls
everywhere. Investing in young people means investing in our future; and
they should have the opportunity and resources they need to succeed.

That’s why, since day one in office, this Administration has taken
action to advance the safety, education, health, and well-being of
girls, including:

-   **Accelerating Learning and Improving Student Achievement.** The
    American Rescue Plan, the largest one-time education investment in
    our history, included $130 billion to help schools address the
    impact of the pandemic on student well-being and academic
    achievement. To sustain these efforts, the Biden-Harris
    Administration increased funding and targeting of federal grants to
    better support academic recovery—from the Education Innovation and
    Research program to extended-day and afterschool programming through
    21st Century Community Learning Centers. And the Administration’s
    [Improving Student Achievement Agenda for
    2024](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-improving-student-achievement-agenda-in-2024/)
    is helping accelerate academic performance for every child in
    school.

<!-- -->

-   **Canceling Student Debt.** President Biden and Vice President
    Harris vowed to fix the federal student loan program and make sure
    higher education is a ticket to the middle class—not a barrier to
    opportunity. The Biden-Harris Administration has approved nearly
    $170 billion in loan forgiveness for almost 5 million borrowers
    through more than two dozen executive actions with the goal of
    helping these borrowers get more breathing room in their daily
    lives, access economic mobility, buy homes, start businesses, and
    pursue their dreams.

<!-- -->

-   **Cutting Child Poverty Nearly in Half in 2021.** President Biden
    and Vice President Harris believe that no child should grow up in
    poverty. Their expansion of the Child Tax Credit helped cut child
    poverty nearly in half in 2021 to a record low of 5.2%. President
    Biden and Vice President Harris are fighting to restore this
    expansion, which would lift over a million girls out of poverty and
    narrow racial disparities. The Biden-Harris Administration has also
    lifted hundreds of thousands of girls out of poverty by updating the
    Thrifty Food Plan and creating SunBucks, a new program that helps
    low-income families afford groceries over the summer when they don’t
    have access to school meals.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Youth Mental Health.** President Biden and Vice
    President Harris believe that health care is a right, not a
    privilege, and that mental health care is health care—period. That’s
    why they invested almost $1.5 billion to strengthen the 988 Suicide
    & Crisis Lifeline and launched the National Mental Health Strategy,
    with ongoing investments to strengthen the mental health workforce,
    ensure parity for mental health and substance use care, connect
    Americans to care, and better protect youth from the harms of social
    media. The Biden-Harris Administration is also delivering the
    largest investments in school-based mental health services ever,
    bringing 14,000 new mental health professionals into schools across
    the country and making it easier for schools to leverage Medicaid to
    deliver care.  
     
-   **Preventing Gun Violence, Including Domestic Violence with
    Firearms**. Gun violence is the leading killer of children and
    teenagers in the United States. President Biden and Vice President
    Harris have taken historic executive action to reduce gun violence
    and violent crime. In 2022, President Biden signed into law the
    Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the most significant new
    gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The intersection between
    guns and domestic violence can be especially deadly, and BSCA
    expanded background checks to keep guns out of the hands of more
    domestic abusers, narrowed the “boyfriend loophole” so an individual
    convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence against a
    dating partner is prohibited from purchasing a firearm, and expanded
    funding for red flag laws that allow for temporary removal of
    firearms from an individual who is a danger to themselves or others.
    President Biden established the first-ever Office of Gun Violence
    Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris. The Biden-Harris
    Administration has made historic investments in law enforcement and
    community-led crime prevention and intervention strategies and has
    announced more executive actions to reduce gun violence than any
    other administration. Most recently, building on [life-saving
    actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Year-One-Report-Final.pdf)
    that the Administration has already taken, President Biden signed a
    [new Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/26/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-announce-additional-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence-and-save-lives/)
    in September 2024 to improve school-based active shooter drills and
    combat emerging firearms threats. The President and Vice President
    also announced new actions to support survivors of gun violence,
    promote safe gun storage, fund community violence intervention, and
    improve the gun background check system, among other actions.  
     
-   **Launching the American Climate Corps.** President Biden launched
    the [American Climate Corps](http://www.whitehouse.gov/climatecorps)
    to give a diverse new generation of young people the tools to fight
    the impacts of climate change today and the skills to join the clean
    energy and climate-resilience workforce of tomorrow. The American
    Climate Corps is tackling the climate crisis, including by restoring
    coastal ecosystems, strengthening urban and rural agriculture,
    investing in clean energy and energy efficiency, improving disaster
    and wildfire preparedness, and more. [More than 15,000 young
    Americans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/25/fact-sheet-during-climate-week-biden-harris-administration-announces-continued-progress-on-the-american-climate-corps/)
    have already been put to work in high-quality, good-paying clean
    energy and climate resilience workforce training and service
    opportunities through the American Climate Corps—putting the program
    on track to reach President Biden’s goal of 20,000 members in the
    program’s first year ahead of schedule.  
     
-   **Providing Children with Healthier, More Sustainable
    Environments.** The Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean School
    Bus Program has awarded nearly $3 billion and funded approximately
    8,700 electric and low-emission school buses nationwide, protecting
    children from air pollution by transforming school bus fleets across
    America. The Biden-Harris Administration also invested $15 billion
    toward replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country within a
    decade, protecting children and schools from lead exposure that can
    cause irreversible harm to cognitive development and hamper
    children’s learning. And earlier this year, the Environmental
    Protection Agency provided $58 million to protect children from lead
    in drinking water at schools and child care facilities.

<!-- -->

-   **Fighting Online Harassment and Abuse.** Online harassment and
    abuse is increasingly widespread in today’s digitally connected
    world and disproportionately affects women, girls, and LGBTQI+
    individuals. President Biden established the White House Task Force
    to Address Online Harassment and Abuse to coordinate comprehensive
    actions from more than a dozen federal agencies, and his Executive
    Order on artificial intelligence directs federal agencies to address
    deepfake image-based abuse. The Department of Justice also funded
    the first-ever national helpline to provide 24/7 support and
    specialized services for victims of online harassment and abuse,
    including the non-consensual distribution of intimate images; raised
    awareness of new legal protections against the non-consensual
    distribution of intimate images that were included in the Violence
    Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022; and funded a new
    National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals.

<!-- -->

-   **Keeping Students Safe and Addressing Campus Sexual Assault.** The
    Department of Education restored and strengthened vital Title IX
    protections against discrimination on the basis of sex for students
    and employees. The Department of Justice awarded more than $20
    million in FY 2024 to support colleges and universities in
    preventing and responding to sexual assault, domestic violence,
    dating violence, and stalking. And the Department of Education—in
    collaboration with the Departments of Justice and Health and Human
    Services—launched a Task Force on Sexual Violence in Education that
    has released data on sexual violence at educational institutions and
    is working to improve sexual violence prevention and response on
    campus.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Vulnerable Youth.** The Biden-Harris Administration has
    taken action to support the needs of vulnerable and underserved
    youth—from helping prevent youth homelessness and human trafficking
    to supporting employment initiatives for youth with disabilities.
    This includes $800 million in dedicated funding to support students
    experiencing homelessness through the President’s American Rescue
    Plan. The Department of Health and Human Services also issued
    [landmark
    rules](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2023/hhs-announces-historic-child-welfare-package-expand-support-and-equity-child)
    to improve the child welfare system, particularly for the most
    vulnerable children, and to advance the safety and wellbeing of
    families across the country, including for LGBTQI+ children in
    foster care. And the Department of Justice has funded programs to
    help communities develop, enhance, or expand early intervention
    programs and treatment services for girls who are involved in the
    juvenile justice system.

The Biden-Harris Administration has also taken action to support girls
around the globe by fighting to advance the human rights of women and
girls and promote access to education, health, and safety, including:

-   **Promoting Girls’ Education Globally.** The United States is
    investing in girls’ education around the world, which in turn
    advances health and economic development. The U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID) invested more than $2.5 billion
    from FY 2021-2023 to increase access to quality basic and higher
    education, and reached 18.7 million girls and women in 69 countries
    in FY23 alone to advance gender equality in and through education.
    The Departments of State and Labor have also supported efforts to
    promote girls’ education through science, technology, engineering,
    and mathematics (STEM) education programs in Kenya and Namibia, as
    well as technical and vocational education training centers for
    adolescent girls in Ethiopia. The United States has strongly
    condemned the restriction of girls’ education in Afghanistan,
    including by restricting visas for individuals believed to be
    responsible for, or complicit in, repressing women and girls by
    limiting or prohibiting access to education.

<!-- -->

-   **Closing the Gender Digital Divide.** Last year, Vice President
    Harris launched the Women in the Digital Economy Fund (Wi-DEF) to
    accelerate progress towards closing the gender digital divide. To
    date, Wi-DEF has raised over $80 million, including an initial $50
    million commitment from USAID. Building on the success of the Fund,
    the Women in the Digital Economy Initiative includes commitments
    from governments, private sector companies, foundations, civil
    society, and multilateral organizations that have pledged more than
    $1 billion to accelerate gender digital equality. This Initiative
    supports girls’ access to digital learning opportunities, provides
    employment and educational skills, and helps fulfill the historic
    commitment of G20 Leaders to halve the digital gender gap by 2030.
    Since the launch of Wi-DEF, the United States has invested $102
    million in direct and aligned commitments to closing the gender
    digital divide and accelerating gender digital equality.

<!-- -->

-   **Preventing and Responding to Online Harassment and Abuse
    Globally**. To address the scourge of online harassment and abuse
    against girls and women, the Biden-Harris Administration launched
    the 15-country Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online
    Harassment and Abuse, which has advanced international policies to
    address online safety and supported programs to prevent and respond
    to technology-facilitated gender-based violence. Since the Global
    Partnership was launched in 2022, the Department of State has
    supported projects in every region to prevent, document, and address
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence, cultivate safe online
    use, and respond to survivors’ needs. 

<!-- -->

-   **Championing Girls’ Leadership in Addressing the Climate Crisis**.
    In 2023, Vice President Harris announced the Women in the
    Sustainable Economy Initiative—[an over $2 billion public-private
    partnership](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-23-2024-usaid-joins-pepsico-unilever-danone-mccormick-company-nespresso-collaboration-advance-women-resilient-agricultural-supply-chains)
    to promote women’s access to jobs in the green and blue industries
    of the future—including by advancing girls’ access to STEM
    education. Through WISE, the Department of State is investing more
    than $12 million in programs to benefit girls, including programs
    that promote girls’ economic skills and opportunities in STEM and
    that foster girls’ roles in leading, shaping, and informing
    equitable and inclusive climate policies and actions.

<!-- -->

-   **Strengthening HIV Prevention Services for Girls.** To address key
    factors that make adolescent girls and young women particularly
    vulnerable to HIV, the United States launched the DREAMS
    (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe)
    public-private partnership as part of the President’s Emergency Plan
    for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2014. Announced in 2023, PEPFAR’s DREAMS
    NextGen program is the next phase of DREAMS that will take a more
    nuanced approach that is responsive to the current context within
    each of the 15 DREAMS countries. PEPFAR has invested more than $2
    billion in comprehensive HIV prevention programming for girls
    through DREAMS—including $1.3 billion since the start of the
    Administration—and the program reaches approximately 2.5 to 3
    million girls annually.

<!-- -->

-   **Increasing Efforts to End Child Marriage Globally.** To address
    the global scourge of child, early, and forced marriage, USAID and
    the Department of State invested $86 million in 27 countries to
    support programs that prevent and respond to this harmful practice,
    including by equipping girls and young women with education and
    workforce readiness skills; providing education, health, legal, and
    economic support; and raising awareness. Under the leadership of the
    Biden-Harris Administration, the United States also made its
    first-ever contribution to the UNICEF-UNFPA Global Programme to End
    Child Marriage, which works in 12 countries in Africa and South Asia
    to promote the rights of adolescent girls, and is contributing more
    than $2 million in FY 2024 to UNFPA to help reach refugee adolescent
    girls and prevent child marriages in humanitarian settings.

<!-- -->

-   **Leading Programs to End Female Genital Mutilation and Cutting.**
    To address the harmful practice of female genital mutilation and
    cutting (FGM/C), USAID invested in programs to address this issue in
    Djibouti, Egypt, Mauritania, and Nigeria. The United States is a
    long-standing donor to the UNICEF-UNFPA Joint Programme on the
    Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation, and invested $20 million
    from FY 2020-FY 2023 in this partnership, which has succeeded in
    advocating for legal and policy frameworks banning FGM/C in 14 of 17
    countries and supported more than 6.3 million women and girls with
    FGM/C-related protection and care services.

<!-- -->

-   **Promoting Young Women’s Civic and Political Participation.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has advanced the political and civic
    participation of women and girls as a pillar of democracy promotion
    efforts worldwide. The Administration launched Women LEAD, a $900
    million public-private partnership focused on building the pipeline
    of women leaders around the world, including by supporting programs
    to reach girls and young women. Under this umbrella, the USAID-led
    Advancing Women’s and Girls’ Civic and Political Leadership
    Initiative provides more than $25 million to identify and dismantle
    the individual, structural, and socio-cultural barriers to the
    political empowerment of women and girls in ten focus countries:
    Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Colombia, Ecuador,
    Honduras, Kyrgyz Republic, Yemen, and Fiji. Furthermore, the State
    Department is launching a new $1.25 million program in Africa that
    will empower and equip young women leaders to take on
    decision-making roles in democratic transition processes.

<!-- -->

-   **Protecting Girls in Humanitarian Emergencies.** The United States
    government has increased its support for girls in humanitarian and
    fragile contexts. Since 2021, USAID has more than doubled the
    percentage of its humanitarian budget allocated to the protection
    sector, which includes child protection and gender-based violence
    activities serving girls. In FY 2023, USAID provided $163 million
    specifically towards addressing gender-based violence in
    humanitarian emergencies. In 2022, USAID and the Department of State
    launched *Safe from the Start: ReVisioned*, which seeks to better
    address the needs of girls and women from the onset of a conflict or
    crisis.

<!-- -->

-   **Combatting Child Trafficking**. To combat child trafficking,
    including trafficking of girls, the Department of State has
    committed $37.5 million through Child Protection Compacts, building
    capacity in Jamaica, Peru, and Mongolia, and establishing new
    partnerships with Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, and Romania. These
    partnerships strengthen country responses to child trafficking to
    more effectively prosecute and convict traffickers, provide
    comprehensive trauma-informed care for child victims—including
    girls—and prevent child trafficking in all its forms.
