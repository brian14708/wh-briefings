The United States is proudly a leader and core strategic partner in the
world’s quest to eradicate polio and because of our efforts, the world
has a historic window of opportunity to end polio for good. Today, we
reaffirm our commitment to secure a polio-free future.

Through our leadership in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, our
sustained commitment to ending polio has resulted in 20 million people
walking today who otherwise could have been paralyzed. We have reduced
the number of children paralyzed by 99.9 percent and vaccinated over 3
billion children against polio. However, polio persists in some of the
world’s most challenging environments.

If high vaccination rates against polio are not achieved and maintained,
including amidst instability, conflict, and misinformation mounting
around the world, the risk of polio outbreaks will rise even in places
long considered polio-free, like we’ve recently seen in New York,
London, and Ukraine as well as in Gaza, where all parties must ensure
the safe and effective implementation of the polio vaccination campaign
that is urgently needed throughout Gaza.

In order to achieve the goal of eradicating polio, the world must rally
together. Delivering a polio-free world with stronger health systems and
communities is not only the right thing to do for humanity, but a smart
investment in the health of future generations and our collective global
health security. Together, we can make it a reality.
