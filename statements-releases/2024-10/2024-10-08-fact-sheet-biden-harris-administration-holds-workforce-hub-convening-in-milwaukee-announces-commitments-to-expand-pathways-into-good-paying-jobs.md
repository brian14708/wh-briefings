title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Holds Workforce Hub Convening\
  \ in Milwaukee, Announces Commitments to Expand Pathways into Good-Paying\_Jobs"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced new actions from his Investing in
America agenda to connect Milwaukee, Wisconsin residents to good-paying
jobs, including replacing lead pipes and upgrading infrastructure
through the Milwaukee Workforce Hub. The city’s Hub is one of nine
[Investing in America Workforce
Hubs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/11/fact-sheet-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-announces-record-federal-investments-in-registered-apprenticeships-holds-workforce-hub-convening-in-philadelphia-with-new-commitments-to-train-and-hir/)
launched by the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure all Americans
—including women, people of color, veterans, and other that have been
historically left behind–have access to job opportunities, and the
training needed to fill them. This announcement comes during President
Biden’s visit to Milwaukee, where he announced EPA’s final rule to
replace lead pipes within a decade and announced $2.6 billion in new
funding to deliver clean drinking water nationwide.  
   
Thanks to funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
infrastructure projects totaling nearly $100 million are in the works
across the City of Milwaukee. As part of these investments, the city has
begun replacing 100 percent of its lead service lines, reducing the
timeline for replacement from 60 years to 10 years in alignment with the
President’s goal. The Biden-Harris Administration will create thousands
of jobs for Milwaukee residents through these investments, and will
continue to collaborate with local organizations, ensuring the city is
training the skilled workers needed to accomplish these projects. The
City of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District are
leading the charge in creating workforce opportunities for the
community.  
   
Today, collaborators in the Milwaukee Workforce Hub are announcing
commitments that will expand pathways into these good-paying jobs to
meet the President’s goal.  
   
**Scaling Up and Expanding Apprenticeships**  
   
Registered apprenticeships are the gold-standard model for training a
new generation of workers in the skilled trades and provide pathways to
high-quality jobs for women and other historically underrepresented
groups. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has
invested more than $730 million to expand Registered Apprenticeships and
pre-apprenticeships nationwide, leading to the hiring of more than 1
million apprentices.  
   
In Milwaukee, local organizations are taking steps to use more
apprentices on public projects and prioritize graduates of local
pre-apprenticeship programs which serve underrepresented populations.
These steps build on the city’s existing program, which puts residents
on a path to a journey-level position in a skilled trade.     
   
In total, these actions will create opportunities for hundreds of new
apprentices and help to grow certified pre-apprenticeship programs
serving underrepresented populations, including high school students
from Milwaukee Public Schools. These opportunities include:  
  
The **City of Milwaukee’s Department of Public Works and Milwaukee Water
Works** will run a pilot from 2025 to 2027 and require that 10 percent
of all labor hours within each craft go to apprentices—half of whom must
come from certified pre-apprenticeship programs that serve residents of
Milwaukee who are currently underrepresented in apprenticeships. The new
requirement would apply to multiple major road construction bids
totaling $102 million, including a $36 million Reconnecting Communities
project to reconnect communities divided by a road that prioritizes
vehicle traffic over bikers and pedestrians, and a $24.3 million RAISE
project to make complete streets improvements along one and a half miles
of Villard Ave, including raised bike lanes, signal improvements, and
curb extensions. The pilot will apply to all contracts replacing at
least 300 lead service lines, creating 175 apprentice jobs and covering
an estimated $82 million of lead service line replacement funding from
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

-   **Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD)** will also change
    their procurement policies to require apprenticeships for all crafts
    working on all their projects, helping to bring new workers into
    specialized crafts like pipefitting and operating engineers. For
    2025, this policy would apply to construction bids totaling
    approximately $90 million for the reclamation facilities, the
    conveyance system, and flood management projects. This policy is
    estimated to create at least 80 apprentice jobs, 40 percent of whom
    will be required to come from certified pre-apprentice programs
    serving traditionally-underrepresented residents of Milwaukee.    
-   The **Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT)** continues
    its efforts to develop a local workforce to build state highways.
    Currently, WisDOT has implemented a Federal Highway Administration
    pilot on a $65 million freeway project which sets incentives for
    local residency workforce and apprentice requirements as part of
    federally funded highway projects. The department will consider the
    use of the special provisions in future projects to grow this effort
    in the Milwaukee area.

<!-- -->

-   **Milwaukee area unions and postsecondary providers** have committed
    to increase their apprenticeship classes as demand for apprentices
    on public contracts increases—projecting to increase classes by at
    least 200 apprentices. Specific union level increases include 50 new
    apprentices from the Laborers’ International Union of North America,
    70 from the International Association of Bridge, Structural,
    Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers, 75 from the United
    Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, and 20 from
    International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.  
-   The City of Milwaukee’s **Environmental Collaboration Office** will
    also implement a Community Benefits Agreement as it builds a new
    public Electric Vehicle (EV) charging network in the city through a
    nearly $15 million federal grant from US Department of
    Transportation. This Community Benefits Agreement will require
    electrician apprentices on each EV charging installation and include
    local hire requirements consistent with the City of Milwaukee’s
    Resident Preference Program.  At least 40 percent of the chargers
    will be put in historically disadvantaged communities.

**Expanding Pipelines into Apprenticeship**  
  
These expanded registered apprenticeship slots will create new
opportunities for hundreds of workers in the Milwaukee area. The
Milwaukee Workforce Hub will work to ensure every resident has access to
these opportunities, by investing in pre-apprenticeship programs that
offer disadvantaged communities a chance to develop the skills and work
experience needed to succeed in these apprenticeships. As a result of
the Milwaukee Workforce Hub, dedicated funding for pre-apprenticeships
in the area will grow by at least $650,000.  
  
The **Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership/Building Industry Group &
Skilled Trades Employment Program (WRTP | BIG STEP)** currently serves
1,000 individuals every year and has been a leader in the Milwaukee
construction sector for decades. In the coming months and years, WRTP |
BIG STEP will lead the workforce hub’s construction sector coordination
and job training, convening industry partners to develop workforce
programs that provide Milwaukee residents access to good-paying and
union job in the skilled trades. New investments include:

-   **MMSD** will invest $350,000 in WRTP | BIG STEP for certified
    pre-apprenticeship programs, including transportation assistance,
    stipends while participants are in training, and on-going placement
    and retention for first-year apprentices.  
-   **Employ Milwaukee and philanthropic organizations** will invest up
    to $400,000 in additional funding for WRTP | BIG STEP, including
    capacity building to increase participation in
    apprenticeship-readiness initiatives. Employ Milwaukee, the
    workforce board for Milwaukee, will use formula funds from the U.S.
    Department of Labor to support innovative customized training
    cohorts in to meet the needs of the local construction industry with
    a goal of training 60-80 workers.  
-   **Unions in the Milwaukee region** will expand their investment in
    WRTP | BIG STEP. Unions have been investing about $625,000 per year
    in this pre-apprenticeship program, which trained over 1,000 people
    in 2023. Over the next two years, regional trades are striving to
    increase their investments in WRTP | BIG STEP to at least 3 cents
    per hour of member work on regional mega projects, including a $3.3
    billion data center being built by Microsoft in Southeast Wisconsin.
    Unions will also partner with Milwaukee Public Schools to prepare
    students for pre-apprenticeship programs.

**Providing Supportive Services**  
  
The Milwaukee Workforce Hub will also support residents as they begin
working in these growing fields, by helping residents with supportive
services, including career navigation services and stipends. These
investments will help ensure that workers have the resources and skills
they need for continued success in the industry.

-   The **Wisconsin Department of Transportation** will invest $507,000
    in workforce development through the Highway Construction Skills
    Training (HCST) program. WRTP | BIG STEP receives $143,800 in
    funding from WisDOT to run HCST. This year, WisDOT used grant
    funding from US DOT to lead a pilot to expand stipends and
    supportive services for job training participants in HCST. Lessons
    learned from the pilot, will be used to look at where stipends and
    higher supportive services help increase graduates in the
    program.   
-   **MMSD** is partnering with **Employ Milwaukee** and **Milwaukee
    Community Services Corps** to provide career navigation services and
    paid work experience for 64 participants in water sector careers
    with $1 million from the U.S. Department of Labor. The funding also
    supports the development of water industry career pathways and
    competency maps in partnership with the Council for Adult &
    Experiential Learning.

**Additional Federal Support for Workforce Development**  
  
In addition to commitments from partners, the Biden-Harris
Administration is making millions in direct investments in Milwaukee to
support job training and upskilling to meet the need for these historic
investments.

-   **EPA’s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative** will incorporate key
    workforce development and labor best practices into the estimated
    $320 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other funding to
    clean up the Milwaukee Estuary Area of Concern. EPA will, for the
    first time, incorporate Project Labor Agreements into contract task
    orders with an estimated $275 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law funding. This initiative will support local and regional jobs
    cleaning up contaminated sediments in the Milwaukee Estuary Area of
    Concern. In addition, EPA is collaborating with local organizations
    to support local workforce development as part of the estimated $45
    million in activities to restore important habitats across
    Milwaukee.  
-   **The City of Milwaukee Water Works** is partnering with **Employ
    Milwaukee** to upskill at least 60 city of Milwaukee workers in
    occupations to support the replacement of lead service lines. Employ
    Milwaukee is using $500,000 from the U.S. Department of Labor
    Community Project Funding to fund this partnership.  
-   **Employ Milwaukee** also received a $5 million Building Pathways to
    Infrastructure Grant from the U.S. Department of Labor that will
    prepare more than 480 unemployed and underemployed individuals for
    high-demand infrastructure jobs, including advanced manufacturing,
    information technology, and professional, scientific, and technical
    service occupations that support the growing sectors of renewable
    energy, transportation, and broadband infrastructure. Over $900,000
    from this grant is going to the Milwaukee Area Technical College to
    assist underrepresented populations in accessing academic and
    non-academic support to enter civil engineering and drafting
    occupations that will support transportation and water investments
    from the Biden-Harris Administration. Other partners in the grant
    include Waukesha Area Technical College, Wisconsin Department of
    Workforce Development Bureau of Apprenticeship Standards, WOW
    Workforce Board, MKE Tech Hub, City of Milwaukee, and a variety of
    employers.  
-   **The City of Milwaukee** is investing more than $25 million in
    American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding to remediate lead paint. To help
    meet that demand, the City provided $3 million for Employ
    Milwaukee’s Healthy Homes Construction Careers Program, which is
    designed to connect trained workers with lead abatement
    certifications to contractors who are paid by the City of Milwaukee
    Health Department to remediate high lead risk homes. The training is
    free to the student, including the cost of training, certification,
    exam fees, stipends, incentives, and wages during work experience.
    To date, 344 workers had been enrolled in training so far.  
-   **The Wisconsin Biohealth Tech Hub** received nearly $50 million
    through President Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act to establish the
    region as a leader in personalized medicine. Biden-Harris
    Administration funding for the Wisconsin Tech Hub will create
    inclusive talent pipelines that can help develop and deploy cutting
    edge medical technologies; addressing workforce challenges that
    often face new industries.
