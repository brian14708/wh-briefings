Tonight, Doug and I are praying for all those who were killed or injured
in the collapse of the ferry dock walkway on Georgiaâ€™s Sapelo Island, as
well as their family members and loved ones. Our Administration is in
close touch with state and local officials, and we have offered any
federal support the community might need. As always, we are deeply
grateful for the heroism of our first responders. Even in the face of
this heartbreak, we will continue to celebrate and honor the history,
culture, and resilience of the Gullah-Geechee community.
