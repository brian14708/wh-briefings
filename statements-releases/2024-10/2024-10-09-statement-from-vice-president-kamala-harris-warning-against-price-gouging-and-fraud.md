title: "Statement From Vice President Kamala\_Harris Warning Against Price Gouging\
  \ and\_Fraud"
---
 
Let us all be clear: Americans impacted by a crisis should never be
ripped off.  
  
I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of price gouging during an
emergency. As Attorney General of California during devastating
wildfires that displaced thousands of residents, I took on those
attempting to take advantage of the situation by raising hotel prices.
As Senator, I worked to stop price gouging during the pandemic.  
  
Those evacuating before Hurricane Milton or recovering from Hurricane
Helene should not be subject to illegal price gouging or fraud – at the
pump, airport, or hotel counter. Any company or individual that tries to
exploit Americans in an emergency should know that the Administration is
monitoring for allegations of fraud and price gouging and will hold
those taking advantage of the situation accountable.
