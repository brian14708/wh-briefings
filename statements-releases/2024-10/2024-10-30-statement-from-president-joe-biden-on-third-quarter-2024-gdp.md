title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Third Quarter 2024\_GDP"
---
 
Today’s GDP report shows how far we’ve come since I took office—from the
worst economic crisis since the Great Depression to the strongest
economy in the world. Since I took office, the economy has grown 12.6%,
we’ve had the lowest average unemployment in 50 years, nearly 16 million
jobs have been created, and incomes have risen $4,000 more than
inflation. While critics thought we’d need a recession to lower
inflation, instead we’ve grown around 3% a year on average, while
inflation has fallen to the level right before the pandemic.

We need to keep building on this progress. Instead, Congressional
Republicans are proposing across-the-board tariffs that would cost
families nearly $4,000 a year, reignite inflation, and kill hundreds of
thousands of jobs. The Vice President and I are fighting to lower costs
on everyday goods—from housing and groceries to health care and child
care—while Republicans fight for more tax breaks for the wealthy and
large corporations. The best way to grow the economy is from the middle
out and the bottom up, not the top down.
