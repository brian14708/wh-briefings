President Biden spoke this morning with Prime Minister Netanyahu of
Israel.  Vice President Harris joined the call.  The President affirmed
his ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.  He condemned
unequivocally Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October
1st.  On Lebanon, the President emphasized the need for a diplomatic
arrangement to safely return both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to
their homes on both sides of the Blue Line.  The President affirmed
Israel’s right to protect its citizens from Hezbollah, which has fired
thousands of missiles and rockets into Israel over the past year alone,
while emphasizing the need to minimize harm to civilians, in particular
in the densely populated areas of Beirut.  On Gaza, the leaders
discussed the urgent need to renew diplomacy to release the hostages
held by Hamas.  The President also discussed the humanitarian situation
in Gaza and the imperative to restore access to the north, including by
reinvigorating the corridor from Jordan immediately.  They agreed to
remain in close contact over the coming days both directly and through
their national security teams.
