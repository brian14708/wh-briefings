title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Student Debt Cancellation for Over\
  \ 1 Million Public Service Workers Under the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration"
---
 
Today, my Administration is approving another $4.5 billion in student
debt cancellation for over 60,000 public service workers – bringing the
total number of Americans who have had their debt cancelled under Public
Service Loan Forgiveness during my Administration to over 1 million
people.

Public service workers – teachers, nurses, firefighters, and more – are
the bedrocks of our communities and our country. They dedicate their
careers to giving back to others, and were given the promise of student
debt forgiveness after 10 years of public service and 10 years of
payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But for too
long, the government failed to live up to its commitments, and only
7,000 people had ever received forgiveness under Public Service Loan
Forgiveness before Vice President Harris and I took office.

We vowed to fix that, and because of actions from our Administration,
now over 1 million public service workers have gotten the relief they
are entitled to under the law.

Today’s announcement comes on top of the significant progress we’ve made
for students and borrowers over the past three years. That includes
approving debt cancellation for nearly 5 million Americans across all
our various debt relief actions; providing the largest increases to the
maximum Pell Grant award in over a decade; fixing Income-Driven
Repayment so borrowers get the relief they earned; and holding colleges
accountable for taking advantage of students and families.

From day one of my Administration, I promised to fight to ensure higher
education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.
I will never stop working to make higher education affordable – no
matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stop us.
