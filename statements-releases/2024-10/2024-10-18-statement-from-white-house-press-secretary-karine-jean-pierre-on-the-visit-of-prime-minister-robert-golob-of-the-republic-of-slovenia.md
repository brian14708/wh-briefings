On October 22, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will host Prime Minister
Robert Golob of the Republic of Slovenia for a bilateral meeting at the
White House. This will be their first meeting at the White House and
follows conversations that helped pave the way for the largest prisoner
swap since the Cold War. The leaders will have an in-depth discussion on
a range of issues of mutual interest, including energy security and
cooperation, a shared approach to the Western Balkans, continued robust
support to Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression, and events
in the Middle East. President Biden will underscore our appreciation for
Prime Minister Golob’s leadership to bring home Americans unjustly
detained by Russia and our continued cooperation on a host of other
global issues.
