title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Call with President Herzog of\_Israel"
---
 
This morning President Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac
Herzog on the solemn occasion of the one-year anniversary of
the horrific Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks. 

President Biden expressed his deepest condolences to the people of
Israel and to the families of the 1,200 innocent people – including 46
Americans – massacred by the terrorist group Hamas on a day of
unspeakable brutality. He stressed that the United States will never
give up until we bring all of the remaining hostages home safely.

President Biden conveyed his commitment to the safety of the Jewish
people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist, and reaffirmed
his support for Israel’s right to defend itself against attacks from
Iran and all Iranian-backed terrorist groups, including Hezbollah,
Hamas, and the Houthis.

The President also expressed deep sadness for the loss of innocent life
in Gaza and the ongoing suffering of Palestinian civilians as a result
of the war that Hamas unleashed. The two leaders reaffirmed
their commitment to achieving a deal in Gaza that brings the hostages
home, secures Israel, alleviates the suffering of Palestinian civilians,
and paves the way for a lasting peace with Hamas never again able to
control Gaza or reconstitute its military capabilities.
