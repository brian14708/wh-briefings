title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Reduce\
  \ Medical Debt and Address Illegal Medical Debt Collection\_Practices"

*Vice President Harris announces actions to protect consumers and reduce
hurdles that prevent individuals from receiving relief from medical
bills*  
   
*White House hosts roundtable with Americans impacted by medical debt,
including those who received medical debt relief through Biden-Harris
Administration actions*

Today, Vice President Harris announced a series of actions by the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Department of Defense
(DOD), and Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) to increase
pathways for medical debt relief, to address illegal actions by
third-party debt collectors, and to improve our understanding of the
impacts of medical debt.  
   
Getting sick or taking care of loved ones should not create financial
hardship for families. Yet, more than 100 million Americans struggle
with medical debt. Over 40 million Americans —1 in 5 adults — [owe
around $88
billion](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-of-director-rohit-chopra-on-new-cfpb-medical-debt-report/#:~:text=Medical%20bills%20are%20the%20most%20common%20debt%20in%20collections%20reported)
in medical debt in collections, making it the largest source of debt in
collections—more than credit cards, utilities, and auto loans.  
   
That is unacceptable to President Biden and Vice President Harris. [Vice
President Harris has repeatedly
highlighted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/06/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-during-the-nationwide-economic-opportunity-tour/#:~:text=So,%20President%20Biden%20and%20I%20have%20made%20debt)
the negative impacts of medical debt, noting that medical debt can stand
in the way of someone’s dream to own a car, home, or small businesses.
In June, Vice President Harris
[announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/11/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-proposal-to-prohibit-medical-bills-from-being-included-on-credit-reports-and-calls-on-states-and-localities-to-take-further-actions-to-reduce-medical-debt/)
the CFPB’s proposed rule to remove medical debt from the consumer credit
reports of more than 15 million Americans and called on states to take
action to tackle medical debt. Following the Vice President’s call to
action, HHS approved North Carolina’s [innovative
program](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2024/08/12/north-carolina-hospitals-sign-relieve-medical-debt)
to encourage hospitals to relieve medical debt and relieve approximately
$4 billion in medical debt for nearly 2 million working families in
North Carolina. Further, American Rescue Plan funds are being leveraged
to eliminate an estimated $7 billion in medical debt for up to nearly 3
million Americans by the end of 2026.  
   
“No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or
experienced a medical emergency. That is why I have worked to cancel
hundreds of millions in medical debt to date – part of our
Administration’s overall plan to forgive $7 billion by 2026 – and make
it so medical debt will soon no longer be included in your credit
score,” **said Vice President Harris.** “As someone who has spent my
entire career fighting to protect consumers, I am proud to announce
today’s new actions to build on our work to reduce the burden of medical
debt by increasing pathways for relief and cracking down on predatory
debt collection tactics.”  
   
To continue addressing the burden of medical debt, today the Vice
President is announcing the following actions:  
   
**Holding Third-Party Debt Collectors Accountable**  
   
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released an Advisory
Opinion on improper medical debt collections. The Advisory Opinion
clarifies the responsibilities of debt collectors to confirm that debts
are accurate, valid, and substantiated before engaging in collection
actions. Further, the CFPB has stated that they will ensure fairness and
increase transparency by cracking down on debt collectors that collect
on debt that is not owed by patients.  
   
CFPB also released a Consumer Advisory that explains to consumers what
actions they can take when they suspect that they have been improperly
billed or if they have had improper or illegal collection actions taken
against them. The Consumer Advisory suggests actions such as:
following-up with their provider if a bill looks incorrect, asking their
provider for an itemized bill, negotiating bills if the price appears
wrong, reporting to the CFPB if they have been improperly billed, and
pursuing legal action if appropriate.  
   
**Increasing Pathways to Reduced Medical Bills**  
   
The Department of Defense has proposed a rule aimed at providing
financial relief for civilians receiving medical care at military
medical treatment facilities (MTFs).  If finalized as proposed, this
rule would implement fee reductions through a sliding scale discount
program as well as catastrophic cap waivers.  Through these measures,
the DoD aims to significantly reduce the financial burden on patients
while maintaining high-quality care and expanding the range of complex
trauma cases that Department healthcare providers may encounter in both
deployed and humanitarian settings.  
   
**Providing Transparency on Tax-Exempt Hospital Debt Collection
Practices**  
   
CFPB released a blog post highlighting billing issues that occur when
non-profit hospitals fail to provide financial assistance. Under the
law, tax-exempt hospitals are required to offer financial assistance to
help offset health care costs for low-income patients. However, the CFPB
has [previously found
evidence](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-highlights-consumer-protection-issues-in-medical-and-rental-debt-collection/#:~:text=Additionally,%20non-profit%20hospitals%20fail%20to%20properly%20address%20medical)
that tax-exempt hospitals often bill and initiate collections against
patients who have received or are eligible for financial assistance.
Today’s blog post shines a light on bills wrongfully ending up in
collections.  
   
**Better Understanding the Impact of Medical Debt on Seniors**  
   
HHS is collecting evidence and data to inform future actions to address
the burden of medical debt. For the first time, the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services added new questions on medical debt to their
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The MCBS is an annual survey
of people covered by Medicare to better understand their health care
needs. These new questions will provide essential background on levels
of medical debt carried by seniors and those with disabilities and the
impacts of these debts on their day-to-day lives. The Agency for Health
Care Research and Quality is also adding additional questions to the
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, one of the largest sources of data on
health care in the United States, to capture more granular information
on medical debt. Questions will capture information on the amount of
medical debt, ability to pay unexpected medical bills, financial
sacrifices that individuals may have had to make due to their health or
treatment, and other aspects of medical debt and financial well-being.
CFPB also [recently
spotlighted](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/debt-collectors-that-take-advantage-of-surviving-spouses-and-their-vulnerabilities/)
the legal challenges facing surviving spouses who are pursued for their
spouse’s medical debt, providing insights into the ways debt collectors
take advantage of this vulnerable population.
