title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Hurricane Helene\_Response"
---
 
Since before Hurricane Helene made landfall, my Administration has
mobilized an intensive Federal response to ensure impacted communities
have the resources and support they need. As part of that ongoing
commitment, and in response to Governor Cooper’s request for additional
support, today I ordered another 500 active-duty troops with advanced
technological assets to move into Western North Carolina and assist with
the response and recovery efforts. With a total of 1,500 troops now
supplementing a robust on-the-ground effort – including more than 6,100
National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 Federal personnel – my
Administration is sparing no resource to support families as they begin
their road to rebuilding.  
   
Additionally, I have been briefed on Tropical Storm Milton as it
strengthens across the Gulf of Mexico and the work my Administration is
doing to preposition life-saving resources in advance of the storm. I
urge all residents in Florida to listen to local officials and make
preparations as needed.  
   
As these communities brace for potentially yet another catastrophic
storm, and as part of my Administration’s solemn obligation to stand
with impacted communities as they rebuild their lives, we will continue
working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders – regardless of
political party and no matter how long it takes.
