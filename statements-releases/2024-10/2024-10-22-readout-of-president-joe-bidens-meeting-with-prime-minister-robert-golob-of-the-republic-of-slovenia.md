President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Robert
Golob of the Republic of Slovenia at the White House.  The leaders had
an in-depth discussion on a range of foreign policy issues of mutual
interest.  President Biden expressed his gratitude for Slovenia’s role
in the historic deal that secured the release of three Americans
unjustly detained by Russia, as well as an American green card holder
who won a Pulitzer Prize while in Russian detention, and 12 other human
rights defenders and political dissidents.  They discussed
U.S.-Slovenian cooperation on clean energy and advanced technologies,
and a joint approach to Western Balkans – an area of strategic interest
for both  the United States and the Republic of Slovenia.  They
reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine as it continues to
defend against Russia’s aggression.  They discussed the latest
developments in the Middle East, the need to reach a diplomatic
resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that allows
civilians on both sides of the Blue Line to safely return to their
homes, to ensure civilians – including humanitarians and journalists –
are protected, and to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and to
achieve a ceasefire deal that secures the release of the hostages. 
President Biden underscored the need for increased defense investments
to ensure NATO is properly resourced to face tomorrow’s challenges.
