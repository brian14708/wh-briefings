Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)     (Dear Minority Leader
Jeffries:)   (Dear Majority Leader Schumer:)  
(Dear Minority Leader McConnell:)  
   
I write to apprise you of developments in Israel and the United States
Government’s response to them.  
   
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched over 200 ballistic missiles at Israel.
 Consistent with our longstanding commitment to Israel’s security and
our public indication of our continuing efforts to protect Israel from
Iranian and Iranian-aligned threats, I am reporting to you the posture
of United States military forces to aid in Israel’s defense against
these attacks and any further such attacks.  The outstanding performance
of our service members across the Middle East, working in strong support
of Israeli forces, contributed to a historic defense of Israel against
Iranian threats, much like our shared success on April 13, 2024.  Our
shared success on October 1 included downing dozens of incoming Iranian
weapons before they could harm civilians in Israel.  
   
In recent months, we have adjusted the United States military posture to
improve United States force protection and increase support for the
defense of Israel.  These adjustments include extension of the USS
Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, along with its destroyer escorts
and carrier air wing that is equipped with F-35C Lightning II Fifth
Generation Fighters, to replace the previously extended USS Theodore
Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group.  We also have deployed additional
destroyers, including some that are ballistic missile defense-capable;
the guided missile submarine USS Georgia, the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready
Group/Marine Expeditionary Unit, multiple fighter and attack squadrons
of Fourth and Fifth Generation Fighters including F-22, F-15E, and F-16,
as well as A-10 Attack aircraft; and other forces.  
   
United States forces will remain postured in the region to serve
important national interests, including the protection of United States
persons and property from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias,
and to continue to support the defense of Israel, to which our
commitment remains ironclad.  In this context, I directed the deployment
to Israel of a ballistic missile defense system and United States
service members capable of operating it to defend against any further
ballistic missile attacks while this defensive posture is deemed
warranted.  
   
I directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect
United States persons and interests abroad and in furtherance of United
States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my
constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive and
to conduct United States foreign relations.  
   
                               Sincerely,  
   
   
   
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
