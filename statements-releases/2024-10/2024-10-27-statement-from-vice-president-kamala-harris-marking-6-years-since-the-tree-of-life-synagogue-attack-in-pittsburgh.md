title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris Marking 6 Years Since the Tree\
  \ of Life Synagogue Attack in\_Pittsburgh"
---
 
Today marks six years since a white supremacist used a weapon of war
to murder 11 precious souls and wound many more at the Tree of Life
Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood. This unspeakable
act — fueled by antisemitic hate — was the deadliest attack on the
American Jewish community in our Nation’s history. As we remember the
victims of this horrific mass shooting, we also honor the courage of the
first responders, some of whom were injured during this attack, and
commemorate the resilience of the Pittsburgh community. This summer,
ground was broken on the nation’s first museum and education center on
the history of antisemitism in America at the site of the synagogue, a
symbol of this enduring strength.  
  
As we know, today’s remembrance also comes amid a rise of antisemitism,
here and around the world. Earlier this month, we marked one year since
the October 7<sup>th</sup> Hamas terrorist attack against Israel in
which 1,200 innocent people were massacred, 250 people taken
hostage, and where Hamas committed unspeakable sexual violence.   
  
I will always work to ensure the safety and security of Jewish people in
the United States and around the world, and will always call
out antisemitism whenever and wherever we see it. Doug and I are proud
to have worked alongside President Biden to combat antisemitism,
including through the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. This
work is not new for me: I have spent my entire career fighting
antisemitism, including prosecuting hate crimes as a District Attorney
and publishing an annual report on hate crimes as Attorney General of
California to ensure that policymakers and law enforcement respond with
a sense of urgency to this crisis. And since the beginning of our
administration, we have secured record funding for the physical security
of nonprofits and faith-based institutions around the country, including
synagogues, Jewish Community Centers, and Jewish day schools.  
  
 Additionally, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights
continues to investigate cases of antisemitism and other forms of hate
on campus making clear that each university must ensure all students and
faculty are safe and secure on campus.  We also continue our work to
ensure that every person in our Nation can live free from gun violence —
in their places of worship, schools, and communities. To take on the
epidemic of gun violence, our administration enacted the most
significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years and created the first-ever
White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which I am proud to
lead.  
  
Today, Doug and I stand in solidarity with the survivors of this attack,
the families who lost loved ones, and the entire Jewish community.
