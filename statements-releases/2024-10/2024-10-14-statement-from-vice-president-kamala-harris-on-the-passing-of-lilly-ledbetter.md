title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Lilly\_Ledbetter"
---
 
Lilly Ledbetter was a tireless leader in the fight for equal rights.   
  
After finding out that she had been systematically underpaid for nearly
two decades compared to her male colleagues, Lilly became an advocate
for equal pay. Her efforts contributed to the passage of the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which strengthened protections against pay
discrimination, and which was the first bill signed into law during the
Obama-Biden Administration.  
  
I have always believed when we lift up the economic status of women, we
lift up the economic status of families and communities – and all of
society benefits. That’s why I co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act in
the United States Senate, a bill that Lilly was a powerful supporter of,
and which would further increase pay transparency. And that’s why I
continue to fight for the Paycheck Fairness Act – to honor Lilly’s
legacy, and continue building a more fair and equitable future for
women, and all Americans.  
  
Lilly’s advocacy has improved the lives of millions, and will inspire
generations to come. Doug and I send our condolences and prayers to the
Ledbetter family.
