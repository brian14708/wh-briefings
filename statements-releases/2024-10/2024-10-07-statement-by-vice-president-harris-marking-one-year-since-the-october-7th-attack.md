title: "Statement by Vice President Harris Marking One Year Since the October 7th\_\
  Attack"
---
 
I will never forget the horror of October 7, 2023.  1,200 innocent
people, including 46 Americans, were massacred by Hamas terrorists.
Women raped on the side of the road. 250 people kidnapped. It was the
deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. What Hamas did
that day was pure evil – it was brutal and sickening. And it has
rekindled a deep fear among the Jewish people not just in Israel, but in
the United States and around the world.  
   
The long, extraordinary arc of Jewish history is full of pogroms and
prejudice, slaughter and separation. And now, in our own generation,
there is another moment that the world must never forget.  
   
I am devastated by the loss and pain of the Israeli people as a result
of the heinous October 7 attack. Doug and I pray for the families of the
victims and hope they find solace in remembering the lives their loved
ones lived.  
   
We also pray for the safety of Jewish people all around the world. We
all must ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 ever happen again.
I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses
is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails
in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are
free from the grip of Hamas. I will never stop fighting for the release
of all the hostages, including the seven American citizens, living and
deceased, still held: Omer, Edan, Sagui, Keith, Judy, Gad, and Itay. I
will never stop fighting for justice for those who murdered Hersh
Goldberg-Polin and other Americans. And I will always ensure Israel has
what it needs to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists
like Hamas. My commitment to the security of Israel is unwavering.  
   
Hamas’s terrorist attack on October 7 launched a war in Gaza. I am
heartbroken over the scale of death and destruction in Gaza over the
past year—tens of thousands of lives lost, children fleeing for safety
over and over again, mothers and fathers struggling to obtain food,
water, and medicine. It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire
deal to end the suffering of innocent people. And I will always fight
for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity,
freedom, security, and self-determination. We also continue to believe
that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is
the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides
to return safely to their homes.  
   
Today, as we mourn the lives lost on October 7, I know many Jews will be
reciting and reflecting on the Jewish prayer for mourning – the Kaddish.
The words of the Kaddish, however, are not about death. The prayer is
about still believing in God and still having faith. I know that is
difficult amidst so much trauma and pain. But it is with that spirit
that I commemorate this solemn day. We will not forget, and we will not
lose faith. And in honor of all those souls we lost on October 7, we
must never lose sight of the dream of peace, dignity, and security for
all.
