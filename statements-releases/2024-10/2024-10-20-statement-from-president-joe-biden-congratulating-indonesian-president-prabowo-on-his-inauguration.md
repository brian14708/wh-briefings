  \ on his\_Inauguration"
---
 
I congratulate President Prabowo Subianto on his inauguration as
President of the Republic of Indonesia, and the Indonesian people for
exercising their right to vote and making their voices heard.

This year, Indonesia and the United States are celebrating 75 years of
diplomatic relations. Vice President Harris and I look forward to
working with President Prabowo to honor this milestone by continuing to
strengthen our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and show that
democracies can deliver on the challenges that matter most to our
peoplesâ€™ lives.
