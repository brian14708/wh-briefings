title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on Americans Saving Nearly $1 Billion\
  \ on Prescription Drugs Thanks to the Inflation Reduction\_Act"
---
 
All Americans should be able to access the health care they need – no
matter their income. That is why our Administration fought to lower
health care costs with the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation that I
was proud to cast the tie-breaking vote on in the Senate. During the
first half of this year alone, we now know that nearly 1.5 million
people with Medicare have already saved nearly $1 billion because of our
law’s cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.   
   
Additionally, we have been able to cut prescription drug costs, cap the
cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors, and lower premiums for those
on Medicare. Our Administration has also reached unprecedented
agreements with pharmaceutical companies to lower prices for the first
10 drugs selected for the Medicare price negotiation program – ten of
the most widely used and expensive drugs that treat conditions ranging
from cancer to diabetes. And there is still much more to come.  
   
I have seen the impact of fighting to protect patients up close. As
Attorney General, I held Big Pharma accountable for their deceptive and
illegal practices – winning settlements that amounted to more than $7
billion against pharmaceutical companies for their unsafe and unfair
tactics. I will never stop fighting for the health, wellbeing, and
financial stability of the American people.
