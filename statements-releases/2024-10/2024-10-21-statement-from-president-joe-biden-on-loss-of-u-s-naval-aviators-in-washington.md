title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Loss of U.S. Naval Aviators in\_Washington"
---
 
Jill and I mourn the tragic loss of two naval aviators, Lieutenant
Commander Lyndsay Evans and Lieutenant Serena Wileman, who were killed
when their EA-18G Growler aircraft crashed last Tuesday near Mount
Rainier, Washington during a routine training mission.  They were among
our nation’s finest and had just recently returned to the United States
after an extended deployment to the Middle East defending against Houthi
missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea.  We thank the U.S. Navy, U.S.
Army, and Yakima County Tribal and local authorities for their efforts
to locate and recover these two brave and talented young aviators.  We
pray for their families, loved ones and squadron-mates, and we will
always honor their service and sacrifice.
