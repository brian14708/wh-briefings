title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Support\
  \ North Carolina\u2019s Hurricane\_Recovery"
---
 
*FEMA to hire Community Liaisons across the state to aid in recovery*

*More than $300 million approved for North Carolina survivors and state
recovery efforts*

Following Hurricane Helene’s devastating impacts across the Southeast
and Appalachia, the Biden-Harris Administration continues its robust
Federal efforts to help communities recover and rebuild, including in
heavily impacted communities in North Carolina. Across the state, the
Administration is working alongside state and local officials to
continue surging resources and assisting families, business owners,
farmers, and other impacted communities receive the support and
assistance they need and deserve.

To continue supporting recovery efforts, today the Administration is
**announcing that the Federal government will create a brand-new program
and hire Community Liaisons to assist impacted communities with their
recovery and rebuilding efforts**. These dedicated Community Liaisons
will interface between the people of North Carolina and FEMA to ensure
their needs are met and serve as trusted messengers for survivors.

Thus far, the Administration has **approved more than $300 million in
assistance across the state, including** **$118 million in individual
assistance to more than 87,600 households, and more than $189 million
for debris removal and other emergency efforts.** In total, across all
impacted states in the Southeast and Appalachia, the Administration has
approved nearly $2 billion in hurricane recovery assistance.

These new efforts to support North Carolina’s recovery supplement
additional resources and funding, including:

-   More than 1,500 Federal personnel remain deployed supporting the
    response and recovery operations. This includes more than 400
    Disaster Survivor Assistance Team members, who are visiting
    neighborhoods to connect with survivors, assess damage, and offer
    access to Federal resources that support recovery and rebuilding.
-   Fourteen Disaster Recovery Centers are operating in impacted areas
    and have served more than 5,700 visitors. More centers will be
    opening in the coming days. Survivors can visit Disaster Recovery
    Centers in the following cities/towns: Asheville, Bakersville,
    Boone, Brevard, Hendersonville, Jefferson, Lenoir, Marion,
    Morgantown, Newland, Old Fort, Sparta, Sylva, and Waynesville.
-   FEMA is providing temporary hotel stays to more than 2,500
    households through Transitional Sheltering Assistance.
-   FEMA inspectors have performed more than 21,000 home inspections to
    help survivors assess damage and apply for financial assistance.
-   Active-duty troops and National Guard members remain on the ground
    in their state capacity to **support search-and-rescue operations,
    route clearance, and commodities distribution across western North
    Carolina.** The Department of Defense is also employing additional
    capabilities to assist with increasing situational awareness across
    the remote terrain of Western North Carolina. The Army Corps of
    Engineers continues missions supporting debris removal, temporary
    emergency power installation, water and wastewater assessments with
    the Environmental Protection Agency.
-   Power has been restored to 99 percent of impacted North Carolina
    customers due to thousands of utility personnel working around the
    clock.
-   Commodity distribution, mass feeding, and hydration operations
    continue in areas of western North Carolina. FEMA continues to send
    commodity shipments and voluntary organizations are supporting
    feeding operations with bulk food and water deliveries coming in via
    truck and aircraft. Mobile feeding operations are reaching survivors
    in heavily impacted areas, including three mass feeding sites in
    Buncombe, McDowell and Watauga counties.

Additional actions the Administration is taking to protect public
health, provide flexibilities to homeowners and taxpayers, support
infrastructure recovery, and support workers, farmers, and students in
North Carolina can be [found

Biden-Harris Administration’s Continuous Commitment to Being on the
Ground

Following Hurricane Helene’s devastating impacts across North Carolina,
President Biden committed to helping impacted communities recover and
rebuild, no matter how long it takes. On October 2, less than one week
after landfall, President Biden visited North Carolina to survey the
damage, meet with first responders and impacted communities, and receive
an operational briefing. As part of that visit, he also directed up to
1,000 active-duty troops to partner with the North Carolina National
Guard on the ground at the request of the Governor. Days later, to surge
additional resources and capacity at the request of the Governor,
President Biden ordered another 500 active-duty troops to move into
western North Carolina. On October 5, Vice President Harris also visited
North Carolina to survey the damage, receive briefings, and meet with
first responders.

The President and Vice President and senior leaders across the
Administration have spoken with and coordinated closely with Governor
Cooper throughout the response. President Biden talked with Governor
Cooper at least twice immediately following Helene’s landfall, and
Governor Cooper joined him to survey damage and receive briefings during
his visit. They have stayed in close contact in the ensuing weeks.

At the President’s direction, FEMA Administrator Criswell has been on
the ground in North Carolina for multiple days and nights to lead the
Federal response since Helene’s landfall. She has traveled across the
state to meet with survivors and communities, identify resource needs,
and continue ensuring a swift and coordinated recovery effort.  She will
return again this evening and remain in place to direct additional
measures to speed response and recovery.  Many other Administration
leaders, including Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Secretary Michael Regan,
and Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, have also visited North Carolina to
support recovery efforts and others will do so in the coming days and
weeks, including Secretary Tom Vilsack on October 25.
