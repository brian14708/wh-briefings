title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Takes New Actions to Counter\
  \ Islamophobia and Anti-Arab\_Hate"
---
 
Over the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has continued to
take action to fight hatred and violence against Muslim and Arab
communities. Members of these communities, including Palestinian
Americans, have been murdered or wounded in hate-fueled attacks; shot
and subjected to other assaults as they simply walked down streets;
bullied at schools, including by having their religious head coverings
ripped off; and denied jobs, harassed, or demoted at work merely because
of their faith or ethnicity.

President Biden and Vice President Harris are leading efforts to bring
about much-needed change and have repeatedly condemned such violence,
discrimination, and bias. These efforts are part of a larger
Administration initiative to counter hate in all its forms, to keep
every community safe, to promote equal justice, and to afford all
Americans a fair shot at success. For generations, Muslim and Arab
Americans have contributed to the enrichment and prosperity of our
nation through their public, military, and community service, in
addition to many other invaluable contributions. And like all Americans,
they are entitled to the promise and opportunities of our great nation.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting some actions
taken as part of its forthcoming National Strategy to Counter
Islamophobia and Hatred Against Arabs in the United States, including
important steps to address daily concerns regarding safety and
discrimination, as well as issues related to travel. The Administration
will continue to lead a whole-of-government and a whole-of society
effort to counter hate.

Completed executive branch actions that are part of the forthcoming
Strategy include:

*Improving Safety and Security*

-   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of
    Investigation (FBI) and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC)
    have completed an unclassified assessment on violent threats facing
    Muslim and Arab communities in the United States. The assessment
    will be published this week, and is the first of what will be an
    annual assessment by these agencies regarding threats facing these
    communities.

-   Since 2021, DOJ has [awarded over $100 million in
    grants](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/spotlight/combating-hate-crimes#:~:text=Awarding%20Grants%3A%20Awarding%20over%20%2470%20million%20in%20grant,well%20as%20supporting%20research%20and%20program%20evaluation%20studies.)
    to law enforcement and prosecution agencies, community-based
    organizations, and civil rights groups to address hate crimes
    through outreach, investigations, prosecutions, community awareness
    and preparedness, reporting, hotlines, and victim services. This
    figure includes nearly $30 million in grants
    [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-awards-nearly-30m-combat-rise-hate-and-bias-crimes)
    last month.

-   DOJ continues to support law enforcement agencies’ transition to the
    [National Incident-Based Reporting
    System](https://bjs.ojp.gov/national-incident-based-reporting-system-nibrs)
    (NIBRS). Beginning in January 2021, NIBRS became the national
    standard for law enforcement crime data reporting in the United
    States and the transition to NIBRS represented a significant
    improvement in how reported crime is measured and estimated by the
    federal government. Since 2015, DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance
    and the FBI have provided more than $150 million to law enforcement
    agencies and state Uniform Crime Programs to support their
    transitions to NIBRS.

-   The DOJ Civil Rights Division continues to prosecute Islamophobic
    and other hate crimes, including hate crimes directed at students on
    campus. Last week, a New Jersey man [pleaded guilty to a federal
    hate
    crime](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-jersey-man-pleads-guilty-federal-hate-crime-breaking-center-islamic-life-rutgers)
    for breaking into the Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University
    in New Brunswick, New Jersey, during the Eid-al-Fitr holiday and
    damaging and destroying religious artifacts because of the Islamic
    faith of those associated with the facility.
-   DOJ’s [United Against
    Hate](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-launches-nationwide-initiative-combat-unlawful-acts-hate#:~:text=The%20United%20Against%20Hate%20program%20is%20convening%20local,community%20groups%20to%20combat%20unlawful%20acts%20of%20hate.)
    initiative, led by all 94 [United States Attorneys’
    Offices](https://www.justice.gov/usao/find-your-united-states-attorney)
    (USAOs), combats unlawful acts of hate by teaching community members
    how to identify, report, and help prevent hate crimes and by
    building trust between law enforcement and communities. To date, at
    least 45 USAOs have engaged directly with Muslim communities.

<!-- -->

-   Attorney General Garand directed the Federal Bureau of Investigation
    (FBI) and all 94 USAOs across the country to work with local law
    enforcement and community leaders to protect communities from
    hate-fueled violence in the last year and recently reaffirmed DOJ’s
    commitment to combat the disturbing rise in the volume and frequency
    of threats against Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian as well as Jewish
    communities here in the United States. DOJ created [a
    webpage](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/addressing-jewish-arab-muslim-palestinian-hate)
    aimed at raising awareness of resources for addressing these
    threats, and it will continue to publicize its efforts.  
      
-   During the September 2024 Protecting Places of Worship Week of
    Action, the DHS Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships
    and White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships
    hosted workshops to encourage partnerships to take collective action
    against hate-based violence, including Islamophobic violence and
    hate crimes against Arabs. This emphasis included promotion of [a
    guide](https://www.fema.gov/blog/take-these-4-steps-apply-nonprofit-security-grant)
    to applying for Nonprofit Security Grant Program funding.  
      
-   DHS has
    [announced](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/10/01/dhs-announces-210-million-additional-funds-protect-faith-based-institutions-and)
    that it will distribute $210 million in Nonprofit Security Grant
    Program funds as the second tranche of additional funding the
    Biden-Harris Administration secured to protect faith-based
    institutions and nonprofit organizations against targeted attacks.
    This funding opportunity will be made available in late October.

-   DHS published two resource guides to help faith communities and
    others address swatting, hoax threats and doxing. The [DHS Resources
    for Swatting and Hoax
    Threats](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/resources-swatting-and-hoax-threats)
    provides information on how to handle swatting calls and hoax
    threats, while the [DHS Resources for Individuals on the Threat of
    Doxing](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/resources-individuals-threat-doxing#:~:text=Resources%20for%20Individuals%20on%20the%20Threat%20of%20Doxing.%20This%20infographic)
    infographic defines what doxing is and outlines proactive steps
    individuals can take to prevent doxing.

*Tackling Discrimination and Bias*

-   The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has published [the Workplace
    Rights Federal
    Toolkit](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility/workplace-rights-federal-agency-toolkit/),
    a compilation of resources for employees of the federal government
    regarding their workplace rights, including information about their
    rights to nondiscrimination and religious accommodation.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Labor sent [a
    letter](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/advisories/tegl-05-23) to
    American Job Centers and other public workforce entities reminding
    them about their legal obligations to enforce prohibitions on
    discrimination based on actual or perceived religion, shared
    ancestry, or ethnic characteristics — including Islamophobia,
    Antisemitism, and related forms of discrimination – in federally
    funded activities and programs. The letter also included a fact
    sheet with examples of these forms of discrimination in the
    workforce development system.

<!-- -->

-   DOJ [issued a fact sheet
    titled](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-03/factsheet_-_confronting_discrimination_based_on_religion.pdf)
    Confronting Discrimination Based on Religion in Schools: A Resource
    for Students and Families, which discusses scenarios involving
    students’ rights to pray and wear religious attire in schools.

<!-- -->

-   ED’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a [Fact Sheet on
    Harassment based on Race, Color, or National Origin on School
    Campuses](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-race-color-national-origin-202407.pdf),
    reminding schools of their federal civil rights obligations under
    Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to take prompt
    and effective action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile
    environment. ED OCR continues to investigate and resolve claims of
    shared ancestry discrimination under Title VI at schools. For
    example, ED OCR [recently entered into a resolution
    agreement](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-of-3)
    with the Ann Arbor Public Schools in Michigan to address concerns
    about a hostile environment for students based on shared Muslim/Arab
    Palestinian ancestry.

-   ED released [Free to Learn: Leading Inclusive Learning Environments
    in Higher
    Education](https://sites.ed.gov/cfbnp/files/2024/07/USDE_Campus-Toolkit_FINAL.pdf),
    a new resource guide for fostering safe and inclusive campuses.

<!-- -->

-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) [issued
    a letter](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/Ensuring%20Fair%20Housing%20Amidst%20Ongoing%20Religious%20Discrimination.pdf)** to
    the over 200 federally-funded Fair Housing Initiatives Programs and
    Fair Housing Assistance Programs** on how to identify and counter
    Islamophobia, Antisemitism, and related forms of bias and
    discrimination in housing. Also, HUD [created a
    webpage](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/14religion)
    on protections against housing discrimination on the basis of
    religion, shared ancestry, or ethnic characteristics, which include
    the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
    1964.

-   The Department of Transportation (DOT) provided a number of
    resources related to travelers’ rights and opportunities [to file a
    complaint](https://www.transportation.gov/civil-rights/complaint-resolution/public-complaint-process)
    when there may be an instance of discrimination by airlines or
    recipients of federal funding, including discrimination on the basis
    of religion or national origin. The [Passengers’ Right to Fly Free
    from
    Discrimination](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/Passengers%20Right%20to%20Fly%20Free%20from%20Discrimination.pdf)
    is a guide designed to explain DOT’s role in protecting aviation
    passengers from unlawful discrimination. Similarly, the [Guidance
    for Airline Personnel on Non-discrimination in Air
    Travel](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-05/Guidance%20for%20Airline%20Personnel%20on%20Non-discrimination%20in%20Air%20Travel%205-10-2021.pdf)
    assists airline personnel in understanding their legal obligations
    not to discriminate against passengers. For example, this guidance
    notes that it is impermissible to remove a passenger from a flight
    simply because he is holding a book that appears to be a Quran.

<!-- -->

-   DOJ [sent a
    letter](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-hosts-forum-and-sends-letter-local-officials-reinforce-federal-civil)
    to state, county, and municipal officials reminding them of the
    obligation of public officials to comply with the land use
    provisions of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons
    Act (RLUIPA) and to inform them about documents issued by DOJ that
    may be of assistance to them in applying this federal civil rights
    law. RLUIPA is a federal law that protects people and religious
    institutions from discriminatory and overly burdensome land use
    regulations. For example, DOJ recently filed a complaint and consent
    decree in [*United States v. Hendricks
    County*](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/united-states-v-hendricks-county-indiana-sd-ill#:~:text=Hendricks%20County,%20Indiana%20(S.D.%20Ill.)%20settling%20allegations%20that),
    settling allegations that Hendricks County violated RLUIPA and the
    Fair Housing Act by twice unlawfully denying zoning approval to an
    Islamic educational organization that sought to develop a religious
    seminary, school, and housing on land in Hendricks County.

-   Some Americans, including many Muslims and Arabs, have documented
    how financial institutions use de-risking, a practice to terminate
    or restrict business relationships indiscriminately with broad
    categories of clients rather than analyzing and managing the risks
    of clients in a targeted manner. To help address de-risking, the
    U.S. Treasury Department has published its [National De-Risking
    Strategy](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1439). The
    Treasury Department also has issued a [proposed
    rule](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-proposed-rule-strengthen-and-modernize-financial-institutions)
    to improve the effectiveness of how banks manage potential risks
    associated with anti-money laundering and counter-financing of
    terrorism in a risk-based manner, while avoiding one-size-fits-all
    approaches that can lead to financial institutions declining to
    provide financial services to entire categories of customers.

*Addressing Issues Related to Travel*

-   The FBI published an [Overview of the U.S. Government’s Terrorist
    Watchlisting Process and
    Procedures](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/terrorist-watchlisting-transparency-document-april-2024-050224.pdf/view).
    This document advances transparency by providing a general
    description of this system and mechanisms to ensure that concerns
    about it are handled in a timely and fair manner.

<!-- -->

-   On January 20, 2021, President Biden
    [rescinded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/proclamation-ending-discriminatory-bans-on-entry-to-the-united-states/)
    the previous administration’s discriminatory Muslim Ban, which
    included many Arab countries and was inconsistent with our nation’s
    foundation of religious freedom for all. At President Biden’s
    direction, the U.S. Department of State conducted a review of visa
    applications and has taken various corrective actions to process
    applications that were impacted by the prior travel ban, including
    reconsidering previously denied applications and implementing a
    one-time fee credit for certain applicants.
