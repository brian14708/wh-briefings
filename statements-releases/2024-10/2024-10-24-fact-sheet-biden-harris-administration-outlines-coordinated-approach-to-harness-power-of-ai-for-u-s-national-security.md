title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Outlines Coordinated Approach\
  \ to Harness Power of AI for U.S. National\_Security"
---
 
Today, President Biden is issuing the first-ever National Security
Memorandum (NSM) on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The NSM’s fundamental
premise is that advances at the frontier of AI will have significant
implications for national security and foreign policy in the near
future. The NSM builds on key steps the President and Vice President
have taken to drive the safe, secure, and trustworthy development of AI,
including President Biden’s landmark Executive Order to ensure that
America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing the risks of
AI.

The NSM directs the U.S. Government to implement concrete and impactful
steps to (1) ensure that the United States leads the world’s development
of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI; (2) harness cutting-edge AI
technologies to advance the U.S. Government’s national security mission;
and (3) advance international consensus and governance around AI.

The NSM is designed to galvanize federal government adoption of AI to
advance the national security mission, including by ensuring that such
adoption reflects democratic values and protects human rights, civil
rights, civil liberties and privacy. In addition, the NSM seeks to shape
international norms around AI use to reflect those same democratic
values, and directs actions to track and counter adversary development
and use of AI for national security purposes.

In particular, the NSM directs critical actions to:

**Ensure that the United States leads the world’s development of safe,
secure, and trustworthy AI:**

-   Developing advanced AI systems requires large volumes of advanced
    chips. President Biden led the way when he signed the CHIPS Act,
    which made major investments in our capacity to manufacture
    leading-edge semiconductors. **The NSM directs actions to improve
    the security and diversity of chip supply chains, and to ensure
    that, as the United States supports the development of the next
    generation of government supercomputers and other emerging
    technology, we do so with AI in mind.**

<!-- -->

-   Our competitors want to upend U.S. AI leadership and have employed
    economic and technological espionage in efforts to steal U.S.
    technology. **This NSM makes collection on our competitors’
    operations against our AI sector a top-tier intelligence priority,
    and directs relevant U.S. Government entities to provide AI
    developers with the timely cybersecurity and counterintelligence
    information necessary to keep their inventions secure. **

<!-- -->

-   In order for the United States to benefit maximally from AI,
    Americans must know when they can trust systems to perform safely
    and reliably. For this reason, **the NSM formally designates the AI
    Safety Institute** as U.S. industry’s primary port of contact in the
    U.S. Government, one staffed by technical experts who understand
    this quickly evolving technology. It also lays out strengthened and
    streamlined mechanisms for the AI Safety Institute to partner with
    national security agencies, including the intelligence community,
    the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy.

<!-- -->

-   **The NSM doubles down on the National AI Research Resource**, the
    pilot for which is already underway, to ensure that researchers at
    universities, from civil society, and in small businesses can
    conduct technically meaningful AI research. AI is moving too fast,
    and is too complex, for us to rely exclusively on a small cohort of
    large firms; we need to empower and learn from a full range of
    talented individuals and institutions who care about making AI safe,
    secure, and trustworthy.

<!-- -->

-   The NSM directs the National Economic Council to coordinate an
    economic assessment of the relative competitive advantage of the
    United States private sector AI ecosystem.

**Enable the U.S. Government to harness cutting-edge AI, while
protecting human rights and democratic values, to achieve national
security objectives:**

-   **The NSM does not simply demand that we use AI systems in service
    of the national security mission effectively; it also unequivocally
    states we must do so only in ways that align with democratic
    values.** It provides the first-ever guidance for AI governance and
    risk management for use in national security missions, complementing
    previous guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget for
    non-national security missions.

<!-- -->

-   **The NSM directs the creation of a Framework to Advance AI
    Governance and Risk Management in National Security, which is being
    published today alongside this NSM.** This Framework provides
    further detail and guidance to implement the NSM, including
    requiring mechanisms for risk management, evaluations,
    accountability, and transparency. These requirements require
    agencies to monitor, assess, and mitigate AI risks related to
    invasions of privacy, bias and discrimination, the safety of
    individuals and groups, and other human rights abuses. This
    Framework can be updated regularly in order to keep pace with
    technical advances and ensure future AI applications are responsible
    and rights-respecting.

<!-- -->

-   The NSM directs changes across the board to make sure we are using
    AI systems effectively while adhering to our values. **Among other
    actions, it directs agencies to propose streamlined procurement
    practices and ways to ease collaboration with non-traditional
    vendors.**

**Advance international consensus and governance around AI:**

-   **The NSM builds on substantial international progress on AI
    governance over the last twelve months, thanks to the leadership and
    diplomatic engagement of President Biden and Vice President
    Harris.** Alongside G7 allies, we developed the first-ever
    International Code of Conduct on AI in 2023. At the Bletchley and
    Seoul AI Safety Summits, the United States joined more than two
    dozen nations in outlining clear principles. 56 nations have signed
    up to our Political Declaration on the Military Use of AI and
    Autonomy, which establishes principles for military AI capabilities.
    And at the United Nations, the United States sponsored the
    first-ever UN General Assembly Resolution on AI, which passed
    unanimously and included the People’s Republic of China as a
    co-sponsor.

<!-- -->

-   **The NSM directs the U.S. Government to collaborate with allies and
    partners to establish a stable, responsible, and rights-respecting
    governance framework** to ensure the technology is developed and
    used in ways that adhere to international law while protecting human
    rights and fundamental freedoms. 

The release of today’s NSM is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
comprehensive strategy for responsible innovation, and builds on
previous actions that President Biden and Vice President Harris have
taken.
