title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Tigran\_Gambaryan"
---
 
I am pleased that American citizen and former U.S. law enforcement
official Tigran Gambaryan has been released on humanitarian grounds by
the Nigerian Government and is on his way back to the United States so
that he can receive needed medical attention. As soon as we secured Mr.
Gambaryan’s release, I called his wife Yuki to share this good news. I
am grateful to my Nigerian colleagues and partners for the productive
discussions that have resulted in this step and look forward to working
closely with them on the many areas of cooperation and collaboration
critical to the bilateral partnership between our two countries.
