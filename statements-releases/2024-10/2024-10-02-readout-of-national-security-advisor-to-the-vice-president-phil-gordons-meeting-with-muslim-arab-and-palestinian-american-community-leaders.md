National Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon met
virtually today with Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian American community
leaders from across the United States.

Dr. Gordon discussed the latest developments in the Middle East. He
underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to bring the war
in Gaza to an end through a ceasefire and hostage release deal, which
would relieve the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He expressed concern for
civilians in Lebanon and underscored the importance of a diplomatic
resolution for ultimately achieving lasting stability and security
across the Israel-Lebanon border so that civilians can safely return to
their homes. He also expressed concern about actions that undermine
peace, security, and stability in the West Bank. Dr. Gordon heard
participants’ views and perspectives about developments in the region
and reiterated the Vice President’s commitment to continue to engage
with Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities across the United States.
