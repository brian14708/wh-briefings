title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on New Action to Significantly Expand\
  \ Contraception Coverage Under the Affordable Care\_Act"
---
 
Since *Roe v. Wade* was overturned more than two years ago, Republican
elected officials have made clear they want to ban or restrict birth
control, defund federal programs that help women access contraception,
and repeal the Affordable Care Act. And Congressional Republicans have
repeatedly blocked federal legislation to safeguard the fundamental
right to birth control for women in every state. It’s unacceptable.

Today, my Administration is taking a major step to expand contraception
coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This new action would help
ensure that millions of women with private health insurance can access
the no-cost contraception they need. Vice President Harris and I have
worked tirelessly to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act. We
lowered costs for Marketplace coverage by an average of $800 per year
for millions of Americans, and more Americans than ever before have
signed up for health insurance through the law.  

At a time when contraception access is under attack, Vice President
Harris and I are resolute in our commitment to expanding access to
quality, affordable contraception. We believe that women in every state
must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions,
including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family.
We will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive health care
and call on Congress to restore reproductive freedom and safeguard the
right to contraception once and for all.
