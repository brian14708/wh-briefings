*Biden-Harris Administration Announces Proposal for Most Significant
Expansion of Contraception Coverage Under the Affordable Care Act in
More Than a Decade*

  
President Biden and Vice President Harris have protected and built on
the Affordable Care Act. Nearly 50 million people over the past decade
have had coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s Marketplaces, and
the law has protected more than 100 million people with preexisting
medical conditions. Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration,
Affordable Care Act coverage is more affordable than ever with millions
of families saving an average of $800 per year on Marketplace
coverage.  
  
The Affordable Care Act has also helped millions of women save billions
of dollars on contraception—an essential component of reproductive
health care that has only become more important since the Supreme Court
overturned *Roe v. Wade*. As part of President Biden and Vice President
Harris’ steadfast commitment to reproductive rights, the Biden-Harris
Administration has further strengthened contraception access and
affordability under the Affordable Care Act, through Medicare and
Medicaid, through the Title X Family Planning Program, through federally
qualified health centers, and for federal employees, Service members,
veterans, and college students.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a rule that would
significantly increase coverage of contraception without cost sharing
for 52 million women of reproductive age with private health insurance.
Building on the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most private
health plans must cover contraception without cost sharing, today’s
proposed rule from the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS),
Labor, and the Treasury would:

-   **Expand coverage of over-the-counter contraception without cost
    sharing.** Under the proposed rule, for the first time, women would
    be able to obtain over-the-counter (OTC) contraception without a
    prescription at no additional cost. As a result, more women would be
    able to access and afford critical OTC medications such as emergency
    contraception and the first-ever daily oral contraceptive approved
    by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use without a
    prescription that is now widely available across the country.  
-   **Make it easier to learn about coverage for OTC contraception.** To
    help ensure that women understand this new benefit, most private
    health plans would be required to disclose that OTC contraception is
    covered without cost sharing and without a prescription—and take
    steps to help women learn more about their contraception coverage.  
-   **Strengthen coverage of prescribed contraception without cost
    sharing.** The proposed rule would make it easier for most women
    with private health insurance to obtain contraception without cost
    sharing that is prescribed by their health care provider. Health
    plans would be required to cover every FDA-approved contraceptive
    drug or drug-led combination product without cost sharing unless the
    plan also covers a therapeutic equivalent without cost sharing,
    eliminating barriers that some women continue to face in accessing
    contraception prescribed by their provider.

This proposed rule, if finalized, would be the most significant
expansion of contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act since
2012, when contraception was first required to be covered. Also today,
the Biden-Harris Administration is issuing new guidance to help ensure
that patients can access other preventive services, such as cancer
screenings, that must be covered without cost sharing under the
Affordable Care Act.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is issuing this proposed rule at a time
when reproductive rights are under attack, and Republican elected
officials remain committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade*,
dangerous and extreme abortion bans are putting women’s health and lives
at risk and disrupting access to critical health care services,
including contraception, as health care providers are forced to close in
states across the country. At the same time, Republican elected
officials in some states have made clear they want to ban or restrict
birth control in addition to abortion, and Republicans in Congress have
attacked contraception access nationwide by proposing to defund the
Title X Family Planning Program. In contrast, President Biden and Vice
President Harris believe that women in every state must have the freedom
to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to
decide if and when to start or grow their family.  
  
Today’s announcements build on actions that the Biden-Harris
Administration has already taken to expand access to affordable
contraception, including to implement the President’s [Executive Order
on Strengthening Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception and
Family Planning
Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/)
from June 2023. The Administration has taken action to:

-   **Expand contraception coverage and affordability under the
    Affordable Care Act. **The Departments of HHS, Labor, and the
    Treasury [proposed a
    rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/02/2023-01981/coverage-of-certain-preventive-services-under-the-affordable-care-act)
    to provide a new pathway under the Affordable Care Act for women to
    access coverage of contraceptives when their private health coverage
    is exempt from covering this benefit due to a religious objection.
    These agencies also issued [new
    guidance](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/faqs-part-64.pdf) to
    support expanded coverage of a broader range of FDA-approved,
    cleared, or granted contraceptives at no additional cost under the
    Affordable Care Act, building on [guidance
    issued](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/07/28/hhs-dol-treasury-issue-guidance-regarding-birth-control-coverage.html) after
    *Roe v. Wade* was overturned to clarify protections for
    contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Further, HHS
    strengthened the standard for inclusion of family planning providers
    in Marketplace plan provider networks and provided [nearly $9
    million](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-advances-womens-health-through-affordable-care-act-grants-14-states-dc)
    in grant funding to support state efforts to enhance and expand
    coverage of, and access to, reproductive and maternal health
    services, including contraception. And the Internal Revenue Service
    issued [new](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-24-71.pdf)
    [guidance](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-24-75.pdf) affirming
    that high-deductible health plans can cover OTC contraception as
    preventive care.  
-   **Bolster family planning services through Title X clinics.** HHS
    continues to [rebuild and
    grow](https://opa.hhs.gov/research-evaluation/title-x-services-research/family-planning-annual-report-fpar)
    the Title X Family Planning Program, which has played a critical
    role in ensuring access to a broad range of high-quality family
    planning and preventive health services for more than 50 years.
    During the prior administration, more than 1,000 service sites left
    the Title X Family Planning Program, leading to a significant
    decline in people served. The Biden-Harris Administration reversed
    the policy changes that led to those departures, strengthening the
    Title X Family Planning Program and helping ensure that the Program
    remains a critical part of the nation’s health safety net. In 2023,
    HHS provided about $287 million to nearly 4,000 Title X clinics
    across the country to provide free or low-cost voluntary,
    client-centered family planning and related preventive services for
    2.8 million women and families—an 80 percent increase since 2020.  
-   **Support family planning coverage through the Medicaid and Medicare
    programs.** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
    issued [new
    guidance](https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/cib08082024.pdf)
    to state Medicaid programs and Children’s Health Insurance Programs
    (CHIP) to help ensure that enrollees can access family planning
    services. The new guidance outlined existing state obligations under
    federal law, highlighted strategies to enhance access to
    contraception, affirmed confidentiality requirements for those
    seeking family planning services, and shared recommendations on ways
    to measure quality in delivering family planning services. To help
    ensure that women with Medicare coverage have access to more covered
    types of contraception without unnecessary barriers, CMS updated its
    Medicare Part D formulary clinical review process for plan year 2024
    and 2025 to include additional contraceptive types, such as
    long-acting contraceptives, and is increasing public awareness of
    contraceptive coverage options under Medicare Part B. The Secretary
    of HHS also [issued a
    letter](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/01/22/hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-announces-new-actions-increase-contraceptive-care-coverage-51st-anniversary-roe-v-wade.html) to
    state Medicaid and CHIP programs as well as private health insurers
    and Medicare plans about their existing obligations to cover
    contraception for those they serve.  
-   **Increase contraception access through federal health centers.**
    Federal health centers continue to be an important source of family
    planning services: in 2023, health centers provided nearly 3 million
    contraceptive services visits to patients, a 14 percent increase
    since 2020. To support health centers in providing high-quality
    family planning services, the Health Resources and Services
    Administration (HRSA) provided updated guidance on existing federal
    requirements for family planning and related services, which is a
    required primary health care service under federal law, as well as
    evidence-based recommendations and resources. HRSA also adopted new
    data measures for health centers that will help assess whether
    patients have been screened for contraception needs. Screening and
    data measures will help enhance the overall delivery of voluntary
    family planning and related services.  
-   **Support contraception access for federal employees and their
    families.** The Office of Personnel Management [strengthened access
    to
    contraception](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/carriers/fehb/2024/2024-03.pdf) for
    federal workers, retirees, and family members by issuing guidance to
    insurers participating in the Federal Employee Health Benefits
    Program to clarify standards and support expanded coverage of a
    broader range of FDA-approved, cleared, or granted contraceptives at
    no additional cost. The Office of Personnel Management also required
    insurers that participate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits
    Program to take additional steps to educate enrollees about their
    contraception benefits and launched a [public education
    campaign](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/contraception-coverage/)
    to highlight contraception benefits available to federal employees
    and their families.  
-   **Promote contraception access and affordability for Service members
    and their families and certain dependents of veterans.** To improve
    access to contraception at military hospitals and clinics, the
    Department of Defense
    [expanded](https://tricare.mil/WalkinContraceptiveServices) walk-in
    contraceptive care services for active-duty Service members and
    other Military Health System beneficiaries and
    [eliminated](https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/3174941/tricare-offers-contraceptive-care-to-support-you-your-family-and-your-readiness#:~:text=Yes.,many%20retailers%20at%20no%20cost.)
    TRICARE copays for certain contraceptive services. And the
    Department of Veterans Affairs
    [eliminated](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/30/2024-09072/champva-coverage-of-audio-only-telehealth-mental-health-services-and-cost-sharing-for-certain)
    out-of-pocket costs for certain types of contraception through the
    Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans
    Affairs.  
-   **Support access to affordable contraception for college students.**
    To help increase access to contraception for college students,
    President Biden directed the Secretary of Education to convene
    institutions of higher education to share best practices and ways to
    help students understand their options for accessing contraception.
    In 2023, Vice President Harris joined a Department of
    Education [convening](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/05/readout-of-vice-president-kamala-harriss-participation-at-the-department-of-educations-convening-on-access-to-contraception-for-college-students/) of
    representatives from 68 colleges and universities across 32 states
    to discuss promising strategies for protecting and expanding access
    to contraception for their students. This convening followed Vice
    President Harris’s multiple conversations about reproductive health
    access with students on college campuses across the country.  
-   **Enhance contraception access through technical assistance and
    public-private partnership.** In June 2023, HHS announced a new
    five-year public-private partnership to expand access to
    contraception with Upstream, a national nonprofit organization that
    provides health centers with free patient-centered, evidence-based
    training and technical assistance to eliminate provider-level
    barriers to offering the full range of contraceptive options. To
    date, HHS has connected Upstream to more than 130 health care
    clinics, resulting in partnerships that will help Upstream
    accelerate their national expansion to reach 5 million women of
    reproductive age every year.  
-   **Promote research and data analysis on contraception access.** To
    document the gaps and disparities in contraception access as well as
    the benefits of comprehensive coverage, HHS convened leading experts
    to discuss the state of research, data collection, and data analysis
    on contraception access and family planning services. These
    convenings helped identify research gaps, opportunities for
    collaboration, and ways to bolster research efforts for both Federal
    agencies and external partners.

In addition to strengthening access to affordable contraception, the
Biden-Harris Administration continues to implement President Biden’s
[three](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-access-to-reproductive-health-care-services/)[Executive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/03/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-at-the-first-meeting-of-the-task-force-on-reproductive-healthcare-access-2/)[Orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/)
and a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-presidential-memorandum-on-ensuring-safe-access-to-medication-abortion/)
directing federal agencies to protect access to reproductive health care
issued since the Court overturned *Roe v. Wade*. To date, the
Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to protect access to
abortion, including FDA-approved medication abortion; defend access to
emergency medical care; support the ability to travel for reproductive
health care; safeguard the privacy of patients and health care
providers; and ensure access to accurate information and legal
resources.  
  
The Vice President has led the White House’s efforts
to [partner](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dobbs-Anniversary-States-Report-6.22.23.pdf) with
leaders on the frontlines of protecting access to abortion, highlighting
the harm of abortion bans to women’s health at more than 100 events in
more than 20 states since *Roe v. Wade* was overturned, and meeting with
hundreds of  state legislators, health care providers, and advocates. On
what would have been the 51st anniversary of *Roe v. Wade*, the Vice
President launched a nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour to
continue fighting back against extreme attacks throughout America.  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to call on
Congress to restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law to
ensure that women in every state are able to make their own decisions
about reproductive health care.
