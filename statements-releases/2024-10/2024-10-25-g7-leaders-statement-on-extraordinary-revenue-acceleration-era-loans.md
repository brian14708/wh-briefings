title: "G7 Leaders\u2019 Statement on Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA)\_Loans"
---
 
Today, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), have reached a
consensus on how to deliver approximately $50 billion in Extraordinary
Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loans to Ukraine.

These loans will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary
revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets,
in line with G7 respective legal systems and international law. The loan
proceeds will be disbursed through multiple channels to support
Ukraine’s budgetary, military and reconstruction assistance, as
consistent with all applicable law and G7 members’ respective legal
systems. Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the
year.

We express our utmost appreciation for the timely implementation of this
historic G7 Leaders’ decision by the Finance Ministers, who have agreed
on a technical solution ensuring consistency, coordination, fair
distribution of lending, and solidarity among all G7 partners. We are
particularly grateful to the European Union and its Member States for
their constructive engagement towards this remarkable result.

Today’s announcement confirms that the G7 fulfills the commitment they
made in June at the Apulia G7 Leaders’ Summit. Russian illegal and
unprovoked aggression has caused untold harm to the people of Ukraine
and to global peace and security. We will not tire in our resolve to
give Ukraine the support it needs to prevail. Russia must end its
illegal war of aggression and pay for the damage it has caused to
Ukraine in line with international law.

The G7 remains steadfast in its solidarity to support Ukraine’s fight
for freedom, and its recovery and reconstruction. With the large amount
of financing from the ERA loans to meet its pressing need, we have once
again made clear our unwavering commitment to stand by Ukraine for as
long as it takes. Time is not on President Putin’s side.
