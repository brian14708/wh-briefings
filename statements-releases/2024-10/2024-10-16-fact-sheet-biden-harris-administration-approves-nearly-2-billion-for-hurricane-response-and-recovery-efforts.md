title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Approves Nearly $2 Billion for\
  \ Hurricane Response and Recovery\_Efforts"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration continues its response and recovery
efforts across the Southeast and Appalachia following Hurricanes Helene
and Milton. Nearly 8,000 Federal personnel remain on the ground working
side-by-side with State and local officials to help survivors with
recovery and rebuilding.

**As part of our commitment to remaining with impacted communities as
long as it takes, under President Biden’s direction, the Administration
has already approved more than $1.8 billion in assistance for hurricane
recovery efforts.**

This includes assistance for individuals – including funding for
temporary housing, essential needs like food, water, baby formula, and
other emergency supplies – as well as public assistance to states for
costs related to debris removal, life-saving emergency protective
measures, and restoring public infrastructure, including roads, bridges,
schools, and courthouses.

**In North Carolina, where the Administration** [**continues to surge
resources**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/13/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-recovery-efforts-in-north-carolina-following-hurricane-helene/)**,
more than $100 million in assistance has been approved for more than
77,000 survivors.**

This funding supplements additional investments announced by President
Biden during his visit to Florida this weekend, where he awarded more
than $600 million from the Department of Energy to [six
projects](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/Helene_Milton_Hurricanes_GRIP2_Fact_Sheets.pdf)
across the Southeast to enhance the reliability and resilience of the
electric grid in the face of more extreme weather events.

Specific funding for impacted communities includes:

For those affected by Hurricane Helene, FEMA has approved over $911
million, which includes $581 million in assistance for individuals and
affected communities and over $330 million for public assistance costs
like debris removal and other activities to save lives, protect public
health and safety, prevent damage to public and private property, and
restore public infrastructure.

For individual assistance related to **Hurricane Helene**, specific
funding approved includes:

-   Florida: More than $213 million for 71,000 survivors
-   South Carolina: More than $132 million for 146,000 survivors
-   Georgia: More than $119 million for 118,000 survivors
-   North Carolina: More than $100 million for 77,000 survivors
-   Tennessee: More than $11.8 million for 2,400 survivors
-   Virginia: More than $4.7 million for 1,500 survivors

For those affected by **Hurricane Milton**, FEMA has already approved
over $620 million, which thus far includes $16 million in assistance for
individuals and affected communities and over $604 million in public
assistance.  

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has offered over $48
million in tentatively approved disaster loan funding to survivors of
Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The SBA also has hundreds of staff working
on the ground supporting communities in Florida, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia in 48 disaster
recovery centers, as well as in loan processing and customer service
centers. 

<u>Disaster Recovery Centers open throughout impacted states:</u>

Additional Disaster Recovery Centers are opening throughout the affected
communities to provide survivors with in-person assistance. These
centers serve as “one stop shops,” offering help with applications for
FEMA assistance, information on available resources from other Federal
agencies, and guidance on navigating the recovery process. Disaster
Survivor Assistance Teams remain on the ground in neighborhoods in all
affected states helping survivors apply for assistance and connecting
them with additional state, local, federal and voluntary resources.

Survivors can visit Disaster Recovery Centers in the following
cities/towns:

Florida:

-   Twelve Disaster Recovery Centers are open in Bradenton, Branford,
    Glen Saint Mary, Homosassa, Lake City, Largo, Live Oak, Madison,
    Perry, Sarasota, and Tampa, and more will open in the coming days
    and weeks. DRCs will support survivors impacted by both Helene and
    Milton. In addition, 120 Disaster Survivor Assistance Team members
    are going into neighborhoods to connect with survivors.

North Carolina:

-   Six Disaster Recovery Centers are open in Asheville, Bakersville,
    Boone, Lenoir, Marion and Sylva. FEMA expects to open up to ten more
    Disaster Recovery Centers in impacted communities in the coming
    days. More than 1,200 FEMA staff are on the ground, and 379 Disaster
    Survivor Assistance Team members are going into neighborhoods to
    connect with survivors.

Georgia:

-   Four Disaster Recovery Centers are open in Valdosta, Douglas,
    Sandersville and Augusta. 152 Disaster Survivor Assistance Team
    members are going into neighborhoods to connect with survivors.

    Barnwell, Batesburg, Easley, and North Augusta. 92 Disaster Survivor
    Assistance Team members are going into neighborhoods to connect with
    survivors.

Tennessee:

    Assistance Team members are going into neighborhoods to connect with
    survivors.

Virginia:

-   Four Disaster Recovery Centers are open in Damascus, Dublin,
    Independence, and Tazewell. 57 Disaster Survivor Assistance Team
    members are going into neighborhoods to connect with survivors.

Additional assistance to agriculture producers includes:

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that people in parts
of Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee recovering from Tropical Storm
Helene may be eligible for food assistance through the USDA’s Disaster
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP). Approximately
982,930 households in Georgia, 152,572 households in North Carolina and
54,692 households in Tennessee are estimated to be eligible for this
relief to help with grocery expenses. Through this program, which USDA
makes available through states in the aftermath of disasters, people who
may not be eligible for SNAP in normal circumstances can participate if
they meet specific criteria, including disaster income limits and
qualifying disaster-related expenses.

USDA also announced additional assistance to help agriculture producers
impacted by Hurricane Helene in the recovery process. Producers will
receive over $233 million in indemnities for losses from Hurricane
Helene. These payments will directly help farmers and rural communities
recover.

Currently, Hurricane Helene estimated indemnities by state include:

-   Georgia: $207.7 million 
-   Florida: $12.8 million
-   Alabama: $5.0 million 
-   North Carolina: $4.1 million 
-   South Carolina: $4.1 million
-   Virginia: $61,000
