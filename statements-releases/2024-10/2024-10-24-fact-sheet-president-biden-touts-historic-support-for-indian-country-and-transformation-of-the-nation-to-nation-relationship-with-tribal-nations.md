title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Touts Historic Support for Indian Country and\
  \ Transformation of the Nation-to-Nation Relationship with Tribal\_Nations"
---
 
Tomorrow, at the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, President Biden
will outline his record of transformative investment in Indian Country
and relationships with Tribal Nations, advancing Tribal sovereignty and
self-determination, respecting Native cultures, and protecting
Indigenous sacred sites. 

President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken historic actions to
support Indian Country through executive actions, historic investments,
and strengthening government-to-government relationships. The President
has issued three historic Executive Orders that reform federal funding
to help live up to the promise of Tribal self-determination, improve
public safety and criminal justice for Native Americans while targeting
the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people, and improve
educational outcomes and career opportunities for Native American
students by focusing on systemic barriers and increasing access to
high-quality education. The President has also taken further executive
action through two Presidential Memoranda on Tribal consultation,
including his [2021 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening
Nation-to-Nation
Relationships](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-on-tribal-consultation-and-strengthening-nation-to-nation-relationships/)
and his [2022 Memorandum on Uniform Standards for Tribal
Consultation](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/11/30/memorandum-on-uniform-standards-for-tribal-consultation/#:~:text=The%20Presidential%20Memorandum%20of%20January,directives%20of%20Executive%20Order%2013175.).

This executive action builds on the historic investments President Biden
has made in Indian Country, including:

-   $32 billion in the American Rescue Plan, the largest direct federal
    investment in Tribal Nations in history.
-   $13 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build high-speed
    internet, roads, bridges, public transit, and clean water sanitation
    infrastructure in Tribal communities.
-   $700 million in the Inflation Reduction Act to invest in Native
    communities for climate resilience and adaptation programs, drought
    mitigation, home electrification, and clean energy development.
-   Obligating billions of federal contract dollars—and significant
    percentages of agencies’ overall procurement dollars—to Native-owned
    or controlled businesses through the Buy Indian Act, a law that has
    been re-invigorated under the Biden-Harris Administration.

The Biden-Harris Administration has made honoring Tribal Nations and
Indigenous Peoples central to our conservation agenda, including by
restoring and designating multiple new national monuments that honor
Tribal Nations by protecting sacred ancestral places and their
historically and scientifically important features, designating the
first Indigenous-focused national marine sanctuary, directing federal
agencies to support First Foods including healthy and abundant native
salmon and steelhead, signing over 200 new co-stewardship agreements
with Tribes, issuing an updated Sacred Sites MOU and best practices, and
implementing a first-of-its kind Indigenous Knowledge guidance.

The President has also sought to have an Administration that reflects
the priorities of Indian Country by hiring over 80 Native appointees in
historic positions, including the first Native American Cabinet
Secretary with Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and the first
Native American Treasurer of the United States with Chief Lynn Malerba.
In addition, the President followed through with his promise to
reinstate the annual White House Tribal Nations Summit and the White
House Council on Native American Affairs.

Dr. Biden has been a champion for Native communities. As First Lady, she
has visited Native communities ten times, highlighting the Biden-Harris
Administration’s historic investments in youth mental health, Native
language revitalization, and infrastructure and economic development,
and she has worked to improve access to cancer screening and cancer care
for Native communities.

The President also believes that to usher in the next era of the
Federal-Tribal relationships we need to fully acknowledge the harms of
the past. That is why he is issuing a historic Presidential apology for
the Federal Indian Boarding School era. For over 150 years, the federal
government ran boarding schools that forcibly removed generations of
Native children from their homes to boarding schools often far away.
Native children at these schools endured physical, emotional, and sexual
abuse, and, as detailed in the [Federal Indian Boarding School
Investigative
Report](https://www.doi.gov/priorities/strengthening-indian-country/federal-indian-boarding-school-initiative)
by the Department of the Interior (DOI), at least 973 children died in
these schools. The federally-run Indian boarding school system was
designed to assimilate Native Americans by destroying Native culture,
language, and identity through harsh militaristic and assimilationist
methods.

In making this apology, the President acknowledges that we as a people
who love our country must remember and teach our full history, even when
it is painful. And we must learn from that history so that it is never
repeated.

The Presidential apology builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s
extraordinary accomplishments working with Tribes and Native
Communities:

**<u>Strengthening Tribal Self-Determination</u>**

-   [Executive Order 14112 on Reforming Federal Funding and Support for
    Tribal Nations to Better Embrace Our Trust Responsibilities and
    Promote the Next Era of Tribal
    Self-Determination](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/11/2023-27318/reforming-federal-funding-and-support-for-tribal-nations-to-better-embrace-our-trust)
    (Dec. 2023): EO 14112 directs agencies to reform federal funding
    programs in a manner that reflects trust in Tribal priorities and
    deference to Tribal decision-making. The Executive Order directs the
    White House Council on Native American Affairs, the Office and
    Management and Budget, and the White House Domestic Policy Council
    to work across the Federal Government to measure the chronic
    shortfalls of existing federal funding for Tribes and develop
    recommendations for what additional funding and programming is
    necessary. 

**<u>Addressing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons and Gender-Based
Violence in Native Communities</u>**

-   Signing an [Executive Order to improve public safety and criminal
    justice and address the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous
    People
    (MMIP)](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/15/executive-order-on-improving-public-safety-and-criminal-justice-for-native-americans-and-addressing-the-crisis-of-missing-or-murdered-indigenous-people/)
    by directing agencies to prioritize addressing this crisis and
    assessing what more they can do.
-   Signed into law the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)
    Reauthorization Act of 2022, which expanded special Tribal criminal
    jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of sexual violence, child
    violence, stalking, assaults on Tribal law enforcement officers, and
    sex trafficking on Tribal lands, in addition to domestic and dating
    violence.
-   Awarded $68 million in FY 2023 VAWA grants and more than $85 million
    in FY 2024 VAWA grants to support Native communities to provide
    services and promote justice for survivors.
-   Established the Not Invisible Act Commission to improve the federal
    government’s efforts to address violent crime and the high rates of
    people reported missing in Native communities.

**<u>Historic Investments in Indian Country</u>**

-   Historic investments in Tribal Nations, including $32 billion in the
    American Rescue Plan, the largest direct federal investment to
    Tribal Nations in history; $13 billion in the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law; and $700 million in the Inflation Reduction Act.
-   Through the President’s Justice40 Initiative, more than 500 federal
    programs, including programs funded and created through the
    President’s Investing in America agenda, are working to deliver
    benefits to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by
    underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. All federally
    recognized Tribes and Tribal entities are recognized as
    disadvantaged for purposes of benefitting from the Justice40
    Initiative. These investments are resulting in cleaner air and
    water, more affordable clean energy, good-paying jobs, and other
    benefits that Tribes are seeing and experiencing today and into the
    future.

**<u>Supporting Native-owned Businesses</u>**

-   The Biden-Harris Administration has spent billions of federal
    contract dollars with Native-owned or controlled businesses through
    the Buy Indian Act, a law that authorizes the Department of the
    Interior and Indian Health Service (IHS) at the Department of Health
    and Human Services to have contract set-asides for Tribal and
    Native-owned businesses.
-   Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Federal spending with Native
    firms has increased by $8.2B between FY20 and FY23. The Small
    Business Administration (SBA) has expanded access to capital for
    Native communities by nearly doubling the total dollar amount lent
    to Native American small businesses. SBA now has 12 Native-owned
    banks and CDFIs that lend with SBA backing.

**<u>Advance Appropriations for Indian Health Service</u>**

-   For the first time ever, and after many years of Tribal advocacy,
    the Biden-Harris Administration successfully secured advance
    appropriations for the Indian Health Service (IHS), and the
    President has requested mandatory funding for IHS moving forward.

**<u>Regulations Supporting Tribes and Native Communities</u>**

-   The Biden-Harris Administration has worked consistently with Tribal
    Nations throughout the last four years to secure regulatory
    improvements that reflect long-standing Tribal priorities. Some of
    this regulatory work includes [revising regulations for promoting
    economic development opportunities across Indian Country, revising
