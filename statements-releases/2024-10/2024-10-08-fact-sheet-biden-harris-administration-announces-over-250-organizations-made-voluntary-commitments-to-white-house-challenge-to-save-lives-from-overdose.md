title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Over 250 Organizations\
  \ Made Voluntary Commitments to White\_House Challenge to Save Lives from\_Overdose"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that over 250
organizations, businesses, and stakeholders across the country have made
voluntary commitments to the White House Challenge to Save Lives from
Overdose.  
  
The Challenge, launched earlier this year, is a nationwide
call-to-action to stakeholders across all sectors to increase training
on, and access to, life-saving opioid overdose reversal medications like
naloxone. The voluntary commitments highlighted today build on progress
made under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s Unity Agenda,
which calls on all Americans, in red states, blue states¸ and everywhere
in between, to come together and help address the nation’s overdose
epidemic.  
  
Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’<u>s</u> leadership, the
Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action and made
unprecedented investments to reduce overdose deaths. The Administration
removed decades-long barriers to treatment for substance use disorder
and expanded access to life-saving overdose reversal medications like
naloxone.  The Administration also acted to make naloxone available
over-the-counter at groceries and pharmacies for the first time in
history. Today, the nation is now seeing the largest decrease in
overdose deaths on record.  
  
The White House received commitments to the Challenge from private and
public entities, spanning entertainment and hospitality, professional
sports leagues, health care providers, trade associations, schools and
universities, technology companies, transportation partners, faith
groups, private businesses, and more.   
A number of organizations and businesses made new voluntary commitments
as part of the White House Challenge to Save Lives from Overdose,
including:

-   **Amazon** is equipping its North American operations facilities
    with naloxone and bolstering its emergency response procedures with
    comprehensive training for employees on how to recognize signs of an
    opioid overdose and properly administer naloxone. Amazon is rolling
    out its naloxone program in two phases, starting with its most
    densely populated fulfillment centers. By early 2025, the program
    will expand to all of Amazon’s operations sites in the U.S.,
    covering over 500,000 employees at hundreds of sites nationwide.  
-   **American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
    (AFSCME)** commits to train its members and staff on proper use of
    opioid overdose reversal medications. They also commit to including
    opioid overdose medications in all first aid kits.  
-   **The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA)** is working with
    the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to implement naloxone on
    flights, including trainings. They previously worked with the FAA to
    require that Emergency Medical Kits (EMK) carried by passenger
    airlines include naloxone.  
-   **Atlanta Public Schools (APS)** is implementing a district-wide
    training available to all school staff to recognize and reverse
    overdose. Currently, 136 APS health and security personnel have
    completed naloxone training. APS stocks naloxone in every
    elementary, middle, and high school in the district, serving nearly
    50,000 students and 8,000 employees, and has opioid educational
    posters and brochures to increase school community awareness.  
-   **Butler University** formed the Butler Overdose Action Team,
    comprised of faculty, staff, and student leaders, in response to the
    *White House Challenge to Save Lives from Overdose*. The team is
    leading campus-wide initiatives to increase awareness, training, and
    access to lifesaving opioid overdose reversal medication, and
    collaborating with local health organizations in Indianapolis to
    promote education on opioid use disorder on campus. Butler also
    recently placed naloxone in all 58 Emergency Kits across campus, and
    plans are underway for comprehensive naloxone training for students
    and employees.  
-   **Charleston County School District (CCSD)** commits to working with
    their community and local substance use agencies to provide
    educational programs on and promote the use of opioid overdose
    reversal medications (OORM). CCSD’s substance use program commits to
    educate students, staff, and parents/caregivers about the dangers of
    illicit fentanyl and how OORM can save lives. In addition, CCSD
    works closely with district nursing staff on the use and
    availability of OORM in CCSD’s 83 schools that serve approximately
    49,000 students.  
-   **The Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Department** commits to train
    and equip all of its Police Officers with naloxone. The Department
    supports a regional transit agency in the Dallas/Fort Worth
    metroplex, covering six counties and thirteen cities.  
-   **Deloitte LLP** will equip U.S.-based Deloitte Offices with
    naloxone by December 2024. Naloxone will be placed in Automated
    External Defibrillator (AED) cabinets at its offices across the U.S.
    Further, Deloitte will train select office personnel to recognize
    and help treat overdose.  
-   **Keystone Contractors Association (KCA)** is recommending to its
    members that every construction jobsite and contractor’s office have
    naloxone available on-site. This builds upon KCA’s work in prior
    years in launching the Pennsylvania Construction Opioid Awareness
    Week to get resources and training to construction employers to
    provide to their workers.  
-   **Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA)** commits to
    reach its 500,000+ members, their families, and LIUNA affiliates
    with education on the importance of naloxone on jobsites, training
    on how to use the medication, and information on where and how to
    get it. This work is in addition to developing and promoting
    comprehensive safety and health information on opioid use.  
-   **The National Hockey League (NHL)** commits to working with its
    clubs and staff to make life-saving medication readily available
    across NHL offices and in arenas. NHL is helping clubs make naloxone
    available at home games with their first aid units, and ensuring
    on-site personnel are trained to administer it on game nights. NHL
    is also advising clubs to include naloxone in their travel medical
    kits, and encouraging its availability in the visiting team’s
    emergency bags.  
-   **San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (SDMTS)** now trains every
    newly hired Code Compliance Inspector (CCI) from the Transit
    Security and Passenger Safety Department in the recognition of
    opioid overdose and issues naloxone as required equipment for staff.
    In 2024, CCIs administered naloxone nearly 200 times, and the SDMTS
    Bus Division Road Supervisors also started carrying naloxone. SDMTS
    started training CCIs to carry and administer naloxone in July 2021
    in response to the overdose crisis.

Commitments from these entities build upon steps taken in recent years
by other organizations that joined the *White House Challenge to Save
Lives from Overdose* to address the overdose epidemic. Examples of these
actions from organizations include:

-   **American Heart Association and Opioid Response Network** are
    partnering on the EmPOWERED to End Opioid Misuse and Stimulant Use
    Disorder Initiative that aims to address opioid and stimulant usage
    within Black and Hispanic communities. They have partnered with
    Black and Hispanic churches to implement community trainings and
    disseminate educational tools to facilitate open and honest
    conversations with a wide range of people on the stigmatization of
    people experiencing opioid and substance use disorders.  
-   **International Union of Painters & Allied Trades (IUPAT) District
    Council 35** prioritizes support for and awareness of mental health
    and substance use, and provides overdose education and training on
    naloxone to its members and apprentices. IUPAT also distributes
    naloxone to its members, apprentices, and jobsites. IUPAT is part of
    a broader effort by the Massachusetts Building Trades Recovery
    Council, which has distributed more than 11,000 doses of naloxone to
    14 building trades unions across Massachusetts for distribution to
    their membership. The Recovery Council receives naloxone from
    Massachusetts’ Bureau of Substance Abuse Services’ Community
    Naloxone Program.  
-   **The Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA)** in Florida has
    developed overdose rescue training for operations, safety, and
    security staff, and implemented a ‘bus marshal’ program, where
    naloxone-equipped security officers ride strategically-targeted
    routes. This led to saving the life of a bus passenger who was
    experiencing overdose. JTA also launched ‘Safety on the Move’,
    delivering free overdose prevention and rescue training and naloxone
    kits to at-risk communities in partnership with Drug Free Duval,
    Community Coalition Alliance, Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) Foundation, and North Florida High Intensity Drug
    Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Overdose Response Strategy.  
-   **The North Carolina Council of Churches (NCCC)** hosts a Partners
    in Health and Wholeness initiative that works to bridge the issues
    of faith, health, and justice. This includes the Overdose Response
    program that offers opioid workshops to faith communities that seek
    to learn more about the opioid crisis and how they can help with
    response, and incorporates naloxone distribution upon request. They
    also received grant funding to provide local churches with resources
    for opioid-related initiatives for their members.   
-   **The Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington (RAMW)** has
    more than 1,400 businesses in its membership, including restaurants,
    food and hospitality vendors, and allied business<u>es</u> that work
    within the food industry in DC, Northern Virginia, and Suburban
    Maryland. RAMW began partnering with the DC Department of Behavioral
    Health (DBH) to provide overdose education and naloxone distribution
    to restaurants in DC, including large trainings for business
    improvement districts. Restaurants can order a kit to receive by
    mail from [RAMW’s
    website](https://www.healthsupportnow.org/naloxonetoolkit).  
-   **The San Francisco Entertainment Commission** is partnering with
    the San Francisco Department of Public Health to raise awareness
    about the presence of illicit fentanyl at and around nightlife
    spaces, and increase the entertainment industry’s access to
    life-saving naloxone. To date, they have led in-person trainings for
    staff at 18 nightlife businesses in San Francisco, distributed 300+
    doses of naloxone at outreach events, and reached approximately 900
    nightlife attendees through on-stage overdose prevention trainings
    before performances and other events.  
-   **This Must Be the Place** is a nonprofit providing free naloxone to
    attendees at music venues and festivals across the country. They
    committed to passing out over 60,000 free kits of naloxone at places
    like Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and Dreamville.
    Seventy percent of the population they reach are receiving naloxone
    for the first time.  
-   **United Airlines** equips each of its enhanced medical kits on
    every aircraft and station across the network with opioid overdose
    reversal medications. All of United’s 28,000+ flight attendants are
    annually trained in the proper use of these life-saving medications.
    Over the past five years, United has purchased nearly 1,200 units
    annually, ensuring greater safety for both passengers and crew,
    including flight attendants and pilots.  
-   **The University of Rhode Island (URI)**, through its Cooperative
    Extension program, established the Community First Responder Program
    (CFRP). CFRP provides more than 50,000 kits annually. CFRP offers
    in-person and online educational trainings for the public at schools
    and town halls, and to healthcare providers, first responders,
    police, and more. They also distribute naloxone and safer-use kits
    at events in partnership with CVS Health and the U.S. Postal
    Service. CFRP has expanded services to rural regions of five other
    New England states through a grant from the Substance Abuse and
    Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). CFRP is expanding
    its regional rural overdose education via collaborations with New
    Hampshire Cooperative Extension, Husson University School of
    Pharmacy (Maine), University of Maine Cooperative Extension, Western
    New England University College of Pharmacy (Massachusetts), and
    University of Vermont Cooperative Extension. As naloxone is often
    inaccessible to New England’s rural regions, CFRP offers to mail
    no-cost naloxone to participants completing its online interactive
    module, “Become a Community First Responder.”

In support of President Biden and Vice President Harris’
whole-of-government approach to address the overdose epidemic, federal
agencies are working to help expand access to life-saving opioid
overdose reversal medications like naloxone and save even more lives.
These efforts also align with updated [Guidelines for Safety Station
Programs in Federal
Facilities](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/22/2023-28207/guidelines-for-safety-station-programs-in-federal-facilities)[released
in December
2023](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/12/21/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-increase-naloxone-access-federal-facilities-across-nation.html):

-   **The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)** has
    authorized first responders in its Office of Safety, Security and
    Personnel and throughout the U.S. Forest Service who are equipped
    and trained in the administration of opioid overdose reversal
    medications (OORM).  Additionally, USDA’s Center for Faith-Based and
    Neighborhood Partnerships has provided OORM trainings to over 40
    community partners across 15 states as part of its Rural and Farming
    Communities Mental Health and Suicide Prevention work. USDA remains
    committed to continuing and expanding the reach of these
    trainings.  
-   **The Department of Commerce**‘s Office of Export Enforcement (OEE)
    is training Special Agents in the use of opioid overdose reversal
    medications (OORM) in October 2024, allowing OEE Special Agents to
    safely and effectively deploy them. OEE will have OORM accessible
    during all preplanned enforcement operations by January 2025.   
-   **The Department of Defense (DoD)** is committed to opioid safety
    and prevention of overdose. To strengthen DoD’s emergency response
    protocols, naloxone is available across installations in the
    Continental United States and training programs have been expanded,
    ensuring first responders are equipped and trained. The DoD remains
    committed to the safety and prevention of overdose by continuing its
    efforts to provide naloxone access to DoD first responders and
    investigators and to provide associated trainings beyond DoD first
    responders.  
-   **The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS)** is
    increasing training on and access to naloxone. The Indian Health
    Service (IHS) now mandates annual overdose response training for all
    IHS employees, contractors, students, and volunteers. Further,
    before 2025, naloxone training and a guide on procuring naloxone
    (i.e., using state standing orders, city and county public health
    departments, etc.) will be available to all U.S. Public Health
    Service Commissioned Corps officers, and naloxone will be available
    in safety stations at all HHS regional offices. Substance Abuse and
    Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in partnership with
    the Program Support Center (PSC) and the Office of the Assistant
    Secretary of Health (OASH), will equip all AED stations in its
    headquarters with naloxone, and SAMHSA hosted an annual naloxone
    training for all staff as part of its International Overdose
    Awareness Day recognition. Additionally, naloxone training will be
    added to the HHS Learning Management System available to all HHS
    personnel, including volunteer Federal Civilian Responders.  
-   **The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** issued, and recently
    updated, a policy regarding the *Administration of Naloxone by
    Non-Healthcare Providers*. This policy directs DHS agencies and
    offices to identify their workforce populations at higher risk of
    exposure and develop a program to equip them with both naloxone and
    the training to use it.  The DHS Office of Health Security (OHS)
    developed virtual and in-person training modules that DHS agencies
    and offices can use to train their non-healthcare providers or as
    the basis for developing their own workforce-specific training. DHS
    continues to work to operationalize formal programs that equip
    non-healthcare providers with Component-procured naloxone.  
-   **The Department of the Interior (DOI)** has issued guidance on the
    training, carrying, and use of naloxone by DOI employees who may
    come into contact with persons suspected of opioid overdose during
    their normal course of duties. The guidance allows critical first
    responders – including emergency medical responders and emergency
    medical technicians (EMR/EMT), firefighter EMTs, and law enforcement
    officers – to have access to opioid overdose reversal medications at
    various sites nationwide, including national parks and tribal lands.
    As DOI components continue to conduct risk assessments to identify
    high-risk areas and appropriate personnel to be trained, the
    Department is poised to implement vital resources efficiently to
    preserve life and protect the public.  
-   **The Department of Justice (DOJ) **has enacted policies so
    employees most likely to encounter overdose victims have access to
    opioid overdose reversal medications (OORM) and the training to
    safely and effectively deploy them. Pursuant to these policies, its
    law enforcement agencies – Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and
    Explosives (ATF), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal
    Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and U.S. Marshals Service – will have
    OORM accessible during all preplanned enforcement operations; all
    Federal Bureau of Prisons staff at all sites will have access to
    OORM 24 hours a day; and all DOJ public-facing facilities and law
    enforcement facilities will have safety stations equipped with
    OORM.  
-   **The United States Postal Service (USPS)** has trained 59,000
    employees in 1,318 facilities in U.S. counties facing high numbers
    of overdose deaths in response to the *White House Challenge to Save
    Lives from Overdose*. Also, USPS has procured and distributed
    naloxone to first aid kits in these facilities. As the USPS
    continues it communication activities on overdose prevention, it
    expects to reach over 500,000 employees, many of whom have
    public-facing roles as part of the Postal Service’s ubiquitous
    footprint across the United States.   
-   **The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)** is working to make
    training available to all employees by December 2024 and will
    develop and issue a policy statement to support naloxone
    implementation by March 2025. VA also pledges to ensure opioid
    overdose reversal medications are available in all high-risk
    Veterans Health Administration health care areas, including at VA
    Medical Centers and outpatient clinics, and in all Vet Centers by
    the end of 2025.
