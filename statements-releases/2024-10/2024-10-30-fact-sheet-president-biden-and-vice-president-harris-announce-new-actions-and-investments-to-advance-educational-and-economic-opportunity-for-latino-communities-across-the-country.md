Today, President Biden will ceremonially sign [Executive Order (EO)
14124](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/07/17/executive-order-on-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through-hispanic-serving-institutions/),
establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity,
Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs), alongside nearly two dozen champions for these
institutions and Latino communities. President Biden and Vice President
Harris will also announce nearly $19 million in transformational
investments for five HSIs in Florida, Illinois, Texas, and Puerto Rico
to build research infrastructure. These efforts build on the
Administration’s historic investment of over $16 billion in more than
500 HSIs across 30 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico
that educate more than 4.7 million students annually.

Over the past three years, President Biden and Vice President Harris
have taken historic actions to expand opportunity for Latino families
and communities, including: creating more than 15 million jobs – with 5
million created for Latinos, helping Latino entrepreneurs start new
businesses at the fastest rate in over 10 years, addressing our broken
immigration system, and working to ensure equitable educational
opportunity for students.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to
advance educational opportunities for students at HSIs and giving them a
fair shot at achieving the American dream. 

**<u>Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity
through HSIs</u>**

With student enrollment that is at least one-quarter Latino, HSIs are
engines of economic mobility, propelling high numbers of students from
low-income backgrounds and first-generation college students into good
jobs and brighter futures. **Today, President Biden will ceremonially
sign EO 14124 to strengthen the Federal Government’s commitment to
advancing opportunity for HSIs and the students they serve.**

The EO creates a new Initiative and first-ever President’s Board of
Advisors on HSIs to:

-   Increase awareness of opportunities for HSIs to equally participate
    in Federal programs and enhance the capacity of HSIs to meet the
    educational needs of their students.
-   Identify best practices for HSIs to scale effective strategies,
    programs, and initiatives to support the educational success and
    economic mobility of their students.
-   Improve the ability of HSIs to align program offerings with the
    economic needs of the Nation and their local economies, especially
    in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and teaching.
-   Coordinate efforts to help HSIs become or remain fiscally secure
    institutions.
-   Foster cross-sector collaboration among HSIs and philanthropic,
    public, and private sector organizations.
-   Strengthen Federal recruitment activities at HSIs to build
    accessible and equal pathways into Federal career opportunities for
    HSI students, faculty, staff, and alumni.
-   Provide tools, data, and analytics to support HSIs in improving
    educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for
    students.

**<u>Investing Additional $19 Million in Research Infrastructure at
HSIs</u>**

To remain the most competitive economy in the world, the Nation’s most
inclusive institutions of higher education must continue to lead in
research and development. Yet too many HSIs
[report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/d24106162.pdf) having unmet
infrastructure needs that hold back their ability to engage in research
that will propel forward these institutions, their students, and the
nation as a whole.

To help address these needs, the Biden-Harris Administration established
the Department of Education’s Research and Development Infrastructure
Program (RDI) for the colleges and universities that play a central role
in educating students from diverse backgrounds. The program provides
funds to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribally
Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), and Minority Serving
Institutions (MSIs)—including HSIs— to implement transformational
investments in research infrastructure, including research productivity,
faculty expertise, graduate programs, physical infrastructure, human
capital development, and partnerships leading to increases in external
funding.

**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced nearly $19 million in
new grants to five HSIs to build their research and physical
infrastructure including—**

-   Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida received $1.1
    million.
-   National Louis University in Chicago, Illinois received $3 million.
-   Sam Houston State University in Houston, Texas received $5 million.
-   Texas A&M University Corpus Christi in Corpus Christi, Texas
    received $4.7 million.
-   University of Puerto Rico on the Rio Piedras Campus received $5
    million.

The $19 million in grants to HSIs was a part of $49 million in RDI
grants to 13 HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs.

**<u>Building on Historic Investments in HSIs</u>**

Today’s announcements build on President Biden and Vice President
Harris’ historic investments of over $16 billion in direct funding to
HSIs, including through COVID relief funds and the Department of
Education’s federal grant program funds.
