Jill and I extend our heartfelt congratulations to President Claudia
Sheinbaum on her inauguration.  As a symbol of our respect and the
friendship between our two nations, our First Lady is leading the
Delegation to President Sheinbaum’s inauguration, along with many senior
leaders from my administration. Jill and I wish President Sheinbaum a
joyful celebration and a very successful presidency, and we congratulate
the people of Mexico on the historic inauguration of their first woman
president.  

Mexico and the United States are strong partners and close neighbors and
we share deep political, economic, and cultural ties.  The United States
is committed to continuing to work with Mexico to deliver the
democratic, prosperous, and secure future that the people of our two
countries deserve.
