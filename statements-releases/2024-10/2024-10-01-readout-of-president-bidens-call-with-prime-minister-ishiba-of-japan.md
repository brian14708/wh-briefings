President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. called Ishiba Shigeru today to
congratulate him on his election by the Diet to become Prime Minister of
Japan. The President underscored that the U.S.-Japan Alliance has served
as the cornerstone of regional peace and prosperity for over seven
decades and rose to new heights under former Prime Minister Kishida. The
President said he looked forward to working closely with Prime Minister
Ishiba to continue deepening the U.S.-Japan global partnership across
the full range of security, economic, technology, and diplomatic issues.

The two leaders noted that the American and Japanese people share deeply
rooted values and principles, including a commitment to uphold a global
order that is free, open, secure, and prosperous. The President and
Prime Minister reaffirmed their resolve to continue strengthening
defense cooperation and to maintain peace and stability across the
region. They also underscored their commitment to enhance regional
cooperation through a latticework of likeminded partners, including
cooperation with Australia and India through the Quad and through
trilateral partnerships with the Republic of Korea and the Philippines.
