title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on ILA and USMX\_Agreement"
---
 
Tonight the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) and the
United States Maritime Alliance came together to reach a tentative
agreement that reopens the East Coast and Gulf ports, and I want to
applaud all involved for their efforts. This step indicates progress
toward a strong contract and represents the power of collective
bargaining. As I have said, this is about fairness – and our economy
works best when workers share in record profits. Dockworkers deserve a
fair share for their hard work getting essential goods out to
communities across America.
