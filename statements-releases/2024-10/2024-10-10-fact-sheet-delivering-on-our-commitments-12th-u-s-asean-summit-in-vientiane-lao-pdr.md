The Biden-Harris Administration has worked to strengthen our ties with
ASEAN and deliver on our commitments to the region. Over the past three
and a half years, we have pursued an unprecedented expansion in the
breadth and depth of U.S.-ASEAN relations, including upgrading our
relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and
institutionalizing cooperation in five new areas—health, transportation,
women’s empowerment, environment and climate, and energy—as well as
deepening our cooperation in foreign affairs, economics, technology, and
defense. To date, we have made significant progress in fulfilling 98.37
percent of our commitments in the ASEAN-U.S. Plan of Action (2022-2025)
and its Annex. The United States will continue working with ASEAN,
including through ASEAN-led mechanisms, to build an open, inclusive,
transparent, resilient, and rules-based regional architecture in which
ASEAN is its center.  
   
**DELIVERING ON OUR COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP  
**  
This year, the United States and ASEAN are celebrating 47 years of
U.S.-ASEAN relations. President Biden and Vice President Harris remain
committed to ASEAN centrality and supporting the ASEAN Outlook on the
Indo-Pacific, which shares fundamental principles with the U.S.
Indo-Pacific Strategy. ASEAN is at the heart of the U.S. approach to the
Indo-Pacific, as reflected in numerous U.S. initiatives to promote
economic prosperity and regional stability. Through the U.S.-ASEAN
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the United States has demonstrated
that we are a reliable and enduring partner for our combined one billion
people. Key U.S.-ASEAN accomplishments under the Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership include:

-   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) extended the
    U.S.-ASEAN Regional Development Cooperation Agreement to 2029
    enabling the launch of the new five-year ASEAN USAID Partnership
    Program in March 2024. 
-   The United States plans to conduct a second U.S.-ASEAN maritime
    exercise in 2025, co-hosted by Indonesia. U.S. and ASEAN Member
    States’ navies will exercise communication, information sharing, and
    the implementation of maritime security protocols in accordance with
    international law.
-   In August 2024, the United States and ASEAN agreed to formalize
    U.S.-ASEAN health cooperation, elevating our engagement to a
    biennial U.S.-ASEAN Health Ministers Dialogue. USAID also officially
    launched the U.S.-ASEAN-Airborne Infection Defense Platform to
    bolster the region’s tuberculosis response capacity.
-   The United States is launching a cybersecurity training program for
    the ASEAN Secretariat that will enhance the cybersecurity awareness,
    knowledge, and skills of our partners who are the backbone of ASEAN
    institutions.  
-   At the third U.S.-ASEAN High-Level Dialogue on Environment and
    Climate this year, the United States unveiled the U.S.-ASEAN Climate
    Solutions Hub to help ASEAN members states develop and implement
    their contributions under the Paris Agreement.
-   In 2023, the United States and ASEAN held the inaugural Dialogue on
    the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to advance human rights for
    persons with disabilities across Southeast Asia, including working
    with private sector to find ways to support accessibility across
    Southeast Asia.

As a reflection of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership reaching its
full potential, the United States and ASEAN celebrated the launch of the
**U.S.-ASEAN Center** in Washington, DC in December 2023. The Center has
already hosted several high-profile ASEAN-related events and is on track
to become the key hub for ASEAN’s engagement with the United States.

-   In June 2024, the Center hosted the Secretary-General of ASEAN, Dr.
    Kao Kim Hourn, for his first working visit to the United States,
    where he launched a speaker series.
-   In August 2024, the Center hosted an ASEAN Day celebration,
    showcasing a wide array of cultural activities from ASEAN Member
    States.
-   The Center is also partnering with the Antiquities Coalition to host
    a Cultural Property Agreement workshop.

The **U.S.-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership (USASCP)** is a key mechanism
for our engagement on innovating sustainable cities of the future. Since
it was launched in 2018, USASCP has invested more than $19 million in
over 20 projects across urban sectors throughout the region. USASCP
tackles the varied challenges of rapid urbanization, including
accelerating climate action and promoting sustainable urban services.

-   In 2024, the USASCP Smart Cities Business Innovation Fund 2.0 will
    grant $3 million for net-zero urban innovation projects to
    strengthen private sector investment in sustainability and climate
    action across the ASEAN region.
-   In 2022, the Smart Cities Business Innovation Fund 1.0 granted a
    total of $1 million to six awardees across the region, including a
    solar panel recycling facility in Da Nang Vietnam and a
    seaweed/bioplastics manufacturer in Tangerang Indonesia.
-   The United States paired municipal water and wastewater facility
    operators from five cities across the United States and the ASEAN
    Smart Cities Network to share their expertise.

This year marks the **Young Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative’s
(YSEALI)** second decade of building youth leadership capabilities
across Southeast Asia to promote cross-border cooperation on regional
and global challenges. YSEALI’s 160,000 strong digital network and 6,000
plus alumni community is creating new opportunities for its members to
shape YSEALI’s next 10 years of impact. The State Department is well on
its way to doubling the number of Southeast Asian youth participating in
the YSEALI Academic and Professional Fellowships by 2025, in line with
the commitments laid out by President Biden and Vice President Harris
during the May 2022 U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.

-   The United States has invested over $1.8 million to empower nearly
    500 young women as part of the YSEALI Women’s Leadership Academy
    (WLA). In celebration of the WLA’s 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the
    U.S. Mission to ASEAN granted $44,000 to alumni groups to foster
    collaboration and find innovative ways to close the gender
    leadership gap.
-   The YSEALI Seeds for the Future Program—a grant program intended to
    support innovative initiatives in Southeast Asia—has provided nearly
    $3 million for more than 500 young leaders to carry out projects
    that improve their communities.
-   The Department of State’s YSEALI Alumni Engagement Innovation Fund
    supported 16 YSEALI alumni-led public service projects in 2024. 

**ENHANCING CONNECTIVITY AND RESILIENCE  
**  
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to build greater connectivity
with ASEAN and enhancing regional resilience to bolster economic
development and integration. The United States is ASEAN’s number one
source of foreign direct investment, and U.S. goods and services trade
totaled an estimated $500 billion in 2023. Since 2002, the United States
has provided more than $14.7 billion in economic, health, and security
assistance to Southeast Asian allies and partners. During that same
period, the United States provided nearly $1.9 billion in humanitarian
assistance, including life-saving disaster assistance, emergency food
aid, and support to refugees throughout the region. As a durable and
reliable partner of ASEAN, the United States supports the governments
and people of Southeast Asia in enhancing the region’s connectivity and
resilience. In addition to U.S. companies’ substantial investments, the
United States is cooperating with the private sector to equip the
region’s workforce with the skills needed to succeed in Southeast Asia’s
burgeoning digital economy. Other key U.S. initiatives supporting this
effort include:

-   USAID announces $2 million of new funding to support the sustainable
    development of critical minerals, supporting ASEAN’s goal of raising
    environmental, social, and governance standards for mineral sector
    development.

-   Through the Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership (JUMPP), the U.S.
    Department of State has implemented over 60 technical assistance
    activities to strengthen national power sectors and regional
    electricity market, enhancing the clean energy export potential of
    Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam to the ASEAN market. 
-   The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is supporting a feasibility
    study to develop two cross-border interconnections, further
    expanding our longstanding support to connect the ASEAN Power Grid.
-   USAID is expanding cooperation with the ASEAN Center for Energy to
    support private sector and multilateral development bank investment
    to operationalize regional connectivity through the ASEAN Power
    Grid.
-   Through the ASEAN Digital Ministers’ Meeting and Digital Senior
    Officials’ Meeting, we are intensifying our cooperation on trusted
    information and communications technology infrastructure – including
    undersea cables, cloud computing, and wireless networks, artificial
    intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and combatting online scams.
-   The United States supported development of the ASEAN Responsible AI
    Roadmap and provided AI technical assistance for the Digital Economy
    Framework Agreement. Our collective effort ensures ASEAN can foster
    an inclusive environment where affirmative, safe, secure, and
    trustworthy AI innovation can flourish.
-   Under the U.S.-ASEAN Connect framework, the U.S. Mission to ASEAN is
    leveraging the U.S. government and private sector expertise to
    advance economic engagement, including through workshops covering
    topics such as best practices to strengthen cybersecurity and how to
    harness digital technologies.

Over the past three and a half years, the Biden-Harris Administration
has also spurred investment and economic growth through the advancement
of over $1.4 billion in private sector investments in the ASEAN region.
This past year alone, the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation (DFC) has invested over $341 million in ASEAN markets. To
further our cooperation and support, DFC has announced that it will open
new offices in Vietnam and the Philippines to source more opportunities
and further advance private sector investment. DFC’s key initiatives and
investments have included:

-   Loaning up to $126 million loan to power company PT Medco Cahaya
    Geothermal to strengthen Indonesia’s energy security.
-   Initiating DFC’s first investment in Lao PDR with a $4 million loan
    portfolio guarantee to Phongsavanh Bank, which will work with
    Village Funds to give farmers financing to scale their businesses,
    increase their incomes, and improve their livelihoods.
-   Initiating DFC’s first investment in East Timor with a $3 million
    loan to microfinance institution Kaebauk Investimentu No Finansas,
    which will provide financing to small businesses, especially rural
    and unbanked ones.

We look forward to continue advancing our Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership with ASEAN in 2025 by formulating a new plan of action to
guide the next five years of our enduring partnership as we work to
further the prosperity of our combined one billion people.
