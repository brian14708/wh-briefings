President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine to discuss U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense
against Russian aggression. President Biden updated President Zelenskyy
on his efforts to surge security assistance to Ukraine over the
remainder of his term in office. Today, the President announced a $425
million security assistance package for Ukraine that includes additional
air defense capability, air-to-ground munitions, armored vehicles, and
critical munitions to meet Ukraine’s urgent needs. In the coming months,
the United States will provide Ukraine with a range of additional
capabilities, including hundreds of air defense interceptors, dozens of
tactical air defense systems, additional artillery systems, significant
quantities of ammunition, hundreds of armored personnel carriers and
infantry fighting vehicles, and thousands of additional armored
vehicles, all of which will help to equip Ukraine’s armed forces.
President Zelenskyy updated President Biden on his plan to achieve
victory over Russia, and the two leaders tasked their teams to engage in
further consultations on next steps.

The leaders committed to intensify security assistance planning
alongside international partners in order to ensure that Ukraine has the
equipment it needs to prevail. As part of this effort, in November 2024,
President Biden will host a virtual leader-level meeting of the Ukraine
Defense Contact Group, where the leaders will coordinate with
international partners on additional assistance for Ukraine.
