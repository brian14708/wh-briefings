  \ the Republic of Mauritius and the United Kingdom on the Status of the Chagos\_\
  Archipelago"

I applaud the historic agreement and conclusion of the negotiations
between the Republic of Mauritius and the United Kingdom on the status
of the Chagos Archipelago. It is a clear demonstration that through
diplomacy and partnership, countries can overcome long-standing
historical challenges to reach peaceful and mutually beneficial
outcomes. This agreement affirms Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos
Archipelago, while granting the United Kingdom the authority to exercise
the sovereign rights of Mauritius with respect to Diego Garcia. 

Diego Garcia is the site of a joint U.S.-UK military facility that plays
a vital role in national, regional, and global security. It enables the
United States to support operations that demonstrate our shared
commitment to regional stability, provide rapid response to crises, and
counter some of the most challenging security threats we face. The
agreement secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego
Garcia into the next century.

We look forward to continuing our strong partnership with Mauritius and
the United Kingdom in upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific.
