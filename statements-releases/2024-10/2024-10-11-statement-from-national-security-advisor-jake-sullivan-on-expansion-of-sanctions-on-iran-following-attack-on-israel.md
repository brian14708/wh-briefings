title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Expansion of Sanctions\
  \ on Iran Following Attack on\_Israel"
---
 
On October 1, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Israel. 
This attack targeted Israel’s most populated city, Tel Aviv, and could
have killed hundreds if not thousands of innocent people.  Fortunately,
the attack was defeated and rendered ineffective thanks to the U.S.
military working in partnership with Israeli Defense Forces.  Following
that reckless attack, we made clear that Iran would face severe
consequences.  We have since consulted with allies and partners,
including a call between the President and his G7 counterparts, and
today the Departments of the Treasury and State have announced new and
significant measures to more effectively target Iran’s energy trade. 
The new designations today also include measures against the “Ghost
Fleet” that carries Iran’s illicit oil to buyers around the world. These
measures will help further deny Iran financial resources used to support
its missile programs and provide support for terrorist groups that
threaten the United States, its allies, and partners.  

President Biden has consistently confronted Iran‘s destabilizing actions
and will continue to do so.  Under the Biden-Harris administration, the
United States has not lifted a single sanction on Iran and has
designated over 700 individuals and entities connected to the full range
of Iran’s destabilizing activities and support for terrorism across the
Middle East and globally.  Today’s announcement has been coordinated
with allies and partners, many of whom will announce their own measures
to hold Iran accountable for its attack over the coming days.
