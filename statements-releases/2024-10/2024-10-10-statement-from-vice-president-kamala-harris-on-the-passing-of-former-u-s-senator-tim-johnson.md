title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Former U.S.\
  \ Senator Tim\_Johnson"
---
 
Senator Tim Johnson was a tenacious fighter for the people of South
Dakota.  
   
Throughout his career—as a member of the South Dakota legislature, as
the state’s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives,
and as a U.S. Senator—he brokered compromise and advanced commonsense
solutions that improved the lives of South Dakotans and all Americans.  
   
Senator Johnson secured support for critical water infrastructure that
delivered clean water to communities across South Dakota, including
Native reservations and rural communities across the state. He played a
vital role in passing the Affordable Care Act, which delivered
high-quality, affordable health care to millions of Americans, including
tens of thousands of South Dakotans. And as Chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, he championed community banks and housing finance
reforms to help ensure that rural communities across the nation have the
support they need to access safe and affordable housing.  
   
His life and legacy will be felt by generations of South Dakotans and
all Americans to come. Doug and I send our prayers to his wife, Barbara,
and the entire Johnson family.
