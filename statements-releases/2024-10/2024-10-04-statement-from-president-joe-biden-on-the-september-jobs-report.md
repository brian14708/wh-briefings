title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the September Jobs\_Report"
---
 
Today, we received good news for American workers and families with more
than 250,000 new jobs in September and unemployment back down at 4.1%. 
With today’s report, we’ve created 16 million jobs, unemployment remains
low, and wages are growing faster than prices. Under my Administration,
unemployment has been the lowest in 50 years, a record 19 million new
businesses have been created, and inflation and interest rates are
falling. And we’re seeing the power of collective bargaining to lift up
workers’ wages—including the progress made by dockworkers on record
wages with carriers, and port operators and the reopening of East Coast
and Gulf ports.

Make no mistake: We have more to do to lower costs and expand
opportunity. Congress should pass our plan to build millions of new
homes, expand prescription drug price caps, empower workers and protect
the right to organize, and cut taxes for hardworking families.
Congressional Republicans have a different plan—more giant tax cuts for
billionaires and big corporations, ending the Affordable Care Act,
undermining workers by cutting overtime and making it harder to
organize, and imposing a national sales tax that would raise costs by
nearly $4,000 per year. While they put billionaires first, we’ll keep
fighting to grow the middle class.
