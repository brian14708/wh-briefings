title: "Interested Parties Memo: Fighting Hurricane Helene Falsehoods with\_Facts"
---
 
*Senior Advisor to the President and Communications Director Ben LaBolt,
and Director of Digital Strategy Christian Tom*

Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s direction, the
Administration has mobilized a [robust, intensive, and
whole-of-government
effort](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/02/fact-sheet-update-biden-harris-continues-life-saving-response-efforts-in-response-to-hurricane-helene/)
to respond to the impacts of Hurricane Helene. This includes extensive
pre-landfall preparations, as well as an immediate surge of additional
resources and personnel to impacted communities. More than 6,400 Federal
personnel are on the ground, and more than $110 million in Federal
assistance has been given to survivors, with more to come. We are
sparing no resource as we work to ensure communities across the
Southeast have prompt access to Federal resources that will enable them
to both purchase essential items and begin their road to recovery and
rebuilding.

Unfortunately, as our response and recovery efforts continue, we have
seen a large increase in [false information circulating online related
to the federal response to Hurricane
Helene](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response).
A number of scam artists, bad-faith actors, and others who want to sow
chaos because they think it helps their political interests are
promoting disinformation about the recovery effort, including ways to
access critical and live-saving resources. This is wrong, dangerous, and
it must stop immediately.

Combatting misinformation and disinformation is always important – but
it is especially important when responding to disasters like Hurricane
Helene. **<u>In fact, disinformation after a hurricane or other natural
disaster can discourage people from seeking critical assistance when
they need it most.</u>** It is imperative that we encourage impacted
residents to register for FEMA assistance, *not* *discourage it*, by
allowing falsehoods to spread.

Leaders from across the country, including local, state, and federal
elected officials in both parties, are pleading with people to stop
sharing “this junk.”

    junk’](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/misinformation-hurricane-helene/index.html)

    donation
    rumors](https://www.wvlt.tv/2024/10/03/lot-misinformation-gov-lee-fema-address-donation-rumors/)

Here are some of the falsehoods being spread online – and the facts we
are fighting back with:

**<u>FALSEHOOD: Disaster relief funds were used on immigrants in the
U.S. illegally.</u>**

FACT: No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None.
FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded
through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster
efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other,
non-disaster related efforts.

1.  **Washington Post**: [No, Biden didn’t take FEMA relief money to use
    on migrants — but Trump
    did](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/04/no-biden-didnt-take-fema-relief-money-use-migrants-trump-did/)
2.  **NBC News:** [False claims about FEMA disaster funds and migrants
    pushed by
    Trump](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/false-claims-fema-disaster-funds-migrants-pushed-trump-rcna173955)
3.  CNN: [‘This is FALSE’: White House responds to Trump’s FEMA disaster
    relief
    claims](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/video/white-house-response-donald-trump-biden-harris-fema-digvid)

**<u>FALSEHOOD: FEMA is in the process of confiscating Helene survivor
property. If I apply for disaster assistance and my land is deemed
unlivable, my property will be seized.</u>**

**FACT**: FEMA cannot seize your property or land. Applying for disaster
assistance does not grant FEMA or the federal government authority or
ownership of your property or land.

1.  **Verify**: [No, the government isn’t seizing land in Chimney Rock,
    N.C., and bulldozing the
    town](https://www.verifythis.com/article/news/verify/extreme-weather-verify/chimney-rock-north-carolina-land-seized-bulldozing-claims-false/536-0456b5a1-a174-460f-841c-62cd7939f9f9)

**<u>FALSEHOOD: FEMA will only provide $750 to disaster survivors to
support their recovery.</u>**

**FACT**: This is a type of assistance that you may be approved for soon
after you apply, called Serious Needs Assistance. It is an upfront,
flexible payment to help cover essential items like food, water, baby
formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency
supplies. There are other forms of assistance that you may qualify for
to receive, and Serious Needs Assistance is an initial payment you may
receive while FEMA assesses your eligibility for additional funds. $750
is what is immediately available to eligible survivors. In addition,
survivors may qualify for more FEMA financial assistance, including to
repair storm-related damage to homes and property, find a temporary
place to stay, and receive compensation for lost crops and livestock.

-   **Verify**: [No, FEMA isn’t giving people impacted by Hurricane
    Helene just
    $750](https://www.verifythis.com/article/news/verify/extreme-weather-verify/fema-hurricane-helene-money-750-dollars-fact-check/536-a21cad25-00c2-4386-a3a4-c5bebf4e9327)

**<u>FALSEHOOD: FEMA and the FAA are restricting air space in North
Carolina, preventing private citizens from delivery relief.</u>**

**FACT**: There are no airspace restrictions in place in North Carolina
as rescue efforts continue because of Hurricane Helene. Pilots looking
to come into Asheville or Rutherford airports need to reach out to the
airport for permission to land. The FAA is working with local
authorities to ensure rescue efforts happen safely.

-   **Secretary Buttigieg**: [No one is shutting down the airspace and
    FAA doesn’t block legitimate rescue and recovery
    flights.](https://x.com/SecretaryPete/status/1842271678274928964)
-   **NC Aviation:** [With a **300% increase in traffic over Western
    NC**, Prior Permission Required is now in place at select airports
    to ensure safe skies and sustainable
    operations.](https://x.com/NCAviation/status/1842193607681528227)

The Biden-Harris Administration continues to work via the official White
House digital channels to inform the public of the response and recovery
efforts to dispel the misinformation being shared, with higher volume on
X than other platforms. Updates will continue to be shared about the
volume and scope of federal aid being delivered.

The Biden- Harris Administration is also engaging trusted online
publishers and influencers to connect with FEMA as a way to meet people
where they are and provide them with accurate information. One example
of this partnership includes **MeidasTouch:** [Trump lies instantly
debunked by FEMA
spokesperson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_CQ879SLI8). This digital
video resulted in reach across both digital and traditional media,
including a [local Alabama
newspaper](https://www.al.com/news/2024/10/hurricane-helene-disaster-relief-supplies-not-being-confiscated-despite-social-media-rumors.html)
combatting misinformation.

In addition, the White House will leverage our opt-in SMS messaging
platform to share messages to those in affected areas. SMS is a more
resilient form of communication where data connectivity might still be
recovering, and this is a further example of using all parts of digital
communications to reach people who need information and assistance.
