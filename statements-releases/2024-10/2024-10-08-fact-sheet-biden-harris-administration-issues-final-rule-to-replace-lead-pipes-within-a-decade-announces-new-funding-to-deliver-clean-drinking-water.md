title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Issues Final Rule to Replace\
  \ Lead Pipes Within a Decade, Announces New Funding to Deliver Clean Drinking\_\
  Water"
---
 
*Since President Biden Took Office, Over 367,000 Lead Pipes Have Been
Replaced Nationwide, Benefitting 918,000 People*

President Biden and Vice President Harris are fighting to ensure a
future where every community has access to clean, safe water. Since Day
One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to ensure that every
American can turn on their tap and drink clean water without fear of
lead and other toxic chemicals. As part of this historic commitment to
clean water and environmental justice, President Biden committed to
replace every lead pipe in the country within 10 years, issuing a
comprehensive [Lead Pipe and Paint Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/)
to achieve that goal.

Today, to deliver on this promise, President Biden is traveling to
**Milwaukee, Wisconsin**, to announce that the Environmental Protection
Agency is **issuing a final rule that will require drinking water
systems nationwide to replace lead service lines within 10 years. EPA is
also investing an additional $2.6 billion for drinking water upgrades
and lead pipe replacements, funded by President Biden’s landmark
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. ** This announcement comes as part of the
President’s commitment to spend his remaining months in office
“sprinting to the finish” and delivering on his historic Investing in
America agenda, which is improving the lives of Americans and planting
the seeds for a better, more prosperous future for decades to come.

In its first year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that it
would develop this new rule, known as the Lead and Copper Rule
Improvements, to establish the first-ever national requirement to
replace all lead service lines. Since then, President Biden secured a
historic $15 billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe replacement, and
hundreds of thousands of Americans have already had their lead pipes
replaced. Because of the President’s actions today, millions more will
benefit from lead-free infrastructure in the years to come.

Lead poisoning can cause serious health effects, especially in children.
It can cause irreversible damage to cognitive development, damage the
kidneys, slow learning, and cause cardiovascular disease. Lead exposure
can also impact pregnancies, increasing the risk of low birthweights or
even miscarriage. No level of lead exposure is safe. Yet, due to decades
of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment, lead
poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and
communities of color.

Today’s announcement will help protect Americans in communities across
the country from these harms – the EPA estimates that every year, this
final rule will prevent up to 900,000 infants from being born with low
birthweight, stop up to 200,000 IQ points lost in children, and reduce
up to 1,500 cases of premature death from heart disease.

To build on these commitments, today, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development is investing over $420 million in new grants,
prioritizing lead hazard reduction to protect children, alongside
efforts to improve home health, energy efficiency, and community safety.
HUD will provide funding to address lead-based paints in homes, develop
training and partnerships to identify and control lead-based paint
hazards, coordinate home inspections and more.

**Replacing Lead Pipes in Milwaukee**

Lead pipe replacement is actively underway in Milwaukee through a $30
million investment provided by President Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has
accelerated Milwaukee’s lead replacement timeline from 60 years down to
10 years.** Milwaukee is replacing lead pipes using union labor and
prioritizing replacements in disadvantaged communities with the most
need. The city is now a leader in the region, partnering with cities
like Detroit in the [Great Lakes Lead Pipes
Partnership](https://glslcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04.23.24_White-House-Water-Summit-2.pdf)
to accelerate lead pipe replacement across the Midwest.

**Progress Replacing Lead Pipes Across America**

Beyond Milwaukee, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to
accelerate lead pipe replacement nationwide. President Biden secured a
historic **$15 billion in dedicated funding through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law for lead pipe replacement,** and an additional $11.7
billion that can be used for both drinking water projects and lead pipe
replacement. Nearly half of this funding is required to flow to
disadvantaged communities, including in neighborhoods and communities
that shoulder most of the burden of lead poisoning. In addition to
providing clean drinking water for millions, this effort is also
creating good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs, in replacing lead
pipes and delivering clean water to households. This effort also
advances the President’s [Justice40
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal
investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by
underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.

**These actions from the Administration have already put cities across
the country on track to meet the President’s goal of replacing every
lead pipe within a decade:**

-   **Detroit, Michigan**, has received $90 million from this
    Administration for lead pipe replacement, which has allowed the city
    to accelerate from replacing 700 lead pipes per year to replacing
    over 8,000 this year. Detroit is now on track to replace all 80,000
    lead pipes within 10 years.
-   **Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**, has received $98 million from the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan to replace
    lead pipes, and is on track to replace every lead pipe by 2026. The
    city is already over halfway done with this work.
-   **St. Paul, Minnesota**, received $16 million from the American
    Rescue Plan to enable the city’s Lead-Free St. Paul program to
    target the replacement of all lead pipes by 2032.
-   **Denver, Colorado** has accelerated its efforts through $76 million
    from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, allowing the city to be on
    track to replace all lead pipes within a decade.
-   **Akron, Ohio** is now on track to replace all lead service lines by
    2027 thanks to $9 million in funding through the American Rescue
    Plan.
-   And some communities have already finished replacing lead pipes.
    Following a lead-in-water crisis, **Benton Harbor, Michigan**,
    successfully replaced all its lead pipes within just two years,
    fueled by $18 million in funding from the President’s American
    Rescue Plan. And **Edgerton, W**I has replaced 100% of its known
    lead pipes after receiving funding from the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law.

**Delivering Clean Water**

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes more than $50 billion to help
ensure every community has access to clean water – the largest
investment in clean water in American history. Combined with new
protections against toxic chemicals and over 42 million acres of lands
and waters protected under President Biden, the Biden-Harris
Administration has embarked on the most ambitious conservation and clean
water agenda in the nation’s history, making historic progress to secure
clean water for all. Highlights of this ambitious agenda include:

-   [Combatting toxic “forever chemicals” in drinking water and
    wastewater.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/10/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-critical-action-to-protect-communities-from-pfas-pollution-in-drinking-water/)
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $10 billion to address
    harmful PFAS pollution in drinking water and wastewater. The EPA has
    also finalized the first-ever national standard to address these
    “forever chemicals” in drinking water, which will protect 100
    million Americans from PFAS exposure, safeguarding public health and
    advancing environmental justice.
-   [Protecting freshwater at the
    source](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/the-america-the-beautiful-freshwater-challenge/).
    Our rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands are the sources of clean
    drinking water that flows into our homes and economic drivers for
    many communities. Through the America the Beautiful Freshwater
    Challenge, the Administration has launched a nationwide initiative
    to protect, restore, and reconnect 8 million acres of wetlands and
    100,000 miles of our nation’s rivers and streams by 2030. Over 200
    states, Tribes, local governments, and businesses have joined the
    effort to meet these goals.
-   [Investing in clean water for
    Tribes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/23/fact-sheet-at-white-house-water-summit-biden-harris-administration-announces-bold-national-goal-to-protect-and-restore-freshwater-resources-delivers-over-1-billion-for-tribal-clean-water-projects/).
    The Biden-Harris Administration has announced historic Tribal water
    infrastructure investments totaling over $5 billion through the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding will help bring clean
    water to Tribal Nations, where half of Tribal households lack access
    to basic clean drinking water or adequate sanitation. The
    Administration has launched 900 Tribal clean water infrastructure
    projects to date through these investments.

**Investing in Wisconsin**

Today’s announcement builds on a record of investment in the state of
Wisconsin over the course of the President’s term in office. In addition
to the President delivering on lead pipe replacement, the President’s
Investing in America agenda has deployed $7.2 billion in public sector
clean energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure investments, which have
catalyzed an additional $8 billion from the private sector.

These investments include:

-   $1.7 billion in funding to provide affordable, reliable high-speed
    internet to everyone in Wisconsin, with 72,000 homes and small
    businesses already connected.
-   $4.1 billion for transportation – to rebuild our roads and bridges,
    expand our transit and rail, modernize our ports and airports, and
    more. This includes $1 billion in funding that the Biden-Harris
    Administration announced earlier this year to replace the Blatnik
    Bridge, an important route for people and freight in the Twin Ports
    area.
-   1.3 million seniors and Medicare beneficiaries who can receive free
    vaccines, $35 insulin, and, starting in January, a $2,000 cap on
    out-of-pocket costs.
-   $3.3 billion from Microsoft to bring a new data center that will
    create over 4,000 jobs to Racine, Wisconsin on the site of a
    proposed investment from Foxconn in the prior Administration that
    never materialized.
