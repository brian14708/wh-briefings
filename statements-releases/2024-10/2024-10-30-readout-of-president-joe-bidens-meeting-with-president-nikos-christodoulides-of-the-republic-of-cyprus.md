President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Nikos
Christodoulides of the Republic of Cyprus at the White House.  Following
the inaugural launch of the U.S.-Republic of Cyprus Strategic Dialogue
earlier this month, the leaders had an in-depth discussion on a range of
foreign policy issues of mutual interest including energy
diversification, regional security, and support to Ukraine.  President
Biden expressed his gratitude for the Republic of Cyprus’s support for
the maritime humanitarian corridor that delivered more than 8,000 metric
tons of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.  Acknowledging the 50th
anniversary of the division of the island of Cyprus, President Biden
reiterated his support for a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with
political equality for all Cypriots consistent with United Nations
Security Council Resolutions.
