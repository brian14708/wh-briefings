title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Passing of Ethel\_Kennedy"
---
 
Ethel Kennedy was an American patriot, a fighter for justice, and an
extraordinary force for good.  
   
A national and global leader, Ethel Kennedy used her voice to advocate
for the causes she cared most about—from human rights around the world
to conservation and gun safety. Guided by a deep sense of faith and an
abiding optimism, she fought for over five decades to build a stronger
nation and a better world.  
   
Ethel was a leader of courage, and a reminder to all of us that from
great loss can come great purpose. Her legacy will inspire people around
the world for generations to come.  
   
Doug and I send our love and our prayers to the Kennedy family.
