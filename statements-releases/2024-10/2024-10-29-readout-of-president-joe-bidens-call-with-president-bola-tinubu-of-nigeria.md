President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Bola Tinubu of
Nigeria.  President Biden offered his condolences on the recent flooding
that has impacted northeastern Nigeria and underscored his appreciation
for President Tinubu’s leadership in securing the release on
humanitarian grounds of American citizen and former U.S. law enforcement
official Tigran Gambaryan last week.  The two leaders also spoke about
the value of the U.S.-Nigeria partnership in addressing global
challenges and advancing security and prosperity across multiple
sectors. In particular, President Biden expressed appreciation for
cooperation on law enforcement, including through the recently announced
Bilateral Liaison Group on Illicit Finance and Cryptocurrencies, for
collaboration on new and innovative technologies, and on shared
interests in reforming international organizations to reflect African
voices.
