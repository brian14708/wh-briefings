title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Increased Worker\_Organizing"
---
 
When I took office, I promised to be the most pro-union, pro-worker
President in history. I have kept that promise. Today’s data from the
National Labor Relations Board shows the number of workers filing for
union representation has doubled since the start of my
Administration—the first administration in five decades to have an
increase in union petitions. I am proud to have secured the NLRB’s first
budget increase in almost a decade, and I will continue fighting for
more funding so the Board can empower workers on the job.

After the previous administration sided with big corporations to
undermine workers—from blocking overtime pay protections to making it
harder to organize—my Administration has supported workers, including
restoring and extending overtime pay protections to 4 million workers,
holding employers accountable for union-busting, and calling on Congress
to pass the PRO Act. Because when unions do well, all workers do well
and the entire economy benefits.
