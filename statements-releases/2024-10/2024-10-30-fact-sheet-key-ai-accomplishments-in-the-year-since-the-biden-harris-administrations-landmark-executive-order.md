title: "Fact Sheet: Key AI Accomplishments in the Year Since the Biden-\u2060Harris\
  \ Administration\u2019s Landmark Executive\_Order"
---
 
One year ago, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order to
ensure that America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing
the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). The Executive Order directed
sweeping actions to manage AI’s safety and security risks, protect
Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up for
consumers and workers, promote innovation and competition, advance
American leadership around the world, and more.

**Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that Federal
agencies have completed on schedule each action that the Executive Order
tasked for this past year—more than one hundred in all.** Below are some
of the Administration’s most significant accomplishments on managing
AI’s risks and seizing its promise in the year since President Biden
signed his Executive Order.

**<u>Managing Risks to Safety and Security:  
</u>**The Executive Order directed the boldest actions ever taken to
protect Americans from a broad range of AI’s safety and security risks,
including risks related to dangerous biological materials, software
vulnerabilities, and foreign actors’ efforts to develop AI for harmful
purposes. Over the last year, to protect safety and security, agencies
have:

-   **Used Defense Production Act authorities to require developers of
    the most powerful AI systems to report vital information, including
    results of safety and security testing, to the U.S. government.**
    These companies have notified the Department of Commerce about the
    results of their red-team safety tests, their plans to train
    powerful models, and large computing clusters they possess capable
    of such training. Last month, the Department of Commerce proposed a
    [rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/09/11/2024-20529/establishment-of-reporting-requirements-for-the-development-of-advanced-artificial-intelligence)
    to require the reporting of this information on a quarterly basis.

<!-- -->

-   **Led the way on AI safety testing and evaluations to advance the
    science of AI safety.** The U.S. AI Safety Institute (US AISI) at
    the Department of Commerce has begun pre-deployment testing of major
    new AI models through recently signed
    [agreements](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/us-ai-safety-institute-signs-agreements-regarding-ai-safety-research)
    with two leading AI developers. The Department of Energy (DOE)
    developed and expanded its AI testbeds and evaluation tools, which
    it has already used to test models’ risk to nuclear security.

<!-- -->

-   **Developed guidance and tools for managing AI risk.** The US AISI
    and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the
    Department of Commerce published frameworks for managing risks
    related to generative AI and [dual-use foundation
    models](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/07/department-commerce-announces-new-guidance-tools-270-days-following),
    and earlier this month, AISI released a [Request for
    Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/04/2024-22974/safety-considerations-for-chemical-andor-biological-ai-models)
    on the responsible development and use of AI models for chemical and
    biological sciences. The Department of Defense (DoD) released its
    Responsible AI toolkit to align AI projects with the Department’s
    Ethical Principles.

<!-- -->

-   **Issued a first-ever National Security Memorandum (NSM) on AI.**
    The NSM directs concrete steps by Federal agencies to ensure the
    United States leads the world’s development of safe, secure, and
    trustworthy AI; to enable agencies to harness cutting-edge AI for
    national security objectives, including by protecting human rights
    and democratic values; and to advance international consensus and
    governance on AI. This essential document serves as a formal charter
    for the AI Safety Institute, designating it as the center of the
    whole-of-government approach to advanced AI model testing, and will
    guide rapid and responsible AI adoption by the DoD and Intelligence
    Community. The NSM also directs the creation of a [Framework to
    Advance AI Governance and Risk Management in National
    Security](https://ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NSM-Framework-to-Advance-AI-Governance-and-Risk-Management-in-National-Security.pdf),
    which provides agile guidance to implement the NSM in accordance
    with democratic values, including mechanisms for risk management,
    evaluations, accountability, and transparency. 

<!-- -->

-   **Finalized a framework for nucleic acid synthesis screening to help
    prevent the misuse of AI for engineering dangerous biological
    materials.** The framework, developed by the Office of Science and
    Technology Policy (OSTP), encourages nucleic acid synthesis
    providers to identify gene sequences that could be used to pose
    national security risks, and to implement customer screening to
    mitigate the risks of misuse. Federal agencies will require that
    funding recipients obtain synthetic nucleic acids from vendors that
    adhere to the framework, starting in 2025. The Department of
    Homeland Security (DHS) has developed an initial framework with
    principles for evaluating the effectiveness of screening mechanisms
    going forward.

<!-- -->

-   **Launched a new Task Force on AI Datacenter Infrastructure.** The
    Task Force provides streamlined coordination on policies to advance
    datacenter development operations in line with economic, national
    security, and environmental goals.

<!-- -->

-   **Identified measures—including approaches for labeling content and
    improving transparency—to reduce the risks posed by AI-generated
    content.** The Department of Commerce submitted to the White House a
    final report on science-backed standards and techniques for
    addressing these risks, while NIST has launched a
    [challenge](https://ai-challenges.nist.gov/genai) to develop methods
    for detecting AI-generated content. President Biden has emphasized
    that the public has a right to know when content is AI-generated,
    and agencies are working to use these tools to help Americans to
    know that communications they receive from their government are
    authentic.

<!-- -->

-   **Combatted AI-generated image-based sexual abuse**. Image-based
    sexual abuse—both non-consensual intimate images of adults and child
    sexual abuse material—is one of the fastest growing harmful uses of
    AI to date and disproportionately targets women, children, and
    LGBTQI+ people. This year, following the Vice President’s leadership
    in underscoring the urgent need to address deepfake image-based
    sexual abuse and a White House [Call to
    Action](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/05/23/a-call-to-action-to-combat-image-based-sexual-abuse/)
    to reduce these risks, leading AI developers and data providers made
    [voluntary
    commitments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/09/12/white-house-announces-new-private-sector-voluntary-commitments-to-combat-image-based-sexual-abuse/)
    to curb the creation of AI-generated image-based sexual abuse
    material. Additionally, the Department of Justice (DOJ) funded the
    first-ever helpline to provide 24/7 support and specialized services
    for victims of the non-consensual distribution of intimate images,
    including deepfakes. The Department of Education also clarified that
    school responsibilities under Title IX may extend to conduct that
    takes place online, including AI-generated abuse.

<!-- -->

-   **Established the AI Safety and Security Board (AISSB)** to advise
    the Secretary of Homeland Security on the safe and secure use of AI
    in critical infrastructure. The
    [AISSB](https://www.dhs.gov/artificial-intelligence-safety-and-security-board)
    has met thrice this year to develop a set of recommendations for
    entities that develop, deploy, and promote accountability for AI
    systems that assist in delivering essential services to millions of
    Americans. The work of the AISSB complements DHS’s first-ever AI
    safety and security guidelines for critical infrastructure owners
    and operators, which were informed by agencies’ assessments of AI
    risks across all critical infrastructure sectors. To help protect
    critical infrastructure further, the Department of Treasury released
    a
    [report](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Managing-Artificial-Intelligence-Specific-Cybersecurity-Risks-In-The-Financial-Services-Sector.pdf)
    on managing security risks of AI use in the financial sector, and
    the Department of Energy released an assessment of potential risks
    to the power grid, as well as ways in which AI could potentially
    strengthen grid resilience and our ability to respond to threats.

<!-- -->

-   **Piloted AI for protecting vital government software systems.** The
    Department of Defense and DHS conducted AI pilots to address
    vulnerabilities in government networks used, respectively, for
    national security purposes and for civilian governmental
    organizations.

**<u>Standing up for Workers, Consumers, Privacy, and Civil
Rights</u>**  
AI is changing the products and services Americans buy, affecting jobs
and workplaces, and introducing or exacerbating risks to privacy,
equity, and civil rights. President Biden’s Executive Order stands up
for Americans in each of these domains, and over the last year, agencies
have:

-   **Developed bedrock principles and practices, along with guidance,
    to help protect and empower workers as AI is built for and used in
    the workplace.** The Department of Labor (DOL) released [AI
    Principles and Best
    Practices](https://www.dol.gov/general/AI-Principles) for employers
    and developers to build and use AI in ways that center the wellbeing
    of workers and improve the quality of jobs. DOL also published two
    guidance documents to assist [federal
    contractors](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/ai/ai-eeo-guide) and
    [employers](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/fab/fab2024_1.pdf)
    in complying with worker protection laws as they deploy AI in the
    workplace. In addition, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
    released resources for job seekers and workers to understand how AI
    use could violate employment discrimination laws.

<!-- -->

-   **Protected patients’ rights and safety, while encouraging
    innovation, as AI is developed and deployed for healthcare.** The
    Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established an AI
    Safety Program to track harmful incidents involving AI’s use in
    healthcare settings and to evaluate mitigations for those harms. HHS
    has also developed objectives, goals, and high-level principles for
    the use of AI or AI-enabled tools in drug development processes and
    AI-enabled devices. Additionally, HHS finalized a rule that
    established first-of-its-kind transparency requirements for AI and
    other predictive algorithms that are part of certified health
    information technology. HHS also finalized a civil rights
    regulation, implementing Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act,
    that requires covered health care entities to take steps to identify
    and mitigate discrimination when they use AI and other forms of
    decision support tools for care.

<!-- -->

-   **Published guidance and resources for the safe, secure, and
    trustworthy design and use of AI in education.** In July, the
    Department of Education released guidance calling up on educational
    technology developers to design AI in ways that protect rights,
    improve transparency, and center teaching and learning. This month,
    the Department of Education released a toolkit to support schools
    and educational leaders in responsibly adopting valuable AI use
    cases.

<!-- -->

-   **Issued guidance on AI’s nondiscriminatory use in the housing
    sector,** which affirms that existing prohibitions against
    discrimination apply to AI’s use for tenant screening and housing
    advertisements, while explaining how to comply with these
    obligations. Additionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
    approved a rule requiring that algorithms and AI used for home
    valuations are fair, nondiscriminatory, and free of conflicts of
    interest.

<!-- -->

-   **Set guardrails on the responsible and equitable use of AI and
    algorithmic systems in administering public benefits programs.** The
    Department of Agriculture’s guidance provides a framework for how
    State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments should manage
    risks for uses of AI and automated systems in critical benefits
    programs such as SNAP, while HHS released a plan with guidelines on
    similar topics for benefits programs it oversees.

<!-- -->

-   **Affirmed commitments to prevent and address unlawful
    discrimination and other harms resulting from AI.** DOJ’s Civil
    Rights Division convenes federal agency civil rights offices and
    senior government officials to foster AI and civil rights
    coordination. Five new agencies also
    [joined](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-new-federal-agencies-join-justice-department-pledge-enforce-civil-rights-laws)
    a 2023 pledge to uphold America’s commitment to fairness, equality,
    and justice as new technologies like AI become more common in daily
    life.

<!-- -->

-   **Advanced privacy protections to safeguard Americans from privacy
    risks that AI creates or exacerbates.** In particular, the National
    Science Foundation (NSF) and DOE
    [established](https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-doe-establish-research-coordination-network)
    a research network dedicated to advancing the development,
    deployment, and scaling of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs),
    while NSF launched the $23 million initiative Privacy-preserving
    Data Sharing in Practice program to apply, mature, and scale PETs
    for specific use cases and establish testbeds to accelerate their
    adoption. Simultaneously, DOE launched a $68 million effort on AI
    for Science research, which includes efforts at multiple DOE
    National Laboratories and other institutions to advance PETs for
    scientific AI. The Department of Commerce also developed guidelines
    on evaluating differential privacy guarantees. The Office of
    Management and Budget (OMB) released a [Request for
    Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/16/2024-23773/request-for-information-executive-branch-agency-handling-of-commercially-available-information)
    (RFI) on issues related to federal agency collection, processing,
    maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, and disposition of
    commercially available information containing personally
    identifiable information. OMB also released an
    [RFI](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/30/2024-01756/request-for-information-privacy-impact-assessments)
    on how federal agencies’ privacy impact assessments may be more
    effective at mitigating privacy risks, including those that are
    further exacerbated by AI and other advances in technology and data
    capabilities.

**<u>Harnessing AI for Good  
</u>**Over the last year, agencies have worked to seize AI’s enormous
promise, including by collaborating with the private sector, promoting
development and use of valuable AI use cases, and deepening the U.S.
lead in AI innovation. To harness AI for good, agencies have:

-   **Launched the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot and
    awarded over 150 research teams access to computational and other AI
    resources.** The NAIRR pilot—a national infrastructure led by the
    National Science Foundation (NSF) in partnership with DOE and other
    governmental and nongovernmental partners—makes available resources
    to support the nation’s AI research and education community.
    Supported research teams span 34 states and tackle projects covering
    deepfake detection, AI safety, next-generation medical diagnoses,
    environmental protection, and materials engineering.

<!-- -->

-   **Promoted AI education and training across the United States.** DOE
    is leveraging its network of national laboratories to
    [train](https://www.energy.gov/cet/supercharging-americas-ai-workforce)
    500 new researchers by 2025 to meet demand for AI talent, while NSF
    has invested millions of dollars in programs to train future AI
    leaders and innovators. These programs include the EducateAI
    initiative, which helps fund educators creating high-quality,
    inclusive AI educational opportunities at the K-12 through
    undergraduate levels that support experiential learning in fields
    such as AI and build capacity in AI research at minority-serving
    institutions.

    in proceedings before USPTO.

**<u>Bringing AI and AI Talent into Government  
</u>**AI can help government deliver better results for the American
people, though its use by Federal agencies can also pose risks, such as
discrimination and unsafe decisions. Bringing AI and AI-enabling
professionals into government, moreover, is vital for managing these
risks and opportunities and advancing other critical AI missions. Over
the last year, agencies have:

-   **Issued the first-ever government-wide policy to strengthen
    governance, mitigate risks, and advance innovation in federal use of
    AI.** OMB’s historic policy,
    [M-24-10](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf),
    requires agencies to implement concrete safeguards when using AI in
    a way that could impact Americans’ rights or safety. These
    safeguards include a series of mandatory risk management practices
    to reliably assess, test, and monitor AI’s impacts on the public and
    provide greater transparency into how the government uses AI. OMB’s
    policy also directs agencies to designate Chief AI Officers to
    coordinate the use of AI across their agency, while expanding and
    upskilling their AI workforce and removing barriers to adopting AI
    for all manner of purposes—from addressing climate change to
    advancing public health and safety.

<!-- -->

-   **Released a government-wide policy to advance responsible
    acquisition of AI by Federal agencies.**
    [M-24-18,](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/M-24-18-AI-Acquisition-Memorandum.pdf)
    published this month by OMB, helps ensure that when Federal agencies
    acquire AI, they have the information and tools necessary to manage
    risks, promote a competitive marketplace, and collaborate on
    strategic planning. This work directs the Federal government—the
    largest buyer in the U.S. economy—to advance AI innovation and risk
    management through responsibly exercising its purchasing power.

<!-- -->

-   **Hired over 250 AI practitioners into the Federal government
    through the** [**AI Talent Surge**](https://ai.gov/apply/). Tech
    talent programs ramped up hiring for AI talent, with the
    Presidential Innovation Fellows bringing on their first-ever AI
    cohort, DHS establishing their AI Corps with over 30 members
    onboarded to date, and the U.S. Digital Corps providing pathways for
    early-career technologists to join Federal service. AI talent has
    been instrumental in delivering on critical AI priorities, from
    using AI to deliver top-tier government services, to protecting the
    public’s rights and safety in the use of AI.

<!-- -->

-   **Established the Chief AI Officers Council** to harmonize best
    practices and sharing of resources across the interagency to
    implement OMB’s guidance and coordinate the development and use of
    AI in agencies’ programs and operations.

<!-- -->

-   **Introduced expanded reporting instructions for the federal AI use
    case inventory** to include identifying use cases that impact rights
    or safety and how the agency is addressing the relevant risks in
    line with OMB’s policies. 
-   **Bolstered the public interest technology ecosystem**. Building on
    the AI Talent Surge, the White House [announced
    funding](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/07/16/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-commitments-from-across-technology-ecosystem-including-nearly-100-million-to-advance-public-interest-technology/)
    across government, academia, and civil society to support education
    and career pathways that will help ensure government has access to
    diverse, mission-oriented technology talent.

<!-- -->

-   **Activated new hiring authorities to bring AI and AI-enabling
    talent into agencies**. As part of the AI Talent Surge, the Office
    of Personnel Management (OPM) granted new hiring authorities,
    including direct hire authorities and excepted service authorities,
    for agencies to rapidly bring on top-tier AI and AI-enabling talent,
    and released guidance on skills-based hiring and pay and leave
    flexibilities to best position agencies to hire and retain AI and
    AI-enabling talent. Additionally, OPM collaborated with partners to
    run three National Tech to Gov career fairs to connect the public
    with AI and tech jobs in government, surfacing roles from over 64
    Federal, state, and local government employers to over 3,000 job
    seekers.

**<u>Advancing U.S. Leadership Abroad</u>**  
President Biden’s Executive Order directed work to lead global efforts
to capture AI’s promise, mitigate AI’s risks, and ensure AI’s
responsible governance. To advance these goals, the Administration has:

-   **Sponsored and passed a landmark United Nations General Assembly
    resolution.** The unanimously adopted resolution, with more than 100
    co-sponsors (including the People’s Republic of China), lays out a
    common vision for countries around the world to promote the safe and
    secure use of AI to address global challenges.

<!-- -->

-   **Engaged foreign leaders on strengthening international rules and
    norms for AI, including at the 2023 UK AI Safety Summit and the AI
    Seoul Summit in May 2024, where Vice President Harris represented
    the United States.** In the United Kingdom, Vice President Harris
    unveiled a series of U.S. initiatives to advance the safe and
    responsible use of AI, including the establishment of AISI at the
    Department of Commerce.

<!-- -->

-   **Announced a global network of AI Safety Institutes and other
    government-backed scientific offices to advance AI safety at a
    technical level.** This network, which will formally launch in
    November at the inaugural network convening in San Francisco, will
    accelerate critical information exchange and drive toward common or
    compatible safety evaluations and policies.

<!-- -->

-   **Expanded global support for the U.S.-led Political Declaration on
    the Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and
    Autonomy.** Fifty-six nations now endorse the political declaration,
    which outlines a set of norms for the responsible development,
    deployment, and use of military AI capabilities. DoD has expanded
    the scope of its international AI Partnership for Defense to align
    global Responsible AI practices with the Political Declaration’s
    norms.

<!-- -->

-   **Developed comprehensive plans for U.S. engagement on global AI
    standards and AI-related critical infrastructure topics.** NIST and
    DHS, respectively, will report on priority actions taken per these
    plans in 90 days.

<!-- -->

-   **Signed** **the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention on AI and
    Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law.** This first
    multilateral treaty on AI represents a powerful affirmation of the
    relevance of existing human rights obligations to AI activities and
    establishes a strong baseline in international law for responsible
    government use of AI. The United States’ signature reflects its
    commitment to ensuring that AI technologies are designed, developed,
    used, and governed in ways that promote respect for human rights and
    democratic values. 

<!-- -->

-   **Led the development of a Joint Statement on Responsible Government
    Practices for AI Technologies.** The Joint Statement, to which the
    41 countries of the Freedom Online Coalition committed, calls on
    governments to develop, use, and procure AI responsibly, including
    by respecting international obligations and commitments, assessing
    impacts of AI systems, conducting ongoing monitoring, ensuring
    adequate human training and assessment, communicating and responding
    to the public, and providing effective access to remedy. 

<!-- -->

-   **Launched the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online
    Harassment and Abuse. ** The 15-country Global Partnership has
    advanced international policies to address online safety, and
    spurred new programs to prevent and respond to
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including through AI.

<!-- -->

-   **The Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International
    Development published resources to advance global AI research and
    use of AI for economic development.** The AI in Global Development
    Playbook incorporates principles and practices from NIST’s AI Risk
    Management Framework to guide AI’s responsible development and
    deployment across international contexts, while the Global AI
    Research Agenda outlines priorities for advancing AI’s safe,
    responsible, and sustainable global development and adoption.
