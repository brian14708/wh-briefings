title: "Statement from Vice President Kamala\_Harris on One Million Public Service\
  \ Workers Receiving Student Debt\_Cancellation"
---
 
Higher education should be a pathway to economic opportunity – not a
lifetime of debt. That is why I have fought to make education more
affordable and reduce the burden of student debt throughout my career.

When President Biden and I took office, only 7,000 people had ever been
approved for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Today, I am proud to say
that a record one million teachers, nurses, first responders, social
workers, and other public service workers have received student debt
cancellation. As I travel our nation, I meet many of these public
servants who say they now have more money in their pocket to put towards
buying a home, renting an apartment, getting a car, starting a family,
and saving up for the future.

Our Administration has forgiven over $170 billion in student debt for
nearly five million people throughout the country — more than any
Administration in history. And while Republican elected officials do
everything in their power to block millions of their own constituents
from receiving this much needed economic relief, I will continue our
work to lower costs, make higher education more affordable, and relieve
the burden of student debt. I am fully committed to doing what is
necessary to build an economy that works for every American.
