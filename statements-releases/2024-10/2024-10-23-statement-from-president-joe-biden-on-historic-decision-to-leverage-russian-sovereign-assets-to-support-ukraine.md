title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Historic Decision to Leverage Russian\
  \ Sovereign Assets to Support\_Ukraine"
---
 
This summer, I led an effort to bring the G7 together to commit $50
billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration loans to Ukraine backed by
the profits of immobilized Russian sovereign assets.  After Russia’s
brutal invasion of Ukraine, the G7 took bold action to immobilize
Russia’s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions, and committed that these
assets will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays
for the damage it has caused to Ukraine—paving the way for Extraordinary
Revenue Acceleration loans.

As part of the G7 package, the United States is announcing today that we
will provide $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by
the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets. In other
words, Ukraine can receive the assistance it needs now, without
burdening taxpayers. These loans will support the people of Ukraine as
they defend and rebuild their country. And our efforts make it clear:
tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause.

Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict. The people of
Ukraine will prevail. This is another reminder to Vladimir Putin that
the world has rallied behind Ukraine—and the United States and our G7
partners will continue to stand with them every step of the way.
