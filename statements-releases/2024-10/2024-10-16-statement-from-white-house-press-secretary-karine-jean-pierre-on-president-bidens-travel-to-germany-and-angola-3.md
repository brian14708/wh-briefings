President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to Germany from October

close bond the United States and Germany share as Allies and friends and
coordinate on geopolitical priorities, including Ukraine’s defense
against Russian aggression and events in the Middle East.  The President
will also reaffirm our shared commitment to democracy and countering
antisemitism and hatred; advance cooperation on the economy, trade, and
technology; and strengthen our Euro-Atlantic alliances and
partnerships.  
    
The first week of December, President Biden will also separately travel
to Luanda, Angola, where he will celebrate the transformation of the
U.S.-Angola relationship, recognize Angola’s role as a strategic partner
and regional leader, and discuss increased collaboration on security,
health, and economic partnerships—including the G7’s Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment support for the Lobito
Corridor—that deliver for both our peoples.
