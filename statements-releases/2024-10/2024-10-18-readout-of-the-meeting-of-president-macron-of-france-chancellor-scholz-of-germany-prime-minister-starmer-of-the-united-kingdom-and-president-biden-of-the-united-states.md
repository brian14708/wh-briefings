President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany,
Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom, and President Joseph
R. Biden, Jr. of the United States met today in Berlin, Germany.

The leaders condemned Russia’s continued war of aggression against
Ukraine, discussed their plans to provide Ukraine with additional
security, economic, and humanitarian assistance – including leveraging
the extraordinary revenues of immobilized Russian sovereign assets, as
decided at the G7 Summit –, discussed President Zelenskyy’s Victory
Plan, and reiterated their resolve to continue supporting Ukraine in its
efforts to secure a just and lasting peace, based on international law,
including the United Nations Charter, and respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity.

The leaders also discussed events in the Middle East, in particular the
implications of the death of Yahya Sinwar, who bears responsibility for
the bloodshed of the October 7th terrorist attack, the immediate
necessity to bring the hostages home to their families, ending the war
in Gaza, and ensuring humanitarian aid reaches civilians. The leaders
also reiterated their condemnation of Iran’s escalatory attack on Israel
and coordinated on efforts to hold Iran accountable and prevent further
escalation. They discussed the situation in Lebanon and agreed on the
need to work towards full implementation of UNSCR 1701 and a diplomatic
resolution that allows civilians on both sides of the Blue Line to
return safely home.
