Inflation has now fallen to 2.1%—nearly at its 2% target. While critics
said we needed a recession to lower inflation, instead inflation has
come down while our economy has grown more than 12% over the course of
my Administration—the fastest rate of any presidential term in the
21<sup>st</sup> century. Incomes are up almost $4,000 after accounting
for inflation, and gas prices are down to $3.13 per gallon and below $3
in 21 states.

We have more to do. We will keep fighting to lower costs by building
millions of new homes, lowering health insurance premiums, and making
child care more affordable. Congressional Republicans are fighting for
tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations, while raising costs on
families by nearly $4,000 a year with across-the-board tariffs that
would cause inflation to skyrocket. They have a cost-raising agenda—we
have a cost-cutting agenda.
