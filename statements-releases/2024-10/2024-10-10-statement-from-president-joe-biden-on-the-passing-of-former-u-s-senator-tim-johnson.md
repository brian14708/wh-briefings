title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of Former U.S. Senator\
  \ Tim\_Johnson"

Tim Johnson served the people of South Dakota with distinction, and it
was an honor to serve alongside him in the United States Senate for over
a decade.

He always put South Dakotans first, and he never forgot where he came
from. He worked tirelessly to bring clean drinking water to Americans
wherever they lived: rural towns, inner cities, and Tribal lands. And he
steered critical investments toward Indian Country and to South Dakota’s
development and infrastructure.

As a Senator, Tim improved access to health care for millions of
Americans by providing a critical vote on the Affordable Care Act,
advocating for veterans’ health care funding, and fighting to expand
Medicaid in South Dakota.

We also worked together to establish the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, to defend the backbone of our economy—hardworking Americans.

Over the years, Jill and I got to know Tim and Barb as true friends. Our
hearts are with Barb, his three children, his eight grandchildren, and
the people of South Dakota, whose lives Tim touched.

May God bless Tim Johnson.
