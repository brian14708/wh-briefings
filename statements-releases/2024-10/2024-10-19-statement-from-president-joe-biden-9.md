We are heartbroken to learn about the ferry dock walkway collapse on
Georgiaâ€™s Sapelo Island. What should have been a joyous celebration of
Gullah-Geechee culture and history instead turned into tragedy and
devastation. Jill and I mourn those who lost their lives, and we pray
for the injured and anyone still missing. We are also grateful to the
first responders at the scene. My team is in touch with state and local
officials, and we stand ready to provide any and all assistance that
would be helpful to the community.
