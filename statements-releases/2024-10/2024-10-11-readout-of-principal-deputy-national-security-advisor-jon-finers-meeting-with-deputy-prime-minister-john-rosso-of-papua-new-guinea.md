On October 10, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer met
with Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso of Papua New Guinea in Washington,
DC.  They discussed the deepening cooperation between the United States
and Papua New Guinea as exemplified by the establishment of the
inaugural U.S.-PNG Strategic Partnership Dialogue. Mr. Finer noted the
status of new and ongoing projects being undertaken by the United States
in cooperation with Papua New Guinea, including building a humanitarian
assistance/disaster relief warehouse in Lae, connecting 19,000 Papua New
Guinean households to electricity over the last three months under the
Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership, the $26 million flagship
Peace Project under the U.S Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote
Stability, and U.S. assistance to the Government of Papua New Guinea in
resolving the ongoing fuel crisis.

Mr. Finer and Mr. Rosso reaffirmed the value and opportunities generated
by our deepening partnership and discussed areas of potential future
collaboration in education, people-to-people ties, resource
conservation, access to banking services, and defense, especially where
enabled by the U.S.-PNG Defense Cooperation Agreement. They agreed to be
in touch over the coming weeks to continue the progress of the maturing
relationship.
