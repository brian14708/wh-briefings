title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on ILA and USMX\_Agreement"
---
 
I want to applaud the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) and
the United States Maritime Alliance for coming together to reopen the
East Coast and Gulf ports. Today’s tentative agreement on a record wage
and an extension of the collective bargaining process represents
critical progress towards a strong contract. I congratulate the
dockworkers from the ILA, who deserve a strong contract after
sacrificing so much to keep our ports open during the pandemic. And I
applaud the port operators and carriers who are members of the US
Maritime Alliance for working hard and putting a strong offer on the
table.

I want to thank the union workers, the carriers, and the port operators
for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability
of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.
Collective bargaining works, and it is critical to building a stronger
economy from the middle out and the bottom up.
