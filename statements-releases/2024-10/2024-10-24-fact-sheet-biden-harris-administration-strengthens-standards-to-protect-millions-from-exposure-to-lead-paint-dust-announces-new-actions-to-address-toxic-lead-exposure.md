title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Strengthens Standards to Protect\
  \ Millions from Exposure to Lead Paint Dust, Announces New Actions to Address Toxic\
  \ Lead\_Exposure"
---
 
*Today’s announcement is expected to reduce the lead exposure of up to
1.2 million people every year and represents one of over 100 actions
taken by the Administration in 2024 to reduce lead poisoning*

President Biden and Vice President Harris have been clear that all
Americans deserve to live free from fear of toxic lead exposure. Since
Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has marshalled a whole of
government effort to reduce all sources of lead exposure, issuing a
comprehensive [Lead Pipe and Paint Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/)
that guides federal action to achieve a lead-free future.

Today, as we continue to mark National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week,
the Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to further reduce lead
exposure by **issuing a final Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule
to strengthen requirements for the removal of lead paint dust in
pre-1978 housing and child care facilities.**

Lead is a neurotoxin that can irreversibly harm brain development in
children, lower IQ, cause behavioral problems, and lead to life-long
health effects. There is no safe level of lead exposure. Yet, due to
decades of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment,
lead poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and
communities of color.

Today’s final rule sets new standards for lead abatement activities that
will better protect children and communities from the harmful effects of
exposure to dust generated from lead paint. The rule will help protect
people in communities across the country from these harms, and is
**expected to reduce the lead exposures of up to nearly 1.2 million
people every year, providing public health and economic benefits up to
30 times greater than the costs.** Although the United States banned
lead-based paint in residences in 1978, an estimated 31 million houses
built before 1978 still contain lead-based paint, and 3.8 million are
home to one or more child under the age of six, putting them at risk of
lead exposure.

**Since the announcement of the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action
Plan, the Administration has taken hundreds of actions across more than
10 agencies to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in drinking water,
paint, soil, food and household products, the workplace, and to combat
lead exposure internationally – including more than 100 actions in the
past year alone.** Some of the actions since the latest Action Plan
progress update in November 2023 include:

**<u>Reducing Exposure to Lead from Paint and Dust in the Home</u>** –
Lead in household dust originates from indoor sources such as
deteriorated, lead-based paint on surfaces. In the last year, the
Administration has worked diligently to identify, help tackle, and
eliminate these exposures in several ways:

-   Earlier this month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD)
    [announced](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_265)
    more than $420 million in awards to remove lead hazards from homes,
    including HUD-assisted homes, ensuring the safety of children,
    residents, and families. [This includes $2 million to remove other
    housing-related hazards from homes in conjunction with
    weatherization
    efforts](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/HHWCD2024.pdf),
    and [nearly $10 million to facilitate
    research](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/LTSHHTS2024.pdf)
    on better identifying and controlling lead and other housing-related
    hazards. These awards are part of President Biden’s [Justice40
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/),
    which seeks to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of
    certain Federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable
    housing, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities
    that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by
    pollution. 
-   In August 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    issued a new [final rule updating the Head Start Program Performance
    Standards](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/policy/pi/acf-ohs-pi-24-05).
    This rule requires Head Start programs to protect children from
    exposure to lead in water and paint through regular testing and
    inspection and remediate lead in Head Start facilities where lead
    exists.
-   In 2024, EPA conducted approximately 1,400 compliance monitoring
    activities for lead-based paint in over 190 communities, more than a
    third of which were communities with environmental justice concerns.
    Additionally, EPA’s Federal Facilities Enforcement Office conducted
    compliance monitoring activities at 18 military installations
    in 2024. This work protects our service members and their families
    from exposure to lead-based paint in their homes at military bases.

**<u>Reducing Exposure to Lead from Drinking Water</u>** – Millions of
buildings still receive their water through a lead pipe. The
Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to meet President
Biden’s commitment to replace every lead pipe in the country within a
decade:

-   Earlier this month President Biden traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
    to announce a [**final
    rule**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-final-rule-to-replace-lead-pipes-within-a-decade-announces-new-funding-to-deliver-clean-drinking-water/)
    **that requires drinking water systems nationwide to replace lead
    service lines within 10 years**. This rule will protect children
    from brain damage, prevent up to 900,000 infants being born with low
    birth weight, and protect 1,100 adults from premature death from
    heart disease every year.
-   President Biden secured a historic [**$15 billion in
    funding**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-3-billion-to-replace-toxic-lead-pipes-and-deliver-clean-drinking-water-to-communities-across-the-country/)
    through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law specifically dedicated for
    replacing lead service lines, and provided an additional $2.6
    billion from his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for drinking water
    upgrades and lead pipe replacements, along with an additional $11.7
    billion in general-purpose funding through the Drinking Water State
    Revolving Fund which can also be used for lead pipe replacement. To
    date, EPA has announced over $18 billion of this funding across
    every state. Nearly half of this funding is required to flow to
    disadvantaged communities, in the form of grants and zero-interest
    loans.
-   Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions, cities across
    the country are already making progress in replacing lead pipes.
    Cities with some of the highest numbers of lead pipes, like
    Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburgh, St. Paul, and Denver, have received
    funding from the Administration and are now on track to replace all
    lead pipes within 10 years or less. Under this Administration,
    **over 367,000 lead pipes have been replaced nationwide, benefitting
    nearly 1 million people.**
-   Funding from the American Rescue Plan’s [$350
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-to-protect-communities-from-lead-exposure/)
    State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund can be used by states and
    communities to replace lead service lines and remediate lead paint.
    To date, well **over** **$20 billion** nationwide has been invested
    in water infrastructure projects.
-   During this Administration, the EPA has also used its Water
    Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program to provide
    well over $350 million in financing to communities for lead pipe
    replacement.
-   Since launching in November 2023, EPA’s [Get the Lead Out
    Initiative](https://www.epa.gov/water-infrastructure/get-lead-out-initiative)
    has provided technical assistance to public water systems nationwide
    to identify lead pipes and accelerate their replacement.
    Prioritizing disadvantaged and underserved communities, the
    initiative is providing assistance to a growing
    [list](https://www.epa.gov/water-infrastructure/get-lead-out-initiative-communities)
    of public water systems, including in Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois,
    and facilitates access to funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law. This initiative builds on the partnership between EPA, the
    Department of Labor (DOL), and [40 underserved
    communities](https://www.epa.gov/water-infrastructure/lead-service-line-replacement-accelerators)
    to support lead pipe replacement.
-   In January 2023, the [White House Summit on Accelerating Lead Pipe
    Replacement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-and-progress-to-protect-communities-from-lead-pipes-and-paint/)
    hosted by Vice President Harris, announced new actions and progress
    to deliver clean drinking water, replace lead pipes, and remediate
    lead paint to protect children and communities across America,
    including the [**Biden-Harris Get the Lead Out
    Partnership**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/briefing-room/2023/01/26/biden-harris-get-the-lead-out-partnership/) comprised
    of state and local officials, water utilities, labor unions, and
    other nongovernmental organizations who committed to advance and
    accelerate lead pipe replacement. This White House Partnership
    spurred the creation of a the [**Great Lakes Lead Pipes
    Partnership**](https://glslcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04.23.24_White-House-Water-Summit-2.pdf)**,
    a first-of-its kind, mayor-led effort to accelerate lead pipe
    replacement in cities with the heaviest lead burdens.**
-   In August 2024, EPA announced [$26 million in grant
    funding](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-26-million-grants-protect-children-lead-drinking)
    to protect children from lead in drinking water at schools and
    childcare facilities across the country. These grants will be used
    by 55 States and territories to reduce lead exposure where children
    learn and play.
-   The Department of the Interior conducted more than 330 water system
    assessments at all Indian Affairs-owned sites, including schools,
    offices and detention centers, among others. Beyond service lines,
    assessments collected lead/copper samples to identify lead sources
    in water distribution systems and where lead levels affected
    drinking points DOI coordinated immediate remediation strategies and
    implemented actions including alternative water sourcing and
    confirmatory sampling.

**<u>Reducing Exposure to Lead from Air</u>** – Major sources of lead in
the air include emissions from manufacturing, waste and metals
processing, and aircraft operating on leaded aviation fuel. To tackle
these emissions, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken the following
actions:

-   In January 2024, EPA
    [released](https://www.epa.gov/isa/integrated-science-assessment-isa-lead)
    the Integrated Science Assessment for Lead as part of its review of
    the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This technical
    document, along with additional technical and policy assessments,
    will provide the scientific foundation for EPA’s decisions as it
    regulates air lead exposure.
-   In October 2023, [EPA issued a final
    determination](https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-lead-emissions-aircraft)
    that emissions of lead from aircraft engines that operate on leaded
    fuel cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be
    anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. With this final
    determination, EPA and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have
    begun work to consider regulatory options to address lead emissions
    from aircrafts.

**<u>Reducing Exposure to Lead from Soil</u>** – Lead contamination at
legacy pollution sites from past industrial operations, like lead mining
and smelting, can accumulate in soil and poses a threat to human health
and the environment. Reducing lead levels in soils can reduce exposure
risks.

-   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $5 billion to clean up
    legacy pollution, including lead contamination, at Superfund and
    Brownfields sites. In Fiscal Year 2024, EPA completed 63 Superfund
    cleanup projects that addressed lead contamination in soil to
    protect families and children from the harmful impacts of lead. In
    addition, lead is the environmental contaminant most commonly
    reported by EPA Brownfields cleanup grant recipients. In fiscal year
    2024, Brownfields grant recipients completed 63 brownfields cleanups
    that addressed lead contamination.
-   In January 2024, after years of research and advanced understanding
    of the latest science on lead, EPA issued [new
    guidance](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated-soil-lead-guidance-cercla-sites-and-rcra-corrective-action-facilities)
    to improve screenings for lead in residential soils at Superfund and
    other contaminated sites. This new guidance cuts in half the
    recommended screening levels issued 30 years ago and takes into
    account the potential for cumulative impacts by recommending even
    more stringent levels in areas where there may be additional sources
    of lead exposure, such as lead in drinking water or lead paint in
    homes.

**<u>Reducing Exposure to Lead from Food and Household Products</u>** –
Lead may be present in food when it is in the environment where foods
are grown, raised, or processed. To reduce the risk to children of
ingesting lead in food, the Administration is working to addressed lead
hazards in processed foods.

-   In September 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published
    a new study on [dietary exposure from lead in infants and young
    children](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19440049.2024.2396910).
    This action is part of the agency’s [Closer to
    Zero](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/closer-zero-reducing-childhood-exposure-contaminants-foods)
    effort, which sets forth the FDA’s science-based approach to
    continually reduce exposure to lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and
    other contaminants to the lowest levels possible in foods eaten by
    babies and young children.

**<u>Protecting People from Lead Exposure in the Workplace</u>** –
Workers can be exposed to lead as a result of the production, use,
maintenance, recycling, and disposal of lead material and products. In
2024, the Administration sought to protect workers through a number of
actions.

-   In April 2024, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
    Health (NIOSH) released [Trends in Workplace Lead
    Exposure](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/lead/data/index.html),
    monitoring workplace lead exposure trends through the Adult Blood
    Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance program.
-   In March 2024, at the direction of President Biden, the Department
    of Veterans Affairs (VA)
    [announced](https://www.va.gov/wilmington-health-care/news-releases/at-the-direction-of-president-biden-va-is-expanding-health-care-eligibility-to-millions-of-veterans/)
    that all veterans exposed to toxins and other hazards during
    military service—including lead—are now eligible for VA health care.

**<u>Accelerating Innovations to Improve Blood Lead Testing</u>** –
Testing blood is the best way to determine if a person has had lead
exposure, as there are often no immediate symptoms when someone is
exposed to lead. Based on blood lead test results, healthcare providers
can recommend follow-up actions and care.

-   In March 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
    announced Phase 2 of the [Lead Detect Prize on
    challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=lead-detect-prize),
    inviting selected Phase 1 participants to develop their winning
    concepts into detailed designs. This challenge provides a $1 million
    prize pool to accelerate the development of next-generation
    point-of-care blood lead testing technology. National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) and the FDA support the challenge,
    and it spotlights the urgent need to identify and foster new or
    existing breakthrough solutions and products for optimal lead
    testing in children.

**<u>Establishing Domestic Partnerships to Reduce All Lead
Exposure</u>** – The Administration is engaging stakeholders in a number
of ways to reduce community exposure to lead in the United States.

-   In July 2024, the President’s Task Force on Environmental Health
    Risks and Safety Risks to Children published the [Progress Report on
    the Federal Lead Action
    Plan](https://ptfcehs.niehs.nih.gov/features/featured-activity/task-force-reports-progress-federal-lead-action-plan),
    a comprehensive update on the government’s progress since 2018
    toward reducing childhood lead exposures. HUD, EPA, and HHS, as
    co-leading members of the Task Force’s Lead Subcommittee, are
    leading aggressive actions to combat lead exposure. The Federal Lead
    Action Plan promotes a vision that the United States will become a
    place where children, especially those in communities with
    environmental justice concerns, can live, learn and play and remain
    safe from lead exposure and its harmful effects.
-   In June 2024, the CDC published the [Childhood Lead Poisoning
    Prevention National Classroom
    program](https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/php/trainings/childhood-lead-poisoning-prevention.html).
    This program features multiple training methods and outreach
    strategies, including slide presentations, training videos,
    webinars, podcasts, and materials posted online to engage a broad
    range of audiences, including public health professionals, other
    physicians, general audiences, and high school students, through
    social media platforms and many other outlets.
-   In February 2024, the EPA in collaboration with HUD and CDC/ASTDR
    published *A U.S. Lead Exposures Hotspot Analysis*, which identifies
    states and counties with the highest potential lead exposure risk
    from old housing sources of lead. This analysis applied
    science-based methods based on available data, continuing the
    agencies’ commitment to advancing whole of government efforts to
    focus lead actions in disproportionately impacted locations.
-   EPA continues to establish and lead U.S. whole-of-government
    partnerships to develop and apply a science-based blueprint to
    identify communities with high lead exposures and improve their
    health outcomes in support of [EPA’s Lead
    Strategy](https://www.epa.gov/lead/final-strategy-reduce-lead-exposures-and-disparities-us-communities)
    and priority activities of the [President’s Task Force on
    Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to
    Children](https://ptfcehs.niehs.nih.gov/).

**<u>Spearheading an International Effort to Reduce Global Lead
Exposure</u>** – Amidst historic actions taken domestically to combat
lead exposure in the United States, the Administration has built an
unprecedented global coalition to tackle lead exposure in low- and
middle-income countries, where one in two children has elevated levels
of lead in their blood.

-   In September 2024, the U.S. Agency for International Development
    (USAID) joined UNICEF and over 60 partners and 26 countries to
    launch the [Partnership for a Lead-Free
    Future](https://www.usaid.gov/leadfreefuture), the first-ever
    public-private partnership dedicated to tackling lead exposure in
    low- and middle-income countries. The Partnership committed [$150
    million](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-23-2024-usaid-and-unicef-launch-150-million-backed-partnership-lead-free-future)
    toward this effort—at least 10 times the average estimated annual
    investment to combat lead exposure internationally over the past
    five years.
-   Earlier this year, USAID, through its Enterprises for Development,
    Growth, and Empowerment (EDGE) Fund, provided $5 million to the
    [Lead Exposure Elimination Project
    (LEEP)](https://leadelimination.org/) to accelerate the global
    transition to lead-free paint. Spanning over 30 countries in Africa,
    Asia, Latin America, Central Asia, and Europe, the LEEP partnership
    will support governments in introducing lead paint regulations and
    demonstrate how the private sector can reduce lead exposure, saving
    lives and protecting communities.
