title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Election of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker\
  \ of the\_House"

Jill and I congratulate Kevin McCarthy on his election as Speaker of the
House.  
   
The American people expect their leaders to govern in a way that puts
their needs above all else, and that is what we need to do now.    
   
As I said after the midterms, I am prepared to work with Republicans
when I can and voters made clear that they expect Republicans to be
prepared to work with me as well.  Now that the leadership of the House
of Representatives has been decided it is time for that process to
begin.

Today we learned that my plan to build an economy that works from the
bottom up and the middle out has achieved the lowest unemployment rate
in 50 years. And that we made 2021 and 2022 the best years for job
growth on record.   
   
It’s imperative that we continue that economic progress, not set it
back.  It is imperative that we protect Social Security and Medicare,
not slash them.  It is imperative that we defend our national security,
not defund it.  These are some of the choices before us.  
   
As the last two years show, we can do profound things for the country
when we do them together.  
   
For example, this week I travelled to Kentucky to highlight the growing
benefits that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is bringing to
communities all over the country.  
   
This is a time to govern responsibly and to ensure that we’re putting
the interests of American families first.
