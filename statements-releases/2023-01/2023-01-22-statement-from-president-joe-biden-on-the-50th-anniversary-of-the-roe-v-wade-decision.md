title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 50th Anniversary of the Roe v.\
  \ Wade\_Decision"

Today, instead of commemorating the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the
Supreme Court’s decision in *Roe v. Wade*, we are acknowledging that
last year, the Supreme Court took away a constitutional right from the
American people.  
   
Since the Supreme Court’s decision, Americans, time and time again, have
made their voices heard:  women should be able to make these deeply
personal decisions free from political interference. Yet, Republicans in
Congress and across the country continue to push for a national abortion
ban, to criminalize doctors and nurses, and to make contraception harder
to access. It’s dangerous, extreme, and out of touch.   
   
I’ll continue to fight to protect a woman’s right to choose. Congress
must restore the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in federal law – it’s the
only way we can fully secure a woman’s right to choose in every state.
