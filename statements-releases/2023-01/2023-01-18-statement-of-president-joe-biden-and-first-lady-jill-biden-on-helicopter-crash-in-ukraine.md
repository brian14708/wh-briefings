  \ Crash in\_Ukraine"

Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families of all those
killed in the tragic helicopter crash in Ukraine this morning, including
Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrskyy and other senior
Ukrainian government officials. Our hearts are also with the dozens of
civilians who were killed or injured, including precious children, and
their families.  We grieve with all those who are mourning this
heartbreaking tragedy.  Mr. Monastyrskyy and his team were deeply
involved in the preservation of Ukraine’s democracy—both its defense
against Russian aggression, and the vital work of reforms to strengthen
Ukraine’s institutions through this war and into the future.  A reformer
and patriot, Mr. Monastyrskyy championed the will of the Ukrainian
people. We will continue to honor that legacy through efforts to
strengthen Ukraine’s institutions, and in our unfailing partnership with
the people of Ukraine to keep the flame of freedom bright.  Today, we
are praying for healing for the wounded and comfort for those who have
lost loved ones.  The United States stands with the people of Ukraine in
the face of this tragedy, and for as long as it takes.
