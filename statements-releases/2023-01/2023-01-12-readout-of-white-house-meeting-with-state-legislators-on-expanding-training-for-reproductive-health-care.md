title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Legislators on Expanding Training\
  \ for Reproductive Health\_Care"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the
President and Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental
Affairs, chaired a working meeting with state legislators from 11 states
on actions to expand training opportunities for reproductive health care
providers.  
  
Since the Supreme Court’s decision overturning *Roe v. Wade*, extremist
officials in more than a dozen states are enforcing laws that make it a
crime for health care professionals to provide abortion care. Beyond the
devastating impact on women, state abortion bans jeopardize the ability
to train the next generation of medical providers on routine,
evidence-based reproductive health care. Many new physicians may not be
able to receive the training they need to provide essential and timely
health care services, such as care for pregnancy loss.  
  
In the meeting, state legislators shared steps they are taking to expand
access to training for reproductive health care providers. California
has enacted legislation and allocated $20 million to fund targeted
provider recruitment, retention, and training. Maryland and New Jersey
have also allocated funds to support clinical training, and states
across the country are building on existing steps to support
reproductive health care providers. Just this week, Illinois passed a
comprehensive reproductive rights package including provisions to grant
out-of-state practitioners a temporary license to practice in Illinois
under certain circumstances.  
  
White House Senior Officials thanked the state leaders for their work
and ongoing partnership with the White House to protect access to
reproductive health care. Their leadership stands in stark contrast to
Republican elected officials focused on banning abortion and
criminalizing providers.  
  
State leaders included:

-   California Assemblywoman Cottie Petrie-Norris
-   Connecticut Representative Matt Blumenthal
-   Delaware Senator Kyle Gay
-   Illinois Representative Kelly Cassidy
-   Maryland Delegate Ariana Kelly
-   Massachusetts Representative Aaron Michlewitz
-   Nevada Assemblymember Michelle Gorelow
-   New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs Acting Director Cari Fais
-   New Mexico Senator Linda Lopez
-   New York Senator Liz Krueger
-   Oregon Representative Andrea Valderrama
