title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Meetings\
  \ with Congressional\_Leaders"
---
 
President Biden looks forward to meeting with Speaker McCarthy to
discuss a range of issues, as part of a series of meetings with all new
Congressional leaders to start the year. 

Like the President has said many times, raising the debt ceiling is not
a negotiation; it is an obligation of this country and its leaders to
avoid economic chaos. Congress has always done it, and the President
expects them to do their duty once again.  That is not negotiable.

As for the broad economic debate in our country, the Speaker and his
allies have said that they have a fiscal plan to cut Social Security,
cut Medicare, cut other vital programs, and impose a 30 percent national
sales tax. 

The President looks forward to learning more about those plans, as well
as to telling them about his plan to cut the deficit – beyond the
historic $1.7 trillion we have delivered – strengthen retirement
programs, invest in key priorities, and fund it all by making the
wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. 

We are going to have a clear debate on two different visions for the
country – one that cuts Social Security, and one that protects it – and
the President is happy to discuss that with the Speaker.
