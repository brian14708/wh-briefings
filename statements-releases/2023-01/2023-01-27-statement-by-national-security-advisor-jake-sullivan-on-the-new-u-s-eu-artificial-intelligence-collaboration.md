Today, the United States and the European Union signed an administrative
arrangement to bring together experts from across the U.S. and Europe to
further research on artificial intelligence (AI), computing, and related
privacy protecting technologies, as underscored in the [U.S.-EU Trade
and Technology Council (TTC)
commitment](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/05/u-s-eu-joint-statement-of-the-trade-and-technology-council/).
This collaborative effort will drive responsible advancements in AI to
address major global challenges with a joint development model and
integrated research to deliver benefits to our societies through five
key areas of focus: Extreme Weather and Climate Forecasting, Emergency
Response Management, Health and Medicine Improvements, Electric Grid
Optimization, and Agriculture Optimization. Together, we are confident
the results of our research will extend beyond our partnership to
benefit additional international partners and the global science
community. Today’s announcement also builds on the vision set forth in
the [Declaration for the Future of the Internet
(DFI)](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/28/fact-sheet-united-states-and-60-global-partners-launch-declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet/)
for an open, free, reliable, and secure Internet and digital
technologies around the world. We look forward to deepening our
cooperation with the EU through this initiative.
