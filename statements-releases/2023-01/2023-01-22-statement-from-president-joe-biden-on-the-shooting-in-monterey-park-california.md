title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Shooting in Monterey Park,\_California"
---
 
Jill and I are thinking of those killed and injured in last night’s
deadly mass shooting in Monterey Park. While there is still much we
don’t know about the motive in this senseless attack, we do know that
many families are grieving tonight, or praying that their loved one will
recover from their wounds.

Even as we continue searching for answers about this attack, we know how
deeply this attack has impacted the AAPI community. Monterey Park is
home to one of the largest AAPI communities in America, many of whom
were celebrating the Lunar New Year along with loved ones and friends
this weekend.

Early this morning, I directed my Homeland Security Advisor to mobilize
full federal support to local and state authorities as they continue to
respond and investigate this shooting. As we await more crucial
information from law enforcement, I want to assure the community of
Monterey Park and the broader area that we will support you in every way
we can.
