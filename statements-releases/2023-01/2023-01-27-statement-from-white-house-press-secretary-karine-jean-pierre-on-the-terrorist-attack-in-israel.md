title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Terrorist\
  \ Attack in\_Israel"

We strongly condemn the heinous terror attack that took place this
evening at a synagogue in Jerusalem, and are shocked and saddened by the
loss of life, including the killing of at least eight innocent
victims. The attack tragically occurred on International Holocaust
Remembrance Day, when the memory of those lost in the Holocaust is
commemorated around the world. The United States will extend our full
support to the Government and people of Israel. Accordingly, the
President has directed his national security team to engage immediately
with Israeli counterparts to offer all appropriate support in assisting
the wounded and bringing the perpetrators of this horrible crime to
justice.
