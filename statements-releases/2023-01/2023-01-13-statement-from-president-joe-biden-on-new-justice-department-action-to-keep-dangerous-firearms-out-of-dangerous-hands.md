title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on New Justice Department Action to Keep\
  \ Dangerous Firearms Out of Dangerous\_Hands"
---
 
Keeping especially dangerous firearms off our streets reduces gun
violence and saves lives. Today, the U.S. Department of Justice
finalized a rule to keep another type of especially dangerous weapon out
of dangerous hands – pistols with attached stabilizing braces that turn
the firearms into short-barreled rifles.

For decades, the federal government has placed stricter regulations on
short-barreled rifles than other firearms because short-barreled rifles
are accurate – like rifles – and concealable and easily maneuvered –
like pistols. The gun industry has recently attempted to circumvent this
long-standing federal law by selling stabilizing braces that essentially
convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle. Families and communities
across the country have paid the price. Dayton, Ohio– nine killed and 27
injured outside of a bar. Boulder, Colorado – 10 killed at a grocery
store.

The Justice Department is taking action to close this loophole and
regulate these pistols with stabilizing braces as the dangerous weapons
they are, and make it harder for individuals intending to inflict
carnage to obtain these weapons.

Today’s action will save lives. It builds on my Administration’s already
historic record of executive action to reduce gun violence, and the
enactment of the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in
nearly three decades. But there is so much more to do. As I said when
celebrating the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we must
seize the momentum and continue to act – including by once again banning
assault weapons.
