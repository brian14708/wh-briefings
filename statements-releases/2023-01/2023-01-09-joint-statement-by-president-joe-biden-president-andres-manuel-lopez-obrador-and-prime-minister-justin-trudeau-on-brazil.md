Canada, Mexico, and the United States condemn the January 8 attacks on
Brazil’s democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power. We stand with
Brazil as it safeguards its democratic institutions. Our
governments support the free will of the people of Brazil. We look
forward to working with President Lula on delivering for our countries,
the Western Hemisphere, and beyond.
