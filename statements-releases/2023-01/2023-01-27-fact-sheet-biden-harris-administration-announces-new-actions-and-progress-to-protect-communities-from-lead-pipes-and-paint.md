title: "FACT SHEET:\_ Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions and\
  \ Progress to Protect Communities From Lead Pipes and\_Paint"
---
 
Today, at a White House Summit on Accelerating Lead Pipe Replacement
hosted by Vice President Harris, the Biden-Harris Administration
announced new actions and progress to deliver clean drinking water,
replace lead pipes, and remediate lead paint to protect children and
communities across America. Through historic levels of funding from
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue
Plan, annual appropriations, and harnessing a variety of  tools across
federal, state, and local government, the Administration is delivering
tangible progress on the groundbreaking [Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and
Paint Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/)
announced in December of 2021. The Biden-Harris Administration is
working aggressively to replace all lead service lines in America in the
next decade.  
  
Today’s White House Summit will feature discussions with state and local
officials, along with water utility, labor union, and nongovernmental
partners, on reducing risks to public health posed by lead pipes. The
following actions are being announced:

-   Vice President Harris is announcing a new [**Biden-Harris Get the
    Lead Out
    Partnership**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/briefing-room/2023/01/26/biden-harris-get-the-lead-out-partnership/)
    comprised of state and local officials, water utilities, labor
    unions, and other nongovernmental organizations who have committed
    to advance and accelerate lead pipe replacement. The Vice President
    sent a letter to Governors across the country calling on them to
    join the new partnership, deploy the federal funding available in
    their state, and ensure investments reach overburdened and
    underserved communities.  
-   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in collaboration with the
    Department of Labor (DOL), is announcing a new partnership with four
    states—Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—to
    create [**“Lead Service Line Replacement
    Accelerators**](https://www.epa.gov/water-infrastructure/lead-service-line-replacement-accelerators)**”**
    to drive progress on removing lead service lines.  This action will
    enhance the effectiveness of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    investments to advance progress on President Biden’s goal of
    removing of lead pipes all across America.

In addition, today, EPA is announcing $1.2 billion in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law revolving loan funds have already reached 23 states
for lead service line identification and replacement.   
  
**MAJOR NEW ACTIONS**  
  
**New** **Biden-Harris Get the Lead Out Partnership in collaboration
with 100+ state and local leaders, nongovernmental organizations, water
utilities, labor unions, and others**:  Today, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing an innovative partnership to leverage
existing efforts and funding to meet our commitment to accelerate the
replacement of lead service lines and pipes by the end of the decade
while creating good paying jobs and prioritizing lead remediation
efforts in overburdened and underserved communities. The Biden-Harris
Get the Lead Out Partnership is a coalition of federal government,
states, Tribes, local communities, water utilities, labor unions, and
nongovernmental organizations that has committed to advance a shared set
of principles to accelerate lead service line replacement.  The
inaugural 100+ members of the Partnership are listed at the bottom of
this factsheet.  
  
**Announcing the Creation of Lead Service Line Replacement
Accelerators:**  Today, EPA is excited to unveil a new initiative—its
“Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Accelerators.” This initiative
will be launched in partnership with Department of Labor, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to provide targeted technical
assistance services to communities to make progress on replacing lead
pipes that pose risk to the health of children and families. Through the
LSLR Accelerators initiative, EPA will provide hands-on support to guide
communities through the process of lead service line removals, from
start to finish. Technical assistance services will include technical
assistance in developing lead service line replacement plans, conducting
inventories to identify lead pipes, increasing community outreach and
education efforts, and supporting applications for Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funding. This will result in more communities
accessing their fair share of federal funds to secure a lead-free
future. Partnership is core to the LSLR Accelerators initiative. EPA
will collaborate each step of the way with the four partner states and
support them in strategically deploying funding from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and seeking innovative ways to accelerate lead pipe
removal. As this program moves forward, EPA and Department of Labor will
collaborate to provide tools aimed at increasing job quality standards,
equity, and resources to accelerate the development of the skilled water
workforce needed to undertake these community and system-wide lead
service line replacement programs. This initiative will include the
development of best practices and creative approaches that can serve as
a roadmap for the rest of the country.  
  
**GETTING RESOURCES TO COMMUNITIES**

**$1.2 Billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Being Utilized
for Lead Pipe Replacement in 23 States, Tribes, and Territories:** 
Today, EPA is announcing that $1.2 billion in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law revolving loan funds has already reached 23 states
for lead service line identification and replacement. The 2022
allocation was the first of five years of nearly $15 billion in
dedicated EPA funding for lead service lines that states will receive
through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In May 2022, EPA also
[announced the 2022
allocation](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-additional-19-billion-state-revolving-loan-funds-water-infrastructure)
of $1.9 billion from the $11.7 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
funding from the general Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF),
which can be used to support lead service line removal, along with other
drinking water infrastructure projects.  EPA anticipates releasing the
2023 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law DWSRF allotments, based on the
results of the 7<sup>th</sup> Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey
Assessment, this spring.

**Removing Lead in Private and Federally Assisted Housing**. Earlier
this month, HUD made available $568 million to address [lead-based paint
and additional housing-related
hazards](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_012)
through two Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) that will make
homes healthier and safer for low-income families. The first NOFO
provides over $403 million in grants to state and local governments for
improving health and safety in privately-owned older (pre-1978) homes of
low-income families under HUD’s Lead Hazard Reduction Grant Program—one
of the program’s largest health and safety funding opportunities to date
for privately-owned housing. The second funding notice provides $165
million in grants to Public Housing Agencies for improving health and
safety in public housing—the largest health and safety investment to
date for public housing. With this investment, since 1993, HUD has made
more than $2.7 billion available to protect children, families, and
individuals from exposure to lead and other hazards in their homes. In
2023, HUD will invest an additional $290 million for health and safety
improvements in privately-owned housing.  
  
**Clarifying State, Local, and Tribal governments Can Use Fiscal
Recovery Funds—the $350  Billion in Aid Provided Under the American
Rescue Plan—for Replacing Lead Service Lines and Protecting Communities
Against Lead in Water:** In January 2022, the Treasury Department
[issued the final
rule](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/SLFRF-Final-Rule-Overview.pdf)
addressing the use of State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds, which
provided for an expanded set of eligible lead remediation uses,
including replacement of faucets and fixtures in schools and child care
centers, and confirms recipients’ ability to use funds for the
replacement of lead services lines. Recipients had budgeted over $345
million in American Rescue Plan funds for lead remediation projects as
of September 30, 2022. Examples include:

-   Washington D.C. has budgeted $30 million to increase funding
    available to assist residents in replacing lead water service lines
    to their homes.
-   Rochester, NY, has budgeted $21.5 million to replace lead service
    lines.
-   Bay City, MI obligated $6 million to remove lead pipes in the city
    by hiring a crew of four new Water Department employees that will be
    solely dedicated to lead service line replacement. 

**Directing Federal Agencies to Leverage Existing Funding:** In March,
for the first time, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) [formulated a
preliminary lead pipes
crosscut](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/analytical-perspectives/)
of existing funding for the Fiscal Year 2023 President’s Budget. The
crosscut will be updated for the 2024 budget. In January 2023, OMB
issued guidance to agencies to leverage and prioritize existing funding
to achieve the President’s lead remediation goal, while directing 40
percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities and ensuring the
replacement of entire lead service lines.  
  
**Leveraging USDA Funding to Mitigate Lead:** As of January 20, 2021,
USDA has awarded a total of $132 million in loans and grants for
projects dealing with lead, including $78.2 million being announced
today to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water. These awards include
funding for: the City of Bloomer, Wisconsin, for a water and sewer
upgrade and replacement of 20,000 feet of lead-jointed water mains; the
Anson Madison Water District in Maine to mitigate lead exposure for
3,700 residents; the city of Linwood, Kansas to replace 75 water service
lines with lead joints; the Village of Elberta, Michigan to improve
their water system, with 79 percent of service lines estimated to be
lead; and Columbus County, North Carolina, for the construction and cost
overrun of a new replacement school facility housing Pre-K through 8th
grade. Many of these projects utilize funding from various sources,
including HUD and state-provided funding.   
  
**Issuing Guidance to States and Communities to Support Lead Service
Line Removal:**  EPA’s March 2022 [ Bipartisan Infrastructure Law State
Revolving Fund (SRF) implementation
memo](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-03/combined_srf-implementation-memo_final_03.2022.pdf)
highlights the flexibility provided to states and borrowers to address
lead in drinking water, the creation of dedicated funding to remove lead
service lines, and the priority of ensuring that disadvantaged
communities benefit equitably from this investment. The memo also:

-   Emphasizes that 49 percent of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds
    provided through the DWSRF must be provided as grants and forgivable
    loans to disadvantaged communities
-   Clarifies that any project funded under the $15 billion Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law   appropriation for the replacement of lead
    service lines must replace the entire line, not just a portion,
    unless a portion has already been replaced.

EPA also [released additional
guidance](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-issues-guidance-help-communities-locate-lead-pipes-can-contaminate-drinking-water)
that will help communities and water utilities identify lead pipes that
connect drinking water service to homes and other buildings by
developing and maintaining service line inventories, support
notifications to consumers served by lead pipes, and provide states with
information on oversight and reporting to EPA.  
  
**PROTECTING COMMUNITIES FROM LEAD WITH TESTING & ENFORCEMENT**  
  
**Helping to Close Gaps in Childhood Lead Testing:** In October 2021,
CDC updated the Blood Lead Reference Value (BLRV) to 3.5 micrograms per
deciliter of blood based on the most recent National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey data. Over the past year, 21 states have
changed their laws or policies to provide case management or other
services to children with blood lead levels higher than the updated BLRV
of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter. As a result of this action, more
children are receiving early intervention to prevent additional lead
exposure and its associated harms. CDC also provides funding to 62
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Programs, which support blood lead
testing and reporting, enhanced surveillance, and establishing linkages
of lead-exposed children to recommended services. CDC used increased
funding provided in 2022 to support additional capacity-building awards
for currently unfunded jurisdictions. CDC will continue efforts to
expand direct assistance to additional states and territories until all
at-risk children live in a jurisdiction where a safety-net childhood
lead poisoning prevention program exists.

**Advancing Regulations to Protect Communities from Lead in Drinking
Water and Paint:** EPA has taken several steps in the process of
proposing the [Lead and Copper Rule Improvements
(LCRI)](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/review-national-primary-drinking-water-regulation-lead-and-copper).
EPA is actively engaging in multiple consultations and stakeholder
engagement activities prior to proposing the LCRI. Key activities
include tribal consultation, consultations with the National Drinking
Water Advisory Committee and its Science Advisory Board and
[environmental justice
engagements](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-opportunities-public-input-environmental-justice-lead-and-copper-rule).
In addition, HUD is in the process of implementing its Lead Safe Housing
Rule that eliminates or mitigates lead-based paint hazards through its
housing rehabilitation assistance.

**DECREASING LEAD EXPOSURE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES**

**Reducing Lead Exposures and Disparities in Communities:** On October
27, 2022, EPA
[released](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/FactSheet-StrategyToReduceLeadExposure.pdf)
its Strategy to Reduce Lead Exposures and Disparities in U.S.
Communities in conjunction with National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.
This first-ever, agency-wide lead strategy outlines how EPA will utilize
its full suite of authorities, expertise, and resources to reduce lead
exposure in communities overburdened by pollution and advance the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to environmental justice and
equity.

**Tracking the Benefits of Lead Pipe and Paint Investments in line with
Justice40:** To meet the [President’s
commitment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/)
to target 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean energy
investments to disadvantaged communities, OMB and Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) are committing to track and make publicly
available lead pipe and paint investments to disadvantaged communities.
In November 2022, CEQ
[released](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2022/11/22/biden-harris-administration-launches-version-1-0-of-climate-and-economic-justice-screening-tool-key-step-in-implementing-president-bidens-justice40-initiative/)
Version 1 of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST),
which helps identify disadvantaged communities.

**ADVANCING LEAD REMEDIATION IN SCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE CENTERS**  
  
To achieve the President’s commitment to reduce lead exposure in the
400,000 schools and child care facilities at risk of exposure, the
Action Plan called for the development of a Cabinet Level Partnership
for Lead Remediation in Schools and Child Care Centers. This partnership
between the EPA, Department of Education, Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), and USDA will continue to make progress on lead
remediation in schools and child care centers—safeguarding the health
and well-being of a generation of young people. Developments from the
last year of this Interagency Partnership include:

-   In October 2022, EPA
    [announced](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-30-million-grants-projects-reduce-lead-drinking-water-disadvantaged)
    projects in disadvantaged communities that have been selected to
    receive over $30 million in grant funding under WIIN. This grant
    funding will assist schools with removing sources of lead in
    drinking water. 
-   USDA has awarded funding for community facilities, single family
    housing repair, and educational institutions to address this issue.
    Examples include:
    -   $9.5 million to Columbus County, North Carolina, for the
        construction and cost overrun of a new replacement school
        facility housing Pre-K through 8th grade. This new facility
        replaces two facilities that contained asbestos and lead paint.
    -   $6 million for Anson Madison Water District in Maine in
        low-interest loans and $3.5 million in grants to mitigate lead
        exposure for 3,700 residents, including at schools.
-   The Department of Education will continue to show leadership in
    healthy, sustainable, 21st century school environments by gathering
    [commitments](https://forms.office.com/g/sczdcLZXbz) for school
    infrastructure and sustainability.
-   EPA and the Office of Head Start, Office of Child Care, held a
    [three-part joint webinar
    series](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/technical-and-case-study-presentations-reducing-lead-drinking-water-schools-and-child)
    on “Implementing a 3Ts Program for Lead in Water Testing Throughout
    Child Care and Early Childhood Facilities.”

The inaugural partners are also making the following announcements to
accelerate the replacement of lead service lines and pipes by the end of
the decade while creating good paying jobs and prioritizing lead
remediation efforts in overburdened and underserved communities

-   **Denver Water** is announcing that it was recently approved for $76
    million from the Colorado Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which
    will receive money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The
    funding will help fast-track the program, replacing thousands more
    customer-owned lead service lines in the next few years than had
    been originally anticipated. Since the lead reduction program
    started in January 2020, Denver Water has replaced more than 15,000
    customer-owned lead service lines, prioritizing the replacement work
    areas where there are vulnerable, at-risk populations and
    disproportionately impacted communities. The lead lines are replaced
    with lead-free, copper lines at no direct cost to the customer.  
-   **The City of Wausau and Wausau Water Works** is announcing its
    commitment to map the city’s lead service lines and create a
    strategy for replacing 100 percent of its public and private lead
    service lines. Wausau is using both resources received from ARPA and
    BIL to achieve this success.  
-   **The Town Council and Water Department in Bethlehem** are
    announcing today a goal of replacing 100 percent of their lead pipes
    over the coming decade. The Town of Bethlehem is working on its LSL
    inventory using operational funds. Of the 12,000 water services in
    the town, service line material has been confirmed in approximately
    6,800 of the public-side service lines and 3,600 of the private-side
    service lines.  
-   **The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation** is announcing that it awarded
    over $15 million in grants and investments to support water equity
    efforts because access to safe, affordable water is a cornerstone of
    a healthy community. The Foundation is working with a wide range of
    leaders and changemakers to make sure that new investments in water
    infrastructure reach and are informed by communities that have been
    historically marginalized – ensuring that access to safe water is
    realized in the places that often experience the biggest barriers to
    health and wellbeing.  
-   **BlueConduit** is announcing that it is building the first ever
    national lead service line inventory and will publish it as an
    open-sourced nationwide map in 2023. This mapping will enable
    utilities to locate lead lines more accurately, accelerating the
    removal of lead and lowering the cost per successful replacement.
    BlueConduit is using data science to find lead pipes and has applied
    machine learning models across over 100 communities and water
    systems in 15 states.  
-   **Environmental Policy Innovation Center (EPIC)** announced today
    that it will support 50 overburdened communities across the country
    over the next three years in their lead service line replacement
    efforts. This includes help in developing lead pipe inventories and
    applying for federal funds, and assistance from everything from
    community outreach, to project prioritization, to technical help
    planning an implementation strategy for pipe replacement.  
-   **The State of New Jersey** is announcing that it will identify and
    replace all lead service lines statewide by 2031 through
    implementation of the 2021 Lead Service Line Replacement Law.  New
    Jersey will also propose and seek to adopt a new State Lead and
    Copper Rule that will ensure proactive lead risk analysis and
    reduction measures by all drinking water systems as the State
    pursues the longer-term replacement of all lead service lines
    statewide.  The State is also committing to develop and deploy
    State-sponsored technical assistance programs to support communities
    with lead service line inventory assistance, the development of lead
    service line replacement plans, and the sequencing of eligible
    projects for Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Drinking Water State
    Revolving Fund investment.  
-   **The City of Evanston** is announcing a recently adopted workforce
    development program, hiring Evanston residents and training them on
    the skills needed for lead service line replacement and street
    restoration, implemented in partnership with its youth outreach team
    and augmenting that team’s violence prevention work.  
-   **The City of Albany** is announcing that it will remove its
    remaining 12,000 lead service lines by 2034. The city used $500,000
    from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding to assist the city
    in removing more than 700 full lead services since 2019.  
-   **The City of Rochester** is announcing that it will replace all
    remaining lead service lines (both public and private) by 2030. The
    City has already replaced 5,229 public lines and 106 public and
    private lead service lines, funded to-date by Federal ARPA dollars,
    Department of Health and the City’s own investments. The work has
    been prioritized in areas where people are most at risk, as nearly
    two-thirds of Rochester’s lead service lines are located in
    disadvantaged neighborhoods.  
-   **The Village of Hazel Crest** recently approved a resolution to
    remove all lead service lines within the Village. It won a
    commitment from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
    for $4 million in principal loan forgiveness to begin the work of
    replacing the village’s 2,700 lead service lines, and has made a
    commitment to prioritizing its most vulnerable residents in its lead
    pipe replacement plan.  
-   **The City of Edgerton** is highlighting its new city resolution to
    replace all remaining private lead lines in 2024 using Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law funding and funds provided by water utility rate
    payers. With more than $1 million in principal forgiveness funding
    provided by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to date,
    the City of Edgerton has replaced 75 percent of its private lead
    service lines in the last two construction seasons.
