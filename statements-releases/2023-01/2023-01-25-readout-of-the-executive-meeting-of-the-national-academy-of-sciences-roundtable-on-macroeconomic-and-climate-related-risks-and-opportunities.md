title: "Readout of the Executive Meeting of the National Academy of Sciences\u2019\
  \ Roundtable on Macroeconomic and Climate-related Risks and\_Opportunities"
---
 
This week, Council of Economic Advisers Member Heather Boushey, Office
of Management and Budget Chief Economist Zach Liscow, and other
officials from across the Biden-Harris Administration attended the
Executive Meeting of the [Roundtable on Macroeconomic and
Climate-related Risks and
Opportunities](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/roundtable-on-macroeconomics-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities) convened
by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

This Roundtable’s goal is to improve our understanding of how the
physical and transition effects of climate change relate to and affect
macroeconomic performance, in addition to exploring the implications for
fiscal, monetary, and financial stability policies. In attendance were
dozens of scholars and policymakers focused on the intersection of
climate change, macroeconomic modeling, and public policy.

The President knows that to address the serious challenges climate
change presents, we must take swift and bold action, which is why he has
set an ambitious goal of rapidly transitioning to a net-zero economy by
2050. To support this effort, the President’s [Executive Order on
Climate-Related Financial
Risk](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/15/fact-sheet-biden-administration-roadmap-to-build-an-economy-resilient-to-climate-change-impacts/) called
on the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and
Budget to “identify the primary sources of Federal climate-related
financial risk exposure and develop methodologies to quantify climate
risk within the economic assumptions and the long-term budget
projections of the President’s Budget.” New analytic tools to accurately
model the macro-economic effects of climate change and the energy
transition will enable policymakers to better anticipate, plan for, and
manage these emerging risks. To that end, for the first time in history,
the CEA and the OMB have formally accounted in the Federal budget for
risks of climate change by publishing two new assessments, [Federal
Budget Exposure to Climate
Risks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ap_21_climate_risk_fy2023.pdf)
and a new section in the [Long-Term Budget
Outlook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ap_3_long_term_fy2023.pdf) focused
on climate change. The first of these is supported by an [OMB white
paper](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OMB_Climate_Risk_Exposure_2022.pdf).
Additionally, the OMB and the CEA have [released a white
paper](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CEA_OMB_Climate_Macro_WP_2022.pdf) that
outlines how better modeling of the broader economic impacts of climate
change can help to quantify economic and fiscal impacts of climate
change and climate action. This ongoing analysis is supported by a new
cross-agency Interagency Technical Working Group.  
  
The [National Academies’ Roundtable on Macroeconomic and Climate-related
Risks and
Opportunities](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/roundtable-on-macroeconomics-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities) is
an essential component of this undertaking to fully account for climate
risk in macroeconomic projections. Building upon the productive
conversations of the [Inaugural Meeting of the Roundtable in October
2022](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/01/readout-of-the-inaugural-meeting-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-roundtable-on-macroeconomic-and-climate-related-risks-and-opportunities/),
this first public Executive Meeting brought scholars and policymakers
together to identify user capabilities and needs, discuss opportunities
for incorporating the effects of climate change into macroeconomic
models (as well as challenges and limitations of current modeling
tools), and evaluate policy pathways available to address climate risks
while accounting for socioeconomic equity, setting the agenda for this
work over the next year. While the Interagency Technical Working Group
is working in the near-term to further develop methodologies for the
integration of climate risks into the President’s budget using the
existing expertise and resources of the Federal Government, discussions
with the NAS Roundtable will provide guidance on longer-term work and
development of new tools and models to improve on these near-term
approaches.

Carla Frisch, U.S. Department of Energy  
Justina W. Gallegos, National Economic Council
