*Announces Funding for Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project and Other Major
Projects Across America  
*  
*Hudson Tunnel Project Will Result in 72,000 Good-Paying Jobs*

Continuing the progress implementing the Biden-Harris Administration’s
economic agenda, President Biden is visiting New York to announce
funding for a critical early phase of the Hudson Tunnel Project and Mega
grants for other major infrastructure projects across the country.  The
President will announce the Administration has awarded nearly $1.2
billion from the infrastructure law’s new National Infrastructure
Project Assistance discretionary grant program (Mega) for nine projects
across the country, including over $292 million to complete a critical
early phase of the Hudson Tunnel Project.

These infrastructure investments will create good-paying jobs –
including union jobs and jobs that do not require a college degree. The
projects will grow the economy, strengthen supply chains, improve
mobility for residents, and make our transportation systems safer for
all users.

This announcement comes on the heels of several other announcements of
funding for major infrastructure projects, including more than $2
billion to upgrade some our nation’s most economically significant
bridges such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the Brent-Spence Bridge
through the Bridge Investment Program and $1.5 billion for 26 major
projects through the INFRA program.    
  
These infrastructure improvements are a critical part of President
Biden’s economic agenda to build the economy from the bottom up and
middle out.

**<u>Hudson Tunnel Project  
</u>**  
President Biden will announce a $292 million Mega grant to Amtrak for
Hudson Yards Concrete Casing, Section 3. This funding is part of a $649
million early phase project that will complete the final section of
concrete casing intended to preserve future right-of-way for the new
passenger rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The concrete casing
protects the path of the new tunnel from Penn Station to the Hudson
River’s edge.  If this casing were not built now, the foundations from
the new Hudson Yards development would likely impede the path of the
tunnel and make the project extremely difficult.  
  
The overall [Hudson Tunnel
Project](https://www.amtrak.com/hudson-tunnel) is an over $16 billion
investment that will improve resilience, reliability, and redundancy for
New Jersey Transit (NJ Transit) and Amtrak train service between New
York and New Jersey.  The project will reduce commute times for NJ
Transit riders, enhance Amtrak reliability on the Northeast Corridor
(NEC), and support the northeast regional economy. Amtrak expects the
Hudson Tunnel Project will result in 72,000 direct and indirect jobs
during construction with union partnerships for job training. 

The existing North River Tunnel is over 100 years old, built to early
20<sup>th</sup> century standards, opened for service in 1910, and is
the only passenger rail tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. It
facilitates more than 200,000 passenger trips per weekday on more than
450 Amtrak and NJ Transit trains servicing New York Penn Station. The
tunnel has reached its full capacity of 24 trains per hour, causing
bottlenecks and delays. The tunnel has two tubes with one track each. 
When one goes out of service for any reason, trains have to wait to go
through the working tube.  This creates headaches for NJ Transit
commuters and Amtrak travelers and delays that cascade up and down the
Northeast Corridor. In 2020, passengers experienced 12,653 minutes of
delay due to problems caused by aging tunnel infrastructure. Delays
occurred on 54 different days in 2020 and were attributed to a variety
of causes involving the electrical power, signal and track systems.

In 2012, millions of gallons of salt water flooded into the tunnel
during Superstorm Sandy. Even today, the remnants of seawater that
entered the tunnel in 2012 continue to harm the concrete, steel, tracks
and third rail, signaling, and electrical components within the tunnel.
Today the tunnel requires regular, and occasional emergency, maintenance
that disrupts service for hundreds of thousands of riders throughout the
region.  Rehabilitation of the tunnel would require a full closure,
which will only be possible if a second tunnel existed.

To address those challenges, the Hudson Tunnel Project will rehabilitate
the old North River Tunnel; build a new tunnel beneath the Palisades,
the Hudson River, and the waterfront area in Manhattan; construct new
surface alignment from Secaucus to the new tunnel portal in North
Bergen; construct ventilation shafts and fan plants in New Jersey and
New York; and make track modifications near Penn Station. When the
project is done, the redundant capacity provided by a second tunnel will
mean fewer delays and less risk for catastrophic disruption.

The project is part of the larger Gateway Program which envisions
expanding and rebuilding the rail line between Newark, New Jersey and
New York City through a number of projects, including the new [Portal
North
Bridge](https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2022-03/NJ-Portal-North-Bridge-Project-Profile-FY23.pdf),
which broke ground last year and is supported by $900 million in federal
funding.

Today’s Mega grant announcement is the first of several funding
announcements for the project expected this year and the most
significant federal funding for the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project to
date. 

The Administration is committed to providing the billions of dollars in
funding necessary to ensure that this critical project is completed.
Later this year, if and when additional milestones are met by the states
and other parties, a full funding agreement will be completed.

President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest
investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak, with a $66
billion investment in rail. After waiting years for new federal funding,
2023 will be a year in which major rail projects along the 450-mile
Northeast Corridor between Washington, DC, and Boston, receive their
first significant funding.

**<u>New Mega Project Grants  
</u>**  
The Mega grant program, created by the infrastructure law, funds
projects that are too large or complex for traditional funding programs.
Eligible projects include highway, bridge, freight, port, passenger
rail, and public transportation projects that are a part of one of the
other project types.   The Mega program will invest a total of $5
billion through 2026 to help rebuild the United States’ infrastructure
for the benefit of residents now and for generations to come.  
  
Beyond the Hudson Tunnel concrete casing project, the Administration is
announcing projects of regional and national economic significance that
are receiving Mega grant awards including:

-   $250 million for **the Brent Spence Bridge** connecting Kentucky and
    Ohio, part of a total investment of $1.6 Billion from the
    infrastructure law to build a new companion bridge and rehab an
    existing bridge along a major freight corridor on I-75. Earlier this
    month, the President and Senate Minority Leader McConnell visited
    the Brent Spence Bridge to announce this funding;
-   $150 million to the Louisiana Department of Transportation for **the
    Calcasieu River Bridge Replacement** which will increase capacity on
    a critical stretch of Interstate 10 which is an important freight
    route;
-   $117 million to the Metra Commuter Railroad in Illinois to make
    improvements on **the Metra Union Pacific-North line** on a two-mile
    corridor from the Addison to Fullerton rail bridges, replacing
    approximately 11 bridges, 4 miles of track structure, and more than
    1.75 miles of retaining walls along Metra’s UP-N line;
-   $110 to the North Carolina Department of Transportation to replace
    **the Alligator River Bridge** on U.S. Highway 64 with a modern
    high-rise fixed span bridge along the primary east-west route in
    northeastern North Carolina between I-95 and the Outer Banks;
-   $85 million to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation **for I-44
    and US-75 improvements** along a critical urban freight corridor
    near Tulsa, including vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle
    infrastructure improvements;
-   $78 million to the City of Philadelphia to make improvements along
    approximately 12.3 miles of **Roosevelt Boulevard**, from North
    Broad Street to the Bucks County line including making traffic
    signal upgrades, constructing intersection and roadway
    reconfigurations, constructing median barriers and pedestrian refuge
    islands, making corridor access management improvements,
    constructing complete streets improvements for accessibility,
    pedestrian, and bicycle improvements, as well as installing new
    business access and transit lanes;
-   $60 million to the Mississippi Department of Transportation to widen
    **I-10** in Harrison and Hancock counties along a major freight
    corridor of regional significance; and,
-   $30 million to the California Department of Transportation (Santa
    Cruz County) for the **Watsonville-Cruz Multimodal Corridor
    Program** which will construct approximately 2.5 miles of State
    Route 1 auxiliary lanes and a Bus on Shoulder facility between
    Freedom Boulevard and State Park Drive, construct approximately 1.25
    miles of the New Coastal Rail Trail within Santa Cruz Branch Rail
    Line right-of-way, and fund the purchase of 4 new zero-emission
    buses.
