title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on House Republicans\u2019 First Bill\
  \ Being a Giveaway to Rich Tax Cheats at the Expense of the Middle\_Class"
---
 
For decades, some of our nation’s wealthiest individuals and richest
corporations have failed to pay what they owe in taxes.  
   
Last year, President Joe Biden and I worked with Democrats in Congress
to finally make sure everyone pays their fair share to help fund our
schools, hospitals, military, and other critical priorities.  
   
Now, as one of their first acts in the majority, House Republicans are
rushing to undo that progress and allow too many millionaires,
billionaires, and corporations to cheat the system.  
   
As we have since we took office, President Biden and I will continue to
fight to make sure all people in our nation play by the same rules.
