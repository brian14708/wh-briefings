title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Border Enforcement\_\
  Actions"
---
 
*New Measures Leverage Success of Venezuela Enforcement Initiative to
Limit Disorderly and Unsafe Migration*

While the courts have prevented the Title 42 public health order from
lifting for now, the Biden-Harris Administration today is announcing new
enforcement measures to increase security at the border and reduce the
number of individuals crossing unlawfully between ports of entry. These
measures will expand and expedite legal pathways for orderly migration
and result in new consequences for those who fail to use those legal
pathways. They also draw on the success of the Venezuela initiative,
which launched in October 2022 and has resulted in a dramatic drop in
the number of Venezuelan nationals attempting to enter the United States
unlawfully.  
  
The Administration is also announcing that it is surging additional
resources to the border and the region, scaling up its anti-smuggling
operations, and expanding coordination and support for border cities and
non-governmental organizations. Importantly, the actions announced today
are being implemented in close partnership with Mexico and governments
across the Western Hemisphere.  
  
While these steps will help address some of the most acute challenges at
the Southwest border, they will not solve all of the problems in an
immigration system that has been broken for far too long. That can only
happen if Republicans in Congress who have spent the past two years
talking about border security quit blocking the comprehensive
immigration reform and border security measures President Biden proposed
on his first day in office, and opposing the billions of dollars in
additional funds the President has requested for border security and
management.  
  
Unlike some Republican officials playing political games and obstructing
real solutions to fix our broken immigration system, President Biden has
a plan and is taking action. Under the new enforcement measures
announced today, the Biden-Harris Administration will:  
  
**Impose New Consequences for Individuals who Attempt to Enter
Unlawfully**  
  
To facilitate a return to the processing of all noncitizens under Title
8 authorities when Title 42 eventually lifts, [the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS)
is](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/01/05/dhs-continues-prepare-end-title-42-announces-new-border-enforcement-measures-and):

-   **Increasing the Use of Expedited Removal.** Effective immediately,
    individuals who attempt to enter the United States without
    permission, do not have a legal basis to remain, and cannot be
    expelled pursuant to Title 42 will be increasingly subject to
    expedited removal to their country of origin and subject to a
    five-year ban on reentry.
-   **Announcing New Measures to Encourage Individuals to Seek Orderly
    and Lawful Pathways to Migration.** DHS and the Department of
    Justice today are announcing their intent to propose a new
    regulation that would encourage individuals to seek orderly and
    lawful pathways to migration and reduce overcrowding along the
    southwest border and the strain on the immigration system.  

**Expand Legal Pathways for Safe, Orderly, and Humane Migration**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration and its international partners in the
region are also announcing new and expanded legal pathways to the United
States and other countries that individuals can and should use to avoid
consequences for crossing the border unlawfully. These include:

-   **Expanding the Parole Process for Venezuelans to Nicaraguans,
    Haitians, and Cubans.** Today, the Biden Administration is
    announcing it will extend the successful Venezuela parole process
    and expand it to nationals of Nicaragua, Haiti, and Cuba. Up to
    30,000 individuals per month from these four countries, who have an
    eligible sponsor and pass vetting and background checks, can come to
    the United States for a period of two years and receive work
    authorization. Individuals who irregularly cross the Panama, Mexico,
    or U.S. border after the date of this announcement will be
    ineligible for the parole process and will be subject to expulsion
    to Mexico, which will accept returns of 30,000 individuals per month
    from these four countries who fail to use these new pathways.  
-   **Tripling Refugee Resettlement from the Western Hemisphere.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration intends to welcome up to 20,000 refugees
    from Latin American and Caribbean countries during Fiscal Years 2023
    and 2024, putting the United States on pace to *more than triple*
    refugee admissions from the Western Hemisphere this Fiscal Year
    alone. This delivers on the President’s commitment under the *Los
    Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection* to scale up
    refugee admissions from the Western Hemisphere.  
-   **Launching Online Appointment Portal to Reduce Overcrowding and
    Wait Times at U.S. Ports of Entry.**  When Title 42 eventually
    lifts, noncitizens located in Central and Northern Mexico seeking to
    enter the United States lawfully through a U.S. port of entry have
    access to the [CBP
    One](https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone) mobile
    application for scheduling an appointment to present themselves for
    inspection and to initiate a protection claim instead of coming
    directly to a port of entry to wait. This new feature will
    significantly reduce wait times and crowds at U.S. ports of entry
    and allow for safe, orderly, and humane processing.

-   **New Legal Pathways to Other Countries Across the Region.**
    Countries across the Western Hemisphere are delivering on their
    commitments under the *Los Angeles Declaration* to expand legal
    immigration pathways. Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Belize are
    each implementing new regularization or temporary protection
    policies to provide legal status to hundreds of thousands of
    migrants. Canada, Mexico, and Spain have expanded refugee
    resettlement and temporary work opportunities. Mexico and Guatemala
    have also significantly grown their asylum system. Individuals are
    encouraged to avail themselves of this wide range of legal pathways
    in the region and avoid the dangerous consequences of irregular
    migration.  
-   **Increasing Humanitarian Assistance in Mexico and Central
    America.** The United States is announcing today nearly $23 million
    in additional humanitarian assistance in Mexico and Central
    America. This new assistance will help governments in the region
    respond to the increased humanitarian and protection needs of
    migrants, refugees and other vulnerable populations in their
    care. Recognizing that no one country can respond to these needs
    alone, this assistance will help support shelter, health, legal
    assistance, mental health and psychosocial support, water,
    sanitation, hygiene products, gender-based violence response,
    livelihoods, other protection related activities, and capacity
    building for partners. 

**Surge Resources to Secure the Border, Disrupt Criminal Smuggling
Networks, and Support Border Communities**  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is surging resources and expanding
efforts to securely manage the border, disrupt the criminal smuggling
networks preying on vulnerable migrants, and support communities
receiving migrants as they await their immigration enforcement
proceedings. New and expanded efforts include:

-   **Mobilizing Record Resources for Safe, Orderly, and Humane
    Processing of Migrants.** The Biden Administration is marshalling
    available authorities and resources from across the Federal
    Government to help ensure the border is secure and well-managed when
    the Title 42 public health order eventually lifts. DHS and DOJ are
    surging asylum officers and immigration judges to review asylum
    cases at the border more quickly – with the aim of reducing initial
    processing times from months to days. The two agencies are also
    expanding capabilities and technologies to support faster
    processing, including by installing hundreds of phone lines and
    privacy booths to conduct these interviews and proceedings. DHS is
    also hiring and deploying additional agents and officers to join the
    over 23,000 already working to secure the border. In addition, DHS
    is significantly scaling up its air and ground transportation
    capabilities to quickly remove migrants when warranted or transport
    migrants to less-congested border sectors for further immigration
    enforcement proceedings.  
-   **Taking Thousands of Smugglers off the Streets and Countering
    Smuggler Misinformation.** In Los Angeles earlier this year,
    President Biden announced a first-of-its kind operation against the
    multi-billion-dollar human smuggling industry. Since April, this
    operation has led to over 7,300 arrests, forcing many criminal
    smuggling organizations out of business. The Administration is also
    taking on the smuggler misinformation. The Department of State is
    expanding its paid and earned media outreach to ensure timely and
    accurate information is reaching migrants. Messaging and outreach
    will target high out-migration communities and migrant routes
    through relevant communications channels (e.g., radio, digital,
    trusted partners, and more.) with an estimated reach of over 85
    million potential migrants  
-   **Expanding Coordination with and Support for Border Cities,
    Receiving Communities, and Non-Governmental Organizations.** The
    Biden-Harris Administration is increasing funding available to
    border cities and those cities receiving an influx of migrants, in
    addition to strengthening ongoing coordination and collaboration
    across all levels of government. DHS is also expanding outreach
    efforts with local jurisdictions to provide coordination of
    resources and technical assistance support and the Administration
    has been facilitating coordination between state and local officials
    and other federal agencies. Additionally, the Administration will
    continue to mobilize faith-based and non-profit organizations
    supporting migrants, including those providing temporary shelter,
    food, and humanitarian assistance before often reuniting with family
    as they await the outcome of their immigration proceedings.

The Biden-Harris Administration will do everything within its authority
and available resources to manage this challenge, but until and unless
Congress delivers the funding as well as comprehensive immigration
reform measures President Biden requested, the United States’ broken
immigration system will indeed remain broken.
