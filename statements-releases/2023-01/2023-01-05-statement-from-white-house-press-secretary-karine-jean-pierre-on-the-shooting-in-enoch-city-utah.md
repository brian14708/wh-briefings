title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Shooting\
  \ in Enoch City,\_Utah"

The President and First Lady are mourning with the Enoch City, Utah
community in the wake of a tragic shooting that has reportedly claimed
the lives of five children and multiple adults in their family home.  
   
Too many Americans have lost loved ones or had their lives forever
changed due to gun violence, and gun violence remains the leading cause
of death for children in America. Less than one month after we marked 10
years since the Sandy Hook tragedy, another mass shooting has claimed
the lives of five more children in Enoch City.  
   
President Biden has taken historic executive action to reduce gun
violence, including

to promote safe storage of firearms and prevent suicide. Last
summer, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
— the first significant piece of gun safety legislation in nearly 30
years. This Act helps communities implement new tools to reduce gun
violence, including extreme risk protection orders to temporarily remove
firearms from people determined to be a danger to themselves or others.
The President believes there is more to be done to keep our homes,
schools and communities safe, including enacting an assault weapons and
high-capacity magazine ban to get weapons of war off our streets,
requiring safe storage of firearms, and closing the dating violence
restraining order loophole in our gun background check system.
