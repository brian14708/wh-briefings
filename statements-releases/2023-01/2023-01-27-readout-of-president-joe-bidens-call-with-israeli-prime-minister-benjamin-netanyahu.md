President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to
discuss the horrific terror attack tonight in Jerusalem, which claimed
at least seven innocent Israeli lives. The President made clear that
this was an attack against the civilized world. He offered all
appropriate means of support to the Government and People of Israel over
the coming days. The President stressed the iron-clad U.S. commitment to
Israel’s security, and agreed that his team would remain in constant
touch with their Israeli counterparts.
