*Administration also launches Resident-Centered Housing Challenge, a
call-to-action to improve the quality of life for renters*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to
increase fairness in the rental market and further principles of fair
housing. These actions align with a new *[Blueprint for a Renters Bill
of
Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights.pdf)*
that the Administration is also releasing today. The Blueprint lays out
a set of principles to drive action by the federal government, state and
local partners, and the private sector to strengthen tenant protections
and encourage rental affordability. Key actions announced today include:

-   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Financial
    Protection Bureau (CFPB), both independent agencies, announced they
    will collect information to identify practices that unfairly prevent
    applicants and tenants from accessing or staying in housing in order
    to inform enforcement and policy actions under each agency’s
    jurisdiction. This is the first time the FTC has issued a request
    for information exploring unfair practices in the rental market. The
    two agencies will seek information on a broad range of practices
    that affect the rental market, including the creation and use of
    tenant background checks, the use of algorithms in tenant
    screenings, the provision of adverse action notices by landlords and
    property management companies, and how an applicant’s source of
    income factors into housing decisions.
-   The CFPB announced it will issue guidance and coordinate enforcement
    efforts with the FTC to ensure accurate information in the credit
    reporting system and to hold background check companies accountable
    for having unreasonable procedures.
-   The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an independent agency,
    announced it will launch a new public process to examine proposed
    actions promoting renter protections and limits on egregious rent
    increases for future investments. FHFA will maintain transparency
    throughout the process and provide periodic updates, including one
    within 6 months, to interested stakeholders. As announced in
    November, the FHFA will also increase affordability in the
    multifamily rental market by establishing requirements that
    encourage the financing of multifamily loans that guarantee
    affordable housing. In 2022, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae purchased a
    combined $142 billion in multifamily loans supporting over one
    million units. If the same activity holds in 2023, this would mean
    an investment in approximately 700,000 affordable units.
-   A U.S. Department of Justice workshop will inform potential guidance
    updates around anti-competitive information sharing, including in
    rental markets.
-   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will publish a
    notice of proposed rulemaking that would require public housing
    authorities and owners of project-based rental assistance properties
    to provide at least 30 days’ advanced notice before terminating a
    lease due to nonpayment of rent.
-   The Administration will hold quarterly meetings with a broad,
    diverse, and varying group of tenants and tenant advocates to ensure
    they continue to have a seat at the table and can share ambitious
    ideas to strengthen tenant protections.

These new announcements are part of a broader set of federal actions
that exemplify the principles laid out in the *Blueprint for a Renters
Bill of Rights*, which underscores key protections every renter
deserves:

-   **Safe, Quality, Accessible, and Affordable Housing:** Renters
    should have access to housing that is safe, decent, and affordable.
-   **Clear and Fair Leases:** Renters should have a clear and fair
    lease that has defined rental terms, rights, and responsibilities.
-   **Education, Enforcement, and Enhancement of Renter Rights:**
    Federal, state, and local governments should do all they can to
    ensure renters know their rights and to protect renters from
    unlawful discrimination and exclusion.
-   **The Right to Organize:** Renters should have the freedom to
    organize without obstruction or harassment from their housing
    provider or property manager.
-   **Eviction Prevention, Diversion, and Relief:** Renters should be
    able to access resources that help them avoid eviction, ensure the
    legal process during an eviction proceeding is fair, and avoid
    future housing instability.

In addition, the Administration is rallying state and local stakeholders
and private housing actors to drive further action to protect renters in
line with the Blueprint. **As part of this effort, the Administration is
launching the Resident-Centered Housing Challenge (Challenge),** a call
to action to housing providers and other stakeholders to strengthen
practices and make their own independent commitments that improve the
quality of life for renters. The Challenge, which will occur during the
Spring of 2023, also encourages states, local, Tribal, and territorial
governments to enhance existing policies and develop new ones that
promote fairness and transparency in the rental market. Early
commitments in support of the Challenge, which would affect over
15 million rental units, include:

-   *Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA)* and
    *Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency* *(PHFA)* have capped annual
    rental increases to 5 percent per year for federally or state
    subsidized affordable housing. Beginning in 2023, WHEDA policy
    applies to existing residents in properties utilizing state or
    federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits**. **PHFA applied this policy
    to their portfolio of 450 properties with PHFA funding in 2022.  
-   Members of the *Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future*
    (SAHF), which collectively own or manage 145,000 housing units
    across the U.S., commit to offer flexible payment plans for
    residents with unpaid rent who have engaged with property management
    and to provide the following notices and protections where permitted
    by local law and financing documents: at least 30 days’ notice to
    vacate for nonpayment of rent; at least 5 days to cure a missed rent
    payment; and 60 days’ notice to tenants of any proposed sale or
    closure of a property. SAHF also commits to launching a task force
    of its members to identify best practices for resident-centered
    practices and share resources with the field including model
    policies and procedures, sample notices, and case studies.
-   *Realtor.com Rentals* will pilot a new listing process through their
    DIY landlord product, *Avail*, highlighting units and landlords that
    indicate that they welcome Housing Choice Vouchers. Realtor.com will
    be able to share this information with its nearly 5 million monthly
    rentals search visitors. They will also ensure that more than 1.3
    million Avail renters have access to their application information
    so they can submit their application to multiple property owners on
    the platform without additional cost.
-   The *National Apartment Association* commits to promoting resident
    programming and practices, such as helping tenants build and improve
    credit through reporting of positive rent payments to credit
    bureaus, through their website, industry events and other content
    channels that reach a network of more over 95,000 members owning and
    operating more than 11.6 million apartment homes globally.
-   The *National Association of Realtors* and its affiliate, the
    *Institute of Real Estate Management*, commit to creating new
    resources for property managers in their network of 1.5 million
    members that highlight ways they can incorporate resident-centered
    property management practices in their businesses. Practices would
    include a range of examples that have proven effective, such as
    advertising to prospective residents that Housing Choice Vouchers
    are accepted at their property, providing information about rental
    assistance, and using alternative credit scores for applicants
    without a detailed credit history. 
-   The *National Multifamily Housing Council* commits to working with
    its 2,000 members to identify business standards that align with
    principles of resident-centered management practices, such as
    helping residents build credit, providing resource information to
    residents in financial distress, and communicating these practices
    through a new resource hub on its website.

The Administration welcomes additional commitments from interested
stakeholders to: pursue high-road practices aligned with the Blueprint
principles; create new benefits for residents that enhance their
economic mobility, build credit, and prepare them for homeownership;
reduce or eliminating rental “junk fees,” which are the hidden fees,
charges, and add-ons that take cash out of people’s pockets; expand
pathways to eviction mitigation and prevention; and enhance and increase
communication about tenant rights. To join the Challenge, interested

Over a third of the American population – 44 million households – rent
their homes. Before the pandemic, well over 2 million eviction fillings
and roughly 900,000 evictions occurred annually – disproportionately
affecting Black women and their children. Since then, rental housing has
become less affordable with some landlords taking advantage of market
conditions to pursue egregious rent increases.  Today’s announcements
recognize there are responsible housing providers – large and small,
national and local – willing to treat renters fairly, but it also holds
accountable those who exploit market realities at the cost of renters’
housing access and stability. 

Since taking office, the President has taken substantial steps to
promote fairness in the rental market and ease the burden of rental
costs for millions of American renters. The Administration kept the
national eviction moratorium in place until August 2021, which helped to
prevent over 1.5 million eviction filings nationwide. The Administration
has delivered over 8 million rental or utility assistance payments to
reduce renters’ risk of eviction or housing instability through
Emergency Rental Assistance programs and provided over $769 million for
housing stability services. Last May, the Administration released a
[Housing Supply Action
Plan,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/)
which set the goal of closing America’s housing supply shortfall in five
years. The Administration has been making progress advancing a
[long-term
goal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/budget_fy22.pdf)
of providing housing vouchers to all eligible households: the 2022 and
2023 President’s Budgets proposed to expand rental assistance to an
additional 200,000 households – and the Administration has secured
rental assistance to more than 100,000 households through the 2022 and
2033 appropriations bills and the American Rescue Plan. And, last week,
HUD published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on its efforts to
Affirmatively Further Fair Housing.
