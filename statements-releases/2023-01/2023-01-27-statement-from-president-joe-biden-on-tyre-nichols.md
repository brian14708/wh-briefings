title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Tyre\_Nichols"
---
 
Like so many, I was outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video
of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols’ death. It is yet another
painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the
exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single
day.   
   
My heart goes out to Tyre Nichols’ family and to Americans in Memphis
and across the country who are grieving this tremendously painful loss.
The footage that was released this evening will leave people justifiably
outraged. Those who seek justice should not to resort to violence or
destruction. Violence is never acceptable; it is illegal and
destructive. I join Mr. Nichols’ family in calling for peaceful
protest.   
   
I spoke with RowVaughn Wells and Rodney Wells, Mr. Nichols’ mother and
stepfather, this afternoon. There are no words to describe the
heartbreak and grief of losing a beloved child and young father. Nothing
can bring Mr. Nichols back to his family and the Memphis community. But
Mr. and Mrs. Wells, Mr. Nichols’ son, and his whole family deserve a
swift, full, and transparent investigation.   
   
We must do everything in our power to ensure our criminal justice system
lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment,
and dignity for all. Real and lasting change will only come if we take
action to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. That is
why I called on Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in Policing
Act to my desk. When Senate Republicans blocked that bill, I signed an
executive order that mandated stricter use of force standards and
accountability provisions for federal law enforcement, as well as
measures to strengthen accountability at the state and local level.
