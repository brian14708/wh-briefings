title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves California Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of California and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe winter storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides beginning on
December 27, 2022, and continuing.  
   
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Merced, Sacramento, and Santa Cruz.  
   
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the counties of Merced,
Sacramento, and Santa Cruz.  
   
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Andrew F. Grant as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   
   
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional areas
may be designated for assistance after the assessments are fully
completed.  
   
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
