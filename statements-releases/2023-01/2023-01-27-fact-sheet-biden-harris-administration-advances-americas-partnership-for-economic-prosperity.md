title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Americas Partnership\
  \ for Economic\_Prosperity"
---
 
*Newly announced initial partners represent about 90 percent of the
Western Hemisphere’s GDP*

At the opening ceremony of the Summit of the Americas, President Biden
announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (Americas
Partnership), a historic new initiative to drive the hemisphere’s
economic growth, tackle the core issues that will define the coming
decades, and galvanize greater economic cooperation in our
hemisphere.   
  
Today, Secretary of State Blinken and United States Trade Representative
Tai are moving this initiative forward with representatives from the
initial Western Hemisphere countries who will join them and endorse the
principles and high-level goals of the initiative. Those countries are
Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay. This significant group
represents about 90 percent of the Western Hemisphere’s GDP and nearly
two thirds of its people.  
  
The United States has deep economic ties in the region with existing
free trade agreements with nine of our initial partners. The Americas
Partnership will strengthen and expand our efforts to drive regional
economic growth by focusing on the drivers of bottom-up and middle-out
economic growth, good-quality jobs, and our competitiveness. Our
workers, our companies, and our people benefit from our close economic
ties and deep partnership with our closest neighbors. Through the
Americas Partnership, we will ensure that our hemisphere remains among
the most dynamic economic regions in the world.  
  
The Americas Partnership is a flexible framework and open to all
countries that share our values and vision for a prosperous hemisphere.
Following this announcement, we will move quickly toward execution of
the Americas Partnership, starting with preparations for future
negotiations on commitments and other areas of cooperation. We will
continue to consult closely with labor, environmental groups, civil
society, industry and businesses, and Congress as we make progress on
the President’s vision.  
  
The Americas Partnership will foster regional competitiveness,
resilience, shared prosperity, and inclusive and sustainable investment,
while tackling the climate crisis, by seeking high standard agreements
in these critical areas:    

-   **Regional competitiveness:** We will focus on the issues that drive
    our competitiveness and build the proper foundation for sustainable,
    dynamic economic growth and greater investment, including customs
    procedures, trade facilitation, logistics, good regulatory
    practices, and non-tariff barriers.  
-   **Resilience:** We will leverage our geographic proximity and deep
    trade ties, and strengthen the sustainability and resilience of our
    supply chains and grow our small and medium businesses, while
    protecting our environment and our workers.  
-   **Shared prosperity:** We must ensure that all can benefit from a
    dynamic economy. We will focus on ways to make the lives of our
    peoples fairer and more secure, including investments in workforce
    development, labor standards, and promotion of quality jobs;
    expanding financial inclusion; and improving public services while
    addressing corruption, tax evasion, and other drags on our ability
    to deliver.  
-   **Inclusive and sustainable investment:** To unleash our region’s
    full potential, we will seek to unlock needed financing,
    reinvigorating regional economic institutions and working together
    to bring responsible private investment to the region.

President Biden believes the Western Hemisphere is and will continue to
be an economic powerhouse, home to some of our most important trade and
commercial relationships. We look forward to advancing this partnership
through this year.
