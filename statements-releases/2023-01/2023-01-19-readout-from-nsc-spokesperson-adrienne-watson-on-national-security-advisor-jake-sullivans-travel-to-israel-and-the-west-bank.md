Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
traveled to Israel and the West Bank January 18-20.  He was joined by
Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Middle East
and North Africa Brett McGurk.      
   
In Jerusalem, Mr. Sullivan met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
President Isaac Herzog, and members of the senior national security team
including Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant,
Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, National Security
Advisor (NSA) Tzachi Hanegbi, Mossad Director David Barnea, and Israel
Defense Forces Chief of Staff Major General Herzi Halevi.  
   
During his engagements with the Prime Minister and senior Israeli
officials, Mr. Sullivan restated the United States’ unwavering
commitment to Israel’s security and to countering the continued threats
posed by Iran to Israel, the United States, and the wider region.  Mr.
Sullivan stressed the U.S. commitment to ensure Iran can never acquire a
nuclear weapon.  They also discussed Ukraine, as well as the burgeoning
defense partnership between Russia and Iran and its implications for
security in the Middle East region.   
   
In all of his engagements, Mr. Sullivan underscored President Biden’s
commitment to promoting a more integrated, prosperous, and secure Middle
East region with benefits for all of its people, as exemplified by the
recent Negev Forum Working Groups in Abu Dhabi.  To advance these
aims, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Hanegbi held a virtual quadrilateral meeting
with their counterparts Bahraini NSA H.E. Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad Al
Khalifa and UAE NSA H.E. Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan to further
coordination in the fields of clean energy, emerging technology,
regional security, and commercial relations.      
   
In all of his meetings, Mr. Sullivan recalled that the United States’
longstanding partnership with Israel, which celebrates its
75<sup>th </sup>anniversary this year, is built on mutual interests and
democratic values.  Mr. Sullivan stressed that the Administration will
continue to support the two-state solution, and will discourage policies
that endanger its viability.  Mr. Sullivan underscored the urgency of
avoiding unilateral steps by any party that could inflame tensions on
the ground, with special attention to maintaining the historic status
quo with respect to the holy places in Jerusalem.    
   
In Ramallah, Mr. Sullivan met with Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas to reaffirm the U.S. administration’s interest
in strengthening engagement with the Palestinian Authority and deepening
ties with the Palestinian people.  They discussed U.S. support for
peace, preserving the path towards negotiations for two states, and
advancing equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom for
Israelis and Palestinians.  Mr. Sullivan reviewed U.S. commitments to
the Palestinian people, including support for the East Jerusalem
Hospital Network and establishment of 4G infrastructure in the West
Bank.  He also discussed the need for Palestinian leaders to help
de-escalate tensions in the West Bank and to strengthen Palestinian
institutions.  Finally, they exchanged views on measures to build trust,
enhance security, and foster conditions for a political horizon.
