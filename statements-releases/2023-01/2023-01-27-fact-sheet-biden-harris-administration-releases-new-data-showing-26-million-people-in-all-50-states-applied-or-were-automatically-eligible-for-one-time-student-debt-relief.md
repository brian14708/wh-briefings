  \ Million People in All 50 States Applied or Were Automatically Eligible for One-Time\
  \ Student Debt\_Relief"

*New data comes as elected officials and special interests actively
block many of their own constituents from getting relief*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released new data showing the
number of people in each state who applied for student debt relief or
were automatically eligible for relief. These borrowers could be
benefitting from the Administration’s program right now were it not for
lawsuits brought by elected officials and special interests. In August,
President Biden announced his Administration’s plan to provide up to
$20,000 in debt relief for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per
year. The Administration’s program aimed to protect borrowers most at
risk of delinquency or default as a result of hardships brought on by
the COVID-19 pandemic when the payment pause ends.

In the less than four weeks that the application was available, 26
million people either applied for debt relief or had already provided
sufficient information to the Department of Education (Department) to be
deemed eligible for relief. Over 16 million of those borrowers’
applications were fully approved by the Department and sent to loan
servicers. However, in November of last year– less than a month after
the application was first released – the Department was required to stop
accepting applications as a result of lawsuits brought by opponents of
the program. Loan servicers were thus prevented from discharging any
debt.

Overall, more than 40 million borrowers would qualify for the Biden
Administration’s debt relief program. Nearly 90% of the benefits of the
relief going to out-of-school borrowers would go to those earning less
than $75,000 per year. Millions of those borrowers could be experiencing
the benefits of that relief today – were it not for lawsuits brought on
by elected officials in some of their own states. For more information,
visit StudentAid.gov/debtrelief.

Below is a full breakdown of how many people applied for debt relief and
whose applications were approved by the Department before the
Administration was blocked from discharging debt, rounded to the nearest
thousand.
