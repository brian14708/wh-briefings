title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record ACA Enrollment\_Numbers"
---
 
I promised to lower costs for families and ensure that all Americans
have access to quality, affordable health care. Today, we received
further proof that our efforts are delivering record-breaking results.  
  
More Americans than ever before have signed up for health insurance
through the Affordable Care Act. From November 1<sup>st</sup> to January
15<sup>th</sup>, over 16.3 million Americans signed up for insurance on
HealthCare.gov and the state-based Marketplaces.  This is more than
double the number of Americans who signed up for coverage during the
first ever Affordable Care Act Open Enrollment in 2014.  And for the
more than 30 states that use HealthCare.gov, there has been a combined
50 percent increase in enrollment since I took office in January 2021.  
  
Over the last few months, four out of five consumers looking for health
insurance through the Affordable Care Act were able to find health care
coverage for as little as $10 a month or less. These lower rates — which
were originally delivered as part of my American Rescue Plan — were set
to expire at the end of 2022, but thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act,
we extended them and millions of families are continuing to save $800
per person per year on their premiums.   
  
We’ve made record-breaking progress in expanding coverage and lowering
health care costs for American families, saving them money and giving
more Americans the peace of mind that comes with affordable health
insurance.
