title: "FACT SHEET:\_United\_States and India Elevate Strategic Partnership with the\
  \ initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology\_(iCET)"
---
 
President Biden and Prime Minister Modi announced the U.S.-India
initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in May 2022 to
elevate and expand our strategic technology partnership and defense
industrial cooperation between the governments, businesses, and academic
institutions of our two countries. 

The United States and India affirm that the ways in which technology is
designed, developed, governed, and used should be shaped by our shared
democratic values and respect for universal human rights.  We are
committed to fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology
ecosystem, based on mutual trust and confidence, that will reinforce our
democratic values and democratic institutions. 

Today, the two National Security Advisors led the inaugural meeting of
the iCET in Washington, DC.  They were joined on the U.S. side by the
Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
Director of the National Science Foundation, the Executive Secretary of
the National Space Council, and senior officials from the Department of
State, Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the
National Security Council.  On the Indian side, the Ambassador of India
to the United States, the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government
of India, the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, the
Secretary of the Department of Telecommunications, the Scientific
Advisor to the Defense Minister, the Director General of the Defence
Research and Development Organization, and senior officials from the
Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the National
Security Council Secretariat participated.  The two sides discussed
opportunities for greater cooperation in critical and emerging
technologies, co-development and coproduction, and ways to deepen
connectivity across our innovation ecosystems.  They noted the value of
establishing “innovation bridges” in key sectors, including through
expos, hackathons, and pitch sessions.  They also identified the fields
of biotechnology, advanced materials, and rare earth processing
technology as areas for future cooperation. 

The United States and India underlined their commitment to working to
resolve issues related to regulatory barriers and business and talent
mobility in both countries through a standing mechanism under iCET. 
This followed the January 30 roundtable hosted by the U.S.-India
Business Council with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S.
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Indian National Security
Advisor Ajit Doval, and other senior U.S. and Indian officials and
brought together more than 40 CEOs, university presidents, and thought
leaders from both countries to accelerate opportunities for increased
technology cooperation. 

To expand and deepen our technology partnership, the United States and
India are launching new bilateral initiatives and welcoming new
cooperation between our governments, industry and academia in the
following domains:
