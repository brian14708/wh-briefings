title: "Statement from President Joseph R. Biden on the Department of Housing and\
  \ Urban Development\u2019s New Proposed Rule on Affirmatively Furthering Fair\_\
  Housing"
---
 
Fifty-five years after its passage and signing, we are still working to
realize the Fair Housing Act’s promise to end the legacy and persistence
of discrimination and inequities in our housing system.  That’s why
during my first week in office, I directed the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to implement the Fair Housing Act’s
requirement to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing.   

Today, Secretary Fudge and HUD put forward a proposed rule that takes
meaningful steps to overcome patterns of segregation in housing and give
every American family a fair shot. It restores and builds upon our work
during the Obama-Biden Administration to fully implement the Fair
Housing Act. And, it sends a clear message to communities across the
country that just saying they won’t discriminate isn’t enough.
Communities must take action to aggressively combat and end racial
discrimination in our housing system.

This is an important step forward to ensure every community does its
part to expand equity in housing and to fulfill our promise of a nation
of opportunity and equity for all.
