title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Hanwha Q CELLS\_Announcement"
---
 
Today’s Hanwha Q CELLS announcement to make the largest solar investment
in U.S. history is a big deal for Georgia’s working families and the
American economy. And, this investment is a direct result of my economic
plan and the Inflation Reduction Act.

Hanwha’s Q CELLS investment will create thousands of good-paying jobs in
Georgia, many of which won’t require a four-year degree. It will bring
back our supply chains so we aren’t reliant on other countries, lower
the cost of clean energy, and help us combat the climate crisis. And, it
will ensure that we manufacture cutting-edge, solar technology here at
home. It’s a win for workers, consumers, and our climate.

Under my leadership, the United States can and will lead the world in
manufacturing once again.
