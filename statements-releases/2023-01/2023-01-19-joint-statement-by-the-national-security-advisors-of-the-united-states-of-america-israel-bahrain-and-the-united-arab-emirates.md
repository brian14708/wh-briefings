Today, the National Security Advisors of the United States, Israel,
Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates met to discuss ways to deepen
regional integration, including in the areas of clean energy, emerging
technology, regional security, and commercial relations. Assistant to
the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan and Israeli
National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi participated from Jerusalem,
with H.E. Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa of Bahrain and H.E. Sheikh
Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the UAE joining virtually from Abu Dhabi.
The four counterparts looked forward to further deepening and expanding
the progress achieved since the signing of the Abraham Accords. They
also discussed promising new partnerships developing throughout the
region, including I2U2 (Israel, India, United States, UAE), which is
leveraging technological innovation to address the food security crisis,
and the Negev Forum Working Groups, which recently brought together
experts from six countries in Abu Dhabi to enhance collaboration in the
areas of food security and water technology, clean energy, tourism,
regional security, healthcare, and education and co-existence. The
counterparts focused in particular on the climate crisis, and welcomed
the UAEâ€™s leadership in hosting COP-28 later this year. They agreed to
stay in regular contact over the coming weeks and months to work on
expanding participation to new partners and to coordinate on shared
interests and challenges.
