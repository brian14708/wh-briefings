President Biden looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Kishida Fumio
of Japan to the White House on Friday, January 13<sup>th</sup> to
further deepen ties between our governments, economies, and our people.
Over the past year, the two leaders have worked closely together to
modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance, expand our cooperation on key issues
from climate change to critical technologies including through the Quad,
and advance a free and open Indo-Pacific. President Biden and Prime
Minister Kishida will build on these efforts. They will also discuss a
range of regional and global issues including the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missile programs, Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine, and maintaining
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. President Biden will
reiterate his full support for Japan’s recently released National
Security Strategy, its presidency of the G7, and its term as a
non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The leaders
will celebrate the unprecedented strength of the U.S.-Japan Alliance and
will set the course for their partnership in the year ahead.
