title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Minnesota\
  \ Protecting Reproductive\_Health"
---
 
Today, with Governor Tim Walz’s signature, Minnesota has codified the
protections of *Roe* into law, the first state legislature to do so in
2023.  
   
Americans overwhelmingly support a woman’s right to make her own health
care decisions, as so clearly demonstrated last fall when voters turned
out to defend access to abortion –  including for ballot initiatives in
California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont.  
   
While Congressional Republicans continue their support for extreme
policies including a national abortion ban, the President and Vice
President are calling on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe* in
federal law. Until then, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue
its work to protect access to abortion and support state leaders in
defending women’s reproductive rights. In addition to codifying
reproductive rights into state law, state leaders across the country are
taking steps to protect patients and their health care providers, ensure
access to care through expanded funding and training, strengthen privacy
protections, and expand access to contraception.
