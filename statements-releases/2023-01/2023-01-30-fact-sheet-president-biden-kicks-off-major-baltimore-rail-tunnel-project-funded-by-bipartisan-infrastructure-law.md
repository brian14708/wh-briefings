*Replacing 150-Year Old Baltimore And Potomac Tunnel Will Create 30,000
Good-Paying Jobs And Address Largest Rail Bottleneck Between Washington,
D.C and New Jersey  
*  
*Continued Focus On Implementing Game-Changing Infrastructure Projects
Including Brent Spence Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge, and Gateway Hudson
Tunnel Project in New York*

Continuing the Biden-Harris Administration’s focus on implementing its
economic agenda to deliver real results for the American people,
President Biden is traveling to Baltimore, Maryland, to kick off a major
project funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace the
150-year old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel. This project will address the
largest rail bottleneck on the Northeast Corridor between Washington,
D.C. and New Jersey, and create good-paying union jobs, improve
reliability, lower commuting times, and enhance safety and resilience.
The program is expected to generate 30,000 jobs, including approximately
20,000 direct construction jobs, most of which do not require a college
degree.

President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest
investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak, with a $66
billion investment in rail.

At the project kickoff event, the President will announce:

1.  A project kickoff agreement has been signed by the State of Maryland
    and Amtrak, which includes a $450 million commitment from the
    state’s transportation agency for the tunnel replacement project;
2.  A project labor agreement has been signed between Amtrak and the
    Baltimore-DC Building and Construction Trades Council, which is a
    local affiliate of North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU),
    to cover the first phase of the
    [project](https://www.amtrak.com/about-amtrak/bptunnel.html) to
    ensure the project creates good-paying, union jobs; and,
3.  An agreement is in place between Amtrak and North American Builders’
    Trade Union (NABTU) that ensures Amtrak’s large civil engineering
    construction projects controlled by Amtrak will be performed under
    union agreements. Those agreements will address points such as
    wages, benefits, working conditions, avoiding work disruption, and
    promoting diversity and veteran hiring in the construction trades. 
    With this agreement, Amtrak and NABTU will not face labor-related
    delays in the planning and contracting of major projects;
    contractors and subcontractors share Amtrak’s commitment to paying
    fair wages and benefits; and, Amtrak and NABTU can move forward with
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded projects with efficient
    labor-management relations.

**<u>Frederick Douglass Tunnel</u>**  
The 150 year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel is the oldest tunnel on
the Northeast Corridor.  The 1.4-mile tunnel beneath densely populated
West Baltimore connects Baltimore’s Penn Station to points south. The
tunnel is the largest Northeast Corridor bottleneck between Washington
and New Jersey and a single point of failure for the nine million Amtrak
and Maryland Area Commuter (MARC) passengers who rely on it annually. In
other words, there are no detours possible if the aging tunnel were to
unexpectedly close. The tunnel’s tight curvature and steep incline
requires trains to reduce speeds to 30 mph. These issues create chronic
delays — more than 10% of weekday trains are delayed, and delays occur
on 99% of weekdays.   

The [Baltimore-Potomac Tunnel Replacement
Program](https://railroads.dot.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-administration-usdot-announce-over-233-million-grants-upgrade-0)
will build a new tunnel with two tubes along an alignment with softer
curves; ventilation and emergency egress facilities; new signaling
systems, overhead catenary, and track; five new roadway and railroad
bridges in the area surrounding the tunnel; and a new ADA-accessible
West Baltimore MARC station.  The new tunnel will be named in honor of
the civil rights leader and abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, a Maryland
native and frequent railroad passenger after escaping to his freedom
from slavery by boarding a train in Baltimore.  

When the program is complete, speed and capacity improvements will help
enable service growth and eliminate nearly seven hours of train delay
for the average weekday. Capacity of the tunnel is expected to nearly
triple, and trains travelling through the tunnel will be able to go a up
to 110 miles per hour versus the current 30 miles per hour. By one
estimate, replacing the tunnel would save nearly 450,000 hours per year
for MARC and Amtrak customers. 

The total cost of the program is expected to be approximately $6
billion, of which Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding could contribute
up to $4.7 billion.  While the project received $44 million through the
American Reinvestment and Recovery Act for preliminary engineering and
permitting, it lacked a viable funding source for construction until the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.   

Now, with funding and the President’s commitment, early works, such as
demolition, utility relocations, and select track work, will begin this
calendar year.   The program is expected to generate 30,000 jobs,
including approximately 20,000 direct construction jobs. Amtrak is
investing more than $50 million in local workforce development and
community investments, including pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship
programs to ensure that local workers in West Baltimore can access these
jobs. 

**<u>Infrastructure Progress Across Maryland</u>**  
Already in the first year of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, over
$2.6 billion has been announced and is headed to Maryland with over 44
specific projects identified for funding.  This includes:

1.  **Roads and Bridges:** In Maryland, there are 273 bridges and over
    2,201 miles of highway in poor condition. To date, $1.8 billion has
    been announced in Maryland for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and
    major projects. This includes $1.6 billion in highway formula
    funding and $176.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges
    in 2022 and 2023.
2.  **Airports and Ports:** To date, Maryland has received approximately
    $31.8 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports and roughly $4.8 million
    in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways.
3.  **Public Transit:** Based on formula funding alone, Maryland would
    expect to receive approximately $1.8 billion over five years under
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across
    the state. To date, Maryland has been allocated $346.8 million to
    improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal
    year 2022 and 2023.
4.  **Clean Buses:** To date, Maryland has been awarded $9.4 million for
    the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean School Bus Program. In
    addition, communities in Maryland were awarded $16.8 million for
    clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT’s Low- and
    No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. 
5.  **Electric Vehicle Charging:** Through the National Electric Vehicle
    Infrastructure Program alone, Maryland should expect to receive
    roughly $63 million in formula funding over five years to support
    the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. In
    September, the Biden-Harris Administration approved Maryland’s EV
    Charging plan which unlocks their ability to invest the first $22.7
    million to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. 
6.  **High-Speed Internet:** To date, Maryland has received $5 million
    through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD)
    to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In
    addition, about 182,000 households in Maryland are enrolled in the
    Affordable Connectivity Program.
7.  **Water:** To date, $144 million has been announced to Maryland to
    provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water
    infrastructure. This includes $51.9 million is dedicated to lead
    pipe and service line replacement.
8.  **Clean Energy & Power:** To date, approximately $65.2 million has
    been allocated to Maryland for clean energy, energy efficiency, and
    power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: $45.7 million for
    weatherization; $7.1 million through the State Energy Program; $7.1
    million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant
    Program; and $4.4 million to prevent outages and make the power grid
    more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in
    the coming months. 
9.  **Resilience:** In the last decade, Maryland has experienced 33
    extreme weather events, costing the state up to $5 billion in
    damages. To date, approximately $157.1 million has been allocated to
    Maryland for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023. 
10. **Legacy Pollution Cleanup:** To date, approximately $4.8 million
    has been allocated to Maryland in 2022 and 2023 for capping orphaned
    oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands and $500,000
    has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites.

**<u>Economic Progress Across Maryland</u>**  
Under President Biden, we’re building an economy from the bottom up and
middle out, including creating good-paying jobs, record small business
growth, and spurring new manufacturing investments across Maryland.

1.  Maryland’s unemployment rate is at 4% – down from 6.3% two years
    earlier.  The state has added over 127,000 total jobs since the
    President took office.
2.  Over the last two years, over 206,000 new businesses have been
    started in the State of Maryland.  In fact, 2021 had the most new
    businesses started in Maryland on record – 17 percent higher than
    the previous record.
3.  Across Maryland, companies have announced investments and expansions
    including Catalent (October 2021) which announced a $230 million
    expansion project in in Harmans, Maryland, creating more than 700
    new jobs; Orsted committed (August 2022) to investing nearly $735
    million to create thousands of jobs; and United Safety Technology
    Inc  announced plans (March 2022) for a $350 million medical
    manufacturing facility at Tradepoint Atlantic in Baltimore County,
    which the company expects will create 2,000 jobs.

**<u>Progress on Rail</u>**  
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest
investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak, with a $66
billion investment in rail. This includes: 

1.  $22 billion directly to Amtrak, including $16 billion for the
    National Network and $6 billion for the Northeast Corridor; 
2.  $24 billion in competitive grants for major capital projects on the
    Northeast Corridor; 
3.  $12 billion in competitive grants for passenger rail expansion
    outside the Northeast Corridor;  
4.  $5 billion for the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
    Improvements Program, which provides competitive grants for freight
    and passenger rail safety and efficiency projects; and 
5.  $3 billion in competitive grants for railroad crossing elimination
    projects. 

In 2022, the Biden Administration [announced $233 million in
grants](https://railroads.dot.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-administration-usdot-announce-over-233-million-grants-upgrade-0)
to upgrade intercity passenger rail service across the country. These
investments will help replace bridges and tunnels along the Northeast
Corridor, many of which are over 100 years old. Grants were also awarded
to improve rail infrastructure in California, Michigan, and improving
Chicago Union Station.  

On November 30, 2022, the Federal Railroad Administration granted $4.3
billion to Amtrak, which represents the first year of the $22 billion in
direct funding to Amtrak provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
These funds will be used to modernize the intercity passenger rail
network, most immediately funding improvements to several Amtrak-served
stations to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards, as
well as fleet upgrades.  With $22 billion in infrastructure investments
over five years, Amtrak will increase accessibility at more than 280
Amtrak-served stations across the country.  Funding will also be used to
replace Amtrak’s existing fleet of over 1,000 railcars and locomotives
with accessible, comfortable, state-of-the-art equipment. Portions of
the new fleet will enter service in 2023, and over 525 new railcars and
locomotives will begin service by the end of the decade. Amtrak debuted
the design of the [new “Airo”
railcars](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amtrak.com%2Famtrak-airo&data=05%7C01%7Ckathryn.thomson%40dot.gov%7C99f1440f93f54969721f08db0192c8d1%7Cc4cd245b44f04395a1aa3848d258f78b%7C0%7C0%7C638105502169805582%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=OYKN770qsZSPNYU6zx2LDzN4rLzIAKrNUjRa%2BP4wuf0%3D&reserved=0)
in late 2022.  

On November 15, the Federal Railroad Administration also announced its
Northeast Corridor Inventory, outlining major backlog projects that will
get funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including the Hudson
River Tunnel and East River Tunnel in New York, the Connecticut River
Bridge, and the Susquehanna River Bridge and Frederick Douglas Tunnel in
Maryland.  The Administration expects that the $24 billion available for
the Northeast Corridor will be sufficient to fund all major backlog
projects and provide funding toward some additional improvement projects
that reduce travel time, upgrade stations and facilities, or provide
other enhancements. In late December 2022, the Federal Railroad
Administration opened applications for the first $9 billion in
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for Northeast Corridor
infrastructure projects under the Fed-State Partnership Program.  Only
projects on the Northeast Corridor Project Inventory published in
November may be submitted for funding under this Notice of Funding
Opportunity.   The Frederick Douglass Tunnel could receive as much as
$4.7 billion from this pool of competitive funding. 

In December, the Federal Railroad Administration also opened
applications for the first $2.3 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
funding for intercity passenger rail projects outside of the Northeast
Corridor under the Fed-State Partnership National Program.     
  
2023 will be a year in which major rail projects receive their first
funding, in many instances, after waiting decades for federal funding.
