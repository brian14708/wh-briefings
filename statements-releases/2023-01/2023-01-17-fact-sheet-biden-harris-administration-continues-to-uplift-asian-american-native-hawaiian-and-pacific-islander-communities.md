Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing its first-ever
[**National Strategy to Advance Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI)
Communities**](https://whitehouse.gov/aanhpistrategy2023). The new
strategy, which comprises action plans prepared by 32 federal
agencies—including all 15 executive departments in the President’s
Cabinet—builds on the Administration’s [broader equity
agenda](https://whitehouse.gov/equity) and details [much needed
investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-equity-and-opportunity-for-asian-american-native-hawaiian-and-pacific-islander-communities-across-the-country/)
in AA and NHPI communities and priorities, including data
disaggregation, language access, and combatting anti-Asian hate.

President Joe Biden signed [Executive Order
14031](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/28/executive-order-on-advancing-equity-justice-and-opportunity-for-asian-americans-native-hawaiians-and-pacific-islanders/)
in May 2021, delivering on his commitment to establish and reinvigorate
the [White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
Pacific Islanders](https://www.hhs.gov/about/whiaanhpi/index.html)
(WHIAANHPI). In the Executive Order, the President directed the
development of an ambitious, government-wide interagency plan to advance
equity, justice, and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities.  
  
Since Day One, the Administration has prioritized the needs of AA and
NHPI communities by advancing policies that promote equity, reducing
barriers to accessing federal services and programs, and centering the
experiences and resiliency of AA and NHPIs. The following is a snapshot
of the progress and the important role of the federal government in
supporting families, neighborhoods, and communities across the
country.  
  
**Promoting Belonging and Inclusion and Addressing Anti-Asian
Hate/Discrimination**  
Across the federal government, agencies have stepped up their efforts to
respond to the increasing number of bias incidents and discrimination
against AA and NHPIs, promote belonging, equity, and inclusion, and
improve access to federal resources.

-   The Department of Justice developed an array of resources to provide
    local officials, community leaders and residents, law enforcement,
    and victims with the tools to help prevent and address hate crimes
    and incidents, including a
    [webpage](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/addressing-hate-crimes-against-AAPI)
    specifically to address hate crimes and incidents against AAs and
    NHPIs with instructions on how to report a hate crime to the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation in 24 languages.  
-   The Department of Justice and the Department of Education jointly
    issued a
    [letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/educator-202105-aapi.pdf)
    to educators on May 26, 2021, and a [fact
    sheet](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-aapi-202105.pdf)
    addressing the increased harassment and violence directed at Asian
    American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students and reminded schools
    about their role in addressing discrimination, including harassment,
    against AAPI students.
-   The Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity
    Commission continued to protect AA and NHPI workers, including by
    entering into a conciliation agreement with Conduent Inc., to
    resolve alleged systemic hiring discrimination against Black, AA and
    NHPI applicants for customer care assistant positions at its Yukon
    facility, and by recovering $4.8 million to satisfy a [judgment
    against Maui
    Pineapple](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-collects-over-48-million-judgment-labor-trafficking-case-against-maui-pineapple-thai)
    alleging labor trafficking and discrimination against 54 Thai
    workers. 
-   In February 2022, the Department of State’s Cultural Heritage Center
    helped with the repatriation of 58 iwi kūpuna (ancestral Hawaiian
    remains) from German and Austrian institutions to the Office of
    Hawaiian Affairs. 
-   In March 2022, the Department of the Interior designated the [Amache
    National Historic
    Site](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1207/amache-nhs-designation.htm) in
    Colorado as the newest component of the National Park System,
    honoring and preserving AA and NHPI history of the Japanese American
    incarceration during World War II.
-   Over the past year, the U.S. Agency for International Development
    hosted more than 20 “Urgent Hate Crimes Response/Support” meetings
    to provide a proactive response to the surge in anti-Asian hate
    crimes across the nation. These meetings created pathways to ensure
    that AA and NHPI community members felt safe physically returning to
    work, addressed the interpersonal challenges within the workplace,
    and sustained a respectful, equitable, and just workplace
    environment.
-   Since January 2021, the National Endowment for the Humanities funded
    nearly 100 awards related to AA and NHPI history and culture.

**Addressing the Systemic Lack of Data Disaggregation on AA and NHPI
Communities**  
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to advancing racial equity
through improved data collection, research, access, and disaggregation
efforts. Better data leads to better and more informed policies that
reflect the needs and priorities of the AA and NHPI communities.

-   The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which also
    co-chairs the Equitable Data Working Group, will support revision to
    the Office of Management and Budget Directive 15: Standards for
    Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and
    Ethnicity. This will spur the collection of higher quality
    disaggregated data on AA and NHPI communities and lead to better
    statistical analyses and overall understanding of the diverse AA and
    NHPI population.
-   The Census Bureau is scheduled to release the 2020 Census Detailed
    Demographic and Housing Characteristics File A in summer of 2023
    that will include critical statistics on detailed disaggregated
    Asian and Pacific Islander groups, unavailable in any other data
    collection.
-   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released a [new data
    visualization
    tool](https://www.eeoc.gov/statistics/data-visualizations) enabling
    agency users to analyze AA and NHPI demographic information and
    identify national origin groups experiencing high rates of limited
    English proficiency.
-   In May 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [expanded the
    demographic section in its consumer complaint
    form](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-consumer-complaint-bulletin-examines-county-level-demographic-data/)
    to include household size and household income questions, changes
    that will improve data collection of AA and NHPI complaints. 
-   The Federal Housing Finance Agency used disaggregated AA and NHPI
    data to [uncover trends and disparities related to mortgage approval
    rates](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/Blog/Pages/Latino-Diversity-and-Complexity-The-Importance-of-Data-Disaggregation.aspx),
    which will help ensure equal treatment of all future homeowners.
-   The Department of Transportation launched an agency-wide
    Transportation Equity Data Analysis Community of Practice and
    Working Group that brings together researchers and staff to
    collaborate on ways to strengthen transportation equity.

**Expanding Language Access Across Federal Programs**  
Federal agencies are taking critical action to expand access for limited
English proficient communities and deliver greater equity for the
diverse AA and NHPI community.

-   The Internal Revenue Service developed landing pages on
    [IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/) in 20 foreign languages including
    Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog,
    Khmer, Japanese, Urdu, Arabic, Gujarati, Bengali, and Punjabi.
-   The Food and Drug Administration developed culturally and
    linguistically tailored COVID-19 health messages in Mandarin,
    Cantonese, Hmong, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. And, as part of
    the Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and
    Services Administration, the Pacific Basin Telehealth Resource
    Center’s “Translation Toolkit” included resources in Japanese,
    Chuukese, Ilocano, Korean, Marshallese, Samoan, Tagalog, Chinese
    (Simplified and Traditional), and Vietnamese.

    Bulletin](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-january-4-2020-translations)
    into Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Korean, Tagalog, Thai,
    and Vietnamese and its statements on safety and immigration issued
    during [Hurricane
    Ida](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/08/27/dhs-statement-safety-and-immigration-enforcement-during-hurricane-ida),
    [Hurricane
    Henri](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/08/20/dhs-statement-safety-and-immigration-enforcement-during-tropical-storm-henri)
    and [Tropical Storm
    Fred](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/08/16/dhs-statement-safety-and-immigration-enforcement-during-tropical-storm-fred)
    into Chinese (Simplified and Traditional) and Vietnamese.
-   The Federal Communications Commission created consumer-friendly fact
    sheets and other materials online about its [Affordable Connectivity
    Program](https://www.fcc.gov/acp) and translated them into Chinese
    (Simplified and Traditional), Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.
-   Following a listening session with journalists about COVID
    recovery-related scams, the Federal Trade Commission placed a series

    publications and 26 radio stations in Asian American, Black, Latino,
    and Tribal communities. 
-   The Social Security Administration expanded its [Multi-Language
    Gateway](https://www.ssa.gov/site/languages/en/) internet site to
    include Tagalog and Simplified Chinese translated publications. SSA
    also made linguistic updates to its visitor intake kiosks to better
    facilitate the check-in process at local field offices. 

**Building Capacity in AA and NHPI Communities**  
By increasing access to federal contracts, grants, and opportunities,
the federal government is helping to break down persistent barriers to
federal resources, center equity in grant-making, and build the capacity
of AA and NHPI communities and organizations across the country.

    increased their grants, loans, and investments in infrastructure to
    Hawaii, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana

    in the U.S. territories, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
    subsequently appointed a total of 30 new members, 14 of whom
    self-identify as Asian/Asian American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific
    Islander, or Mixed Ethnicity/Other. 
-   Currently, 17% of appointees at the National Endowment for the Arts

    NHPI council members to its governing body, the National Council on
    the Arts.
-   The General Services Administration’s AA and NHPI affinity group
    launched a mentoring program to encourage career growth and
    development.

**Increasing Outreach and Engagement Efforts and Cultivating Community
Partnerships**  
To ensure that government policies are informed by and reflect the needs
of the AA and NHPI community, agencies are engaging in meaningful
outreach efforts to hear from community stakeholders, deepen
partnerships, and expand access to government programs.
