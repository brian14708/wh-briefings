title: "Vice President Harris Convenes Climate Leaders at the White\_House"
---
 
Yesterday, Vice President Harris convened environmental leaders from
local, state, and national level organizations to discuss the
Biden-Harris Administration’s investments and actions to combat the
climate crisis and the road ahead. The two-part convening included a
discussion with other White House officials, including Ali Zaidi,
National Climate Advisor, John Podesta, Senior Advisor for Clean Energy
Innovation, Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor and Infrastructure
Coordinator, and Brenda Mallory, Chair of the Council on Environmental
Quality. After, the Vice President participated in a moderated
conversation where she highlighted the transformational moment the
country is in following two years of historic legislation and the need
to keep up momentum as those laws are implemented.  
   
Last fall, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act,
which included the nation’s largest investment to combat the climate
crisis. The $370 billion dollar climate investment paired with
provisions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPs and Science Act,
and key executive actions, will lead the nation into a new clean energy
economy. These investments will generate millions of jobs, including
jobs that don’t require a four-year degree, create new industries, and
advance clean air, clean water, and environmental justice in communities
across the country. With this impact in mind, Vice President Harris
underscored the opportunity for the new clean energy economy to include
and benefit all Americans.  
   
Following this convening, today, Vice President Harris will travel to
Ann Arbor, Michigan with Secretary Granholm to participate in a
moderated conversation about the Administration’s historic investments
to combat the climate crisis and the work ahead in 2023.
