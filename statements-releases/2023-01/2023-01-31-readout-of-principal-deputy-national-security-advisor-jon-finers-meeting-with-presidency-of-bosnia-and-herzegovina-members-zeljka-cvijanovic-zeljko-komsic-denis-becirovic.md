Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer met today with
Members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Zeljka Cvijanovic,
Zeljko Komsic, and Denis Becirovic. Mr. Finer reaffirmed the United
States’ commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
multi-ethnic character of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He underscored that
the United States will continue to hold accountable destabilizing actors
who undermine the state and the Dayton Peace Agreement. He congratulated
Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens on obtaining EU candidacy status
in December and urged leaders to seize the momentum to help adopt key
rule of law reforms that would strengthen the fight against corruption
and organized crime. Mr. Finer also conveyed the importance of taking
steps to modernize the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to
diversify the country’s energy supplies away from Russian sources.
