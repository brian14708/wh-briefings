title: "Joint Declaration on The Americas Partnership for Economic\_Prosperity"
---
 
1.  We, the governments of Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa
    Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, the United
    States, and Uruguay, share geographies, languages, history, culture,
    and familial ties, in addition to our long-standing economic ties.
    As democracies, we are united by a common purpose to respond to the
    needs of our peoples through good governance that leads to robust
    economic opportunities and sustainable, inclusive economic growth.
    As neighbors, we stand to reap the benefits of an open, fair,
    inclusive, and prosperous hemisphere.  
     
2.  We acknowledge that the well-being and sustainable economic security
    of our peoples are linked, and that recovering economically from the
    Covid-19 pandemic and global inflationary pressures and achieving
    sustainable growth require stronger regional partnership. In this
    spirit, we announce our shared intention to establish the Americas
    Partnership for Economic Prosperity. Today, we launch discussions to
    orient our future negotiations on key issues to deepen our economic
    cooperation and strengthen our collective stability and
    resilience.  
     
3.  Together, we intend to accelerate the region’s economic growth in
    the service of eliminating poverty, reducing inequality, and
    ensuring that the benefits of this growth are broadly distributed.
    We seek to cooperate on innovative solutions for public
    administration to improve access to and delivery of public services
    and support the mobilization of domestic resources. We support
    stronger governance and adherence to the rule of law, driven by
    principles of transparency and accountability. We recognize that
    fairness and competition in open markets are vital to the vibrancy
    of our democratic institutions, and we plan to work together with
    the private sector and civil society in the fight against
    corruption, tax evasion, money laundering, and other illicit
    financial flows, in line with our existing multilateral obligations.
    We intend for our economic cooperation to include concerted efforts
    to promote gender equality, women’s workforce participation, and
    women’s empowerment. We are committed to pursuing an inclusive,
    human rights-based approach to economic policy that leaves no one
    behind, including but not limited to members of historically
    underrepresented and vulnerable groups such as Indigenous Peoples,
    Afro- descendants, women, youth, LGBTQI+ individuals, older persons,
    persons with disabilities, and members of rural populations. We also
    seek to promote the transition to formal employment, invest in
    education and workforce development, advance workers’ rights, and
    encourage responsible business conduct in our effort to promote
    economic growth that can benefit everyone.  
     
4.  To bolster our regional competitiveness and resilience, we seek to
    strengthen the diversity, sustainability, and resilience of our
    supply chains by expanding regional trade ties, and to advance
    quality infrastructure. Working with our stakeholders, we intend to
    explore opportunities for technical assistance and to exchange
    information and best practices to improve our coordination of crisis
    response measures and prevent disruptions in key regional supply
    chains. We aim to strengthen capacities to promote and enforce
    strong environmental protections and labor standards, including the
    eradication of forced labor, at every step along our regional value
    chains. This work will include efforts to address the climate
    crisis, food security challenges, and vulnerabilities in global
    supply chains.  
     
5.  In line with our collective efforts to combat the climate crisis, we
    intend to seek opportunities to address climate change through
    mitigation, adaptation, and resilience, as well as through clean and
    renewable energy and energy efficiency. Such actions would support
    our mutual energy security objectives of ensuring sufficient and
    reliable access to affordable and sustainable energy in all
    communities. We aim to find ways to improve our respective levels of
    environmental protections with the goal of addressing biodiversity
    loss, preventing wildlife trafficking and other illegal activity,
    and conserving our natural resources for generations to come. We
    intend to work with civil society, public and private actors, and
    regional and multilateral financial institutions to explore ways to
    leverage resources and other necessary instruments to create decent
    jobs, facilitate a just and sustainable clean energy transition, and
    increase opportunities for the most vulnerable communities.  
     
6.  Our longstanding trade and commercial relationships will serve as
    the foundation for our efforts to expand the benefits of
    sustainable, inclusive, and responsible trade to all. Along these
    lines, we intend to promote greater economic integration in the
    region and seek to increase collaboration on customs, trade
    facilitation, logistics, and good regulatory practices; address
    non-tariff barriers; and promote sustainable quality investment. We
    intend to promote trade that advances workers’ rights and economic
    security and elevates the role of the self-employed, entrepreneurs,
    and micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises to support supply
    chain diversification. We seek to build an environment of trust and
    confidence in the digital economy, and to advance secure and
    resilient digital infrastructure and platforms. We also intend to
    foster an inclusive digital economy by taking concerted steps to
    close the digital divide, promote digital-enabling skills, and
    leverage digital tools, digital literacy, and technology to meet our
    goals.  
     
7.  Generating broadly shared prosperity hinges on our ability to
    mobilize greater public and private investment that increases the
    well-being of our peoples, including through improvements in
    education, nutrition and health, social safeguards, and public
    infrastructure. We seek to reinvigorate regional economic and
    financial institutions and partner on forward-thinking reforms in
    multilateral finance and lending institutions. We aim to leverage
    opportunities for co-investment in the region with allies and
    partners from outside of our hemisphere and to strengthen
    connections and business ties among diaspora entrepreneurs in the
    Americas and the Caribbean. This will help to encourage private
    sector investment that meets environment, social, and governance
    criteria, while promoting financial inclusion, creating decent jobs,
    and improving the livelihoods of individuals from all backgrounds,
    including those in underserved communities.  
     
8.  The Americas Partnership will drive our deepened economic
    cooperation and foster bold ideas with clear actions for advancing
    our vision of development, democracy, and shared prosperity. We
    intend for the Partnership to be an open and inclusive initiative
    and to expand in the future to other partners in the hemisphere that
    share our vision, goals, and commitment to an ambitious agenda of
    sustainable economic growth and hemispheric resilience.
