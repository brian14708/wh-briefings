title: "\xAD\xADPresident\_Biden Names Twenty-Ninth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate four individuals to
serve as federal judges—all of whom are extraordinar­­­ily qualified,
experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgroun­­­ds.

This will be President Biden’s twenty-ninth round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 154. 

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
