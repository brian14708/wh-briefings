title: "FACT SHEET:\_Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Efforts to Support\
  \ Community\_Schools"
---
 
Meeting the needs of the whole child is essential to help America’s
students grow academically and improve their well-being. That’s why the
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to increasing and supporting
the adoption of community school models across the country.  
  
Community schools meet the unique needs of the neighborhoods they serve
by leveraging local non-profit, private sector, and public partnerships
to bring wraparound services into school buildings, such as mental
health supports, dental services, and assistance with shelter and
nutrition. They operate with the assistance of school staff who
coordinate with school administrators, stakeholders, and local
organizations to deliver these services and more to students, their
families, and members of the community. Research has shown that these
schools contribute to increased student attendance, on-time grade
progression, and high school graduation.  
  
In the most recent bipartisan funding bill, **the President secured $150
million for the Full-Service Community Schools** program. This means the
program is twice as large as last year and five times as large as when
President Biden came into office.  
  
*“Schools have always been the heart of our communities—where students
learn to be good citizens, where families come together for a common
cause, where towns find pride…students perform their best—and are
happiest—when their parents and educators work together, when their
families get the support they need—as soon as they need it.” – First
Lady Jill Biden Communities in Schools (CIS) Leadership Town Hall
Conference, October 2022.*  
  
Today, in recognition of the need to marshal resources from across the
government to support community schools, the Biden-Harris Administration
is:

-   **Announcing new grants under the Full-Service Community Schools
    program. **Students need integrated, wraparound services—both inside
    and outside of school— in order to succeed academically and feel
    more connected to their schools. Community schools are designed to
    deliver these services, and we are proud to announce a $63 million
    investment in 42 community schools across the country. These funds
    will provide critical support to our students now and equip them for
    future success.
-   **Releasing a White House Toolkit on Federal Resources to Support
    Community Schools**
    \[<https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-13-WHITE-HOUSE-TOOLKIT_Federal-Resources-to-Support-Community-Schools.pdf>\].
    This vital resource will help community school advocates,
    coordinators, and directors, as well as other community
    stakeholders, identify funding sources and grant programs that can
    be used to support community schools and meet the unique needs of
    their communities.

**EXPANDING THE FULL-SERVICE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAM**  
The **Department of Education is announcing todaythe 2022 recipients of
the FSCS program grant competition**. This competition will provide 42
local educational agencies, non-profits, and institutions of higher
education across the country with $63 million in funding for community
schools in more than twenty states. This year’s grant competition
received the largest number of applications in the history of the
program, demonstrating the enormous need for and interest in advancing a
continuum of coordinated support to address students’ social, emotional
and mental health. By continuing to expand the reach of Full-Service
Community Schools, we will support students’ academic recovery, as well
as the health and well-being of communities across the country.  
  
**NEW TOOLKIT HIGHLIGHTS PROGRAMS ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT
SUPPORT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS**  
The Administration supports the Full-Service Community School model
because of the powerful effects these schools have on students’ academic
success and overall well-being.
[Studies](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/media/137/download?inline&file=Community_Schools_Effective_REPORT.pdf)
have found that well-implemented community schools—with integrated
student supports, active family and community engagement, expanded and
enriched learning time, and collaborative leadership practices—can lead
to improved student and school outcomes, particularly for students in
high-poverty schools. Yet communities can face difficulties identifying
resources to establish or expand Full-Service Community Schools because
they exist across the federal government. Today, the White House is
releasing a Toolkit of Federal Resources to Support Community Schools.  
  
The toolkit lists relevant grant programs by federal agency and explains
how those grants can be used to provide student services at community
schools. It also includes new commitments from various federal agencies
to support community schools, including the following:

-   **Prioritizing the work of community schools in federal competitive
    grants:** The [Department of
    Defense](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=337732)
    (DOD) has committed to including priority points for community
    schools in two grant programs – the Military-Connected Local
    Educational Agencies for Academic and Support Programs and the World
    Language Advancement and Readiness Program – which provide grants to
    dozens of school districts reaching tens of thousands of students
    across the country.
-   **Providing in-school support to students by funding community
    school coordinators:** Several federal agencies have identified
    funding in grant programs – including funds provided through the
    Community Development Block Grant (HHS), the Demonstration Grants
    program for Indian Children (ED), and the Military-Connected Local
    Educational Agencies for Academic and Support Programs and the World
    Language Advancement and Readiness Program (DOD) – that can be used
    to support the salary of a community school coordinator. These
    coordinators play a critical role in helping identify and manage a
    community school’s services and partnerships.
-   **Helping community schools apply for and benefit from relevant
    grant programs:** The Corporation for National and Community Service
    (AmeriCorps) and Departments of Education, Labor, Interior, and
    Housing and Urban Development will provide technical assistance or
    issue agency guidance so that community schools can better access
    the full range of resources available to them.
