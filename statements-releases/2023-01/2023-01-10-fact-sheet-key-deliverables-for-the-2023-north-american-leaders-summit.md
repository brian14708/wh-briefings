North American cooperation makes our countries safer, our economies more
competitive, and our supply chains more resilient. By working together,
the countries of North America are better able to address shared
challenges, like climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and
transnational criminal organizations trafficking and smuggling people
and illicit drugs like fentanyl. The North American Leaders’ Summit
(NALS) strengthens our partnerships and advances our shared priorities.
Today, President Biden is joining President Andrés Manuel López Obrador
of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to promote a
common vision for North America. This year, the leaders will build on
last year’s accomplishments with new initiatives and announcements.  
  
**President Biden has used NALS to drive North America’s economic
competitiveness and promote inclusive growth and prosperity. The three
countries will deepen our economic cooperation, promote investment, and
reinforce competitiveness, innovation, and resilience by:**

-   Organizing the first-ever trilateral semiconductor forum with
    industry to adapt government policies and increase investment in
    semiconductor supply chains across North America. Participation will
    include senior industry representatives and cabinet level
    participation from the United States, Mexico, and Canada in early
    2023.
-   Coordinating semiconductor supply chain mapping efforts to develop a
    collective understanding of unmet needs. This mapping with all the
    three countries will identify complementary investment
    opportunities.
-   Expanding North American critical minerals resource mapping to
    collect details on resources and reserves. The Geological Surveys of
    each country will organize a trilateral workshop to share data and
    facilitate cooperation.
-   Partnering with the region’s private sector to increase student
    development and mobility under a new North America Student Mobility
    Project in coordination with Canada and Mexico, an expansion of the
    successful public-private partnership model of the 100,000 (100K)
    Strong in the Americas Innovation Fund. This is the first time
    Canada and Mexico will be added as co-government partners in the
    decade-old 100K Strong initiative.
-   Convening industry and academia experts in semiconductors, ICT,
    biomanufacturing, and other key advanced manufacturing and logistics
    industries for design sessions on the skills needed to develop the
    workforce North America over the next five years.

**The United States, Mexico, and Canada recognize the urgency for rapid,
coordinated and ambitious measures to build clean energy economies and
respond to the climate crisis. At the NALS, the three leaders committed
to combatting the climate crisis by:**

-   Committing to reduce methane emissions from the solid waste and
    wastewater sector by at least 15% by 2030 from 2020 levels and
    deepen collaboration on waste and agriculture methane measurement
    and mitigation, including achieving the Global Methane Pledge
    through trilateral cooperation on methane and black carbon
    emissions.
-   Developing a Food Loss and Waste Reduction Action Plan by the end of
    2025 outlining efforts to cut food loss and waste in half by 2030.
-   Sharing information between our countries on best practices to
    electrify and decarbonize public buses through the cooperative
    development of a Joint Transit Decarbonization Toolkit.
-   Developing a plan for operating standards and the installation of EV
    chargers along international borders to ensure a seamless EV
    charging transition from country to country.
-   Committing to trilateral cooperation to meet a joint commitment to
    conserve 30 percent of the world’s land and ocean area by 2030 and
    to advance Indigenous-led conservation.
-   Developing a North American clean hydrogen market, including
    potential cooperation on research and development, safety codes and
    standards, cross-border hydrogen clusters, green freight corridors,
    and integrated maritime operations.

**On the occasion of the six-month anniversary of the adoption of the
Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, the leaders of
North America reaffirmed their commitment to work together to achieve
safe, orderly, and humane migration in the region. In particular, the
United States, Mexico, and Canada will continue to champion expansion of
legal pathways and other humane measures to address irregular migration
in the region, including:**

    Partnerships Action Plan with practical steps to improve
    coordination and address the root causes of irregular migration.
-   Announcing a virtual platform through the Los Angeles Declaration
    website to give migrants streamlined access to legal pathways. This
    will give potential migrants the information they need to come to
    Mexico, the United States, and Canada lawfully – making them less
    likely to rely on smugglers who lie about border restrictions in
    place and put their lives at risk.
-   Building on an initiative under the last NALS to further help
    migrants access legal pathways in-person, and announcing a
    partnership on a new center in southern Mexico with strong private
    sector support.

    Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program in order to enhance labor

    refugees by promoting balanced public narratives on migrants and
    refugees to support their meaningful inclusion in the region. 

**The United States, Canada, and Mexico committed to coordinate actions

    Persons dialogue to improve cooperation against labor and sexual
    trafficking in the region.

    (NADD) under an updated strategic framework to address illegal drug
