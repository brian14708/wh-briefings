*Vice President Harris Will Announce Presidential Memorandum in Remarks
in Florida to Mark 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of* Roe v. Wade

On what would have been the [50th
anniversary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/01/20/a-proclamation-on-50th-anniversary-of-the-roe-v-wade-decision/)
of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Roe v. Wade*, President Biden will
issue a Presidential Memorandum on Further Efforts to Protect Access to
Reproductive Healthcare Services. Vice President Harris will announce
the Presidential Memorandum in Florida later today, where she will speak
about the next steps in the fight for reproductive rights and reinforce
the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to protecting access to
abortion, including medication abortion.

Since the day of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson
Women’s Health Organization*, President Biden has emphasized the need to
protect access to mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortion that
has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over 20
years and accounts for the majority of all abortions in the United
States.

Earlier this month, the FDA took evidence-based action to support safe
access to mifepristone by allowing the continued use of telehealth to
prescribe the medication and creating a new option for certified
pharmacies to dispense it to patients.

Some state officials have taken steps to try to prevent women from
legally accessing medication abortion and to discourage pharmacies from
becoming certified by the FDA.  
Today, President Biden will sign a Presidential Memorandum to further
protect access to medication abortion.

In the face of barriers to medication abortion and concerns about the
safety of patients, healthcare providers, and pharmacists, today’s
Presidential Memorandum announces actions to:

-   **Protect Legal Access to Medication Abortion.** The Presidential
    Memorandum directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),
    in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of
    Homeland Security (DHS), to consider new guidance to support
    patients, providers, and pharmacies who wish to legally access,
    prescribe, or provide mifepristone—no matter where they live.
-   **Safeguard Patient Safety and Security.** To ensure that patients
    understand their right to access reproductive healthcare despite
    roadblocks, the Presidential Memorandum directs the Secretary of
    HHS, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of
    DHS, to consider new actions to ensure that patients can access
    legal reproductive care, including medication abortion from a
    pharmacy, free from threats or violence. The President has long made
    clear that people should have access to reproductive care free from
    harassment, threats, or violence. Pharmacies should be treated no
    differently.

The Attorney General and the Secretaries of HHS and DHS will also
provide recommendations to the White House Interagency Task Force on
Reproductive Healthcare Access, which was established by President Biden
in Executive Order 14076, on additional ways to address barriers faced
by patients, providers, and pharmacies in safely and legally accessing
or providing medication abortion, consistent with evidence-based
requirements set by the FDA.
