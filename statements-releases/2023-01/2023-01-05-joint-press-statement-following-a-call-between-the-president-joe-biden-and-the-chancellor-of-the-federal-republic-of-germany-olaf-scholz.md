  \ the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany Olaf\_Scholz"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke by phone
on January 5, 2023 to exchange views on the ongoing war of aggression
waged by Russia against Ukraine. They reiterated their support for
Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence. They reaffirmed their unwavering
solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in the face of Russia’s
aggression.

President Biden and Chancellor Scholz expressed their common
determination to continue to provide the necessary financial,
humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine for as long as
needed. To this end, the United States intends to supply Ukraine with
Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, and Germany intends to provide
Ukraine with Marder Infantry Fighting Vehicles. Both countries plan to
train Ukrainian forces on the respective systems.

In light of Russia’s ongoing missile and drone attacks against Ukraine’s
critical infrastructure, President Biden and Chancellor Scholz affirmed
their intention to further support Ukraine’s urgent requirement for air
defense capabilities. In late December, the United States announced its
donation of a Patriot air defense missile battery to Ukraine. Germany
will join the United States in supplying an additional Patriot air
defense battery to Ukraine.

President Biden and Chancellor Scholz expressed appreciation for the
military support provided by other Allies and partners to Ukraine,
endorsed the ongoing coordination efforts of the Ukraine Defense Contact
Group, and welcomed additional donations of air defense systems and
combat vehicles.
