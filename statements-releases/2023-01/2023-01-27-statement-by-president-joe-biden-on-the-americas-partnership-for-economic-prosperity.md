title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Americas Partnership for Economic\_\
  Prosperity"
---
 
At the Summit of the Americas, I announced the Americas Partnership for
Economic Prosperity—a historic initiative that will bring our hemisphere
together to drive sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Today,
eleven countries—Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay— are
joining the United States and coming together to advance the Americas
Partnership, a significant step that will help deliver for working
people across our region.  
   
This group represents about 90 percent of the Western Hemisphere’s GDP
and nearly two thirds of its people. Working together, we will unleash
our full economic potential—including boosting our competitiveness,
building more resilient regional supply chains, creating quality jobs,
combating climate change, and reinvigorating our hemisphere’s economic
institutions. We will focus on improving the lives of our peoples and
growing our economies from the bottom up and middle out.  
   
This is just the beginning. The Americas Partnership is a flexible
framework and open to all countries that share our values and vision for
a prosperous hemisphere. I look forward to gathering with Americas
Partnership leaders to discuss ways we can continue to deepen our
economic cooperation and harness our strengths through the Americas
Partnership.
