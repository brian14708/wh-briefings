---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Isaac Herzog of
Israel to offer condolences for the horrific terror attack at a
synagogue in Jerusalem, a senseless act of violence that took the lives
of at least seven innocent victims at a place of worship. The Vice
President also condemned and expressed concern about subsequent violent
attacks.  The Vice President offered all appropriate support to the
Government and people of Israel in the coming days and beyond.  The Vice
President and President Herzog reflected on International Holocaust
Remembrance Day, and discussed the importance of efforts to support
Holocaust remembrance and combat antisemitism, including through Second
Gentleman Douglas Emhoff’s trip to Poland and Germany.  The Vice
President stressed the unwavering commitment of the United States to
Israel’s security, and reiterated U.S. support for efforts to advance
stability and integration throughout the region.
