title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Record-Setting Small Business\_Applications"
---
 
Small businesses are the engines of our economy and the hearts of our
communities. We learned today that my first two years in office have
been the two greatest years for new small business applications on
record, with more than 10 million total new businesses created. It’s the
latest confirmation that my economic plan is working to build our
economy from the bottom up and middle out.    
  
With unemployment at a record low and the two strongest years of job
creation in our history, there are reasons for economic optimism all
across our country.  
  
Rebuilding our infrastructure and supply chains here at home will help
our small businesses strive for decades ahead. My law to help crack down
on big corporations who are cheating on their taxes will also help level
the playing field for our small businesses, which is part of why it has
been so disappointing to see House Republicans make protecting wealthy
tax cheats their top legislative priority.  
  
I will continue to work with anybody from either party, in Congress or
in the states, to implement my economic agenda and build our economy
from the bottom up and middle out. And I am convinced America’s best
days are ahead.
