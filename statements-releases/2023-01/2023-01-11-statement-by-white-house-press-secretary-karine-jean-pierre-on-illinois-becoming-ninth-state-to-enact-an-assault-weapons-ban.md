title: "Statement by White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Illinois Becoming\
  \ Ninth State to Enact an Assault Weapons\_Ban"
---
 
Illinois has now become the ninth state across America to pass an
assault weapons ban and take bold action to keep weapons of war off
America’s streets. Today, President Biden commends the leadership of
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, House Speaker Chris Welch, Senate
President Don Harmon, Representative Bob Morgan, and the numerous
advocates, survivors, and elected officials whose tireless efforts
turned the pain of Highland Park and other acts of gun violence into
meaningful action on behalf of all Illinoisans.  
   
Too many Americans across the country continue to lose their lives or
their loved ones to gun violence. This is why President Biden has taken
historic action to reduce gun violence, including signing the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act — the first significant piece of gun safety
legislation in nearly 30 years – into law last summer. The President has
continued to press for more action to keep our homes, schools and
communities safe, including federal laws requiring background checks for
all gun sales and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
In the meantime, he continues to urge other states to join California,
New Jersey, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York,
Delaware, Washington, D.C. – and now, Illinois — to ban assault weapons
at the state level to save lives.
