title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Tyre Nichols\_Case"
---
 
Jill and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the family of Tyre
Nichols and the entire Memphis community. Tyre’s family deserves a
swift, full, and transparent investigation into his death.  
   
As Americans grieve, the Department of Justice conducts its
investigation, and state authorities continue their work, I join Tyre’s
family in calling for peaceful protest. Outrage is understandable, but
violence is never acceptable.  Violence is destructive and against the
law.  It has no place in peaceful protests seeking justice.  
   
Public trust is the foundation of public safety and there are still too
many places in America today where the bonds of trust are frayed or
broken. Tyre’s death is a painful reminder that we must do more to
ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair
and impartial justice, equal treatment, and dignity for all.  
   
We also cannot ignore the fact that fatal encounters with law
enforcement have disparately impacted Black and Brown people.  
   
To deliver real change, we must have accountability when law enforcement
officers violate their oaths, and we need to build lasting trust between
law enforcement, the vast majority of whom wear the badge honorably, and
the communities they are sworn to serve and protect.  
   
That is why I called on Congress to send the George Floyd Justice in
Policing Act to my desk. When they didn’t, I signed an executive order
that included stricter use of force standards and accountability
provisions for federal law enforcement, as well as measures to
strengthen accountability at the state and local level.  
   
Today, we all must re-commit ourselves to the critical work that must be
done to advance meaningful reforms.
