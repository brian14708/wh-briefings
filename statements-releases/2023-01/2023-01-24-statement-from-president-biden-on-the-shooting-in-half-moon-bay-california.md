title: "Statement from President\_Biden on the Shooting in Half Moon Bay,\_California"
---
 
Jill and I are praying for those killed and injured in the latest tragic
shooting in Half Moon Bay, California. For the second time in recent
days, California communities are mourning the loss of loved ones in a
senseless act of gun violence. 

Following a briefing from my homeland security team, I have directed my
administration to ensure local authorities and the broader Half Moon Bay
community have the full support of the federal government in the wake of
this heinous attack. 

Yesterday, Senator Feinstein — alongside Senators Murphy, Blumenthal and
others — reintroduced a federal Assault Weapons Ban and legislation that
would raise the minimum purchase age for assault weapons to 21. Even as
we await further details on these shootings, we know the scourge of gun
violence across America requires stronger action. I once again urge both
chambers of Congress to act quickly and deliver this Assault Weapons Ban
to my desk, and take action to keep American communities, schools,
workplaces, and homes safe.
