title: "Statement from the Vice President on the Second Anniversary of January 6,\_\
  2021"

On January 6th, 2021, American democracy endured a violent assault.  
   
Armed with deadly weapons and animated by lies and hate,
insurrectionists invaded the United States Capitol in an attempt to
overturn a lawful election and silence the voice of the people.  
   
Because of the bravery of our law enforcement officers and the resolve
of the people’s representatives, this assault on our democracy failed.  
   
In the two years since, Americans of courage and conviction—Republicans,
Democrats, and independents—have come together to defend freedom,
liberty, and the rule of law. In our communities and at the ballot box,
they have made their voices heard. And our nation is stronger for it.  
   
As President of the Senate and as a former United States Senator, I have
seen firsthand the incredible heroism of the law enforcement officers
who defend our nation’s capital. Doug and I pray for the families and
loved ones of the officers who lost their lives protecting our
democracy: Officer Brian Sicknick, Officer Gunther Hashida, Officer
Howard Liebengood, Officer Jeffrey Smith, and Officer Kyle DeFreytag.
And we pray for all those who still bear the scars of that tragic day.  
   
Today, let us each vow to continue the fight to safeguard and strengthen
our democracy and preserve our most sacred rights and freedoms for
generations to come.
