title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 14th Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter\
  \ Fair Pay\_Act"
---
 
Fourteen years ago, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became the law of
the land as the first bill signed during the Obama-Biden Administration.
This law creates important protections against pay discrimination and
has helped close persistent gender and racial wage gaps that
disadvantage women, particularly women of color, in the workplace.  
  
But fourteen years after the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and nearly
fifty years after the landmark Equal Pay Act of 1963, we still have work
to do to achieve equal pay. Women workers, who perform essential work
for our economy and families, are still paid, on average, 84 cents for
every dollar paid to men. For women of color, the gap is even greater.  
  
Vice President Harris and I remain committed to strengthening equal pay
protections for workers so we can continue to grow our economy,
strengthen our communities, and live up to our Nation’s core values of
equality and fairness. Last year, I signed an Executive Order to advance
pay equity for the Federal workforce and to promote efforts to
achieve pay equity for job applicants and employees of Federal
contractors, and I’m proud to have signed legislation to provide new
protections for pregnant and nursing workers. My Administration
continues to call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act,
commonsense legislation that would increase pay transparency and give
workers more tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination.  
  
Workers on the factory floor, on the soccer field, and in workplaces
across the country deserve to be paid fairly for their work. But more is
needed to ensure all people have a fair shot in this country. Advancing
the economic security of women and their families also strengthens our
economy overall, and my Administration remains committed to eliminating
pay discrimination and unfair pay practices.
