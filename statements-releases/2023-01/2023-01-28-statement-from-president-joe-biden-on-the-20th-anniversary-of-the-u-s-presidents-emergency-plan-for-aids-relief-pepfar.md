title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 20th Anniversary of the U.S. President\u2019\
  s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\_(PEPFAR)"
---
 
Twenty years ago today, President George W. Bush declared that
preventing and treating HIV/AIDS was a foreign policy priority of the
United States. At a time when nearly 30 million people were HIV
positive, but very few were receiving life-saving medicines, the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) transformed the
global AIDS response and laid a marker for America’s commitment to
countries that were impacted the hardest by the AIDS epidemic. Helping
lead the bipartisan effort in Congress to authorize PEPFAR is among my
proudest achievements from my time in the Senate. To this day, PEPFAR
remains a powerful example of America’s unmatched ability to drive
progress and make life better for people around the world.  
   
Since 2003, PEPFAR has saved more than 25 million lives and dramatically
improved health outcomes in more than 55 partner countries. AIDS-related
deaths have declined by 68 percent since their peak in 2004, and new HIV
infections are down 42 percent. PEPFAR investments have ensured that 5.5
million babies have been born HIV-free. And two decades of investment in
partner nations’ health systems played a critical role in countries’
ability to respond to other health crises such as COVID-19, Mpox, and
Ebola.      
   
Today, PEPFAR continues to support 20.1 million people around the world
with HIV/AIDS treatment, and my Administration is committed to
continuing to lead the global HIV/AIDS response. We will build on our
decades of progress to reach the Sustainable Development Goal of ending
AIDS by 2030, work to eliminate the stigma and inequities that keep
people from accessing care, and keep the voices of people living with
HIV/AIDS at the center of our response.  I look forward to working with
Congress on PEPFAR’s reauthorization this year.
