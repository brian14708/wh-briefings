The President is grateful for and accepts Speaker McCarthy’s prompt
invitation to address the peoples’ representatives in Congress.

He looks forward to speaking with Republicans, Democrats, and the
country about how we can work together to continue building an economy
that works from the bottom up and the middle out, keep boosting our
competitiveness in the world, keep the American people safe, and bring
the country together.
