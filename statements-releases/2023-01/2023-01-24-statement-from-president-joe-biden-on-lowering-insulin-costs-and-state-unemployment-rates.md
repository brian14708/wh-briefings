title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Lowering Insulin Costs and State Unemployment\_\
  Rates"
---
 
Today’s state unemployment rates give even more reasons for optimism all
over the country. We see record lows from Pennsylvania to South Dakota
to Alaska. 38 states are now at or below 4 percent unemployment,
including 15 States at or below 3 percent.

At the same time, with the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re delivering on
my promise to lower health care costs for Americans by capping seniors’
insulin costs at $35 for a month’s supply. New data released today shows
that if this provision had been in effect in 2020, over 1.5 million
seniors across the country could have saved an average of $500 per year
on insulin. That’s more money in seniors’ pockets and more breathing
room for American families.

Americans are seeing a strong economy where they live. They are seeing
their neighbors back to work, with higher wages even accounting for
inflation; they are seeing prices down at their pharmacies; they see new
businesses opening with the most Americans applying to start small
businesses of any time on record. And they are seeing groundbreakings
for new factories, roads, and bridges in their states at an historic
scale. I am more confident than ever that America’s best days are ahead.
