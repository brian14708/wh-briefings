President Biden and President Lula spoke by telephone this afternoon.
President Biden conveyed the unwavering support of the United States for
Brazil’s democracy and for the free will of the Brazilian people as
expressed in Brazil’s recent presidential election, which President Lula
won. President Biden condemned the violence and the attack on democratic
institutions and on the peaceful transfer of power. The two leaders
pledged to work closely together on the issues confronting the United
States and Brazil, including climate change, economic development, and
peace and security. President Biden invited President Lula to visit
Washington in early February for in-depth consultations on a
wide-ranging shared agenda, and President Lula accepted the invitation.
