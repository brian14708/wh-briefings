title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on the Terrorist Attack on Pakistan\_\
  Mosque"
---
 
The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on a mosque in
Peshawar, Pakistan with reports today that the death toll has now risen
to 100 people. This is tragic and heartbreaking news, and we extend our
deep condolences to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives.
Terrorism is indefensible, and to target worshippers is unconscionable.
The United States stands ready to provide support to Pakistan in its
efforts to recover and rebuild.
