title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Mayors on Potential\_Protests"
---
 
This afternoon, White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz
Sherwood-Randall and Senior Advisor to the President Julie Rodriguez
held a call with mayors from cities across the nation to brief them on
federal preparations in support of state and local leaders as they
prepare for the anticipated release of footage of the brutal death of
Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee. Participating mayors shared their
perspectives on how important it is to recognize the pain felt by
communities across this country, be prepared in advance with a game plan
to provide adequate community support, and to reinforce the importance
of peace and calm during these difficult moments. White House officials
asked the mayors to remain in regular contact over the coming days and
reiterated that the President will continue to be clear in his message
to the American people that peaceful protests are appropriate, but
violence is never acceptable.

Mayors and senior officials joined the call from cities including:

Atlanta, GA  
Baltimore, MD  
Birmingham, AL  
Boston, MA  
Chicago, IL  
Cleveland, OH  
Kansas City, MO  
Little Rock, AR  
Los Angeles, CA  
Montgomery, AL  
New York City, NY  
Philadelphia, PA  
Portland, OR  
Seattle, WA  
St. Louis, MO
