title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Legislative Leaders on Reproductive\
  \ Rights Ahead of the 50th Anniversary of Roe v.\_Wade"
---
 
Ahead of the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision
in *Roe v. Wade*, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and
Director of the Gender Policy Council, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior
Advisor to the President and Director of the White House Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs, and Carmel Martin, Deputy Assistant to the
President and Domestic Policy Advisor to the Vice President, convened
legislative leaders from eight states where reproductive rights are on
the line this session.   
   
Since the Supreme Court overturned nearly five decades of precedent in
*Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*, President Biden has
called on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe* as federal law
and defended access to reproductive health care using executive action
where possible.  
   
At the same time, the Biden-Harris Administration knows this fight is
being waged in the states, where local officials, state legislatures,
attorneys general, governors, and courts are dictating whether or not
women have the fundamental right to make deeply personal decisions about
their own bodies. Vice President Harris has convened nearly 200 state
legislators to discuss state-level attacks on reproductive rights and
ways to bolster access to abortion.  
   
Though more than a dozen states are already enforcing extreme abortion
bans across the country, Republican state elected officials have made
their agenda for the 2023 legislative session clear: use every tool
available to restrict women’s access to health care, including in some
cases potentially restricting access to contraception. Republican
officials in Wisconsin continue to defend the state’s total abortion ban
from 1849, a 174-year-old law that has no exceptions for rape or incest.
In Texas, legislators are considering measures that would attempt to
prevent women from traveling across state lines for medical care. And a
Republican legislator in Oklahoma has introduced a bill that would
punish women with felony charges for obtaining reproductive care.  
   
In states across the country, legislators are fighting attempts to roll
back reproductive rights. This session in Nebraska’s unicameral
legislature, state Senators will determine whether to pass an abortion
ban at six weeks of pregnancy – a time at which many women don’t even
know they’re pregnant. In North Carolina, Governor Cooper has committed
to defending reproductive rights, but Republican legislative leaders
have passed rules enabling the Republican Speaker to call a veto
override vote at any moment, including on an abortion ban.  
   
During today’s meeting, White House Senior Officials thanked the
legislators for their leadership in defending reproductive rights at
this critical moment, and affirmed the Administration’s support and
partnership in fighting restrictions to women’s health care.   
   
State legislative leaders included:

-   Florida Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book
-   Florida Senator Tracie Davis
-   Montana Representative Alice Buckley
-   Nebraska Senator Megan Hunt
-   North Carolina House Deputy Democratic Leader Ashton Clemmons
-   South Carolina Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto
-   Texas Senate Minority Leader Carol Alvarado
-   Virginia House Democratic Caucus Chair Charniele Herring
-   Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer
-   Wisconsin Senate Minority Leader Melissa Agard
