Jill and I wish a peaceful and joyous Christmas to Orthodox Christians
in the United States and around the world. During this sacred season, we
celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and the power of faith to lift us
up, to change us, and to change the world. We are thankful for the many
ways in which Orthodox Christians continue to show love and compassion
to their neighbors.

As services take place in churches around the nation and the world, we
reaffirm the right of all people to practice their faith freely and
recommit to standing with those who face discrimination, persecution,
and violence because of their faith. We join the Orthodox Christian
community in praying for peace, justice, and joy for all Godâ€™s children
in this new year.
