title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves California Emergency\_Declaration"
---
 
Late Sunday evening while in Mexico City, Mexico for the 10th North
American Leaders’ Summit, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., declared that
an emergency exists in the State of California and ordered Federal
assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local response efforts due
to the emergency conditions resulting from successive and severe winter
storms, flooding, and mudslides beginning on January 8, 2023, and
continuing.   
   
The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of El Dorado, Los Angeles,
Mariposa, Mendocino, Merced, Monterey, Napa, Placer, Riverside,
Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Sonoma,
Stanislaus, and Ventura.  
   
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures (Category B),
limited to direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance
program will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.   
   
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Andrew F. Grant as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.
