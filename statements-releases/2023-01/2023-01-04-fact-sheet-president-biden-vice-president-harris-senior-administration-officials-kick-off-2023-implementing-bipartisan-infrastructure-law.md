*President Biden will announce funding to rebuild some of the nation’s
most economically significant bridges, during visit to Covington,
Kentucky*

The President’s economic plan is proving that when America invests in
ourselves – especially in our infrastructure, clean energy, and
high-growth industries that are critical to our economic and national
security – we can build a bottom-up and middle-out economy. That means
an economy with better jobs and better pay, including jobs that don’t
require a four-year degree. And it means a more dynamic and more
resilient economy, including in communities that are too often
forgotten. 

Today, during a visit to Brent Spence Bridge in Covington, Kentucky, the
President will announce the latest example of how his economic plan is
delivering for American families and American communities: more than $2
billion in investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to upgrade
some of our nation’s most economically significant bridges. To mark this
announcement:

-   The President is visiting Brent Spence Bridge connecting Covington,
    Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio, where he will be joined by Senate
    Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senator Sherrod Brown, former
    Senator Rob Portman, Governor Andy Beshear, and Governor Mike
    DeWine.
-   The Vice President is visiting the bridges crossing the Calumet
    River in Chicago, Illinois.
-   Secretary Buttigieg is visiting the Gold Star Memorial Bridge in New
    London, Connecticut.
-   White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu will visit the
    Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California, where he will join
    Speaker Pelosi.

These major bridge investments are a symbol that we can still do big
things when we do them together.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $40 billion to repair and
rebuild the nation’s bridges – the single largest dedicated investment
in bridges since the construction of the Eisenhower-era Interstate
Highway System. It will help repair or rebuild ten of the most
economically significant bridges in the country along with over 15,000
additional bridges nationwide. The vast majority of the projects funded
by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are covered by Davis-Bacon
requirements, meaning the construction workers who build the projects
will receive good pay and benefits.

Bridges represent more than just their physical structures—they connect
people and communities and make it easier to go about our daily lives.
In addition to getting people where they need to go, bridges are
critical to ensuring the nation’s commerce can flow freely, getting
goods from ships to shelves quickly, reliably, and safely to their
destinations. Modern bridges are critical for first responders to get to
calls more quickly, more reliable shipments for businesses, and less
expensive goods for families.  Approximately 43,000 bridges nationwide
are currently rated in poor condition, which could include requiring
weight restrictions and closures of bridges large and small. 

Today’s announcement of the first year of Large Bridge Project Grants
from the infrastructure law’s **Bridge Investment Program** are for
bridges with a total cost of more than $100 million. The four
economically-significant bridges include:

-   In Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky, grant funds will
    upgrade the existing Brent Spence Bridge and build a new bridge
    dedicated to interstate drivers to improve traffic along I-71/I-75,
    a critical freight route from Canada to Florida.
-   In Chicago, Illinois, grant funds will help rehabilitate four
    moveable bridges crossing the Calumet River that are critical for
    marine traffic to and from the Illinois International Port and
    surrounding industry.
-   In New London, Connecticut, grant funds will rebuild the northbound
    structure of the Gold Star Memorial Bridge which brings I-95 over
    the Thames River, a vital connection on the I-95 corridor for people
    and goods traveling between New York and New England. 
-   In San Francisco, grant funds will replace, retrofit and install
    critical structural elements on the iconic Golden Gate Bridge to
    increase resiliency against earthquakes. The Golden Gate Bridge is
    vital to an estimated 37 million vehicles crossing the bridge per
    year, including 555,000 freight trucks, as well as waterborne
    commerce through the Golden Gate Strait connected to the Port of
    Oakland.

Across the country, the President’s economic plan is leading to billions
of dollars in private sector investment. Communities across Kentucky and
Ohio that were hollowed out due to outsourcing are once again regaining
manufacturing jobs – including in new industries of the future like
clean energy and the digital economy – and seeing major investments in
infrastructure.  For example:

-   **BlueOval SK Battery Park:** Last month in Glendale, Kentucky, Ford
    and SK On broke ground on a $5.8 billion battery manufacturing
    campus that will power the next generation of Ford and Lincoln
    electric vehicles. The battery park will create 5,000 jobs and
    partner with Elizabethtown Community and Technical College to train
    local workers for the jobs of the future.
-   **Ascend Elements:** In Hopkinsville, Kentucky, Ascend Elements is
    building a $1 billion facility to produce battery materials from
    recycled lithium-ion batteries, aided by [$480 million in
    funding](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-awards-28-billion-supercharge-us-manufacturing-batteries)
    from the Department of Energy. Ascend will produce enough material
    to power 250,000 electric vehicles annually, helping break
    dependence on China for critical materials and strengthen U.S.
    supply chains.
-   **Intel:** In September, President Biden and Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger
    broke ground on a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing campus
    outside Columbus, Ohio. Intel’s investment will create 10,000
    good-paying jobs in construction and manufacturing, and strengthen
    U.S. supply chains for the critical chips that power everything from
    automobiles to household appliances to defense systems.
-   **Ford:** Ford announced a $1.8 billion investment in its Avon Lake,
    Ohio, Assembly Plant, creating 1,800 new United Auto Worker jobs
    manufacturing a new electric commercial vehicle.

To help workers across Ohio prepare for good-paying manufacturing jobs
in the industries of the future, the Department of Commerce Economic
Development Administration awarded a $23.5 million grant through the
[Good Jobs
Challenge](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan/good-jobs-challenge)
to the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association to partner with more than 1,000
manufacturing employers to place 6,000 workers in a new job or an
upskilling opportunity at their current employer.

*<u>Bridge Funding Overview – Additional Background  
</u>*  
In addition to the four FY22 Large Bridge Project Grants, the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) also announced an additional Bridge
Planning grant to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to advance critical
planning work in support of replacement of the Bourne and Sagamore
Bridges over the Cape Cod Canal. In October 2022, FHWA awarded nearly
$20 million in planning grants to support 23 projects, including the I-5
Columbia River Crossing connecting Washington and Oregon and 18 bridges
located over electrified rail lines primarily operated by Amtrak and the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia.
These planning grants help create a pipeline of shovel-worthy projects
that could then later be eligible to apply for a construction grant
through a range of competitive grant programs where bridge projects are
eligible. DOT will announce additional Bridge Investment Program
construction grants for bridge projects under $100 million later this
year.  In total, the Bridge Investment Program will fund $12.5 billion
in planning and construction projects over five years, and will support
at least one project in every state.

Other DOT programs funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have also
made significant investments in bridge repair and replacement. Beyond
the Bridge Investment Program awards announced today, the US Department
of Transportation (DOT) has announced over $11 billion to upgrade the
nation’s bridges:

-   The Federal Highway Administration announced nearly $11 billion in
    Fiscal Year 2022 and 2023 **Bridge Formula Program** allocations
    from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To date, states have begun
    work on more than 2800 bridges nationwide using first year funding.
    This includes the I-270 bridge replacement over the Mississippi
    River in Illinois, the Dare County bridge replacement in North
    Carolina, and the I-65 bridge replacement over the Sepulga River in
    Alabama. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes an incentive for
    states to direct the new Bridge Formula Program funds to smaller
    bridges owned by a county, city, town or other local agency. These
    “off-system” bridges tend to be in worse condition than bridges on
    the Interstate or other major roads.  While states generally must
    match federal funding with up to 20 percent state or local funding,
    federal funds can be used for 100 percent of the cost of repairing
    or rehabilitating such locally owned off-system bridges.
-   The separate **Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative,
    Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Formula
    Program** has funded over $200 million of projects in 21 States,
    including resilience improvements to the I-20 Wateree River Bridge
    in South Carolina to upgrade critical elements of the bridge and
    raising the elevation of Louisiana Highway 1 (LA 1) to make it more
    resilient to flooding during extreme weather events across the Gulf
    of Mexico.
-   The **INFRA** program funded four major bridge projects in its first
    year. The I-39/90/94 Wisconsin River Bridges Project in Columbia
    County, Wisconsin, will build two new bridge spans for a route that
    links economic hubs in Madison, Milwaukee, and Chicago.  The I-90
    Austin Bridges Improvement Project in Austin, Minnesota, will
    reconstruct eight bridges (five overhead structures, two mainline
    bridges, and one pedestrian bridge) and rehabilitate two mainline
    bridges along I-90. In Cincinnati, Ohio, the Western Hills Viaduct
    Replacement will replace the 85-year old structurally deficient
    Western Hills Viaduct over the Mill Creek Valley with a new
    structure south of the existing viaduct, which will connect to a
    redesigned interchange with I-75. A part of the overall Brent Spence
    corridor improvement, the project will allow for reliable and
    efficient freight movement by road and rail, as the increased
    spacing of supports will allow for rail realignment and provide a
    new access point to the CSX intermodal facility. Innovative
    technology will be used on the project, including PV light fixtures,
    carbon-absorbing surface treatments, and ecofriendly materials. The
    Newport Pell Bridge Rehabilitation Project in Rhode Island will
    rehabilitate the 4-lane suspension bridge that carries Route 138
    over the Narragansett Bay, connecting Jamestown and Newport along a
    critical urban freight corridor and a major tourism destination.
-   The **RAISE** program also invests in bridge projects. For example,
    in Tucson, AZ, the 22nd Street Corridor improvement will replace an
    existing bridge in poor condition with a new bridge over the Union
    Pacific Railroad (UPRR) that will allow for Class I railroads to
    expand freight service and remove a freight bottleneck. In
    Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Caldwell, Watauga, and Wilkes Counties,
    North Carolina, USDOT is helping to reconstruct approximately 28
    bridges across rural, western North Carolina counties. By replacing
    low water bridges and fixing bridges with posted weight
    restrictions, emergency vehicles, school buses, agricultural
    vehicles, freight vehicles, and trucks carrying heavy equipment can
    traverse them more efficiently and reliably.  In Chattanooga,
    Tennessee, the Wilcox Boulevard bridge replacement will accommodate
    freight trucks to allow for the safe and efficient movement of goods
    to market.
-   The new **Rural Surface Transportation Grant Program** in the law
    funded the Niagara County Rural Bridge Improvement Initiative in
    Niagara County, New York.  The project will rehabilitate the
    Hartland Road Bridge over Golden Hill Creek which is over 70 years
    old and has not had any major rehabilitation work in over 30 years.
    The rehabilitated bridge will support Niagara County’s agricultural
    economy.

In early 2023, additional bridge and supply chain investments are
expected from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s MEGA program (aka
Nationally Significant Infrastructure), along with awards for the Bridge
Investment Program’s allocation for bridge projects under $100 million.
