President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da
Silva of Brazil to the White House on Friday, February 10 to further
strengthen the close relationship between the United States and Brazil.
During their meeting at the White House, the two Presidents will discuss
the United States’ unwavering support of Brazil’s democracy and how the
two countries can continue to work together to promote inclusion and
democratic values in the region and around the world, particularly in
the lead-up to the March 2023 Summit for Democracy. The Presidents will
also discuss how the United States and Brazil can continue to work
together to address common challenges, including combatting climate
change, safeguarding food security, encouraging economic development,
strengthening peace and security, and managing regional migration.
