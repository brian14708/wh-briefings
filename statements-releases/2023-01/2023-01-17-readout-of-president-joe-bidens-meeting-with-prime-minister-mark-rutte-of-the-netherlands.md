President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Mark Rutte
of the Netherlands at the White House.  The leaders reaffirmed the
historic ties and shared values that link our two nations.  As strong
NATO Allies, they discussed ways to further deepen our cooperation on
transatlantic and global issues of mutual interest.  They reviewed our
steadfast political, security, economic, and humanitarian support for
Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression, including our
efforts to hold Russia accountable for its abuses and for the war crimes
committed by Russian forces.  The leaders also discussed our growing
cooperation on other foreign policy priorities, including our shared
vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.  They talked about
strengthening democracy, respect for human rights, and the rules-based
international order around the world, including as co-hosts of the
upcoming second Summit for Democracy.  Building on the deep trade and
investment partnership between the United States and the Netherlands,
the President and Prime Minister discussed the importance of secure
supply chains and critical technologies to our national security and
economic prosperity.
