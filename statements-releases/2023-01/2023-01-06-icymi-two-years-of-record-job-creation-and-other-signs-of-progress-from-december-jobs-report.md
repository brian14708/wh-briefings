title: "ICYMI:\_Two Years of Record Job Creation and Other Signs of Progress from\
  \ December Jobs\_Report"
---
 
Today’s jobs report shows that the economy added 223,000 jobs last
month—capping the two strongest years of job growth in history. This is
just the latest sign President Biden’s economic plan is working as we
continue to transition to more steady, stable growth without giving up
all the historic gains achieved for American workers.   
  
**Quick Facts:**

-   The President’s first two years in office—2021 and 2022—were
    the **two strongest years of job growth in history.**
-   The unemployment rate is at the **lowest level in 50 years.**
-   Unemployment is **near record lows for Black and Hispanic
    Americans.**
-   The unemployment rate is at a** record low for people with
    disabilities.**
-   Hourly **wages were up** 0.3% in December, following five months in
    which real wages rose.
-   Manufacturing employment continued to grow, with **8,000
    manufacturing jobs added last month** for 750,000 total
    manufacturing jobs created since Biden took office.
-   The **labor force grew** as labor force participation continues to
    grow more quickly in this recovery than past ones, especially for
    prime age workers.
