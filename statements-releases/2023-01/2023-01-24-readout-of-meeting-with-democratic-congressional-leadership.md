title: "Readout of Meeting with Democratic Congressional\_Leadership"
---
 
This afternoon President Biden and Vice President Harris hosted Leader
Schumer, Senator Durbin, Senator Stabenow, Leader Jeffries,
Representative Clark, and Representative Aguilar in the Roosevelt Room.

The leaders agreed on the importance of building on the historic
economic progress being achieved because of their shared accomplishments
from the last two years, including the lowest unemployment in 50 years,
significant ground gained against inflation, and more Americans getting
health coverage than ever.

The President and the congressional leaders discussed continued
stepped-up implementation of groundbreaking laws like the Inflation
Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, which taken together are reducing drug and energy
costs, bringing more jobs back to America, and rebuilding the nation.

The group also emphasized advancing our national security interests,
like continuing to assist Ukraine.

They also agreed on continuing to work across the aisle with their
Republican colleagues to deliver more results for the American people,
while also being honest about disagreements – like our opposition to an
unprecedented middle class tax hike, inflation-worsening tax cuts for
the rich, abortion bans, or cutting Social Security and Medicare.
