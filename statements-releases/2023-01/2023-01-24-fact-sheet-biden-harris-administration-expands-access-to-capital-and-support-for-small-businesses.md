title: "FACT SHEET:\_Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Expands Access to Capital and\
  \ Support for Small\_Businesses"
---
 
From its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration has
focused on helping the nation’s businesses recover from the economic
impact of the pandemic and grow. Last week, the Census Bureau released
data that showed that over the last two years Americans have applied to
start 10.5 million new businesses, making 2021 and 2022 the strongest
two years on record for new business applications. With unemployment at
a record low and the two strongest years of job creation in our history,
this is just the latest confirmation that the President’s economic plan
is working to build our economy from the bottom up and middle out.   
  
Today, the Administration will convene a roundtable with leaders across
the small business space to discuss its commitment to ensuring small
businesses have the access to the capital, technical assistance, and
support they need to thrive. The Administration’s actions include:

**Expanding Access to Capital:  
**  
Capital is vital for small businesses to start and grow. That’s why
expanding access to capital, and making sure there are ample pathways to
reach that capital, is a core pillar of the Administration’s agenda to
support small businesses. To that end, the Administration is taking a
number of steps:

-   Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) Proposed Rule. SBA is
    committed to meeting borrowers where they are by extending its
    program offerings to the lenders that underrepresented small
    businesses turn to for their capital needs. Currently, SBA works
    with these lenders in a number of ways. Non-bank private lenders are
    able to participate in the 7a program as guaranteed lenders by
    obtaining an SBLC license. Yet the number of SBLCs available has
    been capped at 14 since 1983. In addition, SBA licenses over 60
    active CDFIs as lenders through the Community Advantage Pilot
    program. This proposed rule, if made final, would lift the
    moratorium on new 7a lending licenses allowing SBA to extend
    additional licenses to nonbank lenders and CDFIs. SBA would plan to
    add three licenses in the initial extension. In addition, it would
    open a path for Community Advantage program to become permanent.
    These steps would allow SBA to expand the pool of lenders that offer
    SBA-backed working capital loans to include those non-traditional
    institutions that have more expertise in meeting the needs of
    underserved small businesses.  
-   Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Proposed Rule.  SBICs are
    privately owned and managed investment funds licensed and regulated
    by the SBA. An SBIC invests private capital and borrowed capital
    with an SBA guarantee to make long-term debt or equity investments
    in qualifying small businesses. Historically, the structure of
    interest payments on SBIC loans leads licensed funds to support
    later stage companies with predictable cash flow as opposed to
    early-stage companies. The proposed SBIC rule is intended to reduce
    barriers to program participation for new SBIC fund managers and
    funds investing in underserved communities and geographies, among
    other groups. The rule introduces a new class of SBIC license,
    “Accrual SBICs,” designed to unlock more patient capital financing
    for startups and small businesses through the SBA’s public – private
    partnership investment program, the SBIC program. It also implements
    SBIC program regulatory changes to lower financial, administrative,
    and procedural barriers to program participation for new fund
    managers and longer duration equity-oriented fund
    strategies. Finally, it modernizes the SBIC program license offering
    and process to align with a more diversified set of private funds
    investing in underserved and undercapitalized areas.  
-   Lending Criteria, Affiliation, and Employee Ownership for SBA
    Business Loan Programs Proposed Rule: SBA is proposing to streamline
    and modernize various regulations governing its 7(a) and 504 loan
    programs. The proposed rule, if made final, would allow SBA lenders
    to underwrite SBA loans using their own standard processes which
    empowers lenders and opens a path for credit alternatives,
    significantly simplify affiliation rules which would reduce the
    processing burden on small business borrowers, and offer a path for
    employees to take ownership in a small business.  
-   Implementing the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI): The
    Treasury Department has implemented the American Rescue Plan’s SSBCI
    which provides nearly $10 billion to states, the District of
    Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments to expand access to
    capital for small businesses, build ecosystems of opportunity and
    entrepreneurship, and create new jobs and economic
    opportunity—especially in underserved communities still reeling from
    the effects of the pandemic. SSBCI provides funding for credit and
    investment programs for existing small businesses, and technical
    assistance to small businesses applying for SSBCI funding and other
    government small business support programs. With a focus on equity
    and reaching underserved communities, SSBCI allocates $2.5 billion
    in funding and incentives for underserved businesses. These federal
    investments are designed to catalyze up to $10 of small business
    lending and investment for every $1 of SSBCI funding which will
    result in tens of billions of new small business financing across
    the country before 2030.

**Making Historic Investments in Support Services for Small
Businesses:**

The Administration is focused on meeting small businesses owners where
they are and offering extensive support services to navigate available
programs. It’s not enough to just provide funding and loans; small
businesses need to be able to utilize them as well. This Administration
has made historic investments in support services for small businesses.
That includes:

-   Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP).  In 2022, Treasury
    closed and funded approximately $8.38 billion in investments with
    170 institutions through ECIP. ECIP investments are supporting the
    efforts of community financial institutions — including CDFIs and
    MDIs — to provide loans, grants, and other assistance to small and
    minority-owned businesses and consumers, especially in low-income
    and financially underserved communities that struggled during the
    pandemic.  
-   Wide Ranging Investments by the CDFI Fund. In 2022, the CDFI Fund
    deployed significant funds to provide capital to traditionally
    underserved communities including $5 billion in New Market Tax
    Credit allocations, $355 million under the Bond Guarantee program,
    and more than $580 million in other grant programs. Last fall, the
    CDFI Fund released the notice of funding availability for the $1.75
    billion CDFI Equitable Recovery Program, aimed at providing funding
    to CDFIs expanding lending in communities that have significant
    unmet capital needs, and received almost 700 applications.  
-   Providing SSBCI Technical Assistance: As a critical element of the
    $10 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, Treasury has
    announced the availability of $200 million specifically to support
    small business technical assistance for states, the District of
    Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments that are participating
    in SSBCI. The Department of Commerce has also announced a nearly
    $100 million Capital Readiness Program, a grant program funded as
    part of SSBCI to help minority and other underserved entrepreneurs
    that will be administered by the Minority Business Development
    Agency (MBDA).   
-   SBA Community Navigators Program: In 2021, SBA awarded a $100
    million in grant funding to organizations in all 50 states and
    Puerto Rico that are working to close resource gaps for U.S small
    businesses and those in underserved and underrepresented
    communities. The program offers funding to nonprofits, state and
    local governments, universities, and tribal entities that serve as
    “hub” organizations. These hubs have established ties with hundreds
    of “spoke” organizations—trusted, culturally
    knowledgeable, local groups and individuals— who they support to
    increase awareness and connections to federal, state, and local
    resources. The program was designed to advance equity through its
    priority focus on socially and economically disadvantaged small
    businesses, rural communities, and small businesses owned by women
    and veterans. As of August 2022, Community Navigators have helped
    secure over $133 million in funding, trained over 170,00 business
    owners, and provided over 30,000 hours of 1:1 counseling.

**Improving Agency Services and Coordination:  
**  
This Administration is committed to continuing to improve upon the
programs and services that are already provided. To that end, the
Administration is taking the following steps:

-   Improving SBA’s Lender Match: SBA will implement significant
    technological improvements to its small business borrower and lender
    marketplace tool, Lender Match. This improved version of Lender
    Match will provide an enhanced landing page to match small business
    borrowers with SBA lenders and offer the option to be taken through
    the entire loan process. It will offer automated tools for lenders
    to streamline underwriting, make the use of credit alternatives more
    common place, and offer an automated eligibility module to make SBA
    lending lower risk and lower cost. Additionally, Lender Match’s
    automated offerings will enable SBA to better fight fraud via
    increased use of data and automated protocols for SBA-backed loans.

-   Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC): In July, Vice
    President Harris announced the formation of the Interagency
    Community Investment Committee (ICIC) chaired by the Treasury
    Department. The ICIC facilitates collaboration and operational
    coordination of federal community investments to maximize the impact
    of federal dollars. Last fall, they released a request for
    information to gather input on how to improve the effectiveness and
    impact of federal community investment programs and will continue to
    provide a forum for continued interagency cooperation to support
    underserved communities, especially when it comes to community
    investment and access to capital.
