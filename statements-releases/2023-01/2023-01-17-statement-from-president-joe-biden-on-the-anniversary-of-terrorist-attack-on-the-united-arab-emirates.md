title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Anniversary of Terrorist Attack\
  \ on the United Arab\_Emirates"
---
 
One year ago, in a terrorist attack launched from Yemen, two ballistic
missiles and a series of drones targeted civilian sites in the United
Arab Emirates. While the UAE’s air defense systems – a hallmark of our
decades-long security partnership – shot the missiles out of the sky,
three innocent civilians died during this heinous attack.

Today, we remember the lives that were so tragically lost, and we
reaffirm the United States’ commitment to the safety and security of the
Emirati people. Working in close cooperation with my friend President
Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the United States will continue to support
the UAE as it defends itself against threats – whether from Yemen or
anywhere else. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of diplomacy to bring
a peaceful end to the war in Yemen, and the United States will continue
to support the security of the UAE and our other partners in the Middle
East, including providing needed military assistance. Therefore, as we
commemorate the tragic events of one year ago, we stand resolute to
ensure it cannot happen again.

As the UAE prepares to host the world to address the climate challenge
during COP-28 this fall, the United States and UAE will continue our
work to advance impactful new initiatives, like the Partnership for
Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) and the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). Our strong partnership is critical
to building a shared future of greater peace, stability, and integration
throughout the region.
