---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Alabama and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes on January 12, 2023.  
   
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Autauga and Dallas.  
   
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the counties of Autauga and
Dallas.  
   
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Kevin A. Wallace, Sr. as
the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   
   
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional areas
may be designated for assistance after the assessments are fully
completed.  
   
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
