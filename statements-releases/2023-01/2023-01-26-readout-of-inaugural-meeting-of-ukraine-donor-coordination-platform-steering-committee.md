title: "Readout of Inaugural Meeting of Ukraine Donor Coordination Platform Steering\_\
  Committee"
---
 
Today, Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Mike
Pyle co-chaired the inaugural meeting of the Ukraine Multi-agency Donor
Coordination Platform’s Steering Committee, delivering on G7 Leaders’
December 2022 commitment and exemplifying the Biden-Harris
Administration’s unwavering support for Ukraine. Representatives from G7
countries, the Government of Ukraine, and the international financial
institutions discussed how to better coordinate economic support for
Ukraine’s immediate financing needs and future economic recovery and
reconstruction efforts. They committed to work closely with Ukrainian
authorities to define, prioritize, and sequence strategic economic
needs; to further Ukraine’s reform ambitions; and to deliver economic
assistance to stabilize Ukraine’s economy and underpin a sustainable and
inclusive recovery. Pyle commended the Government of Ukraine’s adept
management of its economy, despite incredibly difficult circumstances,
and its vision for a broad-based economic reform agenda. He welcomed
opening remarks from the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, and
appreciated working with his co-chairs, Finance Minister of Ukraine,
Sergii Marchenko, and the European Commission Director General for
Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Gert Jan Koopman, and in close
consultation with Japan in its G7 Presidency role. Collaboration will
continue in the coming weeks, and the Steering Committee will hold its
next meeting in March.
