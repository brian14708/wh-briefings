title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on December Producer Price\_Index"
---
 
Today, we received more evidence that we are making real progress
tackling inflation and lowering costs, successfully transitioning from a
historic recovery to steady and stable growth. The inflation rate for
producers fell further, and is now at its lowest level since March 2021.
This decrease reflected a decline in food and energy prices, bringing
real breathing room to working families.  And, price increases outside
of food, energy, and trade services slowed and are at their lowest level
since March 2021.  
   
We also learned that, adjusted for inflation, consumers continue to
spend, albeit at a pace that is slowing compared to earlier in the
recovery – that’s expected with the transition to steady and stable
growth.  
   
Today’s news comes on the heels of an unemployment rate near a 50-year
low, inflation coming down for six months in a row, and record-setting
small business applications for my first two years.  
   
We are not letting up, and there are even more reasons for optimism this
year. This month, thanks to my economic agenda passed over the last two
years, there will be lower prescription costs for our seniors, tax
breaks for lower energy bills, strengthened supply chains, and more good
jobs that Americans can raise a family on rebuilding our infrastructure
and manufacturing here at home.
