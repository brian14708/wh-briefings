title: "Readout of the White\_House\u2019s Meeting with Climate Finance\_Leaders"
---
 
Today, National Economic Council (NEC) Director Brian Deese, National
Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, and senior Administration officials held
a virtual meeting with leaders and advocates focused on climate-related
financial risks. The Administration officials and group discussed the
risks that climate change poses to our financial system – both in terms
of the physical risks posed by of climate impacts like increasingly
frequent and severe storms, droughts, and wildfires, as well as
transition risks related to the global shift to a net-zero economy.

NEC Director Deese and National Climate Advisor McCarthy emphasized that
President Biden and Secretary Yellen are committed to increasing
transparency around climate-related financial risks to our businesses
and economy. They also highlighted the Administration’s commitment to
carrying out President Biden’s executive order on tackling the climate
crisis, which includes developing a climate finance plan that leverages
multilateral and bilateral channels and institutions, assisting
developing countries in implementing ambitious emissions reduction
measures, protecting critical ecosystems, building resilience against
the impacts of climate change, and promoting the flow of capital toward
climate-aligned investments and away from high-carbon investments.

The Administration officials were grateful to listen to the group and
hear their valuable insights and perspectives around shared priorities
to advance transparency and disclosure around climate-related financial
risk.
