Today, we again mark the tragic anniversary of the abduction in Iran of
Robert Levinson — the longest held hostage in U.S history.

After 14 years and repeated, persistent efforts to secure Iran’s
cooperation in locating Mr. Levinson, we are still without answers.
Nevertheless, we will continue to demand answers and to hold Iran
accountable for his abduction, detention, and probable death. We will
not relent until all of our citizens who continue to be wrongfully
detained in Iran and around the world, are returned to their families.

The last 14 years have been heart-wrenching for Mr. Levinson’s wife and
children. Nothing can bring back the lost years – more than 5,000 days
in all –to his family, friends and loved ones. 

But the United States will remain resolute in our support to the
Levinson family and our commitment to pursuing justice for Mr. Levinson
and his family.
