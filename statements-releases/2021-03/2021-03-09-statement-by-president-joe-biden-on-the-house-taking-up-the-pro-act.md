title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the House Taking Up the PRO\_Act"

I strongly encourage the House to pass the Protecting the Right to
Organize (PRO) Act of 2021, which would dramatically enhance the power
of workers to organize and collectively bargain for better wages,
benefits, and working conditions.

As America works to recover from the devastating challenges of deadly
pandemic, an economic crisis, and reckoning on race that reveals deep
disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an
economy that works for everyone.  We owe it not only to those who have
put in a lifetime of work, but to the next generation of workers who
have only known an America of rising inequality and shrinking
opportunity. All of us deserve to enjoy America’s promise in full — and
our nation’s leaders have a responsibility to deliver it.

That starts with rebuilding unions. The middle class built this country,
and unions built the middle class. Unions give workers a stronger voice
to increase wages, improve the quality of jobs and protect job security,
protect against racial and all other forms of discrimination and sexual
harassment, and protect workers’ health, safety, and benefits in the
workplace.  Unions lift up workers, both union and non-union.  They are
critical to strengthening our economic competitiveness.

But, after generations of sweat and sacrifice, fighting hard to earn the
wages and benefits that built and sustained the American middle class,
unions are under siege. Nearly 60 million Americans would join a union
if they get a chance, but too many employers and states prevent them
from doing so through anti-union attacks. They know that without unions,
they can run the table on workers – union and non-union alike.

We should all remember that the National Labor Relations Act didn’t just
say that we shouldn’t hamstring unions or merely tolerate them. It said
that we should encourage unions. The PRO Act would take critical steps
to help restore this intent.  
  
I urge Congress to send the PRO Act to my desk so we can seize the
opportunity to build a future that reflects working people’s courage and
ambition, and offers not only good jobs with a real choice to join a
union — but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity and common purpose
the hardworking people who built this country and make it run deserve.
