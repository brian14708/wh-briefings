National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council
Director Brian Deese co-hosted a virtual event today with Ambassadors
and Permanent Representatives from island countries and territories in
the Caribbean, North Atlantic, and Pacific regions.  They discussed how
pandemic-related economic disruptions and the climate crisis have caused
an unprecedented crisis for import and tourism-dependent island
economies, and they underscored the Biden Administration’s goal of
strengthening our relationships with allies and partners across the
board, including smaller countries that have not always been at the top
of the U.S. diplomatic and economic agenda.   Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Deese
invited participants to partner with the United States under the Small
and Less Populous Island Economies (SALPIE) Initiative, a new economic
cooperation framework designed to strengthen U.S. collaboration with
these island economies to counter COVID-19 economic challenges, promote
economic recovery, respond to the climate crisis, and advance
longer-term shared interests.
