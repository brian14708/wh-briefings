title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the House Passage of the American Rescue\_\
  Plan"
---
 
For weeks now, an overwhelming percentage of Americans – Democrats,
Independents, and Republicans – have made it clear they support the
American Rescue Plan. Today, with final passage in the House of
Representatives, their voice has been heard.

Now we move forward with the resources needed to vaccinate the nation.
To get $1,400 in direct payments to 85% of American households. To
expand coverage and help with lowering health care premiums. To give
small businesses what they need to stay open. To expand unemployment
insurance, provide food and nutrition assistance. To help keep a roof
over people’s heads. To cut child poverty in half.

This legislation is about giving the backbone of this nation – the
essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people
who keep this country going – a fighting chance.

I want to thank all the members who voted for it, especially Speaker
Pelosi, the finest and most capable speaker in the history of our
nation. Once again, she has led into law an historic piece of
legislation that addresses a major crisis and lifts up millions of
Americans.

On Friday, I look forward to signing the American Rescue Plan into law
at the White House – a people’s law at the people’s house.
