The President Orders PREP Act Declaration Amendment to Expand COVID-19
Vaccinator Eligibility to Additional Classes of Medical Professionals
and Health Care Students

HHS Launches [New
Portal](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/COVIDvaccinators/Pages/default.aspx)
for Vaccinators to Check Eligibility Status and Volunteer with their
State

As vaccine supply continues to increase in the coming weeks and all
adults across the U.S. become eligible for vaccination by May 1,
President Biden is announcing new steps to increase the number of
vaccinators to administer vaccines. Through today’s actions more health
care personnel, such as dentists and veterinarians will be eligible to
participate in the national effort to vaccinate the U.S. population,
with the goal of getting the nation closer to normal by the Fourth of
July.

The President is taking the following steps today to increase the number
of vaccinators in the U.S.:

**Ordering an Amendment to the Public Readiness and Emergency
Preparedness (PREP) Act Declaration to Allow More Qualified
Professionals to Serve as Vaccinators.** This action, which was
completed by the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), authorizes additional categories of qualified
professionals to prescribe, dispense, and administer COVID-19 vaccines
anywhere in the country. Newly eligible vaccinators include: Dentists,
Emergency Medical Technicians (Advanced and Intermediate EMTs),
Midwives, Optometrists, Paramedics, Physician Assistants, Podiatrists,
Respiratory Therapists, and Veterinarians. This amendment also
authorizes recently retired members of the above professions,
pharmacists and pharmacy interns to serve as vaccinators, if they were
in good standing upon expiration of their license. And, this amendment
authorizes medical students, nursing students, and students of the other
eligible health care professions with proper training and professional
supervision to serve as vaccinators. States are encouraged to further
expand the categories of persons authorized to administer COVID-19
vaccines in their states, as authorized under the PREP Act, to respond
to the local needs and availability of potential vaccinators.

This effort is the Biden Administration’s third amendment to the PREP
Act Declaration. The Administration’s previous amendments authorized any
health care provider who is licensed or certified in any state to
administer COVID-19 vaccines in any other state or U.S. territory;
authorized any physician, advanced practice registered nurse, registered
nurse, or practical nurse whose license or certification expired within
the past five years – and was in good standing – to administer COVID-19
vaccines in any state or U.S. territory; and authorized any member of a
uniformed service as well as federal government employees, contractors
and volunteers deployed by a federal department or agency to vaccinate
in the state or territory to which they are deployed.

**Launching an Online Vaccinator Portal.** Health care professionals,
retirees, and students can now visit
<https://www.PHE.gov/COVIDvaccinators> for information on whether or not
they are eligible to administer the COVID-19 vaccine under federal law.
The site also includes links to volunteer management portals for every
state, for those professionals and students who wish to volunteer as
vaccinators. HHS is also conducting a significant outreach effort to
health professional associations, schools of health professions, public
health and emergency management stakeholders, and state and local health
officers and immunization managers to share vaccinator eligibility
information and get the word out about volunteer opportunities.

**Deploying Federal Vaccinators Across the Country.** Departments and
agencies from across the U.S. government are contributing their own
health care and support personnel to help surge the national vaccinator
workforce. The Biden Administration has deployed over 4,200 agency
personnel to administer COVID-19 vaccines, including from the National
Disaster Medical System and Public Health Service Corps within the
Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland
Security, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense,
Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Forest Service. Health care
professionals the federal government has deployed include Physicians,
Physician Assistants, Nurses, Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians,
Veterinarians, and EMTs. The federal government has hundreds of
additional interagency vaccinators ready to deploy as further needs are
identified.
