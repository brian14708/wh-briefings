President Joseph R. Biden spoke today with European Commission President
Ursula von der Leyen. He underscored his support for the European Union
and his commitment to repair and revitalize the U.S.-EU partnership.
Noting our shared values and the world’s largest trade and investment
relationship, the leaders agreed to suspend the tariffs related to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Aircraft disputes for four months and to
work toward resolving these long running disputes at the WTO.  They
discussed the importance of close U.S.-EU cooperation to contain the
COVID-19 pandemic and enhance global health security, pursue a
sustainable global economic recovery, tackle the climate crisis, and
strengthen democracy.  The leaders also agreed to coordinate on issues
of shared interest, including China, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and the
Western Balkans
