title: "President\_Biden Announces Intent to Nominate 11 Judicial\_Candidates"
---
 
WASHINGTON – President Biden today announced his intent to nominate 10
individuals to serve as Federal Circuit and District Court judges, and
one individual to serve as a Superior Court Judge for the District of
Columbia. These highly-qualified candidates reflect the President’s
deeply-held conviction that the federal bench should reflect the full
diversity of the American people – both in background and in
professional experience.  
   
These nominees consist of attorneys who have excelled in the legal field
in a wide range of positions, including as renowned jurists, public
defenders, prosecutors, in the private sector, in the military, and as
public servants at all levels of government.  
   
This group also includes groundbreaking nominees, including three
African American women chosen for Circuit Court vacancies, as well as
candidates who, if confirmed, would be the first Muslim American federal
judge in U.S. history, the first AAPI woman to ever serve on the U.S.
District Court for the District of D.C., and the first woman of color to
ever serve as a federal judge for the District of Maryland.  
   
President Biden has had a career-long commitment to the strength of the
federal judiciary, and that is reflected in the historically fast pace
at which he has moved to fill vacancies on the federal bench. The intent
to nominate 11 individuals today is faster than any President in modern
history. With respect to Circuit and District Courts, none of the last
four administrations had nominated more than two candidates by this
point in their presidency.  
   
**Statement from President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.:**  
   
“This trailblazing slate of nominees draws from the very best and
brightest minds of the American legal profession. Each is deeply
qualified and prepared to deliver justice faithfully under our
Constitution and impartially to the American people — and together they
represent the broad diversity of background, experience, and perspective
that makes our nation strong.”
