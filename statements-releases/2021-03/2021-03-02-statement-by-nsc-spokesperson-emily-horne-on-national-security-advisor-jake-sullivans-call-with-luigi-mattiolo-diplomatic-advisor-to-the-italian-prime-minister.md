National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Luigi Mattiolo,
Diplomatic Advisor to the Italian Prime Minister. Mr. Sullivan welcomed
Italy’s new government and underscored his desire to further strengthen
our bilateral partnership.  He also conveyed condolences for the deaths
of Italian Ambassador Luca Attanasio, Carabinieri Vittorio Iacovacci,
and their Congolese driver Mustapha Milambo, in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo on February 22.  Mr. Sullivan expressed U.S. support for
Italy’s priorities in its G20 presidency, including containing the
COVID-19 pandemic, enhancing global health security, pursuing a
sustainable global economic recovery, and tackling the climate crisis. 
They agreed to continue close coordination—both bilaterally and with the
EU—on issues of shared interest, including Libya and the Eastern
Mediterranean.
