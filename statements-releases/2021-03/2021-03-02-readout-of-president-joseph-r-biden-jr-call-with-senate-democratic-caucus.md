title: "Readout of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Call with Senate Democratic\_Caucus"
---
 
President Biden joined the weekly Senate Democratic Caucus lunch meeting
today to make the case for speedy passage of the American Rescue Plan
and get input from Senators on the path forward. During the call, the
President highlighted the broad support the package has received –
including from a bipartisan majority of the American people, state and
local leaders, labor, and the business community – and noted the urgency
of passing the bill to speed up vaccinations and the safe reopening of
schools. With the Senate preparing to take up the Rescue Plan, the
President urged the caucus to remain united in its commitment to passing
a package big enough to meet the economic and health crises we face, and
to act swiftly to pass it before unemployment benefits for around 11
million Americans start expiring on March 14.
