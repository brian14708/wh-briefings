Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Louisiana and ordered federal assistance to

Calcasieu, Catahoula, Claiborne, Concordia, DeSoto, East Baton Rouge,
Franklin, Grant, LaSalle, Madison, Natchitoches, Ouachita, Rapides, Red
River, Richland, Sabine, Webster, West Carroll, and Winn.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to

Federal funding is also available to state and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures and hazard
mitigation measures statewide.
