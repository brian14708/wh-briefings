Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Alejandro
Giammattei of Guatemala and reaffirmed the administration’s commitment
to working together and expanding partnerships to benefit the people of
the region.  They discussed the significant risks to those leaving their
homes and making the dangerous journey to the United States, especially
during a global pandemic.  The Vice President updated President
Giammattei on the United States’ efforts to increase humanitarian
assistance to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  They agreed to
explore innovative opportunities to create jobs and to improve the
conditions for all people in Guatemala and the region, including by
promoting transparency and combating crime.  Vice President Harris and
President Giammattei agreed to collaborate on promoting economic
development, leveraging technology, strengthening climate resilience,
and creating the conditions to expand opportunity for people in their
home countries in order to address the root causes of migration to the
United States.  The Vice President also thanked President Giammattei for
his efforts to secure Guatemala’s southern border.
