title: Statement from President Biden Marking Nowruz
---
 
Spring is an eternal symbol of renewal and rebirth, with light and hope
filling the hearts of people from the United States to Iran, Central
Asia, the Caucuses, the Middle East, and Europe. That is the message and
the joy of Nowruz that we are honoring with a Haft-Sin table in the
White House. This year, perhaps more than ever, that message is badly
needed.Â  After all our pain and loss, we are reminded that better days
lie ahead and that we all must work together to achieve a shared future
of greater peace, prosperity, and understanding. As we continue to make
progress against COVID-19, I hope that soon our virtual celebrations
will return to the joy and community we feel gathering together with
family and friends.

Happy Nowruz!
