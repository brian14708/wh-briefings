title: "President\_Biden Invites 40 World Leaders to Leaders Summit on\_Climate"
---
 
Today, President Biden invited 40 world leaders to the Leaders Summit on
Climate he will host on April 22 and 23.  The virtual Leaders Summit
will be live streamed for public viewing.

President Biden took action his first day in office to return the United
States to the Paris Agreement.  Days later, on January 27, he announced
that he would soon convene a leaders summit to galvanize efforts by the
major economies to tackle the climate crisis.

The Leaders Summit on Climate will underscore the urgency – and the
economic benefits – of stronger climate action.  It will be a key
milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference
(COP26) this November in Glasgow.

In recent years, scientists have underscored the need to limit planetary
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order to stave off the worst impacts
of climate change.  A key goal of both the Leaders Summit and COP26 will
be to catalyze efforts that keep that 1.5-degree goal within reach.  The
Summit will also highlight examples of how enhanced climate ambition
will create good paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help
vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts.  
  
By the time of the Summit, the United States will announce an ambitious
2030 emissions target as its new Nationally Determined Contribution
under the Paris Agreement.  In his invitation, the President urged
leaders to use the Summit as an opportunity to outline how their
countries also will contribute to stronger climate ambition.

The Summit will reconvene the U.S.-led Major Economies Forum on Energy
and Climate, which brings together 17 countries responsible for
approximately 80 percent of global emissions and global GDP.  The
President also invited the heads of other countries that are
demonstrating strong climate leadership, are especially vulnerable to
climate impacts, or are charting innovative pathways to a net-zero
economy.  A small number of business and civil society leaders will also
participate in the Summit.

Key themes of the Summit will include:

-   Galvanizing efforts by the world’s major economies to reduce
    emissions during this critical decade to keep a limit to warming of
    1.5 degree Celsius within reach.
-   Mobilizing public and private sector finance to drive the net-zero
    transition and to help vulnerable countries cope with climate
    impacts. 
-   The economic benefits of climate action, with a strong emphasis on
    job creation, and the importance of ensuring all communities and
    workers benefit from the transition to a new clean energy economy.
-   Spurring transformational technologies that can help reduce
    emissions and adapt to climate change, while also creating enormous
    new economic opportunities and building the industries of the
    future.
-   Showcasing subnational and non-state actors that are committed to
    green recovery and an equitable vision for limiting warming to 1.5
    degree Celsius, and are working closely with national governments to
    advance ambition and resilience.
-   Discussing opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and
    livelihoods from the impacts of climate change, address the global
    security challenges posed by climate change and the impact on
    readiness, and address the role of nature-based solutions in
    achieving net zero by 2050 goals. 

Further details on the Summit agenda, additional participants, media
access, and public viewing will be provided in the coming weeks.
