title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the American Dream and Promise Act of\_2021"
---
 
In every generation, America has been enriched and strengthened by wave
after wave of new immigrants. Dreamers and TPS holders, for whom the
United States is home, are part of our national fabric, and make vital
contributions to communities across the country every day. Many have
worked tirelessly on the frontlines throughout this pandemic to keep our
country afloat, fed, and healthy—yet they are forced to live with fear
and uncertainty because of their immigration status. 

The American Dream and Promise Act of 2021 is a critical first step in
reforming our immigration system and will provide much needed relief to
TPS holders and Dreamers, young people who came here as children and
know no other country. I support this bill, and commend the House of
Representatives for passing this important legislation.

My Administration looks forward to working together with Congress to do
the right thing for Dreamers and TPS holders who contribute so much to
our country, and to building a 21<sup>st</sup> century immigration
system that is grounded in dignity, safety, and fairness, and finally
enacts the long term solutions we need to create an orderly and humane
immigration system, tackle the root causes of migration to the United
States and to create a path to citizenship for the undocumented
population in the United States.
