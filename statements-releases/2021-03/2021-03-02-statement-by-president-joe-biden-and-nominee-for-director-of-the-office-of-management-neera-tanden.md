**Statement by President Joe Biden**

I have accepted Neera Tanden’s request to withdraw her name from
nomination for Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I have
the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and
her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my
Administration. She will bring valuable perspective and insight to our
work.

  
**Letter from Neera Tanden to President Biden Withdrawing Her
Nomination**

  
Dear President Biden,  
   
I am writing to you to withdraw my nomination for Director of the Office
of Management and Budget. It has been an honor of a lifetime to be
considered for this role and for the faith placed in me.   
   
I appreciate how hard you and your team at the White House has worked to
win my confirmation. Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no
path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued
consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other
priorities.  
   
I am incredibly grateful for your leadership on behalf of the American
people and for your agenda that will make such a transformative
difference in people’s lives.  
   
Sincerely,  
   
Neera Tanden
