title: "Statement by President Biden on the COVID- \u2060 19 Hate Crimes Act"
---
 
Jill and I share the nation’s grief and outrage at the horrific killings
of eight people, among them six Asian American women, in Georgia on
March 16<sup>th</sup>.  
  
While we do not yet know motive, as I said last week, we condemn in the
strongest possible terms the ongoing crisis of gender-based and
anti-Asian violence that has long plagued our nation. I urge Congress to
swiftly pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would expedite the
federal government’s response to the rise of hate crimes exacerbated
during the pandemic, support state and local governments to improve hate
crimes reporting, and ensure that hate crimes information is more
accessible to Asian American communities.  I thank Senator Hirono,
Congresswoman Meng, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus
Chairwoman Chu for their consistent leadership on this issue — and for
their persistence in standing up for America’s values by standing
strongly against anti-Asian xenophobia and hate.

During my first week in office, I signed a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-condemning-and-combating-racism-xenophobia-and-intolerance-against-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders-in-the-united-states/) to
condemn and combat racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. I directed the
Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services to
help lead our nation’s efforts to stop anti-Asian bias, xenophobia, and
harassment. Now, it’s time for Congress to codify and expand upon these
actions — because every person in our nation deserves to live their
lives with safety, dignity, and respect.
