title: A Letter on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Ukraine
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
  
     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of
March 6, 2014, with respect to Ukraine is to continue in effect beyond
March 6, 2021.   
     The actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic
processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security,
stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the
misappropriation of its assets, and the actions and policies of the
Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported annexation
of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to pose an unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of
the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 with
respect to Ukraine.

                                  JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
March 2, 2021.
