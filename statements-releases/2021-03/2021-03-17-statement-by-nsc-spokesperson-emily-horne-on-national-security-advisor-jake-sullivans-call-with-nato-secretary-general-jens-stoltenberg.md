cyber threats and climate change. Mr. Sullivan and the Secretary General
also discussed NATO missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and their shared
concerns about Russia’s destabilizing activities. They noted the
importance of continued Allied efforts to enhance burden-sharing and
agreed to work closely together ahead of the NATO Summit to be held this
