title: "FACT SHEET: Small and Less Populous Island Economies (SALPIE)\_Initiative"
---
 
Today the Biden administration launched the “Small and Less Populous
Island Economies (SALPIE) Initiative,” an economic cooperation framework
designed to strengthen U.S. collaboration with island countries and
territories in the Caribbean, North Atlantic, and Pacific regions. 

The SALPIE Initiative signals the U.S. government’s prioritization of
cooperation with these economies to counter COVID-19 economic
challenges, promote economic recovery, respond to the climate crisis,
and advance longer-term shared interests.  Pandemic-related economic
disruptions have caused an unprecedented global crisis, and import and
tourism-dependent island economies have not been spared.  These same
island communities are also among the most vulnerable to climate change;
their economic resilience is increasingly threatened by more frequent
and severe storms, rising sea levels, and warming ocean temperatures.

SALPIE partners are geographically diverse island economies that face
similar challenges.  Most have populations under 1 million, have been
heavily impacted by COVID-related economic disruptions, and are
especially susceptible to the effects of climate change.  Many do not
qualify for concessional foreign assistance programs due to their higher
income levels per capita.  Re-focusing our economic relationships with
these partners will advance shared interests and promote economic
recovery and resilience. 

The Initiative builds on programming designed to elevate our economic
cooperation to provide a framework for the United States to enhance
bilateral, regional, and multilateral collaboration in SALPIE regions. 
Beyond addressing more immediate economic and humanitarian consequences
of the pandemic and climate change, the U.S. government welcomes the
opportunity to partner with these economies to advance important
long-term objectives, including strengthening bilateral and regional
economic ties, countering predatory investment practices by malign
actors, and enhancing collaboration within international organizations.
 

The United States values the strong trade and investment ties we have
with SALPIE and views this as an opportune time to reaffirm and reinvest
in the importance of those relationships as we work together on economic
recovery efforts.  While not an all-inclusive inventory of U.S.
cooperation with this set of economies, the SALPIE Initiative brings 29
U.S. departments and agencies together to coordinate ongoing and future
engagements in the following areas:

-   **Economic Growth:**  Programs that support generating rapid,
    meaningful, sustained, inclusive, and broad-based economic growth.

<!-- -->

-   **Climate/Sustainable Energy/Environment:**  Programs that support
    climate initiatives, sustainable energy development, natural
    disaster response and resilience, and other critical environmental
    and sustainability issues.

<!-- -->

-   **Development Finance:**  Programs in partnership with the private
    sector that leverage loans and/or other credit guarantees to finance
    projects.

<!-- -->

-   **Humanitarian/Social:**  Programs that directly support or promote
    capacity building to improve humanitarian and social conditions.

<!-- -->

-   **Diplomatic/Educational/Cultural:**  Programs with an economic
    focus that foster relationship building and enhance bilateral
    cooperation.

<!-- -->

-   **Political/Security:**  Programs aimed at establishing the
    conditions and capacity necessary for sustainable economic growth by
    promoting peace, security, stability, and sound democratic
    institutions and processes.
