title: Readout of the Second National Climate Task Force Meeting
---
 
Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the second
National Climate Task Force to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration’s
whole-of-government approach to tackling the climate crisis, creating
good-paying, union jobs, and prioritizing environmental justice.

During the virtual meeting, Cabinet leaders and senior Administration
officials discussed their respective plans to integrate addressing
climate change throughout their agencies to put the United States in a
position of strength to lead the world in a clean energy revolution that
creates American jobs with the chance to join a union and builds back an
inclusive, equitable economy. Participants, including the Special
Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, also looked ahead to the
Earth Day Leaders Summit on April 22 and opportunities for each agency
to reduce emissions while supporting good-paying, union jobs, improve
health in our communities, and ensure America leads the industries that
will power the future.

Following the task force meeting, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Forest Service announced it will invest more than $218 million to
leverage the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to fund projects
that will help drive rural economic recovery and job creation, support
the voluntary stewardship efforts of private landowners, and better
conserve America’s public lands. The Administration’s investments
through the LWCF are helping expand access to the outdoors for all
communities, including in areas that have disproportionately less access
to nature, and bolstering the nation’s natural defenses against climate
change.

Additionally, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to
restoring scientific integrity, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) announced it is taking the first step to relaunch its climate
change website to provide the public with information on emissions data,
climate change impacts, scientific reports, and more. 

As outlined by President Biden’s January 27 executive order on tackling
the climate, the Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor
and includes Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior
White House officials to mobilize the Biden-Harris Administration’s
implementation of a whole-of-government approach.
