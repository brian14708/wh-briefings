Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris met in the Oval Office
with a bipartisan group of Members of Congress who have been leaders in
supporting medical research to discuss the critical need to work
together to end cancer as we know it. As the President, Vice President,
and Members of Congress discussed, this is an issue that is personal and
one that affects all families. They had a productive conversation and
exchanged constructive ideas about how to make breakthrough progress in
cancer research. They agreed to continue collaborating on ideas for
investing in transformational research and committed to working across
the aisle to deliver on the issue for the American people.
