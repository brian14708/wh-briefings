title: President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Amends Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
  Islands Disaster Declaration
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. made additional disaster
assistance available to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
by authorizing an increase in the level of federal funding for the Other
Needs Assistance – Lost Wages Assistance (ONA-LWA) program that was
authorized as a result of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic beginning on January 20, 2020, and continuing.

Under the major disaster declaration issued for the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands on April 1, 2020 and a subsequent amendment,
the federal share was made available for ONA-LWA at 75 percent federal
funding of the total eligible costs.         

Under the President’s order today, the non-federal cost share for
ONA-LWA has been waived.
