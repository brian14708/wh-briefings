title: "Readout of the White House\u2019s Meeting with Oil and Gas Company Leadership"
---
 
Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened a meeting with
leadership from oil and gas companies to discuss shared priorities
around addressing the climate crisis, protecting and creating
good-paying, union jobs across the country, and ensuring America leads
the world in a clean energy revolution that powers the future.

During the virtual meeting, National Climate Advisor McCarthy emphasized
President Biden’s commitment to bringing the voices and perspectives of
all stakeholders to the table when tackling climate change. She asked
participants to share information about their commitments and ideas for
addressing the climate crisis and reducing emissions while supporting
local economies and job creation.

National Climate Advisor McCarthy underscored how President Biden’s
plans to tackle the climate crisis are centered around propelling our
equitable economic recovery, positioning America to win the 21st
century, and creating millions of good-paying, union jobs directly in
American communities. She made clear that the Administration is not
fighting the oil and gas sector, but fighting to create union jobs,
deploy emission reduction technologies, strengthen American
manufacturing, and fuel the American economy.

The Department of the Interior was also represented in the meeting to
discuss President Biden’s pause on leasing on federal public lands and
the ongoing outreach efforts to engage critical perspectives from the
public, including workers, Native communities, businesses, and more, as
it conducts a comprehensive review of the program to ensure the
Administration can advance shared goals around addressing climate change
and supporting economic growth.
