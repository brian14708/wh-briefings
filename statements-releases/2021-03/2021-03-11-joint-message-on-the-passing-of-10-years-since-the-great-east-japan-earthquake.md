title: "Joint Message on the Passing of 10 Years Since the Great East Japan\_Earthquake"
---
 
Ten years ago, the Great East Japan Earthquake touched off a trio of
disasters that claimed countless lives and caused immense suffering and
damage for the people of Japan.  On this solemn occasion, we remember
all those who were lost, and we extend our deepest condolences to the
families and communities who were devastated and who are still mourning
such an immense tragedy.

When the catastrophic earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear power plant
accident hit, Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and U.S. Forces immediately
sprang into action, joining together to perform search-and-rescue
operations and to provide supplies and transportation to those in
need.   Japan and the United States worked hand-in-hand to alleviate
suffering and to respond to the accident at the Tokyo Electric Power
Company’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, with the aid of
experts, goods, and equipment from many countries. After the
catastrophe, U.S. and Japanese forces also worked in lockstep to restore
operations at Sendai Airport, which also served as a hub to distribute
over two million tons of relief supplies. And our peoples stepped up as
well, with American and Japanese citizens working together at the
grassroots level to contribute to Japan’s recovery and reconstruction.
Five months after the disasters, then-Vice President Biden visited
Natori and Sendai to see the relief efforts firsthand, as well as the
incredible strength and resilience of the Japanese people. Then, as now,
our joint efforts hold a special place in the hearts and memories of
both our peoples—a testament to the special bond and the unshakable
friendship that is the U.S.-Japanese alliance.

We must not forget that, even after ten years, many of those affected
continue to struggle in the wake of the disaster.  In support of these
individuals and to honor who we lost, Japan and the United
States will continue to move forward shoulder-to-shoulder as
“tomodachi” (friends) to finish the reconstruction of the Tōhoku region
and to realize a better future for us all.
