Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, White House Public Engagement
Director Cedric Richmond, Acting Director of the White House Initiative
on AAPIs Laura Shin, and Domestic Policy Advisor to the Vice President
Rohini Kosoglu hosted a virtual roundtable listening session with Asian
American and Pacific Islander advocates and community leaders from
across the country to discuss the increasing rates of anti-Asian
harassment and violence. Participants shared their perspectives on the
climate of fear that Asian American communities are facing. They also
shared the important work they are doing across the country,
recommendations for preventing and addressing violence against Asian
American communities, and highlighted the coalition building that is
happening across communities.

Ambassador Rice and Congressman Richmond expressed gratitude for the
participants’ courageous leadership in addressing acts of violence and
bias against Asian American communities. They reiterated President
Biden’s commitment to ending anti-Asian violence and bias, and
confronting the role that some federal leaders played during the
COVID-19 pandemic in promoting unfounded fear and bias against Asian
American communities. Ambassador Rice and Congressman Richmond also
underscored that the President has made it the policy of his
Administration to condemn and combat xenophobia against Asian Americans.

Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against
