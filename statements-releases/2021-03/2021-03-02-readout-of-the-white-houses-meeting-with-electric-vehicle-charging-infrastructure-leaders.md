  \ Infrastructure\_Leaders"

Today, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, alongside senior staff
from the National Economic Council, the Council on Environmental
Quality, and Department of Transportation, held a virtual meeting with
CEOs from electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure companies to
discuss shared priorities from tackling the climate crisis to supporting
the economic recovery to build back better.  
  
National Climate Advisor McCarthy underscored President Biden’s
commitment to investments that will strengthen domestic supply chains,
bolster American manufacturing, create good-paying, union jobs in
sectors that support vehicle electrification, and she noted the
Administration’s goal to build more than 500,000 EV chargers.
Administration officials and EV charging infrastructure leaders
discussed the importance of accelerating the development and deployment
of EV charging technologies and infrastructure to empower American
workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century.  
  
The Administration officials asked leaders from the companies at the
cutting edge of EV charging infrastructure and associated technologies
to share their perspectives and insights about how to most effectively
accelerate and scale a national network of EV charging stations. The
officials and EV charging infrastructure leaders agreed it was important
to encourage collaboration across the government, automotive industry,
and other sectors involved in vehicle electrification as the country
aims to lead the world in a clean energy revolution while supporting the
economic recovery and creating good-paying, union jobs.
