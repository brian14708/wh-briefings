  \ in\_Libya"
---
 
On behalf of President Biden, I congratulate the Libyan people on
establishing a Government of National Unity that will guide Libya to
national elections on December 24, 2021.

All Libyans deserve this chance to choose their leaders through the
democratic process, reestablish their sovereignty free from foreign
interference and violence, and secure a brighter future after painful
years of civil conflict and political upheaval. The United States stands
with all those committed to elections and, in support of United Nations
mediation and together with our international partners, we will promote
accountability for any parties that seek to undermine the electoral
roadmap Libyans have established.

The empty logic of military escalation has failed. It is long past time
for foreign countries sending mercenaries and weapons that harm innocent
Libyans to begin their withdrawal and respect the resounding Libyan
calls for a peaceful political transition. Now is the opportunity for
Libyans to lay down their arms, resolve their differences peacefully,
subscribe to a new era of law and order, and write for themselves a more
stable and prosperous chapter in their history.
