*Today’s action by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
extend the federal eviction moratorium represents the latest effort to
provide relief to renters and landlords.*

Following today’s announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) of a [90-day
extension](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-eviction-declaration.html) of
the federal eviction moratorium, the Biden-Harris Administration is
continuing its efforts to support tenants and landlords during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Federal agencies including the Treasury Department,
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of
Agriculture (USDA), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are coordinating efforts to get
tenants and landlords the assistance they need during the public health
crisis.

President Biden entered office facing twin crises of historic
proportions: a global pandemic and an economic downturn that left [10
million people](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) out of
work and [one in five
renters](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and) behind
on rent. On January 29<sup>th</sup>, just days after President Biden
entered office, the CDC extended the existing eviction moratorium
through the end of March, recognizing the historic threat to our
nation’s health. Alongside the extension, the Administration continued
to seek relief for struggling Americans. $25 billion had been allocated
to rental assistance under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,
and the Biden-Harris Administration worked quickly to streamline and
simplify rules to access funding. The American Rescue Plan, signed into
law by President Biden, will deliver an additional $21.5 billion in
emergency rental assistance to help millions of families keep up on rent
and remain in their homes.

President Biden remains committed to implementing a whole-of-government
approach to addressing the nation’s housing challenges. The White House
American Rescue Plan Coordinator is working across agencies and with
White House offices to implement the American Rescue Plan’s housing
provisions. And, Treasury, HUD, USDA, CFPB and the FTC are upholding
that commitment through the following actions to maximize the impact of
the extension and additional funding in the American Rescue Plan: 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Treasury</span>

-   The Treasury Department is in the process of delivering $1,400
    Economic Impact Payments (EIP) to approximately 85% of American
    households, including those who may be behind on rent or at threat
    of eviction. More than 100 million EIPs have already been delivered.
-   The Treasury Department continues to administer the Emergency Rental
    Assistance Program (ERAP) to assist households that are unable to
    pay rent and utilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to the
    passage of the ARP, an additional $21.5 billion is available, almost
    doubling in size the scale and reach of this program and providing
    greater relief to our most vulnerable households.
-   Rental assistance is being distributed by the Treasury Department to
    state and local grantees. Renters and landlords seeking access to
    rental assistance should apply directly to the local program in
    their area. More information on the Emergency Rental Assistance
    Program, including eligibility requirements, can be [found
    here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares/emergency-rental-assistance-program).
-   The Treasury Department recently [updated
    guidance](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ERA-Frequently-Asked-Questions_Pub-3-16-21.pdf) on
    the ERAP, providing grantees greater flexibility in determining
    renter eligibility.
-   The Treasury Department is administering funding to cover costs
    borne by state and local governments that have stepped in during the
    crisis to provide housing assistance and relief to Americans across
    the country. These critical measures taken to blunt the impacts of
    the economic fallout from the pandemic will no longer be a strain on
    the balance sheets of American municipalities.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">HUD</span>

-   HUD will reach out to HUD grantees, including tens of thousands of
    local governments and housing providers, and other program
    participants to communicate about the eviction moratorium extension
    and will offer guidance and support where needed.
-   HUD will continue to coordinate across federal agencies to
    efficiently implement emergency rental assistance programs that
    prevent evictions and ensure financial stability of renters and
    rental properties (including programs from HUD, Treasury, and HHS’s
    Administration for Children and Families).  
-   HUD will continue to support CDC in developing strategies for
    monitoring and evaluating the impacts of the eviction moratorium.
-   HUD will continue its responsibilities in upholding the Fair Housing
    Act and will monitor and address circumstances where landlords are
    evicting tenants because of race, color, religion, sex (including
    sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, familial
    status, or national origin. If tenants feel like they have
    experienced discriminatory treatment, they can contact HUD’s Office
    of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice)
    or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Tenants can also file discrimination
    complaints online at hud.gov/fairhousing.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">USDA </span>

-   USDA will send a notice to 7,000 property owners in its multifamily
    portfolio to inform them of their obligations under the extended CDC
    Eviction Moratorium. USDA will also require property owners to post
    the extension at their properties along with a template of the
    original moratorium letters. These actions follow USDA’s outreach to
    400,000 tenants to share information on the protections provided
    under the CDC Eviction Moratorium as well as information on how to
    access the U.S Treasury’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program
    (ERAP).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">CFPB</span>

-   Tenants can learn about their eviction and debt collection rights
    and how to get help with housing costs at
    www.consumerfinance.gov/renters.
-   The CFPB is taking complaints from tenants about problems with debt
    collectors, including attorneys seeking to evict tenants in
    violation of the CDC eviction moratorium. Consumers can submit a
    complaint
    at [www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) or
    by calling (855) 411-2372
-   The CFPB will monitor and investigate eviction practices to ensure
    that companies are complying with the law. Evicting tenants in
    violation of the CDC, state, or local moratoria, or threatening to
    evict them without apprising them of their legal rights under such
    moratoria, may violate the law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">FTC</span>

-   The FTC will be monitoring and investigating eviction practices to
    ensure that companies are complying with the law. Evicting tenants
    in violation of the CDC, state, or local moratoria, or threatening
    to evict them without apprising them of their legal rights under
    such moratoria, may violate the law.
