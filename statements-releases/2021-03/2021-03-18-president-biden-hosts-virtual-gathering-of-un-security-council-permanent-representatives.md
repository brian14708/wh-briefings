Today, President Joe Biden hosted Permanent Representatives from the UN
Security Council, where he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to
values-based global leadership and re-engagement with international
institutions, in particular the United Nations. The President reiterated
the importance of working with global partners and through multilateral
institutions to end the pandemic, improve global health security, and
ensure that our nations drive an equitable and sustainable economic
recovery. President Biden also announced to the gathering that the
United States intends to formally join the United Nation’s Group of
Friends on Climate and Security.

Thanking U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda
Thomas-Greenfield for her stewardship as the United States holds the
Presidency of the Council this month, the President also noted the need
for the UNSC action on a range of regional crises, including those in
Burma, Ethiopia, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.

President Biden was also joined by Special Presidential Envoy on Climate
John Kerry and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, who
briefed the group on U.S. priorities regarding climate change and
regional security issues, respectively.
