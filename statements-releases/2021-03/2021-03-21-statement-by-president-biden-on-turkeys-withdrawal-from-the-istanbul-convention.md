title: "Statement by President Biden on Turkey\u2019s Withdrawal from the Istanbul\
  \ Convention"
---
 
Turkey’s sudden and unwarranted withdrawal from the Council of Europe
Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and
Domestic Violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention, is deeply
disappointing. Around the world, we are seeing increases in the number
of domestic violence incidents, including reports of rising femicide in
Turkey, the first nation to sign the convention. Countries should be
working to strengthen and renew their commitments to ending violence
against women, not rejecting international treaties designed to protect
women and hold abusers accountable. This is a disheartening step
backward for the international movement to end violence against women
globally.

Gender-based violence is a scourge that touches every nation in every
corner of the world. In the past few weeks, we’ve seen too many examples
of horrific and brutal assaults on women, including the tragic murders
in Georgia. And we’ve seen the broader damage that living under the
daily specter of gender-based violence does to women everywhere. It
hurts all of us, and we all must do more to create societies where women
are able to go about their lives free from violence.
