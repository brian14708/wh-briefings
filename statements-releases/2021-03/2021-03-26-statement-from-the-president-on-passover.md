Jill and I send our best wishes to everyone celebrating Passover in the
United States, the State of Israel, and around the world.

At its heart, the Passover story is one of overcoming adversity and
finding hope, of summoning the resilience and resolve to emerge from a
long dark night to a brighter morning.

It’s a story of recognition that our own rights are bound up with the
rights of our neighbors, and that none of us is free until all of us are
free.

It’s a story of faith, a reminder that even in the face of oppression,
there is reason for hope.

Though this celebration is Jewish, its message is universal. This year,
it resonates anew for a generation that has seen a terrible virus leave
empty chairs at too many of our nation’s tables, one that knows the
oppression and injustice of our world all too well.

This year, we need the Passover story and the hope it provides more than
ever.   

As we close our Seders with the familiar refrain, “Next year in
Jerusalem,” we will now offer an additional prayer: Next year in person.
Next year, together.
