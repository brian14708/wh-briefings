title: Statement by President Biden on the International Day for the Elimination of
  Racial Discrimination
---
 
One of the core values and beliefs that should bring us together as
Americans is standing against hate and racism, even as we acknowledge
that systemic racism and white supremacy are ugly poisons that have long
plagued the United States. We must change the laws that enable
discrimination in our country, and we must change our hearts.

Racism, xenophobia, nativism, and other forms of intolerance are not
problems unique to the United States. They are global problems. They are
human problems that we all need to recognize, name, and dismantle.
Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination, all nations and people should recommit to the
fundamental truth that every human being has inherent dignity and
deserves to be treated with fairness. We must recognize the ways that
racism, gender discrimination, and other forms of marginalization
intersect with and compound one another. And, we must all strive to
eliminate inequities in our policies, remove barriers to full
participation in our societies, and push for open and inclusive
processes that respect all people everywhere.

Under my Administration, the United States will lead the conversation on
these painful issues—at home, in international institutions, and around
the world. That is why, on my first day in office, I signed an Order
establishing a whole of government approach to equity and racial
justice. We will not shy away from engaging in the hard work to take on
the damaging legacy of slavery and our treatment of Native Americans, or
from doing the daily work of addressing systemic racism and violence
against Black, Native, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and
other communities of color. Neither will we fail to speak out against
the horrific mistreatment of the Rohingya in Burma, the Uyghurs in
China, or any racial discrimination we see in the world.

Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It should have no safe harbor
anywhere in the world. We must join together to make it stop.
