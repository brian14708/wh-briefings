title: "Readout of President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary Buttigieg\u2019\
  s Meeting with House Members on Infrastructure"
---
 
Today, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary of
Transportation Pete Buttigieg met in the Oval Office with a bipartisan
group of Members of Congress from the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee to discuss the critical need to invest in
modern and sustainable American infrastructure, including strengthening
and enhancing American roads, bridges, waterways, schools, housing, and
more. The discussion follows a bipartisan meeting the Administration
held with Senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee last
month and it is part of ongoing engagements on infrastructure with
Members of Congress and stakeholders.  
  
The President, Vice President, Secretary, and Members of Congress
discussed their shared commitment to working across the aisle to build
modern and sustainable infrastructure in rural, suburban, and urban
areas across the country that create good-paying, union jobs and support
the economic recovery. They also shared their commitment for ensuring
new and existing infrastructure is modernized to withstand the impacts
of climate change while creating jobs with the choice to join a union
and leading the world in a clean energy revolution. Additionally, they
emphasized the Administration’s commitment to creating skilled-trades
jobs across construction, manufacturing, and engineering sectors,
fulfilling our obligation to working communities too often left behind,
and positioning America to compete and win the 21<sup>st</sup>
century.  
  
The Administration leaders were grateful to hold a constructive
conversation about delivering infrastructure and jobs for American
communities and to exchange ideas that further inform President Biden’s
economic recovery plans to build back better for working families.
