title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of\_\
  2021"

Farmworkers are vital to the wellbeing of our country and our economy.
For generations, America’s farmworkers – many of whom are undocumented –
have worked countless hours to feed our nation and ensure our
communities are healthy and strong. This has been even more clear and
crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic, as farmworkers have put their
lives and the lives of their loved ones on the line to ensure
that families across the country have food on the table.

This is why I support the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021 and
celebrate its passage. The Act will deliver the lawful status and better
working conditions that this critical workforce deserves, as well as
much needed stability for farmers, growers, and the entire agriculture
industry.

My Administration is ready to work with leaders on both sides of the
aisle to address the needs of our essential workers, bring greater
dignity and security to our agricultural sector, and finally enact the
long-term solutions we need to create a safe, orderly, and humane
immigration system, in addition to tackling the root causes of migration
to the United States.
