**<u>Statement by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki:</u>**  
  
Last week the National Security Council (NSC) established a Unified
Coordination Group (UCG), a task force composed of representatives from
the FBI, CISA, and ODNI, with support from the NSA, to drive a
whole-of-government response to the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.
On Monday, the NSC convened a UCG leadership meeting, which included
private sector members for the first time, coordinating our respective
response efforts. We invited the private sector partners based on their
specific insights to this incident, an approach the NSC will take going
forward as appropriate. The UCG discussed the remaining number of
unpatched systems, malicious exploitation, and ways to partner together
on incident response, including the methodology partners could use for
tracking the incident, going forward.   
  
The cost of cyber incident response weighs particularly heavily on small
businesses. Hence, we requested that Microsoft help small businesses
with a simple solution to this incident. In response, Microsoft has
released a one-click mitigation tool. We encourage every business or
organization that has not yet fully patched and scanned their Exchange
Server to download and run this free tool.   
  
**<u>Statement by Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber & Emerging
Technology Anne Neuberger:</u>**  
  
This Administration is committed to working with the private sector to
build back better – including to modernize our cyber defenses and
enhance the nation’s ability to respond rapidly to significant
cybersecurity incidents.
