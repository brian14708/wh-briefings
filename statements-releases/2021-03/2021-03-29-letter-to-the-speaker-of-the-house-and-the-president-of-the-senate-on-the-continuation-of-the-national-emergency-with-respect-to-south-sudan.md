  \ Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to South\_Sudan"

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664 of
April 3, 2014, with respect to South Sudan is to continue in effect
beyond April 3, 2021.

The situation in and in relation to South Sudan, which has been marked
by activities that threaten the peace, security, or stability of South
Sudan and the surrounding region, including widespread violence and
atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers,
attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations,
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13664 with respect to South Sudan.

Sincerely,

  
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
