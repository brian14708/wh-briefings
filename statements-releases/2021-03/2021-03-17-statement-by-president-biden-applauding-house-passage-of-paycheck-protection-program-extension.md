  \ Program\_Extension"

Small businesses are the engines of our economy, the glue of our
communities, and account for half of private sector employment. But
since the start of this pandemic, more than 400,000 small businesses
have permanently closed and millions more are hanging by a thread.

Vice President Harris and I are committed to getting small businesses
the help they need to survive, recover, and grow. The Biden-Harris
Administration has distributed more than $180 billion in Paycheck
Protection Program funding to nearly 3 million small businesses. In
partnership with Congress, our administration has been distributing
funds more equitably, with a focus on the smallest “mom and pop”
businesses and those in underserved areas.

Compared to past rounds of the Program, we are distributing a higher
percentage of loans to the smallest businesses, to rural businesses, and
to businesses in low- and moderate-income communities. And since our
Administration changed the rules to provide more generous relief to sole
proprietors, there’s been a big increase in the number of loan approvals
for that key group, who are disproportionately likely to be women and
minorities.

We know there is more to do to support our nation’s small businesses,
and we are eager to continue to partner with Congress to build on this
success. We want to ensure that every “mom and pop” small business in
America has the resources it needs to rehire and retain workers,
purchase the health and sanitation equipment they need to keep workers
safe, and pursue opportunities to expand.

That is why my Administration strongly supports extension of the
Paycheck Protection Program, and is eager to work with the Senate to
ensure this extension is passed well in advance of the March
31<sup>st</sup> expiration of the Program.
