The President supports the compromise agreement, and is grateful to all
the Senators who worked so hard to reach this outcome. It extends
supplemental unemployment benefit into September, and helps the vast
majority of unemployment insurance recipients avoid unanticipated tax
bills. Most importantly, this agreement allows us to move forward on the
urgently needed American Rescue Plan, with $1400 relief checks, funding
we need to finish the vaccine rollout, open our schools, help those
suffering from the pandemic, and more.
