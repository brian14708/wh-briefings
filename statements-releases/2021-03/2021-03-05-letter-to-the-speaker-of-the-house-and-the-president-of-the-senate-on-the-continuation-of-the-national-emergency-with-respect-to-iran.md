title: Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on the Continuation
  of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was
declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect beyond March 15,
2021.

The actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.

For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 with respect to
Iran and to maintain in force comprehensive sanctions against Iran to
respond to this threat.

                             Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
