title: "Statement by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the Virtual Bilateral\
  \ Meeting between President Joe Biden and Miche\xE1l Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland"
---
 
On Wednesday, March 17, President Joe Biden will host Micheál Martin,
Taoiseach of Ireland, for a virtual bilateral meeting. They will
reaffirm the deep, historic partnership and extraordinary
people-to-people ties between the United States and Ireland. They will
also discuss combatting COVID-19, addressing global challenges,
increasing our shared prosperity, and supporting political and economic
stability in Northern Ireland.  Although the pandemic prevents the
traditional White House celebration of St. Patrick’s Day this year, we
look forward to marking this holiday and our close relationship with
Ireland in a safe way.
