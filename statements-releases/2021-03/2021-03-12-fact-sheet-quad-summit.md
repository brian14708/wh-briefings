**The Quad Vaccine Partnership**  
While ensuring that vaccines have been made available to our people,
“Quad” partners will launch a landmark partnership to further accelerate
the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, Quad leaders are taking
shared action necessary to expand safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine
manufacturing in 2021, and will work together to strengthen and assist
countries in the Indo-Pacific with vaccination, in close coordination
with the existing relevant multilateral mechanisms including WHO and
COVAX.

-   Drawing on each of our strengths, we will tackle this complex issue
    with multi-sectoral cooperation across many stages of action,
    starting with ensuring global availability of safe and effective
    vaccines.
-   Quad partners are working collaboratively to achieve expanded
    manufacturing of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines at facilities
    in India, prioritizing increased capacity for vaccines authorized by
    Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRA). Quad partners will address
    financing and logistical demands for production, procurement, and
    delivery of safe and effective vaccines. Quad partners will work to
    use our shared tools and expertise, through mechanisms at
    institutions including the United States Development Finance
    Corporation (DFC), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
    and, as appropriate, Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC),
    as well as others.
    -   The United States, through the DFC, will work with Biological E
        Ltd., to finance increased capacity to support Biological E’s
        effort to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19
        vaccines by the end of 2022 with Stringent Regulatory
        Authorization (SRA) and/or World Health Organization (WHO)
        Emergency Use Listing (EUL), including the Johnson &
        Johnson vaccine.
    -   Japan, through JICA, is in discussions to provide concessional
        yen loans for the Government of India to expand manufacturing
        for COVID-19 vaccines for export, with a priority on producing
        vaccines that have received authorization from WHO Emergency Use
        Listing (EUL) or Stringent Regulatory Authorities.
    -   Quad partners will ensure expanded manufacturing will be
        exported for global benefit, to be procured through key
        multilateral initiatives, such as COVAX, that
        provide life-saving vaccines for low-income countries, and by
        countries in need.
    -   Quad partners will also cooperate to strengthen “last-mile”
        vaccination, building on existing health-security and
        development programs, and across our governments to coordinate
        and strengthen our programs in the Indo-Pacific.
        -   This includes supporting countries with vaccine readiness
            and delivery, vaccine procurement, health workforce
            preparedness, responses to vaccine misinformation, community
            engagement, immunization capacity, and more.
        -   Australia will contribute US$77 million for the provision of
            vaccines and “last-mile” delivery support with a focus on
            Southeast Asia, in addition to its existing commitment of
            US$407 million for regional vaccine access and health
            security which will provide full vaccine coverage to nine
            Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste, and support
            procurement, prepare for vaccine delivery, and strengthen
            health systems in Southeast Asia.
        -   Japan will assist vaccination programs of developing
            countries such as the purchase of vaccines and cold-chain
            support including through provision of grant aid of $41
            million and new concessional yen loans, ensuring alignment
            with and support of COVAX.
        -   The United States will leverage existing programs to further
            boost vaccination capability, drawing on at least $100
            million in regional efforts focused on immunization.
-   Our commitment will be implemented by the launch of
    a senior-level** Quad Vaccine Experts Group**, comprised
    of top scientists and officials from our governments. This group
    will support Quad cooperation in the long term, and use science and
    evidence to:    
    -   design an implementation plan for the Quad COVID-19 vaccine
        effort;   
    -   identify hurdles impeding vaccine administration in the
        region;   
    -   work with financers and production facilities to monitor timely
        and sufficient capacity expansion that will lead to wider
        distribution of safe and effective vaccines;   
    -   share governmental plans to support Indo-Pacific health
        security and COVID-19 response, and identify practical
        cooperation on “last-mile” delivery for hard-to-reach communities
        in need;   
    -   strengthen and support the life-saving work of international
        organizations, including the WHO, COVAX, Gavi, CEPI, UNICEF, the
        G7, ASEAN, and governments, and call on other countries to do
        the same;   
    -   make additional concrete recommendations before the end of the
        year.   

**The Quad Climate Working Group**  
We have identified the climate challenge as a priority for the Quad and
the Indo-Pacific region. We will establish a new Quad Climate Working
Group focused on:

-   Cooperation, both among ourselves and with other countries, to
    strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement, including to keep
    a Paris-aligned temperature limit within reach;
-   Working together and with other countries to support, strengthen,
    and enhance actions globally;
-   Committing to advancing low-emissions technology solutions to
    support emissions reduction; 
-   Cooperation on climate mitigation, adaptation, resilience,
    technology, capacity-building, and climate finance.

**The Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group**  
Quad leaders recognize that a free, open, inclusive, and resilient
Indo-Pacific requires that critical and emerging technology is governed
and operates according to shared interests and values. In that spirit,
we will convene a Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group, which
will:

-   Develop a statement of principles on technology design, development,
    and use;
-   Facilitate coordination on technology standards development,
    including between our national technology standards bodies and
    working with a broad range of partners;
-   Encourage cooperation on telecommunications deployment,
    diversification of equipment suppliers, and future
    telecommunications, including through close cooperation with our
    private sectors and industry;
-   Facilitate cooperation to monitor trends and opportunities related
    to developments in critical and emerging technology, including
    biotechnology;
-   Convene dialogues on critical technology supply chains.
