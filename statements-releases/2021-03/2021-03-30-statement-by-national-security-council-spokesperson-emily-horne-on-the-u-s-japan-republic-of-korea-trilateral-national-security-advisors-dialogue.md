On Friday, April 2, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will welcome
National Security Secretariat Secretary General Shigeru Kitamura of
Japan and National Security Advisor Suh Hoon of the Republic of Korea
for a trilateral dialogue at the United States Naval Academy in
Annapolis, MD.   
   
This trilateral meeting, which follows the visits of Secretary of State
Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Japan and the
Republic of Korea, provides an opportunity for our nations to consult on
a wide range of regional issues and foreign policy priorities, including
maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, addressing the
COVID-19 pandemic, and combating climate change.  
   
This meeting with Japan and the Republic of Korea is the first National
Security Advisor-level multilateral dialogue of the Biden
Administration, reflecting the importance we place on broadening and
deepening our cooperation on key issues and advancing our shared
prosperity across a free and open Indo-Pacific.
