*Interior, Energy, Commerce, and Transportation Departments Announce New
Leasing, Funding, and Development Goals to Accelerate and Deploy
Offshore Wind Energy and Jobs*

  
Today, the White House convened leaders from across the Administration
to announce a set of bold actions that will catalyze offshore wind
energy, strengthen the domestic supply chain, and create good-paying,
union jobs.

National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland,
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo,
and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met today with state
officials, industry executives, and labor leaders to announce new
leasing, funding, and goals that employ President Biden’s
whole-of-government approach, position America to lead a clean energy
revolution, and create thousands of jobs across the country with the
choice to join a union.

In his first week in office, President Biden issued an Executive Order
that calls on our nation to build a new American infrastructure and
clean energy economy that will create millions of new jobs. In
particular, the President’s Order committed to expand opportunities for
the offshore wind industry. The President recognizes that a thriving
offshore wind industry will drive new jobs and economic opportunity up
and down the Atlantic Coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in Pacific
waters. The industry will also spawn new supply chains that stretch into
America’s heartland, as illustrated by the 10,000 tons of domestic steel
that workers in Alabama and West Virginia are supplying to a Texas
shipyard where Dominion Energy is building the Nation’s first Jones Act
compliant wind turbine installation vessel.

Federal leadership, in close coordination with states and in partnership
with the private sector, unions and other key stakeholders, is needed to
catalyze the deployment of offshore wind at scale.

Today, the Administration is taking coordinated steps to support rapid
offshore wind deployment and job creation:

1.  Advance ambitious wind energy projects to create good-paying, union
    jobs
2.  Investing in American infrastructure to strengthen the domestic
    supply chain and deploy offshore wind energy
3.  Supporting critical research and development and data-sharing.

**<u>Advance Ambitious Wind Energy Projects to Create Good-Paying, Union
Jobs</u>**

-   **Announcing a New Wind Energy Area. **The Interior Department’s
    Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is announcing a new
    priority Wind Energy Area in the New York Bight—an area of shallow
    waters between Long Island and the New Jersey coast—which a recent
    study from Wood Mackenzie shows can support up to 25,000 development
    and construction jobs from 2022 to 2030, as well as an additional
    7,000 jobs in communities supported by this development. The study
    indicates the New York Bight lease area also has the potential to
    support up to 4,000 operations and maintenance jobs annually, and
    approximately 2,000 community jobs, in the years following. This new
    Wind Energy Area is adjacent to the greater metropolitan Tri-State
    area— the largest metropolitan population center in the United
    States that is home to more than 20 million people and their energy
    needs. The next step is for BOEM to publish a Proposed Sale Notice,
    followed by a formal public comment period and a lease sale in late
    2021 or early 2022.
-   **Establishing a Target of Employing Tens of Thousands of Workers to
    Deploy 30 Gigawatts (30,000 megawatts) of Offshore Wind by
    2030. **The Departments of Interior (DOI), Energy (DOE), and
    Commerce (DOC) are announcing a shared goal to deploy 30 gigawatts
    (GW) of offshore wind in the United States by 2030, while protecting
    biodiversity and promoting ocean co-use. Meeting this target will
    trigger more than $12 billion per year in capital investment in
    projects on both U.S. coasts, create tens of thousands of
    good-paying, union jobs, with more than 44,000 workers employed in
    offshore wind by 2030 and nearly 33,000 additional jobs in
    communities supported by offshore wind activity. It will also
    generate enough power to meet the demand of more than 10 million
    American homes for a year, and avoid 78 million metric tons of CO2
    emissions.
    -   <span style="text-decoration: underline">DOI action to unlock
        deployment potential:</span> To position the domestic offshore
        wind industry to meet the 2030 target, DOI’s Bureau of Ocean
        Energy Management (BOEM) plans to advance new lease sales and
        complete review of at least 16 Construction and Operations Plans
        (COPs) by 2025, representing more than 19 GW of new clean energy
        for our nation.
    -   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Massive supply chain
        benefits of deploying offshore wind energy at
        scale:</span> Meeting the 2030 target will catalyze significant
        supply chain benefits, including new port upgrade investments
        totaling more than $500 million; one to two new U.S. factories
        for each major windfarm component including wind turbine
        nacelles, blades, towers, foundations, and subsea cables;
        additional cumulative demand of more than 7 million tons of
        steel—equivalent to 4 years of output for a typical U.S. steel
        mill; and the construction of 4 to 6 specialized turbine
        installation vessels in U.S. shipyards, each representing an
        investment between $250 and $500 million.
    -   <span style="text-decoration: underline">2050 implications of
        meeting the 2030 goal: </span>Achieving this target also will
        unlock a pathway to 110 GW by 2050, generating 77,000 offshore
        wind jobs and more than 57,000 additional jobs in communities
        supported by offshore wind activity – all while creating further
        economic opportunity and ensuring future generations have access
        to clean air and abundant renewable power.
-   **Advancing critical permitting milestones for the Ocean Wind
    Offshore Wind Project. **BOEM is announcing a Notice of Intent (NOI)
    to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Ocean Wind,
    putting it in line to become America’s third commercial scale
    offshore wind project. Ocean Wind has proposed an offshore wind
    project with a total capacity of 1,100 megawatts (MW) — enough to
    power 500,000 homes across New Jersey. BOEM previously announced
    environmental reviews for Vineyard Wind (MA) and South Fork (RI),
    and anticipates initiating the environmental reviews for up to ten
    additional projects later this year.

**Investing in American Infrastructure to Strengthen the Domestic Supply
Chain and Deploy Offshore Wind Energy**

-   **Investing in Port Infrastructure to Support Offshore Wind. **The
    U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Maritime Administration
    today is announcing a Notice of Funding Opportunity for port
    authorities and other applicants to apply for $230 million for port
    and intermodal infrastructure-related projects through the Port
    Infrastructure Development Program. Port Infrastructure Development
    Grants support projects that strengthen and modernize port
    infrastructure, and can support shore-side wind energy projects,
    such as storage areas, laydown areas, and docking of wind energy
    vessels to load and move items to offshore wind farms. In addition
    to supporting our nation’s long-term economic vitality, DOT’s review
    process will consider how proposed projects can most effectively
    address climate change and environmental justice imperatives.
-   **Access to $3 billion in Debt Capital to Support Offshore Wind
    Industry through DOE Loan Programs Office.** DOE’s Loan Programs
    Office (LPO) released a fact sheet to facilitate access for the
    offshore wind industry for $3 billion in funding through LPO’s Title
    XVII Innovative Energy Loan Guarantee Program. The fact sheet
    signals that LPO is open for business and ready to partner with
    offshore wind and offshore transmission developers, suppliers, and
    other financing partners to scale the U.S. offshore industry and
    support well-paying jobs. To date, LPO has provided $1.6 billion in
    support of projects totaling about 1,000 MW of onshore wind.

**<u>Supporting Critical Research and Development and Data-Sharing</u>**

-   **Announcing offshore wind R&D funding through the National Offshore
    Wind R&D Consortium. **The National Offshore Wind Research and
    Development Consortium (NOWRDC), created by the DOE and the New York
    State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), is
    announcing the award of $8 million to 15 offshore wind research and
    development projects that were selected through a competitive
    process. The new projects will focus on offshore support structure
    innovation, supply chain development, electrical systems innovation,
    and mitigation of use conflicts that will help reduce barriers and
    costs for offshore wind deployment. The NOWRDC was established in
    2018 with a $20.5 million DOE investment, matching funds from
    NYSERDA, and with follow-on contributions from state agencies in
    Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Maine—all resulting in a
    total investment of around $47 million.
-   **Partnering with Industry on Data-Sharing. **The Department of
    Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is
    signing a Memorandum of Agreement with Ørsted, an offshore wind
    development company, to share physical and biological data
    in Ørsted-leased waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction. This agreement
    is the first of its kind between an offshore wind developer and
    NOAA, and paves the way for future data-sharing agreements that NOAA
    expects to enter into with other developers. NOAA anticipates
    that Ørsted’s and other companies’ data will fill gaps in ocean
    science areas—particularly in ocean mapping and observing—in service
    of NOAA’s mission to advance climate adaptation and mitigation,
    weather-readiness, healthy oceans, and resilient coastal communities
    and economies. 
-   **Studying Offshore Wind Impacts. **NOAA’s Northeast Sea Grant
    programs, in partnership with DOE, DOC, and NOAA’s Northeast
    Fisheries Science Center, is releasing a request for research
    proposals to support more than $1 million in grant funding to
    improve understanding of offshore renewable energy for the benefit
    of a diversity of stakeholders, including fishing and coastal
    communities. Grant funding will support objective community-based
    research in the Northeast to further understanding of the effects of
    offshore renewable energy on the ocean and local communities and
    economies as well as opportunities to optimize ocean co-use.

At today’s convening, leaders from across the Administration shared
their commitment to work closely with one another and with key
stakeholders to deliver the economic potential presented by offshore
wind energy resources.

-   **National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy:** “President Biden has
    declared very clearly that when he thinks of climate, he thinks of
    people and jobs—good-paying, union jobs. That’s because President
    Biden believes we have an enormous opportunity in front of us to not
    only address the threats of climate change, but use it as a chance
    to create millions of good-paying, union jobs that will fuel
    America’s economic recovery, rebuild the middle class, and make sure
    we bounce back from the crises we face. Nowhere is the scale of that
    opportunity clearer than for offshore wind. This commitment to a
    new, untapped industry will create pathways to the middle class for
    people from all backgrounds and communities.”
-   **Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland: **“For generations, we’ve put
    off the transition to clean energy and now we’re facing a climate
    crisis. It’s a crisis that doesn’t discriminate – every community is
    facing more extreme weather and the costs associated with that. But
    not every community has the resources to rebuild, or even get up and
    relocate when a climate event happens in their backyards. The
    climate crisis disproportionately impacts communities of color and
    low-income families. As our country faces the interlocking
    challenges of a global pandemic, economic downturn, racial
    injustice, and the climate crisis – we have to transition to
    a brighter future for everyone.”
-   **Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm:** “This offshore wind goal
    is proof of our commitment to using American ingenuity and might to
    invest in our nation, advance our own energy security, and combat
    the climate crisis,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm.
    “DOE is going to marshal every resource we have to get as many
    American companies, using as many sheets of American steel,
    employing as many American workers as possible in offshore wind
    energy—driving economic growth from coast to coast.”
-   **Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo:** “The Commerce Department is
    committed to innovative partnerships that advance the best science
    and data to ensure the development of offshore wind is transparent
    and inclusive of all stakeholders,” said Secretary Raimondo. “We
    look forward to engaging the public and private sectors to invest in
    clean energy solutions, like offshore wind, that will contribute to
    our whole-of-government approach to combat the climate crisis and
    create high-paying, high-skilled American jobs.”
-   **Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg:** “Tackling the
    climate crisis is vital to our nation’s future,” said U.S. Secretary
    of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. “The Biden-Harris Administration
    is taking actions that show how creating jobs and addressing climate
    change can and must go hand in hand. Today’s announcement makes a
    critical investment in our nation’s ports, which in turn builds up
    the resilience and sustainability of America’s economy.”
