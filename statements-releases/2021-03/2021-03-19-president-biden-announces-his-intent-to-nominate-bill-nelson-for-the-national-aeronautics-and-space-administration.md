WASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate
Bill Nelson to serve as National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) Administrator.

**Bill Nelson, Nominee for National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) Administrator**

Senator Bill Nelson, former U. S. Senator, is a fifth generation
Floridian whose family came to Florida in 1829.  He has served in public
office over four decades, first in the state legislature and U. S.
Congress, then as State Treasurer.  He was elected three times to the
United States Senate, representing the third largest state for 18
years.  His committees included the breadth of government policy from
defense, intelligence and foreign policy to finance, commerce and health
care.

Nelson chaired the Space Subcommittee in the U.S. House of
Representatives for 6 years and in the Senate was the Chairman or
Ranking Member of the Senate Space and Science Subcommittee and Ranking
Member of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.  Most
every piece of space and science law has had his imprint, including
passing the landmark NASA bill of 2010 along with Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchinson.  That law set NASA on its present dual course of both
government and commercial missions. In 1986 he flew on the 24th flight
of the Space Shuttle. The mission on Columbia, orbited the earth 98
times during six days.  Nelson conducted 12 medical experiments
including the first American stress test in space and a cancer research
experiment sponsored by university researchers.  In the Senate he was
known as the go-to senator for our nation’s space program.  He now
serves on the NASA Advisory Council.
