title: President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Amends Territory of Guam Disaster Declaration
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. made additional disaster
assistance available to the territory of Guam by authorizing an increase
in the level of federal funding for the Other Needs Assistance – Lost
Wages Assistance (ONA-LWA) program that was authorized as a result of
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic beginning on January
20, 2020, and continuing.

Under the major disaster declaration issued for the territory of Guam on
March 27, 2020 and a subsequent amendment, federal funding was made
available for ONA-LWA at 75 percent federal funding of the total
eligible costs.

Under the President’s order today, the non-federal cost share for
ONA-LWA has been waived.
