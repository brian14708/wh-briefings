  17"

Today, an historic number of women in Congress in a bipartisan
vote—under the leadership of our historic Speaker — expressed their
support for a principle in which I also deeply believe: that in the
United States of America, no one’s rights should be denied on account of
their sex.

When Congress first sent the Equal Rights Amendment to the states for
ratification, I was a 29-year-old first-time Senate candidate. As a
young Senator, as now, it was a simple proposition for me — fighting for
the ERA was about fighting for the dignity of women, and for the dignity
of our nation. Nearly 50 years later, it is long past time that we
enshrine the principle of gender equality in our Constitution.

Gender equality is not only a moral issue. The full participation of
women and girls across all aspects of our society is essential to our
economic prosperity, our security, and the health of our democracy. This
is especially critical right now, as the collision of a public health
crisis, economic crisis, and caregiving crisis has erased decades of
women’s economic gains and pushed more women out of the American
workforce than we’ve seen in more than 30 years.

Now is the time for us to recommit ourselves to tearing down the
systemic barriers that continue to fuel gender disparities and limit
opportunity for half of the American people.
