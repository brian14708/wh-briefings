Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice convened the first Principals
Committee Meeting on Advancing Equity as outlined by President Biden’s
January 20th Executive Order on advancing equity and support for
underserved communities. The Committee is chaired by the Domestic Policy
Advisor and includes Cabinet-level leaders from all federal agencies and
senior White House officials tasked with enacting a comprehensive
approach to advancing equity for all throughout our federal policies and
institutions.

During the virtual meeting, Cabinet leaders and senior Administration
officials – including the Secretaries of Transportation, Agriculture,
and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration – shared
their work to date to embed equity and racial justice at the highest
levels of the federal government. With the majority of the Cabinet in
place, agency leaders affirmed their commitment to ensure that the
President’s Executive Order leads to historic and ambitious work to
advance equity that matches the urgency of this moment. Agency
leadership and senior White House officials also discussed OMB guidance
to agencies on coordinating implementation of the Order.
