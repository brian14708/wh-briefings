Women’s history is American history — and world history. On
International Women’s Day, we celebrate the achievements, contributions,
and progress of women and girls in the United States and around the
globe.  
   
My Administration is committed to honoring women by investing in their
opportunity, security, and wellbeing. I was proud to issue an Executive
Order today establishing the White House Gender Policy Council, to
ensure that every domestic and foreign policy we pursue rests on a
foundation of dignity and equity for women. My Administration is also
committed to ensuring that women are represented equally at all levels
of the federal government. That starts with Vice President Harris, who
broke through a barrier that stood for more than two centuries. And it
includes a record number of diverse women whom I’ve nominated to serve
in Cabinet-level roles and appointed to senior-level positions.  
   
In our nation, as in all nations, women have fought for justice,
shattered barriers, built and sustained economies, carried communities
through times of crisis, and served with dignity and resolve. Too often,
they have done so while being denied the freedom, full participation,
and equal opportunity all women are due. Their contributions have been
downplayed. Their stories have been neglected. That is why International
Women’s Day is also a time for us to recommit ourselves to the cause of
equity and equality for women the world over, and to shine a light on
the systemic obstacles that fuel gender disparities and undermine
women’s potential.  
   
Despite persistent obstacles, women are leading every day. Over the past
year, women have played a critical, often outsized role in responding to
the global coronavirus pandemic. They are our vaccine researchers and
public health officials. They are our doctors and nurses. They are our
essential workers — so many of whom are women of color — in fire
stations and nursing homes, on farms and in grocery stores, in schools
and in shelters.  
   
Around the world, we are seeing decades of women’s economic gains erased
by this pandemic. It’s forcing millions more girls out of school, which
could impact economic growth for decades to come. Incidents of violence
against women in their homes and communities have spiked. And, as is so
often the case, COVID-19 is hitting the poorest and most marginalized
women the hardest. These global trends damage all of us, because we know
that governments, economies, and communities are stronger when they
include the full participation of women — no country can recover from
this pandemic if it leaves half of its population behind.  
   
Elevating the status of women and girls globally is the right thing to
do — it is a matter of justice, fairness, and decency, and it will lead
to a better, more secure, and more prosperous world for us all.  On
International Women’s Day, let us recommit to the principle that our
nation, and the world, is at its best when the possibilities for all of
our women and girls are limitless.
