title: Statement by President Biden on the Passage of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization
  Act of 2021 in the House of Representatives
---
 
I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the Violence Against
Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) with bipartisan support — and I urge
the Senate to follow their lead to renew and strengthen this landmark
law.  
  
Writing and passing VAWA is one of the legislative accomplishments of
which I’m most proud. VAWA has transformed the way our country responds
to violence against women. And, with each re-authorization, the Congress
has expanded VAWA’s provisions on a bipartisan basis to improve
protections, including for Native American women and survivors from
underserved communities, and improve efforts to prevent intimate partner
violence.  
  
While we have made significant progress, there is still much work to do.
As many as 1 in 3 women are subjected to domestic violence, dating
violence, sexual assault, and stalking at some point in their lives, and
the rate is even higher for women of color, Native American women, and
members of the LGBTQ community. Growing evidence shows that COVID-19 has
only exacerbated the threat of intimate partner violence, creating a
pandemic within a pandemic for countless women at risk for abuse. In
short, this is an urgent crisis.  
  
This should not be a Democratic or Republican issue — it’s about
standing up against the abuse of power and preventing violence. I am
grateful to the House of Representatives for their leadership and
dedication to ending gender-based violence. Now, I urge the Senate to
follow past precedent and bring a strong bipartisan coalition together
to ensure the passage of VAWA so that I can sign this legislation as
soon as possible.
