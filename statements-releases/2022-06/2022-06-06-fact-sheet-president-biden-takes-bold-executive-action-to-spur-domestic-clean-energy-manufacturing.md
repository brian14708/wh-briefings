title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Takes Bold Executive Action to Spur Domestic\
  \ Clean Energy\_Manufacturing"
---
 
*Historic Actions Include Authorizing Defense Production Act to Lower
Energy Costs, Strengthen Power Grid, and Create Good-Paying Jobs*

Today’s clean energy technologies are a critical part of the arsenal we
must harness to lower energy costs for families, reduce risks to our
power grid, and tackle the urgent crisis of a changing climate. From day
one, President Biden has mobilized investment in these critical
technologies. Thanks to his clean energy and climate agenda, last year
marked the largest deployment of solar, wind, and batteries in United
States history, and our nation is now a magnet for investment in clean
energy manufacturing.

Since President Biden took office, the private sector has committed over
$100 billion in new private capital to make electric vehicles and
batteries in the United States. We have made historic investments in
clean hydrogen, nuclear, and other cutting-edge technologies. And
companies are investing billions more to grow a new domestic offshore
wind industry.

We are also now on track to triple domestic solar manufacturing capacity
by 2024. The expansions to domestic solar manufacturing capacity
announced since President Biden took office will grow the current base
capacity of 7.5 gigawatts by an additional 15 gigawatts. This would
total 22.5 gigawatts by the end of his first term – enough to enable
more than 3.3 million homes to switch to clean solar energy each year.

While President Biden continues pushing Congress to pass clean energy
investments and tax cuts, he is taking bold action to rapidly build on
this progress and create a bridge to this American-made clean energy
future. Today, President Biden is taking action to:

-   Authorize use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to accelerate
    domestic production of clean energy technologies, including solar
    panel parts;
-   Put the full power of federal procurement to work spurring
    additional domestic solar manufacturing capacity by directing the
    development of master supply agreements, including “super
    preference” status; and
-   Create a 24-month bridge as domestic manufacturing rapidly scales up
    to ensure the reliable supply of components that U.S. solar
    deployers need to construct clean energy projects and an electric
    grid for the 21<sup>st</sup> century, while reinforcing the
    integrity of our trade laws and processes. 

Together, these actions will spur domestic manufacturing, construction
projects, and good-paying jobs – all while cutting energy costs for
families, strengthening our grid, and tackling climate change and
environmental injustice. With a stronger clean energy arsenal, the
United States can be an even stronger partner to our allies, especially
in the face of Putin’s war in Ukraine.

The stakes could not be higher. That is why President Biden also
continues to urge Congress to quickly pass tax cuts and additional
investments that advance U.S. clean energy manufacturing and deployment.
Failing to take these actions would deny consumers access to
cost-cutting clean energy options, add risks to our power grid, and
stall domestic clean energy construction projects that are critical to
tackling the climate crisis. At the same time, President Biden will keep
using his executive authority to take bold action to build an
American-made clean energy future.

**<u>INVOKING THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT FOR CLEAN ENERGY</u>**

Today, President Biden is authorizing the use of the Defense Production
Act (DPA) to accelerate domestic production of clean energy technologies
– unlocking new powers to meet this moment. Specifically, the President
is authorizing the Department of Energy to use the DPA to rapidly expand
American manufacturing of five critical clean energy technologies:

-   Solar panel parts like photovoltaic modules and module components;
-   Building insulation;
-   Heat pumps, which heat and cool buildings super efficiently;
-   Equipment for making and using clean electricity-generated fuels,
    including electrolyzers, fuel cells, and related platinum group
    metals; and
-   Critical power grid infrastructure like transformers.

In deploying the DPA, the Biden-Harris Administration will strongly
encourage the use of strong labor standards, including project labor
agreements and community benefits agreements that offer wages at or
above the prevailing rate and include local hire provisions. The
Administration also will strongly encourage projects with environmental
justice outcomes that empower the clean energy transition in low-income
communities historically overburdened by legacy pollution.

Following this announcement, the White House and the Department of
Energy will convene relevant industry, labor, environmental justice, and
other key stakeholders as we maximize the impact of the DPA tools made
available by President Biden’s actions and strengthen domestic clean
energy manufacturing.

**<u>BOOSTING MADE-IN-AMERICA CLEAN ENERGY WITH FEDERAL
PROCUREMENT</u>**

President Biden is also putting the full power of federal procurement to
work spurring additional domestic solar manufacturing capacity. Today,
the President directed the development of two innovative tools to
accelerate Made-in-America clean energy:

-   Master Supply Agreements for domestically manufactured solar systems
    to increase the speed and efficiency with which domestic clean
    electricity providers can sell their products to the U.S.
    Government; and
-   So-called “Super Preferences” to apply domestic content standards
    for federal procurement of solar systems, including domestically
    manufactured solar photovoltaic components, consistent with the Buy
    American Act.

These federal procurement measures can stimulate demand for up to a
gigawatt of domestically produced solar modules in the near term, and up
to 10 gigawatts over the next decade from U.S. government demand alone.
To further increase the impact of these actions, the Administration will
also partner with state and local governments and municipal utilities in
these innovative arrangements – increasing the potential market impact
over the next decade to as much as over 100 gigawatts. These procurement
actions will provide a significant demand anchor for a revitalized
domestic solar manufacturing industry.

**<u>SUPPORT FOR U.S. GRID-STRENGTHENING, CLEAN ENERGY CONSTRUCTION
PROJECTS</u>** ****

Because of private investor confidence in President Biden’s leadership
and our national commitment to a clean energy future, the United States
is now on track to triple its solar manufacturing capacity by 2024. The
expansions to domestic solar manufacturing capacity announced since the
President took office will grow the current 7.5 gigawatts of capacity by
an additional 15 gigawatts of capacity, for a total of 22.5 gigawatts by
the end of his first term – enough to enable more than 3.3 million homes
to switch to clean solar energy every year. To rapidly build on this
progress and create a bridge to this American-made clean energy future,
we need to boost short-term solar panel supply to support construction
projects in the United States right now. This is because grid operators
around the country are relying on planned solar projects to come online
to ensure there is sufficient power to meet demand, and to ensure we can
continue to deploy solar at the rates needed to keep us on track to meet
the President’s climate goals. 

Today, President Biden is using his powers to create a 24-month bridge
for certain solar imports while reinforcing the integrity of our trade
laws and processes. Specifically, the President is:

-   Temporarily facilitating U.S. solar deployers’ ability to source
    solar modules and cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and
    Vietnam by providing that those components can be imported free of
    certain duties for 24 months in order to ensure the U.S. has access
    to a sufficient supply of solar modules to meet electricity
    generation needs while domestic manufacturing scales up; and
-   Reinforcing his commitment to safeguarding the integrity and
    independence of all ongoing trade investigations by career officials
    at the Department of Commerce and recognizing the vital role these
    processes play in strengthening our economy.

**<u>ADDITIONAL STEPS TO CUT COSTS, SUPPORT GOOD-PAYING JOBS, AND
ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</u>**

Today’s actions build on this Administration’s existing initiatives to
grow domestic clean energy innovation and manufacturing and to lower
energy costs for Americans, including:

-   **Permitting More Clean Energy on Public Lands.** As part of the
    [Biden-Harris Permitting Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-permitting-action-plan-to-accelerate-and-deliver-infrastructure-projects-on-time-on-task-and-on-budget/),
    a new five-agency collaboration is [expediting reviews of clean
    energy projects on public
    lands](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/12/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-races-to-deploy-clean-energy-that-creates-jobs-and-lowers-costs/)
    through the Department of the Interior, helping us race ahead toward
    permitting at least 25 gigawatts by 2025 – enough to power around
    five million homes. These actions have already
    [increased](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-outlines-roadmap-continued-renewable-energy-progress-public-lands)
    clean energy permitting activities by 35 percent, including major
    solar [project
    approvals](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-advances-three-solar-projects-california-marking-significant)
    and
    [leases](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/bureau-land-management-utah-issues-first-competitive-solar-leases).
    We have also launched five new Renewable Energy Coordination Offices
    and reduced rents and fees by more than 50 percent for solar and
    wind projects on public lands.

-   **Boosting Community-Based Clean Energy in Cities and Rural Areas.**
    The Biden-Harris Administration is helping 17 local communities
    remove red tape with the [SolarAPP+ online
    tool](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-kicks-summer-solar-2021-tool-fast-tracks-solar-power-communities-nationwide)
    to enable same-day approvals for residential solar installation
    permits, and an additional 400 interested communities are in the
    pipeline. The National Climate Task Force launched new initiatives
    on increasing deployment of [Distributed Energy
    Resources](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-creates-cost-saving-clean-energy-opportunities-to-combat-climate-crisis/),
    including rooftop solar, with a focus on bringing the benefits of
    these projects to underserved communities. The United States
    Department of Agriculture provided the largest-ever investment in
    rural renewable energy last year. In addition, the Department of
    Energy and the Department of Health and Human Services are
    partnering to develop and pilot a digital platform that will connect
    customers who are eligible for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
    Program with community solar subscriptions, to further reduce
    customer energy costs. Likewise, the U.S. Department of Housing and
    Urban Development is working with municipalities to enable residents
    of affordable housing to directly benefit from low-cost community
    solar power without seeing a rent increase or adjustment to their
    utility allowance.

-   **Supporting a Diverse Solar Workforce with Good-Paying Jobs,
    including pathways to stable careers with the free and fair choice
    to join a union.** Solar industry jobs consistently rank among the
    top fastest-growing in the nation, and many require only a high
    school education or GED. The Economic Development Administration
    recently awarded funding to support solar employment training in
    tribal and coal-impacted communities. In addition, the Department of
    Energy has issued a Request for Information and hosted six
    workshops to determine common goals and needs from stakeholders,
    including industry, unions, and training organizations. DOE will
    continue to explore these issues, including by providing funding,
    new collaborations with industry, other federal agencies, and
    state-based job boards to develop equitable worker-centric training
    and education programs, work-based learning opportunities, and
    support services such as career counseling, mentorship, and job
    readiness programs.

-   **Developing** **Clean Energy Domestic Manufacturing for Export and
    Building Capacity in Allied Nations.** The Export-Import Bank of the
    United States (EXIM) Make More in America Initiative, approved by
    the EXIM board in April, will prioritize investments to expand clean
    energy manufacturing. The U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation supports building resilient clean energy manufacturing
    supply chains in allied nations around the world, reducing global
    dependence on China.
-   **Investing in Clean Energy for Resilience in Puerto Rico:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration joined forces with the Commonwealth of
    Puerto Rico to advance dozens of solar energy projects that will
    enable Puerto Rico to meet its target of 100% renewable electricity,
    while improving power sector resilience and increasing access to
    more affordable energy and cleaner air.
