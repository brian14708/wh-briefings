President Juan Guaidó to underscore the United States’ recognition of
and support for the 2015 democratically-elected National Assembly and
Guaidó as the Interim President of Venezuela. President Biden expressed
his support for Venezuelan-led negotiations as the best path toward a
peaceful restoration of democratic institutions, free and fair

all Venezuelans. They discussed the role the United States and other

Venezuela’s crisis. President Biden reaffirmed the United States is
willing to calibrate sanctions policy as informed by the outcomes of
negotiations that empower the Venezuelan people to determine the future
of their country.
