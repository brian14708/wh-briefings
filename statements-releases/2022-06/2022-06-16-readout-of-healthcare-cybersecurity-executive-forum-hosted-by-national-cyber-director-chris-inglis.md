Yesterday, National Cyber Director Chris Inglis hosted Deputy Secretary
of Health and Human Services Andrea Palm, senior U.S. government
cybersecurity officials, and CEOs and other senior executives
representing entities on the Health Sector Coordinating Council
Cybersecurity Working Group Executive Committee for a cyber threat
briefing and roundtable discussion about cybersecurity in the healthcare
and public health sector. Participants discussed the five-year
anniversary of the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force’s
“Report on Improving Cybersecurity in the Health Care Industry,”
including the progress that has been made since the report came out and
areas where additional focus is needed. Deputy Secretary Palm provided
an update on HHS’s work to finalize a sector incident response plan, and
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Deputy Director Nitin
Natarajan shared resources CISA has available to help manage
cybersecurity risk in critical infrastructure sectors, including
healthcare. Healthcare CEOs and senior executives relayed their
experiences protecting their systems, products, and patients; the
investments they’ve made to combat growing cyber threats; and the
challenges they’ve faced in dealing with vulnerabilities in the cyber
ecosystem. All of the participants agreed on the importance of
additional collaboration, including through exercises, to help improve
cybersecurity in the sector.
