title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Launches the Talent Pipeline\
  \ Challenge: Supporting Employer Investments in Equitable Workforce Development\
  \ for Infrastructure\_Jobs"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is kicking off a summer-long
Talent Pipeline Challenge to fill high quality jobs that will help
rebuild our infrastructure and supply chains here at home, and continue
our transition from a historic economic recovery to steady and stable
growth in the years ahead. This is a nationwide call to action for
employers, education and training providers, states, local, Tribal, and
territorial governments, and philanthropic organizations to make
tangible commitments that support equitable workforce development in
three critical infrastructure sectors: Broadband, Construction, and
“Electrification” (EV Charging Infrastructure and Battery
Manufacturing). These commitments will complement the Federal
government’s investment in workforce development and help ensure there
are trained workers who are ready to meet the demands of implementing
the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as the country transitions
from a historic economic recovery to stable and steady growth that works
for working people.

**Employers.** The Talent Pipeline Challenge will encourage employers to
partner with and hire skilled workers from at least one training
provider in each region in which the employer has operations, such as a
registered apprenticeship program or a community college with a diverse
student population. As part of this pledge, employers can partner with
national or regional intermediaries or training providers to build,
scale, or support local training models to recruit, train, or hire
workers in their sector. Training partnerships will build on pathways to
quality jobs for women, people of color, and underserved workers—
including those from rural and Tribal communities and communities with
persistent poverty. As part of this goal:

-   Employers and training providers are encouraged to include a
    community-based organization working with women and
    under-represented groups in the training partnership.
-   Employers already partnered with a registered apprenticeship program
    may consider investing in a quality pre-apprenticeship program that
    sends its graduates directly into a registered apprenticeship
    program.
-   Employers are encouraged to invest in the resources and supports
    like tuition assistance, child care, transportation costs, and
    emergency aid that are often barriers for workers to participate in
    training.

**Training Providers.** The Talent Pipeline Challenge will encourage
training providers, unions, and other intermediaries, including
labor-management skills programs, community colleges, industry
associations, philanthropic organizations, and worker centers, to commit
to:

-   Partner with employers to create or bring to scale skills training
    programs, coupled with wraparound services like transportation
    assistance and child care, that will prepare workers for in-demand
    jobs.
-   Help to recruit regional and local employers from the three
    infrastructure sectors into the Talent Pipeline Challenge—including
    through regional convenings.
-   Work with employer partners to identify, recruit, and support local
    women and workers of color so they will be employed in
    infrastructure jobs, including workers from communities with
    persistent poverty, and rural and Tribal communities.
-   Provide grant funding for employer-training-provider partnerships
    and to defer costs of advanced skills training, particularly for
    underserved workers.

**State and Local Governments.** The Talent Pipeline Challenge is
calling on state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to commit
to:

-   Use federal funding to invest in workforce development efforts in
    these critical sectors, including:
    -   American Rescue Plan (ARP) State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds
        toward job training and other assistance to workers negatively
        affected by the pandemic.

    <!-- -->

    -   Bipartisan Infrastructure Law grant funding, where possible and
        legally permissible, to support workforce development aligned to
        project labor needs.

    <!-- -->

    -   State Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Reserve
        dollars to fund place-based labor-management partnerships in
        infrastructure sectors, with apprenticeships and
        pre-apprenticeship opportunities.
-   Serve as a regional convenor of employers, training, and community
    partners to identify workforce needs and develop a regional
    workforce training plan. 
-   Make a model employer commitment, prioritizing hiring of workers and
    small businesses in their community for state and local projects and
    developing diverse hiring goals.
-   Encourage contractors, where permissible under applicable law, to
    use local/economic hiring preferences to expand the diversity of the
    talent pool and build local talent.
-   Adapt career and technical education plans (i.e., Perkins State
    Plan) to meet new workforce needs created by the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law.

**Administration Actions to Support Infrastructure Workforce
Development**

The Administration is undertaking a wide range of actions to support
workforce development related to the three industries highlighted in the
Talent Pipeline Challenge. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes
over $800 million in dedicated funding for job training, as well as
additional investments where agencies may encourage the use of the funds
for training.  Agencies are including, where possible, workforce
development as an allowable activity in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
programs and identifying funds both within the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, like funds from large federal-aid highway investments, and through
other funding streams— like ARP’s State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds
and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) funding — that can
be invested in workforce training programs. The Department of Labor
(DOL) is working to align federal workforce investments in registered
apprenticeships and workforce programs at community colleges to meet
infrastructure workforce needs. The Administration will also work to
support state and local partnerships seeking to leverage WIOA funding to
support workforce training as well as wrap-around services.

***ADDITIONAL DETAILS:***

**Administration Actions to Support Infrastructure Workforce
Development**

Specific actions include:

-   DOL announced an additional $50 million in Strengthening Community
    Colleges Training grants available to support the development and
    expansion of high-quality workforce training programs at community
    colleges. These grants will enable community colleges – individually
    or collectively – to proactively address equity gaps and meet the
    skills development needs of local employers and workers, including
    for infrastructure-related fields.
-   The Department of Commerce’s (DOC) Internet for All program’s Notice
    of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) prioritize high labor standards and
    protections, as well as workforce development initiatives, to ensure
    there is a trained, diverse workforce ready to support the programs.
    In particular, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD)
    NOFO makes workforce development an eligible use of grant funds, and
    requires a highly-skilled workforce, which can be fulfilled through
    use of graduates of registered apprenticeships or other joint
    labor-management training programs. The NOFO also requires Eligible
    Entities to develop a plan for ensuring an available and highly
    skilled workforce in order to receive their funds.
-   The Department of Energy (DOE), in consultation with DOL, is
    providing $5 million to support a national battery workforce
    sectoral strategy, leading to national training standards and
    industry-recognized credentials.
-   DOE’s Solar Energy Technology Office, with Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law funding, is supporting quality pre-apprenticeships for clean
    energy construction careers.
-   DOL is developing, in collaboration with the Department of
    Transportation (DOT), DOE, and DOC, guidance that will encourage
    federal agencies and workforce system stakeholders —like American
    Job Centers (AJCs) and workforce boards, industry associations,
    worker centers, unions, and employers—to partner on infrastructure
    projects, share labor market information and expertise, and to shape
    workforce development activities to reflect proven strategies and
    practices that deliver sustainable, equitable outcomes.
-   In March, DOT and DOL signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
    that will help facilitate efforts between the two agencies on
    workforce and job quality. The MOU will leverage the individual and
    combined resources and expertise of both agencies to ensure the
    actions necessary to meet common goals related to expanding
    equitable access to quality jobs for workers and communities in the
    development and modernization of American infrastructure. 
-   In March, DOT released the NOFO for the Low and No Emissions Bus
    program. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides the first-ever
    dedicated investment in our transit workforce to support the
    transition to clean technologies like battery electric buses. Five
    percent of grants under the program – up to $280 million over five
    years – will be used to fund workforce development training,
    including registered apprenticeships and other labor-management
    training programs, to train and upskill transit workers to maintain
    and operate zero emission vehicles and related charging
    infrastructure.
-   Last week, DOT and DOE released their proposed minimum standards for
    EV Charging. The standards emphasized strong workforce standards
    such as the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP)
    to increase the safety and reliability of chargers while creating
    and supporting good-paying, highly skilled union jobs in communities
    across the country.
-   Over the course of the summer, the Administration will collaborate
    with employers and other critical stakeholders to encourage action
    on new or existing workforce efforts. Agencies will also highlight
    best practices to address infrastructure talent pipeline needs.

***COMMITMENTS UNDERWAY:***

-   Wilmington, Delaware is leveraging the Fiscal Recovery Funds from
    ARP to expand their Howard High School of Technology workforce
    development program – funding high school and adult job training in
    construction, plumbing, HVAC, and more. The city has also committed
    to using their local workforce for ARP funded neighborhood
    revitalization projects and is assisting local contractors in
    obtaining information and participating in ARP-funded projects.
    Wilmington is connecting graduates from the Howard High School
    training program to jobs with local employers working on local
    revitalization projects, and soon Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    funded infrastructure projects – helping residents get access to
    these good jobs and helping employers access the talent they need to
    successfully complete these government projects.   
-   Washington D.C. is expanding its D.C. Infrastructure Academy with
    Fiscal Recovery Funds from ARP to meet the need for skilled
    infrastructure professionals. The Infrastructure Academy offers
    high-quality training in infrastructure jobs under one roof and
    gives D.C. residents the opportunity to gain skills and secure good
    infrastructure jobs. The program recruits, trains, screens, and
    supports job placement of residents to fulfill the needs of the D.C.
    infrastructure industry, matching graduates to infrastructure jobs
    with leading companies in these high-demand fields.
-   Since 2012, the Electrical Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program
    (EVITP) has trained and certified thousands of electricians
    throughout the country in the installation of electric vehicle
    supply equipment. 1,200 qualified electricians from populations
    traditionally underrepresented in the field have received
    scholarships to complete the program. Both IBEW and The Superior
    Group, a national electrical and technology construction and
    engineering firm headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, are partnering
    with EVITP to increase the number of certified electricians to meet
    growing demand.
    -   IBEW will aim to have a total of 10,000 EVITP certified
        electricians by August.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Superior Group will increase the number of EVITP certified
        electricians in its ranks by 50. Additionally, The Superior
        Group is committed to attracting more than 100 potential new
        employees from underserved communities in Central Ohio by the
        end of 2022.
-   Solely owned by a Black woman for 30 years, McKissack & McKissack is
    a national architecture, engineering, program, and construction
    management firm. McKissack & McKissack offers tuition assistance,
    technical lectures, reimbursement for membership fees, professional
    development programs, licenses, and certifications, and other
    opportunities that grow employee skills and increase individual
    earning power. It strives for these initiatives to attract and
    retain talent— especially from underserved communities.
-   Siemens, which will produce one million EV chargers by 2025, is
    taking a number of steps to build the pipeline of workers to fill
    the jobs that will be created. Siemens is developing technical
    training pathways and building talent pipelines with more than
    100,000 academic institutions nationwide. They are also investing
    $37 million annually in employee training programs. And, Siemens
    recently started an apprenticeship program at their expanded
    manufacturing facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina.
-   The Building Pathways Building Trades Pre-Apprenticeship Program,
    launched in 2011 by the Building and Construction Trades Council of
    the Metropolitan District, prepares women, people of color, and
    other underserved Boston metro area residents to enter a union
    Registered Apprenticeship program – an effective “learn and earn”
    model providing pathways to the middle class. In addition to
    creating opportunities to access and prepare for building trades
    apprenticeships and family-sustaining careers in the construction
    industry, Building Pathways also educates middle and high school
    students about career opportunities in the building trades. Building
    Pathways has prepared and placed hundreds of Boston area residents
    for careers in union construction, with graduates comprised of over
    90 percent people of color and over 55 percent women.
-   Wilson Community College in Wilson, North Carolina will pilot the
    Fiber Broadband Association’s Optical Telecom Installation
    Certification program. The program was designed with industry
    professionals to fill an existing fiber technician skills gap, and
    consists of 144 hours of combined class and lab instruction,
    provided through Wilson Community College. The program will
    eventually include a 2,000-hour apprenticeship at Greenlight
    Community Broadband and other regional broadband partners. The Fiber
    Broadband Association plans to replicate this model with community
    colleges and providers across the country. 
-   The philanthropic community has also stepped up to support these
    efforts. The Families and Workers Fund has committed $1 million in
    aligned funding to help advance good jobs and diverse talent
    pipelines. This funding will focus on building the capacity of
    community-based nonprofits to scale innovative models for helping
    workers achieve economic mobility and career advancement and to
    participate in federal funding opportunities.  Additionally,
    philanthropies are committing $250,000 to train workers in EVITP,
    including $150,000 from the Hewlett Foundation, which is committed
    to enhancing broad public benefits of the clean energy transition.
