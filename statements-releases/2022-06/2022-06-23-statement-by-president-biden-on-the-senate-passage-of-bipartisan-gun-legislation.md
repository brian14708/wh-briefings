title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Senate Passage of Bipartisan Gun\_Legislation"
---
 
Tonight, after 28 years of inaction, bipartisan members of Congress came
together to heed the call of families across the country and passed
legislation to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities.
Families in Uvalde and Buffalo – and too many tragic shootings before –
have demanded action.  And tonight, we acted.

This bipartisan legislation will help protect Americans. Kids in schools
and communities will be safer because of it. The House of
Representatives should promptly vote on this bipartisan bill and send it
to my desk.
