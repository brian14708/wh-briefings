title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Increasing Federal Firefighter\_Pay"
---
 
There’s an old expression that God made man – and then he made a few
firefighters. Firefighters are some of the bravest men and women among
us, and the backbones of our communities, protecting our homes,
businesses, schools, and families from catastrophe. 

Federal firefighters used to get paid $13 an hour – but that ended in my
administration. Last summer, we bumped up wildland firefighter pay to
$15 an hour, a critical first step. I also fought for and secured
historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to give
America’s federal firefighters the pay, respect, and dignity they
deserve. Today, my administration is announcing additional steps to
increase pay for our nation’s federal firefighters, as well as expanding
access to mental health support and creating more career pathways in
wildland firefighting.  

Today’s new steps, already paid for by the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, will temporarily put back pay into firefighter’s pockets,
increasing their bi-weekly checks by up to 50% of their annual base
salary for two years. But we know there is more work to do, especially
as climate change fuels more wildfires. I will do everything in my
power, including working with Congress to secure long-term funding, to
make sure these heroes keep earning the paychecks – and dignity – they
deserve.
