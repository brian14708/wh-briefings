title: "FACT SHEET: Delivering on Tulsa Commitments to Build Black\_Wealth"
---
 
One year ago, commemorating the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre,
President Biden announced two expanded efforts to help Black families
and communities build wealth through homeownership and entrepreneurship.

The President:

-   Launched a first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address
    inequity in home appraisals, charged with identifying and utilizing
    the levers at the federal government’s disposal to root out
    discrimination in the appraisal and homebuying process.  
-   Announced a goal of increasing the share of federal contracts going
    to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), including Black- and
    brown-owned small businesses, by 50 percent by 2025.

Since then, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken swift action:  
  
**<u>Rooting out bias in the home appraisal process</u>**  
  
Homeownership is the primary contributor to building wealth for Black
and brown households, but bias in home valuations limits the ability of
Black and brown families to enjoy the financial returns associated with
homeownership, thereby contributing to the already sprawling racial
wealth gap.  
  
In March, the Biden-Harris Administration released the PAVE Action
Plan, which, once enacted, will represent the most wide-ranging set of
reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal
process. The Action Plan details a set of more than 20 commitments and
actions across all stages of the home appraisal process, including
making the appraisal industry more accountable; empowering consumers
with critical information and assistance if they receive a valuation
that is lower than expected; preventing algorithmic bias in home
valuation; cultivating an appraiser profession that is well-trained and
looks like the communities it serves; and leveraging federal data and
expertise to inform policy, practice, and research on appraisal bias.

**<u>Advancing equity in federal procurement</u>**  
  
Increasing federal spending with underserved businesses not only helps
more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams, but also narrows
persistent wealth disparities. According to
an [analysis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/blog/2021/12/01/the-benefits-of-increased-equity-in-federal-contracting/)
from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, differences in
business ownership account for 20 percent of the wealth gap between
average white and Black households.  
  
Recognizing this historic opportunity, the Biden-Harris Administration
adopted a [bold set of
reforms](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-reforms-to-increase-equity-and-level-the-playing-field-for-underserved-small-business-owners/)
to meet the President’s target of increasing the share of federal
contracts to SDBs and increase opportunity for all underserved
businesses. These actions include:

-   For the first time, asking agencies to increase their goals so that
    governmentwide spending in FY22 results in 11 percent of contracting
    dollars being awarded to small disadvantaged businesses, up from the
    current statutory goal of 5 percent  
-   Releasing, for the first time, disaggregated data of federal
    contracting spend by race/ethnicity of business owner, a powerful
    transparency and management tool  
-   Implementing major changes to the federal government’s use of
    “category management” to boost contracting opportunities for
    underserved small businesses  
-   Increasing the number of new entrants to the federal marketplace and
    reversing declines in the small business supplier base.
