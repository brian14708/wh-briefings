title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with President Jair Bolsonaro of\_\
  Brazil"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and President Jair Messias Bolsonaro met
today to reaffirm the strategic importance of the relationship between
the United States and Brazil—two of the world’s largest democracies. At
a moment when the globe is facing a cascade of crises, from Russia’s war
in Ukraine to global warming and pandemic recovery, the partnership
between the United States and Brazil is vital to international efforts
to address the climate crisis, and ensure peace. The Leaders pledged to
continue their ongoing collaboration on trade and commercial
matters, including through U.S. support for Brazil’s OECD candidacy.
President Biden and President Bolsonaro also discussed how our countries
must work together to facilitate sustainable development in the larger
Amazon Basin to dramatically reduce deforestation, coordinate closely at
the UN Security Council over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and support
democratic renewal.
