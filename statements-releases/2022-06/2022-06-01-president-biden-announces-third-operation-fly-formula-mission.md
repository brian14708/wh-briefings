title: "President\_Biden Announces Third Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"
---
 
*United Airlines will air ship approximately 3.7 million 8-ounce bottle
equivalents of Kendamil infant formula *

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration has
arranged the third Operation Fly Formula flight for the first shipment
of Kendamil infant formula entering the United States. United Airlines
has agreed to transport Kendamil formula free of charge from Heathrow
Airport in London to multiple airports across the country over a
three-week period. These are the first Operation Formula Flight to be
donated by an airline carrier.   
   
These Operation Fly Formula flights donated by United Airlines will
contain over 300,000 pounds or approximately 3.7 million 8-ounce bottle
equivalents of Kendamil infant formula and will begin shipping on June
9. These flights will contain approximately 3.2 million 8-ounce bottle
equivalents of Kendamil Classic Stage 1 and 540,000 8-ounce bottle
equivalents of Kendamil Organic.   
   
The Kendamil formula available through Operation Fly Formula will be
distributed and available for purchase at selected US retailers
nationwide, as well as online. This first shipment, which includes
Kendamil Classic and Kendamil Organic formula, will be available at
Target stores across the country in the coming weeks. Last week, the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency is
exercising enforcement discretion so that Kendal Nutricare can import
infant formula under the Kendamil brand. Kendal Nutricare has announced
that they will export up to 2 million cans of Kendamil infant formula –
the equivalent of at least 54 million 8-ounce bottles to the United
States. Parents can learn more about Kendamil infant formula
at <https://kendamil.com/> and visit the United States website
at <https://us.kendamil.com/> for updates and information on retail
locations.   
   
President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
are authorized to use Department of Defense (DOD)-contracted commercial
aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and
safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. To date,
Operation Fly Formula has brought in the equivalent of 1.5 million
8-ounce bottles of infant formula to the U.S.    
   
In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis
facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers
can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the
U.S. market.
