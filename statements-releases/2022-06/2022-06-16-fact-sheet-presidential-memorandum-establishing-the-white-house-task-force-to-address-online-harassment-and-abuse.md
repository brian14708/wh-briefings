title: "FACT SHEET: Presidential Memorandum Establishing the White\_House Task Force\
  \ to Address Online Harassment and\_Abuse"
---
 
Today, President Biden will sign a Presidential Memorandum establishing
the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse,
responding to the need for government leadership to address online
harms, which disproportionately affect women, girls, people of color,
and LGBTQI+ individuals. Vice President Harris will launch the Task
Force by hosting a survivor and expert roundtable this afternoon. The
tragic events in Buffalo and Uvalde have underscored a fact known all
too well by many Americans: the internet can fuel hate, misogyny, and
abuse with spillover effects that threaten our communities and safety
offline. 

President Biden has long championed efforts to prevent and address
gender-based violence, including writing and passing the landmark
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) nearly three decades ago as a U.S.
Senator and signing
its [reauthorization](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-reauthorization-of-the-violence-against-women-act-vawa/) into
law earlier this year.  The reauthorized VAWA includes historic new
protections against online harassment and abuse. Vice President Harris,
who is hosting today’s Task Force, has long been a champion of
addressing online harassment and abuse throughout her career, including
as United States Senator and California’s Attorney General. 

The Task Force will produce recommendations for the Federal government,
state governments, technology platforms, schools, and other public and
private entities to prevent and address technology-facilitated
gender-based violence, including a focus on the nexus between online
misogyny and radicalization to violence.  Recommendations will focus
particularly on: increasing support for survivors of online harassment
and abuse; expanding research to better understand the impact and scope
of the problem; enhancing prevention, including prevention focused on
youth; and strengthening accountability for offenders and platforms. The
Task Force will be co-chaired by the Gender Policy Council and the
National Security Council, and will include the Attorney General, the
Secretary of Health and Human Services and other heads of Federal
agencies. 

**Strengthening the Federal Response to Online Harms: White House Task
Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse**  

The Task Force is an interagency effort to address online harassment and
abuse, specifically focused on technology-facilitated gender-based
violence. In consultation with survivors, advocates, educators, experts
from diverse fields, and the private sector, the Task Force will develop
specific recommendations to improve prevention, response, and protection
efforts through programs and policies in the United States and globally
by:

-   Improving coordination among executive departments, agencies, and
    offices to maximize the Federal Government’s effectiveness in
    preventing and addressing technology-facilitated gender-based
    violence in the United States and globally, including by developing
    policy solutions to enhance accountability for those who perpetrate
    online harms;
-   Enhancing and expanding data collection and research across the
    Federal Government to measure the costs, prevalence, exposure to,
    and impact of technology-facilitated gender-based violence,
    including by studying the mental health effects of harassment and
    abuse perpetrated through social media, particularly affecting
    adolescents; 
-   Increasing access to survivor-centered services, information, and
    support for victims, and increasing training and technical
    assistance for Federal, State, Tribal, local, and territorial
    governments, as well as for global organizations and entities in the
    fields of criminal justice, health and mental health services,
    education, and victim services;
-   Developing programs and policies to address the disproportionate
    impact of online harassment, abuse, and disinformation campaigns
    targeting women and LGBTQI+ individuals who are public and political
    figures, government and civic leaders, activists, and journalists in
    the United States and globally; 
-   Examining existing Federal laws, regulations, and policies to
    evaluate the adequacy of the current legal framework to address
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence and provide
    recommendations for strengthening it; and
-   Identifying additional opportunities to improve efforts to prevent
    and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence in United
    States foreign policy and foreign assistance, including through
    the [Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment
    and
    Abuse.](https://www.state.gov/2022-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/)

  
**Background  
**When President Biden first wrote and championed the Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) in the early 1990s, the internet was still in its
infancy. Today, the internet has transformed our ability to connect,
communicate, and access services and support. At the same time, social
media and other forms of technology are increasingly misused as tools of
abuse, harassment, and exploitation. 

In the United States, one in three women under the age of 35 report
being sexually harassed online, and over half of LGBTQI+ individuals
report being the target of severe online abuse. Individuals may also be
disproportionately targeted because of their race, gender and gender
identity, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, or
at the intersection of various identities.  Online harassment and abuse
take many forms, including the non-consensual distribution of intimate
digital images; cyberstalking; sextortion; doxing; malicious deep fakes;
gendered disinformation; rape and death threats; the distribution of
child sexual abuse materials; online recruitment and exploitation of
victims of sex trafficking, including youth; and various other forms of
technology-facilitated intimate partner abuse. 

Technology-facilitated gender-based violence can have serious
consequences, ranging from psychological distress and negative health
impacts, including self-harm and suicide, to self-censorship and
disruptions to education and economic loss.   It can also lead to
physical and sexual violence, including homicide.  In the United States
and around the world, women and LGBTQI+ political leaders, public
figures, activists, and journalists face virulent and often sexualized
online harassment and abuse, which can undermine human rights and full
participation in democracy, governance, and civic life. 

Recent mass shootings have also underscored the connections between
online harassment, hate, misogyny, and extremist acts.  For example, the
Uvalde shooter had a history of threatening girls online, yet these
violent, sexualized harms and threats were dismissed and ignored when
reported.  In their annual report on [Mass Attacks in Public
Spaces](https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2020-09/MAPS2019.pdf), the
U.S. Secret Service notes that special focus should be given to
assessing threats and preventing violence related to “men who use
digital platforms to voice misogynistic views and general animosity
toward women.”  

**The Biden-Harris Administration Efforts to Combat Online Harassment
and Abuse **

President Biden and Vice President Harris have long been committed to
standing with survivors of gender-based violence wherever it
occurs—including online. Through this Task Force, they will lead a
strategic vision for countering online forms of violence, harassment and
abuse. Alongside the launch of the Task Force, the Biden-Harris
Administration is undertaking several key actions, including:

-   **Advancing Technology to Assist Victims of Crime Program.** The
    Department of Justice (DOJ) Office for Victims of Crime will award
    $3 million to victim services organizations through the [Advancing
    the Use of Technology to Assist Victims of
    Crime](https://ovc.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-ovc-2022-171237) program.
    This program will support initiatives that use technology to
    increase access to services and information about victims’
    rights, enhance service providers’ understanding of
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence, and strengthen the
    responsiveness of victim service organizations supporting survivors
    of technology-facilitated gender-based violence.
-   **National Domestic Violence Hotline Survivor Survey**. The National
    Domestic Violence Hotline, through funding from the U.S. Department
    of Health and Human Services, Family Violence Prevention and
    Services Program, will provide a preliminary report on its survivor
    survey research project, which was undertaken this spring and for
    the first-time asked survivors about their experiences of online
    harassment and abuse. The Hotline heard from approximately 1,000
    survivors who completed the survey.  *Every* survivor reported they
    had experienced at least one form of online harassment or abuse,
    including 45% who said they experienced cyberstalking, 27% reported
    being threatened with the posting of intimate images without
    permission; 17% reported the posting of intimate pictures without
    permission; and 12% reported sextortion. These insights will help
    inform the work of the Task Force.
-   **Research from the National Threat Assessment Center**. The U.S.
    Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC), under the
    Department of Homeland Security, is adding to its research on the
    nexus between online misogyny and domestic terrorism by preparing a
    report examining the role of domestic violence as a motive and
    precursor to mass violence, including an analysis of the prior
    communications and online presence of the attackers. This report
    will build on its most recent report, [Hot Yoga Tallahassee: A Case
    Study of Misogynistic
    Extremism](https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2022-03/NTAC%20Case%20Study%20-%20Hot%20Yoga%20Tallahassee_0.pdf), which
    analyzes the background of a 2018 attacker who killed two women and
    injured four more at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, FL, and
    highlights the specific threat posed by misogynistic extremism.
-   **Research on Access to Services for Survivors of Cyberstalking**.
    The Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women has
    funded the National Opinion Research Center to collect nationally
    representative data on cyberstalking in the United States to assess
    its scope and nature, as well as determine survivors’ access to
    services and any unmet needs. Research is underway, and report
    findings will be published later this year. 
-   **Expanded Focus on Technological Abuse in the Reauthorized Violence
    Against Women Act.** The Department of Justice (DOJ) will implement
    new statutory provisions in the recent reauthorization of the
    Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2022, which includes for the
    first time a definition of “technological abuse,” recognizing the
    importance of addressing this form of abuse at the intersection with
    domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and dating
    violence.  Under VAWA 2022, the Attorney General will develop a
    national strategy to prevent and address cybercrimes against
    individuals, including cyberstalking and the non-consensual
    distribution of intimate images of adults, and directs the FBI to
    improve data collection regarding these crimes. DOJ will also help
    raise awareness among victim advocates of the new VAWA provision
    that establishes a federal civil cause of action for an individual
    who has an intimate visual depiction of themselves disclosed without
    their consent, with damages up to $150,000 and attorney’s fees.
-   **New Report on the Online Harassment of Women Political
    Figures.** In partnership with the State Department’s Office of
    Global Women’s Issues, Texas A&M University’s Program on Women,
    Peace, and Security are [releasing a
    report](/bush.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WPS-Report-FINAL-draft.pdf) on
    “Technological Threats: How Online Harassment of Female Political
    Figures Undermines Democracy.” The report highlights research and
    policy on the intersection between online harassment,
    technology, women’s political participation, and democracy. 
-   **Expansion of the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based
    Online Harassment and Abuse.**  To address online harassment and
    abuse globally, the State Department will expand the [Global
    Partnership for
    Action](https://www.state.gov/2022-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/) on
    Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, announced at the Summit
    for Democracy in December and officially launched in March at the
    United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. The Global
    Partnership brings together countries, international organizations,
    civil society, and the private sector to better prioritize,
    understand, prevent, and address the growing scourge of
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence around the world. Since
    its launch, the Global Partnership has continued to grow its member
    countries, and recently welcomed the governments of Canada, Chile,
    and New Zealand, who joined the United States, along with Australia,
    Denmark, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
