title: "FACT SHEET: Delivering Progress on the Biden-\u2060Harris Lead Pipe and Paint\
  \ Action\_Plan"
---
 
Six months since the President and Vice President unveiled the
[Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action
Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/),
the Administration has taken swift action and made quick progress. The
Biden-Harris Administration has announced more than $4 billion from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds and annual appropriations that can
be used to begin replacing all of America’s lead pipes while mobilizing
additional resources and tools to get rid of lead, ensure Americans can
drink clean water, and live in healthy homes.

Today, to continue momentum implementing the action plan, Vice President
Harris, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, and
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan are in
Pittsburgh to provide an update on the Administration’s commitment to
addressing lead pipes and paint, including through announcing $500
million for states and local government to reduce lead exposure and
build healthier homes. States and localities can begin applying for the
awards, which will target disadvantaged communities in line with the
President’s Justice40 Initiative. 

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe no child, no family,
and no American should drink water with lead or be exposed to lead paint
in their homes. That’s why they made replacing lead pipes a centerpiece
of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and why Vice President Harris
visited AFL-CIO to release an action plan that helps ensure federal,
state, and local resources are moving quickly. Together, their
leadership, vision, and actions are removing lead from water and homes,
creating good-paying jobs, and supporting the low-income and communities
of color disproportionately impacted. 

*Outlined below is how the Administration is making critical progress on
the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan:*

**<u>Tackling Lead Pipes and Paint with Historic Investments</u>**

-   Today, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is
    making $500 million available for states and local governments to
    protect children and families from lead-based paint and other home
    health hazards, targeting the awards to disadvantaged communities,
    in line with the Justice40 Initiative, by including rating points
    based on the percentage of the area the grant will target that are
    disadvantaged communities.

-   In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a
    memorandum to guide collaborative implementation with state, local,
    and Tribal partners water infrastructure funding through the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $2.9 billion for lead
    service line replacement in 2022. EPA’s memo provided technical
    guidance to states on the disadvantaged community definitions and
    EPA oversight of the state programs. Working collaboratively, EPA
    and state SRF programs continue to make progress towards Justice40.

<!-- -->

-   In May, EPA announced that it is making available $ 7.28 billion in
    new federal grant funding for the Drinking Water State Revolving
    Fund (DWSRF). This funding can be used for loans that help drinking
    water systems install treatment for contaminants, improve
    distribution systems by removing lead service lines and improve
    system resiliency to natural disasters such as floods. 

<!-- -->

-   In May, EPA issued a new funding memorandum to guide the
    distribution of $154 million in FY22 Tribal water infrastructure
    funding from the BIL to support access to safe drinking water and
    wastewater management in Tribal communities, including projects to
    replace lead pipes.

<!-- -->

-   In February, EPA announced $20 million in available grant funding to
    assist communities and schools with removing sources of lead in
    drinking water. This grant funding, and additional funding through
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help make rapid progress on
    the goal of addressing lead and removing lead pipes across the
    country.

-   In April, the Village of Elberta, Michigan received $3.4 million in
    grant and low-interest loans from USDA, leveraging an additional $2
    million in state assistance, to improve their water system and
    remediate lead. Approximately, 79 percent of the service laterals in
    the water distribution system are known or suspected to contain
    lead.  USDA has an additional $23.8 million in projects containing
    lead remediation that are nearing approval and other applications in
    development.

<!-- -->

-   In March, USDA provided a $350,000 award to the City of Linwood,
    Kansas for their Water System Improvements Project.  Leveraging
    $499,586 in HUD’s Community Development and Block Grant funds and
    $150,000 in applicant contribution, this project will enable the
    City of Linwood to replace approximately 75 cast iron service lines
    that may contain lead joints and to make other necessary
    improvements to the distribution system.  

<!-- -->

-   In March, EPA issued a Request for Applications for approximately
    $100 million in federal funding through the Environmental Finance
    Center (EFC) Grant Program. A major priority for this program is to
    provide technical support to disadvantaged communities across the
    country. Selected technical assistance providers will help
    communities develop and submit project proposals, including State
    Revolving Fund (SRF) applications for Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    funding to reduce lead in drinking water.

<!-- -->

-   Schools and child care facilities are also accessing funds for
    projects to replace lead lines and remediate lead plumbing, pipes,
    and paint. In March, the Anson Madison Water District in Maine
    received a $6 million low-interest loan and $3.5 million grant to
    mitigate lead exposure for 3,700 residents, including at two area
    high schools and other educational institutions. In January 2022,
    USDA’s Rural Development obligated $9.5 million to Columbus County,
    North Carolina, for the construction and cost overrun of a new
    replacement school facility housing Pre-K through 8th grade. This
    new facility replaces two school facilities ranging from 60-94 years
    old with asbestos in almost all flooring and lead paint throughout –
    ensuring the new facility meets all code requirements.  

<!-- -->

-   In January, the Department of the Treasury adopted the final rule
    for the $350 billion State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds, which
    provides for an expanded set of eligible lead remediation uses,
    including replacement of faucets and fixtures in schools and
    daycares, and confirms recipients’ ability to use funds for the
    replacement of lead services lines. The final rule took effect on
    April 1, 2022. Already, recipients of the State and Local Fiscal
    Recovery Funds, authorized by the American Rescue Plan, are
    investing more than $60 million in lead remediation projects. Some
    examples of this include: 
    -   The City of Toledo, OH plans to replace all private lead service
        lines in the city (approximately 3,000 lines) at no cost to
        homeowners. Additionally, the City will replace many public lead
        service lines co-located with private lines. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The City of Buffalo, NY has budgeted $10 million for an
        expansion of the City’s ROLL program so that at least an
        additional 1,000 homes can have their lead water service lines
        replaced. The City has already successfully replaced the lines
        in 500 homes and this expanded capacity will more than double
        its impact.

    <!-- -->

    -   The City of Pittsburgh, PA has budgeted $17.5 million to partner
        with the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority to complete
        projects to remediate lead in drinking water.

**<u>Making It Easier to Access Funding</u>**

-   In line with the Office of Management and Budget’s commitment to
    make existing sources of federal funding for lead pipes accessible
    to the public, in March, the President Biden’s FY23 Budget request
    included a summary of all the sources funding for lead pipes across
    the federal government. 
-   In May, EPA and partners across the federal government announced a
    renewed Tribal Infrastructure Task Force to improve federal
    government coordination efforts to deliver water infrastructure and
    financial assistance to American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native
    Villages. 

**<u>Removing Lead in Federally-Assisted Housing</u>**

-   HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing will soon issue a FY22
    notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) for its Lead-Based Paint
    Capital Fund grant program that will support control of lead-based
    paint hazards in public housing.

<!-- -->

-   HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes is developing
    a plan for removing lead service lines from HUD-assisted housing
    when a public water system is replacing a water main (in the street)
    but is not removing the service lines at the same time.

**<u>Remediating Lead in Schools and Child Care Centers </u>**

-   The Department of Health and Human Service’s (HHS) Administration
    for Children and Families (ACF) and EPA are collaboratively
    developing a series of three training webinars on lead testing and
    remediation in drinking water throughout child care and early
    childhood facilities using the 3-Ts (Training, Testing, Taking
    Action). The webinars will provide presentations from HHS and EPA,
    alongside interactive tools, and case studies.  

<!-- -->

-   HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes continues to
    partner with 289 state, tribal, and local governments on their
    implementing on 349 grants that use its funds to make homes of
    low-income children and their families lead-safe and healthy. 

**<u>Closing Gaps in Childhood Lead Testing </u>**

-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with
    Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSU) to raise
    awareness and serve as a place for lead referrals and screening. The
    PEHSUs are a group of environmental health specialists who provide
    medical information and advice on environmental conditions that
    influence reproductive and children’s health. PEHSUs are
    academically based, typically at university medical centers. 

<!-- -->

-   CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are
    also planning a state-to-state learning webinar to showcase the
    efforts of two to three states that have undertaken efforts to
    increase blood lead screening rates. CDC and CMS will identify
    examples and a platform to share approaches, best practices, and
    lessons learned, and encourage coordination across state agencies,
    to consider implementation of levers to increase blood lead
    screening rates.

**<u>Developing New Regulations to Protect Communities from Lead in
Drinking Water</u>**

-   EPA is advancing the regulatory process to develop a new proposed
    rule, the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements. EPA intends to propose
    requirements that, along with other actions, would result in the
    replacement of all lead service lines as quickly as is feasible. EPA
    also intends to consider opportunities to strengthen tap sampling
    requirements and explore options to reduce the complexity and
    confusion associated with the action level and trigger level, with a
    focus on reducing health risks in more communities. The goal of
    these potential lead service line replacement regulatory
    improvements—coupled with non-regulatory actions—is to more
    equitably protect public health.

<!-- -->

-   EPA announced in May that it is seeking input from stakeholder
    groups on the forthcoming Lead and Copper Rule Improvements
    proposal. EPA is inviting small businesses, governments, and
    not-for-profit organizations to participate as Small Entity
    Representatives for a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel. EPA
    accepted nominations for the panel until May 18, 2022. At the same
    time, EPA is implementing the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR)
    to help ensure that lead service line inventories are developed by
    public water systems by 2024.

<!-- -->

-   To further protect children from lead, EPA is working to revise the
    2021 Dust Lead Clearance Levels and the related 2019 Dust Lead
    Hazard Standards final rules. These rules provide important
    provisions to protect children from exposure to lead dust on floors
    and windowsills. The hazard standards are used to identify a
    dust-lead hazard and the clearance levels are used to demonstrate
    adequate clean-up after abatement activities. These apply to
    pre-1978 homes and child-care facilities. The courts sent the
    previous Administration’s 2019 rule back to EPA to redo to ensure
    the levels are protective. EPA currently plans to propose revisions
    to these rules in FY 2023.
