title: "FACT SHEET:  President\_Biden Signs National Security Memorandum to Combat\
  \ Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and Associated Labor\_Abuses"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM)
to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and
related harmful fishing practices.  

IUU fishing is among the greatest threats to ocean health and is a
significant cause of global overfishing, contributing to the collapse or
decline of fisheries that are critical to the economic growth, food
systems, and ecosystems of numerous countries around the world.  Distant
water fishing vessels, which engage in industrial-scale fishing
operations on the high seas and in waters under other states’
jurisdictions, can be significant perpetrators of IUU fishing and
related harmful fishing practices.  IUU fishing often involves forced
labor, human trafficking, and other crimes and human rights abuses. 
Left unchecked, IUU fishing and associated labor abuses undermine U.S.
economic competitiveness, national security, fisheries sustainability,
and the livelihoods and human rights of fishers around the world and
will exacerbate the environmental and socioeconomic effects of climate
change.

The Biden Administration will address IUU fishing by increasing
coordination with diverse stakeholders — public and private, foreign and
domestic.  The United States Government will use the full range of
existing conservation, labor, trade, economic, diplomatic, law
enforcement, and national security authorities to address these
challenges, including:

-   Promoting labor rights, human rights, and fundamental freedoms
    through worker-centered trade policies and working to ensure that
    supply chains are free from forced labor, including by engaging with
    international institutions and trade partners to address forced
    labor and other abusive labor practices in IUU fishing;  
-   Collaborating within international organizations, including regional
    bodies, and partnering with stakeholders from governments, civil
    society, and the private sector, to increase global attention on the
    challenges of IUU fishing, including by distant water fishing
    vessels, and related abusive labor practices, such as the use of
    forced labor in seafood supply chains; and  
-   Combatting abuses and strengthening incentives for ethical behavior
    in the global seafood industry, including by limiting the market for
    products derived from IUU fishing, forced labor, or other abusive
    labor practices.

The Biden-Harris Administration is also taking the following actions to
combat IUU fishing, which will be announced throughout this week’s U.N.
Ocean Conference.

-   The United States, the UK, and Canada will launch an **IUU Fishing
    Action Alliance** aimed at increasing ambition and momentum in the
    fight against IUU fishing, including **a pledge to take urgent
    action** to improve the monitoring, control, and surveillance of
    fisheries, increase transparency in fishing fleets and in the
    seafood market, and build new partnerships that will hold bad actors
    accountable.  
-   The **U.S. Interagency Working Group on Illegal, Unreported, and
    Unregulated Fishing**, comprising 21 Federal agencies, will release
    its *National Five-Year Strategy for Combating Illegal, Unreported,
    and Unregulated Fishing (2022-2026)* by the end of July.  The
    strategy prioritizes the Working Group’s efforts to combat IUU
    fishing, curtail the global trade of IUU fish and fish products, and
    promote global maritime security, while working in partnership with
    other governments and authorities, the seafood industry, academia,
    and non-governmental stakeholders.  The United States will engage
    with priority partners, including Ecuador, Panama, Senegal, Taiwan,
    and Vietnam.  Information on the member agencies and activities of
    the Working Group can be found [here.  
    ](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/us-interagency-working-group-iuu-fishing)
-   NOAA will also issue a **proposed rule to enhance and strengthen its
    ability to address IUU fishing activities and combat forced labor in
    the seafood supply chain**.  Specifically, the rule will enhance
    NOAA’s ability to implement the Agreement on Port State Measures to
    Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated
    Fishing and the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection
    Act.  The rule proposes to broaden the scope of activities that NOAA
    can consider when identifying nations that engage in IUU fishing to
    include fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of a nation,
    without the permission of that nation, or in violation of its laws
    and regulations.  This will ensure consistency with the United
    Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s *International Plan of
    Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and
    Unregulated Fishing*. 

These new actions build on President Biden’s proclamation declaring June
as [National Ocean
Month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/31/a-proclamation-on-national-ocean-month-2022/)

the White House made earlier this month to conserve and restore the
health and productivity of the ocean for the benefit of all Americans.
 These announcements included initiating the designation process for a
new national marine sanctuary to conserve Hudson Canyon in the Atlantic
Ocean, a phase out of the sale of single-use plastics in national parks
and public lands, the launch of efforts to create America’s first-ever
Ocean Climate Action Plan, and the launch of an initiative to center
environmental justice in ocean science and technology activities and
investments.
