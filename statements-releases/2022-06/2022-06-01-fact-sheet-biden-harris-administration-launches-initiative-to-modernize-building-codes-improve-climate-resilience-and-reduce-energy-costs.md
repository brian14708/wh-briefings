*New Building Codes Initiative will boost resilience to the impacts of
climate change, lower utility bills for homes and businesses, and
prioritize underserved communities*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a National
Initiative to Advance Building Codes that will help state, local,
Tribal, and territorial governments adopt the latest, current building
codes and standards, enabling communities to be more resilient to
hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that
are intensifying due to climate change.

Modern building codes and standards provide a range of smart design and
construction methods that save lives, reduce property damage, and lower
utility bills—for example, by ensuring that roofs can withstand
hurricane winds, that construction materials are resistant to flood
damage, and that insulation keeps heating and cooling costs low. With
extreme weather events threatening millions of homes each year, and
taking a greater toll on underserved communities, every dollar invested
in building code adoption provides [eleven times
more](https://www.nibs.org/projects/natural-hazard-mitigation-saves-2019-report)
in savings by reducing damage and helping communities recover more
quickly.  
  
Additionally, modernized energy codes can save households an average of
[$162 dollars each
year](https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-announces-new-building-energy-codes-save-consumers-money-reduce-impacts)
on utility bills, which is especially significant in reducing energy
burden for low-income households. Unfortunately, nearly [two out of
every three
communities](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_building-codes-strategy.pdf)
in the U.S. have not adopted the latest building codes and, as a result,
are vulnerable to climate impacts and higher energy costs.

President Biden is committed to lowering costs for families and
protecting communities from extreme weather—especially communities that
have long been underserved and are disproportionately impacted by
climate change. Earlier this year, President Biden’s National Climate
Task Force approved the new National Initiative to Advance Building
Codes to accelerate the adoption of modern building codes to improve
resiliency, create good-paying jobs, and lower energy bills. Through
this initiative, the Biden-Harris Administration will: 

-   **Comprehensively review federal funding and financing of building
    construction,** to ensure federally-supported housing and other
    building projects follow modern building codes and standards to the
    greatest extent feasible, while creating good-quality jobs and
    advancing Administration efforts to boost affordable housing supply,
    with agencies reporting to the National Climate Task Force on
    progress. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban
    Development (HUD) will promote resilient and efficient building
    standards in new construction supported by Community Development
    Block Grant-Disaster Recovery funds, which primarily aid low- and
    moderate-income persons in disaster recovery.  
-   **Harness $225 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law**
    **funding** for the Department of Energy (DOE) to support
    implementation of updated building energy codes and create
    good-quality jobs, including through workforce training partnerships
    and direct support to state and local agencies, while prioritizing
    the needs of disadvantaged communities and advancing the President’s
    Justice40 Initiative.  
-   **Provide incentives and support for communities to adopt current
    building codes and standards** by providing technical assistance,
    implementing proven strategies and best practices—such as those in
    the new Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Codes
    Strategy—across all relevant agencies in the federal government, and
    using mapping tools that help track code adoption based on energy
    efficiency and local hazards such as flood, earthquake, tornado, and
    hurricane risk.  
-   **Lead by example across the federal building portfolio**, by
    seizing opportunities to advance “above-code” resilience and energy
    efficiency standards in new projects, as well as developing the
    first Federal Building Performance Standards to help achieve
    net-zero emissions across new and existing federal buildings by
    2045.  

To announce the National Initiative to Advance Building Codes, FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell and Deputy National Climate Advisor Ali
Zaidi are in Miami, Florida today meeting with experts in climate
resilience and building safety and efficiency.

**<u>NATIONAL INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE BUILDING CODES</u>**  
  
Modern, consensus-based codes—developed and updated by the International
Code Council, National Fire Protection Association, American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and
other organizations that rely on expert input from scientists and
engineers—provide sets of model standards for several aspects of
building design, including energy efficiency and improving resilience to
various hazards such as wildfires, hurricanes, and floods. Communities
that have adopted modern building codes are [already
saving](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/building-science/building-codes-save-study)
an estimated $1.6 billion a year in avoided damage from major hazards,
with projected cumulative savings of $132 billion through 2040—a figure
that will become much higher if more communities adopt modern codes.  
  
A [recent
analysis](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/building-science/bcat/fact-sheets)
from FEMA categorized states based on their building code uptake and
found that 39 states fell into the lowest category—meaning less than 25%
of the state’s communities were covered by the latest hazard-resistant
codes.
[Nationwide](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/building-science/building-codes-save-study),
only about 35% of counties, cities, and towns have the latest codes in
place, leaving millions of Americans more vulnerable to extreme weather
and higher energy costs.  
  
Through an all-of-government commitment across the Biden-Harris
Administration, key federal agencies will collaborate to:  
  
**Increase Support and Incentives for Modern Code Adoption**

Through the Mitigation Framework Leadership Group (MitFLG), a
collaborative interagency body focused on improving resilience, senior
agency officials will identify opportunities across federal programming
to enhance outreach, technical assistance, and capacity building to
states, Tribes, territories, and local governments on building codes.
For example, agencies will advance the use of innovative incentives in
federal funding to support and reward jurisdictions for code adoption
and enforcement, to the extent allowed by law, with a focus on assisting
historically underserved communities.  
  
As part of this holistic review, which will be reported to the National
Climate Task Force, specific efforts include:

-   **FEMA will implement its new** [**Building Codes
    Strategy**](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_building-codes-strategy.pdf),
    which will integrate and, where legally permissible, require current
    building codes in its programs, policies and guidance; strengthen
    partnerships with other federal agencies, other levels of
    government, NGOs, and the private sector; and target FEMA outreach,
    education, and technical support efforts to increase building code
    adoption in underserved and vulnerable communities.  
-   **DOE will deploy $225 million from the President’s Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law** to support building energy code adoption,
    enforcement, training, and technical assistance at the state and
    local level. With these funds, DOE is launching a [Resilient and
    Efficient Codes
    Implementation](https://www.energycodes.gov/RECI-codes-workshop)
    program to advance energy efficiency and resilience through building
    codes by, among other things, supporting sustained state code
    implementation efforts, creating good-paying union jobs, and
    advancing environmental and energy justice priorities. DOE
    [projects](https://www.energycodes.gov/impact-analysis) that through
    2040, model energy codes will deliver $138 billion in energy cost
    savings and prevent carbon emissions equivalent to what 195 million
    gasoline cars emit in a year.
-   **FEMA will** **utilize and update the** [**Building Code Adoption
    Tracking
    portal**](https://geo.stantec.com/National_BCAT_Portal/viewer/) to
    identify the status of building code adoption relative to known
    climate and other natural hazard risks in each community, with a
    particular focus on code adoption in underserved areas, to help
    local policymakers advance the adoption of  modern, hazard-resistant
    building codes. DOE will continue to track the status of [state
    energy code
    adoption](https://www.energycodes.gov/status/residential).  

**Review Federal Funding and Financing to Incorporate Modern Codes**

The federal government implements a wide range of programs that fund or
finance building construction—from disaster recovery programs at FEMA
and the Small Business Administration, to federally-assisted housing
supported by the Departments of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Treasury,
HUD, and other agencies.

To increase the use of modern building codes across these projects, the
MitFLG will undertake a comprehensive review of agency programs that
support new construction or substantial rehabilitation of homes and
other buildings, through grants, loans, funding, financing, or technical
assistance. Agencies will then work to update programs to incorporate
the latest consensus-based codes, while also identifying opportunities
for greater ambition. For example, HUD will:

-   Require increased resilience and energy efficiency standards for
    residential properties newly constructed or substantially
    rehabilitated with the $5 billion in 2020 and 2021 [Community
    Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR)
    funds](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_22_049).
    These funds can be used to provide assistance to residents of
    underserved communities who have been historically marginalized and
    are adversely affected by disasters.  
-   Seek to require above-code green and resilient construction
    standards in HUD-assisted housing wherever feasible, especially in
    competitive funding announcements, and continue developing new
    incentives for above-code standards, including through the
    Multifamily and Residential Healthcare Facility Green Mortgage
    Insurance Premium programs.

The goal of this interagency effort will be to ensure that building
activities receiving federal funding or financing will meet or exceed
the latest building codes to the greatest extent feasible regardless of
local code adoption, while balancing [Administration policies to boost
housing supply and lower upfront
costs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/),
and with flexibility for operational constraints, mission requirements,
technical feasibility, enforcement feasibility, individual limitations,
or Tribal, cultural, or traditional structures. The MitFLG will report
on progress to the National Climate Task Force.

**Lead by Example Across the Federal Building Portfolio**

The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to expand its efforts to
adopt ambitious, above-code resilience and energy efficiency standards
across the federal building portfolio. As part of ongoing work to
implement the President’s [Executive Order on Federal
Sustainability](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-catalyzing-americas-clean-energy-economy-through-federal-sustainability/):

-   Federal agencies will design all large new construction and
    modernization projects (above 25,000 gross square feet), starting
    now in Fiscal Year 2022, to be **net-zero emissions**—which includes
    the use of all-electric equipment and appliances and efficiency
    measures significantly above current model codes.  
-   The Office of the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer, within the
    White House Council on Environmental Quality, will explore
    opportunities to integrate **innovative resilience
    standards**—including above-code protections against specific
    hazards like floods and wildfires.  
-   The Administration will implement the first-ever **Federal Building
    Performance Standards**, being developed by the White House Council
    on Environmental Quality, the General Services Administration, DOE,
    and the Environmental Protection Agency, to advance the retrofits of
    existing Federal buildings and establish metrics, targets, and
    tracking methods to reach the Administration’s federal carbon
    emissions reduction goals—including a net-zero emissions building
    portfolio by 2045, with a 50 percent emissions reduction by 2032.
