Vice President Kamala Harris today hosted a roundtable with women
business executives, entrepreneurs, and civil society leaders to discuss
women’s economic empowerment in northern Central America. The Vice
President underscored that when women succeed, all of society benefits.
They discussed ways to advance US.-led efforts to empower women
economically and to reduce gender based violence in the region, as part
of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Strategy to Address the Root Causes
of Migration from Central America. The Vice President and the women
leaders welcomed new public and private sector initiatives launched
today on the margins of the Summit of the Americas which, when taken
together, will create an ecosystem of opportunity for women. They also
discussed the $3.2 billion of commitments that the Vice President’s Call
to Action has generated in the past year and the Vice President heard
directly from women who have benefited from Call to Action initiatives.
The Vice President and women leaders also discussed increasing women’s
participation in the work force, expanding women’s financial and digital
inclusion, and promoting diverse and inclusive workforce cultures. The
Vice President reaffirmed that supporting women will remain a central
pillar of her work to address the root causes of migration.
