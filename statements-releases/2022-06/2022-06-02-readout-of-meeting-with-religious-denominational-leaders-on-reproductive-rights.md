  Rights"

Yesterday, White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and
staff from the Office of the Vice President and the White House Office
of Public Engagement convened a meeting with a diverse group of national
religious denominational leaders on reproductive rights. Attendees
discussed the importance of protecting access to health care, including
reproductive health care, with a particular emphasis on the importance
of equitable access for underserved communities.  
   
Faith leaders also highlighted the importance of the constitutional
rights affirmed in *Roe v. Wade*, including the fundamental right to
privacy. Participants underscored the importance in ensuring that health
care decisions be made by women without the interference of
politicians. They also cited fears about the challenges facing families
in their congregations and communities as states pass extreme laws
restricting access to critical health care, including reproductive
health care.   
   
Senior Administration officials highlighted the President’s commitment
to reproductive rights. The Administration also committed to continued
engagement and partnership with these groups.  
   
Participants included representatives from:

-   Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
-   United Church of Christ 
-   United Methodist Church 
-   Presbyterian Church USA 
-   The Fellowship of Affirming Ministries 
-   Reconstructing Judaism
-   The Rabbinical Assembly
