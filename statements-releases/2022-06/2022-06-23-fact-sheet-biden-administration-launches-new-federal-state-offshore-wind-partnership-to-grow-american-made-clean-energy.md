*White House Convenes Governors, Labor Leaders, and Private Companies to
Boost Offshore Wind Supply Chains, Lower Energy Costs, and Support
Manufacturing Jobs*

   
Today, the White House is joining with eleven governors from up and down
the East Coast to launch a new Federal-State Offshore Wind
Implementation Partnership that will accelerate the growing offshore
wind industry. The partnership will support efforts to provide Americans
with cleaner and cheaper energy, create good-paying jobs, and make
historic investments in new American energy supply chains,
manufacturing, shipbuilding, and servicing.  
   
As a first step of this Partnership, the White House and governors are
announcing commitments to collaborate on expanding key elements of the
offshore wind supply chain, from manufacturing facilities to port
capabilities to workforce development. The Administration is also
announcing steps to advance a National Offshore Wind Supply Chain
Roadmap and designating offshore wind vessels as Vessels of National
Interest to facilitate more offshore wind construction.  
   
After years of Americans facing energy uncertainty, President Biden has
taken decisive action to jumpstart the American offshore wind industry.
He set a bold goal of deploying 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by
2030, enough to power 10 million homes with clean energy, support 77,000
jobs, and spur $12 billion per year in private investment in offshore
wind projects. Since then, the Biden Administration has approved the
first large-scale projects, established new wind energy areas, and held
record-breaking wind auctions—signature achievements that advance the
President’s commitment to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen
American energy security.  
   
These bold actions have unleashed historic private sector investments to
expand an American-made wind energy supply chain. In 2021 alone,
investors
[announced](https://laborenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5-BNOW-FINAL.pdf)
$2.2 billion in new funding, including commitments to develop nine major
manufacturing facilities to produce the foundations, towers, cables, and
blades of offshore wind turbines. Supplier contracts to provide
materials and services to offshore wind projects more than doubled. And
[historic project labor
agreements](https://nabtu.org/press_releases/nowa-agreement-orsted) are
helping to grow a diverse union workforce and support training
programs.  
   
More opportunities are ahead, including an estimated $109 billion
revenue opportunity across the offshore wind supply chain this decade,
and East Coast Governors are laying the groundwork to seize them. Having
already set commitments to procure nearly 40 GW of offshore wind, these
states are providing a strong demand signal for clean energy that will
lower energy costs for American families while protecting them from
volatile fossil fuel price spikes. Collaboration between state and
federal governments already is helping to create good-paying jobs and
establish a durable domestic supply chain to facilitate the responsible
development of America’s world-class offshore wind resource. The
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to further partnering with
states to maximize benefits to American workers and communities.  
   
That’s why today at the White House, alongside labor and industry
leaders, Governors will join National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy,
Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Secretary of Energy Jennifer
Granholm, Deputy Secretary of Transportation Polly Trottenberg, and
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Administrator Rick
Spinrad to:

-   **Launch the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation
    Partnership:** Eleven leading states along the East Coast will
    participate in this new Partnership, a first-of-its-kind forum for
    collaboration between federal and state officials to accelerate
    offshore wind progress. The partners will work together to build  a
    strong, U.S.-based supply chain for offshore wind, grow a skilled
    U.S. workforce, and build on work to address important regional
    matters such as transmission and interconnection, fishing and other
    ocean co-use issues, and other key priorities. The Federal-State
    Partnership will look to expand to the West Coast and the Gulf of
    Mexico as offshore wind energy projects develop in those regions.  
-   **Leverage State and Federal Actions to Strengthen the U.S. Offshore
    Wind Supply Chain:** As a first step of this new Partnership, the
    Biden Administration and Governors are endorsing a set of federal,
    state, and mutual commitments to expand key elements of the supply
    chain, including manufacturing facilities for offshore wind
    components, port capabilities, logistics networks needed to install
    projects, and workforce development to fill good-paying jobs.
    Working together, federal and state partners will track progress,
    anticipate future needs, and collaborate on a regional and national
    basis.  
-   **Advance the National Offshore Wind Supply Chain Roadmap:** The
    Department of Energy, along with New York and Maryland, is providing
    funding to develop a comprehensive offshore wind supply chain
    roadmap, through a collaboration led by the National Offshore Wind
    Research and Development Consortium and with partners including the
    Business Network for Offshore Wind. As part of this effort, in March
    2022 the National Renewable Energy Laboratory released a
    [report](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/report-outlines-supply-chain-needs-achieve-offshore-wind-2030-goal)
    on supply chain needs, including manufactured components, ports, and
    vessels, to deploy 30 GW by 2030. Today, Secretary Granholm will
    announce a July workshop for stakeholders, including state
    officials, to provide input on a roadmap, for release later this
    year, laying out actions to meet these supply chain needs.  
-   **Announce Priority Financing for Offshore Wind Vessels:**
    Constructing offshore wind projects requires specialized
    installation vessels, and projections from the National Offshore
    Wind Supply Chain Roadmap show that U.S. and global vessel supply
    will need to increase to meet and accelerate offshore wind
    deployment. Today, the Department of Transportation’s Maritime
    Administration (MARAD) is announcing the designation of offshore
    wind vessels as Vessels of National Interest for support through the
    Federal Ship Financing Program, giving these applications priority
    for review and funding. The program assists the domestic
    shipbuilding industry, providing support for U.S. shipyards to
    modernize their facilities, to build and retrofit vessels, and to
    assist U.S shipowners to cost-effectively obtain domestically
    produced new vessels.

Today’s announcements build on the President Biden’s leadership in
launching the American offshore wind industry. His Administration has
already:

-   **Approved the nation’s first two commercial-scale offshore wind
    projects**, [Vineyard
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters)
    and [South Fork
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-approves-second-major-offshore-wind-project-us-federal-waters),
    both now under construction and being built by union labor. The
    Department of the Interior (DOI) initiated the review of an
    additional 10 projects that, if approved, represent 22 GW of clean
    new energy for the nation.  
-   **Announced an ambitious leasing strategy** for the DOI to hold up
    to [seven offshore wind auctions by
    2025](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-outlines-ambitious-offshore-wind-leasing-strategy)—two
    of which were held earlier this year—including areas in Gulf of
    Maine, New York Bight, Central Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico, as well
    as offshore the Carolinas, California, and Oregon.  
-   **Held a record-breaking wind lease sale in the New York Bight**,
    bringing in [$4.37 billion in winning
    bids](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-sets-offshore-energy-records-437-billion-winning-bids-wind)
    for areas with the potential to power nearly two million homes. DOI
     also joined with New York and New Jersey to launch a [shared
    vision](https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/BOEM%20NY%20NJ%20Shared%20Vision.pdf)
    on offshore wind supply chain development, with a focus on
    delivering benefits to underserved communities. The Federal-State
    Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership will build on these
    efforts.  
-   **Utilized Lease Provisions to Leverage Union Jobs and Supply Chain
    Development to Accelerate Wind Development:** The historic New York
    Bight lease sale included incentives to source major components like
    blades, turbines and foundations domestically and encouraged use of
    project labor agreements to ensure that these projects are built as
    quickly and safely as possible. Last month,  DOI’s [Carolina Long
    Bay lease
    sale](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-winners-carolina-long-bay-offshore-wind-energy)
    included a new credit for bidders who committed to support workforce
    training programs or U.S. supply chain development, generating $42
    million in funding.

made today:*  
  
**Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership**  
  
The new Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership is a
joint effort of the White House National Climate Advisor, the
Secretaries of the Interior, Energy, Commerce, and Transportation, and
the Governors of several East Coast states who are early leaders on
offshore wind development: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.  
  
An initial focus area of the Partnership will be collaboratively growing
a strong U.S. offshore wind supply chain. Going forward, the Partnership
will provide a forum for new initiatives and in coordination with
existing efforts to address ocean co-use, transmission needs and other
offshore wind priorities that may benefit from additional federal,
state, and regional coordination. The Partnership will expand to include
Governors from the West Coast and the Gulf of Mexico as offshore wind
energy projects develop in those regions.  
  
**New Commitments to Strengthen the U.S. Offshore Wind Supply Chain**

During today’s White House event, Administration officials and Governors
will endorse this set of commitments to solidify and expand the domestic
manufacturing capacity, logistics networks, and workforce development
needed for a U.S. offshore wind supply chain that creates good-paying
jobs and equitably benefits local communities.

    and advance a pipeline of projects and lease sales that reinforce
    strong market demand for investment in the U.S. offshore wind supply
    chain.
-   Utilize the lease auction process, consistent with applicable law,
    to incentivize investment in the U.S. offshore wind supply chain,
    including in domestic manufacturing, logistics, and workforce
    development. 
-   Develop, in conjunction with states and other key stakeholders, an
    offshore wind supply chain roadmap that identifies critical gaps and
    opportunities to meet state and federal offshore wind goals and
    pathways to meet those goals, including opportunities where regional
    collaboration will provide greater, sustained local benefits.
-   Seek to leverage federal funding opportunities to promote a
    U.S.-based offshore wind supply chain, consistent with applicable
    law, including by providing appropriate incentives toward the
    Administration’s goal that 40 percent of overall benefits are
    directed to disadvantaged communities.
