title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces New Commitments Supporting\_Women\u2019\
  s Economic Empowerment in Latin\_America"
---
 
*U.S. Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), and the Partnership for Central America (PCA), come together to
announce programs supporting women’s economic empowerment in northern
Central America and the broader Western Hemisphere*

Vice President Kamala Harris today announced new commitments from the
U.S. government, private sector companies and organizations to support
women’s economic empowerment in northern Central America and the Western
Hemisphere more broadly. Accion, CARE International, Cargill,
Mastercard, Microsoft, and PepsiCo—companies and organizations who have
responded to the Vice President’s Call to Action—made additional
commitments to remove barriers to women’s full economic participation
and strengthen women’s access to quality employment, tools, resources,
and networks for business development and growth—thereby promoting
equitable economic recovery across the hemisphere. These commitments
will also address gender-based violence in northern Central America—to
help create safer, stronger, and more prosperous communities across the
region.

These initiatives are committed in support of the U.S. Strategy to
Address the Root Causes of Migration in northern Central America, which
the Vice President launched in July 2021.

**<u>Private Sector and Civil Society Commitments</u>**

Today, the Vice President and the Partnership for Central America
launched [***In Her
Hands***](https://www.centampartnership.org/inherhands) as a private
sector initiative to empower, train, and protect women in northern
Central America and across the Western Hemisphere. Founding members are
a coalition of companies and organizations who responded to Vice
President Harris’s Call to Action, including CARE, Cargill, Mastercard,
Microsoft, Millicom, Nespresso, PepsiCo, PriceSmart, and Pro Mujer.

**The integrated *In Her Hands* commitments will connect more than 1.4
million women and their communities to the financial system and digital
economy, accelerate women’s participation in the agroindustry, train
more than 500,000 women and girls in core job skills, promote gender
parity, and elevate women within companies across the region.**

-   **Establishing a Gender Equity Center**: As a follow up to its
    December 2021 commitment in response to [the Vice President’s Call
    to
    Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-new-commitments-as-part-of-the-call-to-action-for-the-private-sector-to-deepen-investment-in-central-america-now-totaling-over-1-2-billion/)
    humanitarian organization CARE officially established the Center for
    Gender Equity in Central America. The Center is designed to empower
    500,000 individual women and their families–providing benefits to a
    total of two million people to advance efforts to address the root
    causes of migration. The Center will leverage CARE’s gender and
    development expertise and deep connections to local partners and
    women’s organizations to support financial inclusion, women’s
    economic empowerment (including in the protection of labor rights
    and in supporting entrepreneurship), improved agricultural outcomes,
    prevention and reductions in gender-based violence.

-   **Integrating Women into the Financial** **Sector:** Accion, with
    support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, will
    partner with local institutions to connect over 300,000 Guatemalan
    women to the financial sector by 2025. In addition, PriceSmart,
    INCAE Business School, Mastercard, and Cargill will work with the
    Central American Institute of Business Administration to support 120
    women-led small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) in Honduras and
    Guatemala in increasing their access to markets and capital to grow
    their businesses and support job growth in areas of high-out
    migration.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Female Agricultural Workers:** Cargill has committed to
    empowering women in northern Central America’s agriculture sector by
    allocating a portion of its $160 million commitment in commercial
    and charitable investments made in December 2021 to establish new
    programs that will support and accelerate women’s participation in
    the agroindustry.  One of these programs, a partnership with the
    global development organization ACDI/VOCA and their Transforming
    Market Systems program will provide grants to women-owned small
    businesses in Honduras to create thousands of jobs. These programs
    will facilitate women’s access to financing, provide them with
    training, and connect them to new markets to grow their businesses.
    To help empower women and increase employment among female farmers,
    Nespresso will roll out programs in El Salvador and Honduras in 2022
    that will train its agronomists on gender equity. Finally, PepsiCo
    Latin America will bring the Next Generation Agriculture Fund to
    Guatemala, in partnership with the Interamerican Development Bank
    and a local implementing partner.  The program will accelerate
    women’s participation in the agroindustry and increase their
    incomes.

-   **Digitizing Women-owned Businesses:**  Mastercard will digitize
    300,000 women-owned and led businesses in Guatemala, Honduras, and
    El Salvador by 2025. This commitment will build on Mastercard’s May
    2021 commitment to bring five million people in the region into the
    financial system and digitize one million micro and small businesses
    in the three countries by ensuring Mastercard’s efforts reach women
    across the region.  Additionally, Accion will partner with key
    stakeholders in El Salvador and Honduras to expand digital services
    to over 700,000 people within the next five years. Microsoft will
    also work with local partners to launch high-tech digital community
    centers in 20 new communities across the region to provide women and
    girls with internet, digital skills, devices, educational
    experiences, and mentorship in rural and high-migration areas.

<!-- -->

-   **Training Women in Critical Job Skills:**  Microsoft will partner
    with Trust for the Americas to expand on its commitment to provide
    cybersecurity, coding, and artificial intelligence skills training
    to reach an additional 400,000 women, bringing the total number of
    beneficiaries to more than 500,000 women in Central America. Through
    a partnership with Pro Mujer, Microsoft will assist 146
    organizations in the region to provide financial literacy and
    education programs to nearly 25,000 low-income women. Additionally,
    Mastercard will support 5,000 girls to pursue a future career in
    Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics through its
    award-winning Girls4Tech program. Millicom will also provide digital
    skills training for more than 8,000 adolescent girls and adult women
    in 2022—with a commitment to year-over-year increases—in the three
    countries of northern Central America through its *Conectadas*
    program.  

<!-- -->

-   **Achieving Gender Parity:  **PepsiCo will launch a fellowship
    program designed to elevate more women in PepsiCo with a goal to
    achieve equal representation at management levels in the company
    by 2025.  Millicom similarly committed to achieve gender parity
    across its 22,000-employee organization by 2030.  To ensure
    long-term sustainability of their gender commitments, anchor members
    of the Partnership for Central America, Mastercard, Microsoft,
    Nespresso, and Cargill will integrate CARE’s gender equity framework
    into their programming.  This will build off examples from Nepal,
    Australia, France, Canada, and the United States to improve gender
    integration, strengthen capacity, and set new performance targets.

<!-- -->

-   **Elevating Women Within Companies:**  The World Economic Forum
    committed to launching a Gender Parity Accelerator focusing on
    economic empowerment in Central America. Building off the models
    deployed elsewhere in Latin America, the Accelerator will reskill
    women to prepare them for high-growth sectors, work to enhance work
    quality and pay standards, enhance social safety nets, and advance
    more women into management and leadership positions, with targets
    for women in leadership across government and business. 

**<u>U.S. Government Announcements</u>**

Building off her leadership of collaborative public-private partnerships
to address key challenges in the region, the Vice President announced
the following U.S. government initiatives to complement private sector
commitments to empower women and girls in the Latin American region:

-   **Gender-Based Violence (“GBV”) Prevention, Protection, and
    Accountability Initiative: **The U.S. Agency for International
    Development (USAID) announced new programs in northern Central
    America to end the scourge of GBV.  In Guatemala, a new $6.5 million
    program will provide access to violence prevention interventions and
    services while increasing the capacity of local institutions and
    service providers.  In Honduras, USAID will dedicate $2.7 million to
    strengthen access to security and justice for GBV survivors, as part
    of a broader investment in the judicial sector. The initiative will
    work with each country’s justice system to address crimes,
    especially those that are drivers of migration, such as GBV,
    homicide, extortion, and corruption, as well as human trafficking.
    This builds off a recently-announced program in El Salvador, the $35
    million GBV Prevention, Protection, and Accountability Initiative,
    which will support prevention, protection for survivors, and
    increasing accountability for perpetrators.

<!-- -->

-   **GBV Analysis and Roadmap: ** USAID’s new initiative will advance
    efforts to prevent sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence; hold
    perpetrators accountable; and protect and provide services for
    victims in northern Central America.  Migration patterns and GBV are
    deeply intertwined, and individuals on migration pathways,
    especially irregular ones, are often at heightened risk of
    experiencing GBV due to their vulnerable status as undocumented
    migrants.  This initiative will analyze gaps, drivers, and
    opportunities in preventing, mitigating, and responding to GBV in
    the context of migration, and offer a roadmap to inform U.S.
    government policies in support of the U.S. Strategy to Address the
    Root Causes of Migration.******

<!-- -->

-   **Women’s Entrepreneurship and Labor Rights:** To promote economic
    security for all, the Department of State will provide $4.5 million
    through the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund to support
    the economic participation of women and girls across the region.
    -   **Empower Innovation Challenge:  **The State Department’s $3.5
        million program will build the capacity of local civil society
        organizations and women-owned small businesses in Belize,
        Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Ecuador, El
        Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, and Peru.  The initiative
        aims to empower women-owned micro-, small-, and medium-sized
        enterprises to scale their businesses through small grants,
        training, access to capital, networking, and partnership
        opportunities with local and international businesses.   

<!-- -->

-   **Domestic Workers Rights Program:** The State Department will
    expand  its “Promoting the Rights of Domestic Workers in Mexico”
    program to protect labor rights of domestic workers and support
    their transition to the formal workforce.  This $1 million project
    will also support exchanges between domestic worker organizations in
    Mexico and Guatemala.  Program activities include national and
    international-level advocacy for the rights of domestic workers;
    training and mentorship to build the knowledge and capacity of
    domestic worker organizations; legal assistance for domestic
    workers; training domestic workers on a variety of topics related to
    labor rights, leadership, and professionalization; and education for
    employers to formalize relationships with domestic workers. 

<!-- -->

-   **Women’s Digital Inclusion Initiative: ** The U.S. Mission to the
    Organization of American States (OAS), in partnership with the OAS
    Secretariat for Integral Development, will launch the $1.5 million
    “Economically Empowered Women for Equitable and Resilient
    Societies” project to increase the knowledge and capacity of women
    to effectively function in the digital economy, build sustainable
    livelihoods, and increase their participation in policymaking and
    leadership in their societies.  The OAS Secretariat for Integral
    Development will implement the 36-month project, in partnership with
    Meta, which aims to build the capacity of women-led small and
    medium-sized enterprises to digitize, build an online presence, and
    access financial services and international markets.  The initiative
    will benefit 18,000 women in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,
    as well as a select group of six Eastern Caribbean countries.
