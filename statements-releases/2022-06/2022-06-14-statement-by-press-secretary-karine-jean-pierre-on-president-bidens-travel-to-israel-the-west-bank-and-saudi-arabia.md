President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will visit the Middle East region
from July 13-16 to reinforce the United States’ iron-clad commitment to
Israel’s security and prosperity and attend a Summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council plus Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan (known as the GCC+3).
 He will also meet with counterparts from across the region, to advance
U.S. security, economic, and diplomatic interests.

The President will begin his travel in Israel, where he will meet with
Israeli leaders to discuss Israel’s security, prosperity, and its
increasing integration into the greater region.  The President will also
visit the West Bank to consult with the Palestinian Authority and to
reiterate his strong support for a two-state solution, with equal
measures of security, freedom, and opportunity for the Palestinian
people. 

The President will then travel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which is the
current chair of the GCC and the venue for this gathering of nine
leaders from across the region, at the invitation of King
Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud. The President appreciates King Salman’s
leadership and his invitation.  He looks forward to this important visit
to Saudi Arabia, which has been a strategic partner of the United States
for nearly eight decades.  

While in Saudi Arabia, the President will discuss a range of bilateral,
regional, and global issues.  These include support to the UN-mediated
truce in Yemen, which has led to the most peaceful period there since
war began seven years ago.  He will also discuss means for expanding
regional economic and security cooperation, including new and promising
infrastructure and climate initiatives, as well as deterring threats
from Iran, advancing human rights, and ensuring global energy and food
security.  The President looks forward to outlining his affirmative
vision for U.S. engagement in the region over the coming months and
years.  

This visit to the Middle East region culminates months of diplomacy and
follows the President’s meeting with ASEAN leaders at the White House,
his travel to the Republic of Korea and Japan, the Quad Summit, his
hosting of the Summit of the Americas last week in Los Angeles, and his
visit next week to Europe for the G7 and NATO Summits.
