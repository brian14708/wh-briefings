title: "FACT SHEET:\_President\_Biden Calls for a Three-Month Federal Gas Tax\_Holiday"
---
 
The price of gas is up dramatically around the world, and by almost $2
per gallon in America, since Putin began amassing troops on the border
of Ukraine. President Biden understands that high gas prices pose a
significant challenge for working families. That’s why he has taken
action in recent months to boost the supply of oil and gas, including an
historic release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and encouraging
oil companies and refiners to boost capacity and output to get more
supply on the market.  
   
Today, he is calling on Congress and states to take additional
legislative action to provide direct relief to American consumers who
have been hit with Putin’s Price Hike. Specifically, he is calling on
Congress to suspend the federal gas tax for three months, through
September, without taking any money away from the Highway Trust Fund.
And he is calling on states to take similar action to provide some
direct relief, whether suspending their own gas taxes or helping
consumers in other ways.  
   
***Federal Gas Tax Holiday***  
   
Right now, the federal government charges an 18 cent tax per gallon of
gasoline and a 24 cent tax per gallon of diesel. Those taxes fund
critical highways and public transportation, through the Highway Trust
Fund. But in this unique moment, with gas prices near $5 a gallon on
average across the country, President Biden is calling on Congress to
suspend the gas tax for three months – until the end of September – to
give Americans a little extra breathing room as they deal with the
effects of Putin’s war in Ukraine.  
   
The President is also calling on Congress to make sure that a gas tax
holiday has no negative effect on the Highway Trust Fund. With our
deficit already down by a historic $1.6 trillion this year, the
President believes that we can afford to suspend the gas tax to help
consumers while using other revenues to make the Highway Trust Fund
whole for the roughly $10 billion cost. This is consistent with
legislation proposed in the Senate and the House to advance a
responsible gas tax holiday.   
   
President Biden understands that a gas tax holiday alone will not, on
its own, relieve the run up in costs that we’ve seen. But the President
believes that at this unique moment when the war in Ukraine is imposing
costs on American families, Congress should do what it can to provide
working families breathing room.  
   
***State and Local Action***  
   
In addition to federal gas tax relief, the President is calling on state
and local governments to provide additional consumer relief. Already,
some states and local governments have acted: for example, in
Connecticut and New York, governors temporarily suspended their gas
taxes, and in Illinois and Colorado, governors delayed planned tax and
fee increases. And, around the country, in states like Michigan and
Minnesota, states and local leaders are considering a number of forms of
consumer relief – from temporary suspensions and pauses on state sales
tax on gas to consumer rebates and relief payments. The President
believes more states and local governments should do so.  
   
***Ongoing Actions to Blunt the Impact of the Putin Price Hike***  
   
Today’s announcements follow a series of actions the President has taken
to lower gas prices for American families.

-   The President announced the release of a record 1 million barrels
    per day from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which just last week a
    leading oil market analyst confirmed has been critical to keeping
    prices from rising even more.
-   He rallied international partners to join us, releasing a combined
    240 million barrels of oil on the market.
-   He expanded access to biofuels like E15—gasoline that uses a 15
    percent ethanol blend—to increase supply and lower prices at
    thousands of gas stations across the country.
-   He and his Administration are engaging with oil and refining
    companies to ask them to work with the Administration to bring
    forward concrete solutions that increase refinery capacity and
    output. Secretary Granholm is meeting with these CEOs this week.

  
Already, the United States produced more oil under the first year of
this Administration than it did under the first two years of the prior
Administration, and is on track to set new records next year. At the
same time, the President understands that our efforts to increase energy
production in the near-term must be coupled with medium- and long-term
efforts to transition our economy away from fossil fuels produced by
autocrats and to clean energy.
