President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to Schloss Elmau in southern
Germany on June 25 to attend the G7 Leaders’ Summit.  The President and
G7 leaders will discuss a range of the most pressing global issues,
including the G7’s unwavering support for a democratic, sovereign, and
prosperous Ukraine, economic and democratic resilience, tackling the
climate crisis, development infrastructure, global health security, and
the food and energy crisis caused by Russia’s war of aggression. On June
28, the President will travel to Madrid, Spain for the 2022 NATO Summit.
Allied leaders will endorse a new Strategic Concept to guide NATO’s
transformation over the next decade, from strengthening deterrence and
defense, to building resilience against transnational threats including
cyber and climate, to deepening partnerships with democratic partners in
Europe and Asia in order to strengthen the rules-based international
order.
