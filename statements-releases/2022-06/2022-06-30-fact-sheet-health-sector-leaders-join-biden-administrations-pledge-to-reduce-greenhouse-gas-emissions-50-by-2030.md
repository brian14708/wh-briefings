*Health Sector Steps Up to Protect Public Health and Lower Costs  
*  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that 61 of the largest
U.S. hospital and health sector companies responded to the
Administration’s [Health Sector Climate
Pledge](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/04/22/hhs-launches-pledge-initiative-mobilize-health-care-sector-reduce-emissions.html),
committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030. The new
commitments represent over 650 hospitals and thousands of other
providers across the country, and include plans to strengthen resilience
to climate change, protect public health, and lower costs. The health
care sector accounts for 8.5% of U.S. emissions, so these bold
commitments advance President Biden’s goal to reduce nationwide
greenhouse gas emissions 50-52% in 2030 and reach net-zero emissions in
2050.  
Today, historic commitments are being made across the health care
industry, including:

-   Two of the five largest US private hospital and health systems
    (Ascension and CommonSpirit Health) and the largest US public health
    system have pledged to halve their carbon emissions by 2030.

<!-- -->

-   Leading health sector suppliers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca have
    stepped up to achieve net-zero emissions ahead of the 2050 pledge
    timeline.
-   Major medical associations, including America’s Essential Hospitals,
    the American Association of Medical Colleges, and the National
    Academy of Medicine, have committed to taking climate action.

The full list of the 61 organizations is outlined below.

President Biden sees action on climate change as a public health
priority. Studies show that the increasingly dangerous consequences of
climate change are affecting public health, through more frequent and
intense severe weather, extreme heat, and threats to food and water
security. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to using every
available tool to protect public health, while moving full-speed ahead
with our mission to tackle the climate crisis, to create jobs, grow the
clean energy economy, and lower costs for families.

The Biden-Harris Administration launched the [Health Sector Climate
Pledge](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/04/22/hhs-launches-pledge-initiative-mobilize-health-care-sector-reduce-emissions.html)
on Earth Day 2022 through the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS). Since then, over 650 private and public hospitals and health
centers, along with pharmaceutical companies, medical device-makers,
suppliers, and group purchasing organizations have signed the pledge,
joining more than 200 federal hospitals and health facilities from HHS,
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Military Health System.
These organizations are also developing climate resilience plans for
facilities and communities, including plans to support individuals and
communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Today, the
White House and HHS are re-opening the Health Care Sector Pledge until
October 28<sup>th</sup>, 2022 to build on these historic commitments
ahead of the United Nations Climate Conference in November.

*Leading by Example to Advance Health & Climate Goals*

Last year, the Administration established the [Office of Climate Change
and Health
Equity](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ocche+at+hhs&cvid=a82857c4043e4517b778c450e385f0e4&aqs=edge..69i57j0j69i60l3.2674j0j1&pglt=43&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531)
at HHS to identify and address health disparities exacerbated by climate
impacts. Since then, the Administration has invested over [$8 billion in
the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/21/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-additional-385-million-to-lower-home-energy-bills-for-american-families/)
to help low-income Americans manage energy costs in the face of extreme
weather.

The VA has made substantial progress implementing its 2021 Climate
Action Plan, including incorporating climate resilience requirements
into construction standards, assessing the adequacy of critical supply
stockpiles to align with projected climate change impacts, and
developing agency wide strategies to address mission risk amplified by
climate change. Within its medical centers, VA has also successfully
initiated efforts to transition to zero-emission vehicles, is
accelerating efforts to increase energy and water efficiency, and is
expanding upon existing and new sources of carbon-pollution free
electricity.

Today, the Administration is announcing a series of new resources to
support the health sector in transitioning to clean energy, reducing
emissions, and building climate resilience:

-   **Federal Health Sector Emissions Reduction Resources.** HHS, with
    contributions from the Department of Energy (DOE), the Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Housing and Urban
    Development (HUD) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), is
    launching the “Accelerating Healthcare Sector Action on Climate
    Change and Health Equity” webinar series to provide education and
    training on sustainable infrastructure financing, climate emergency
    preparedness, and emissions tracking from the health sector supply
    chain.  
-   **Federal Health Network on Decarbonization Best Practices.** The
    VA, Military Health System, and Indian Health Service are launching
    a coalition to exchange best practices on emissions reduction and
    climate resilience with a plan to share their learning with
    private-sector organizations.  
-   **National Research Forum on Climate Impacts and Heart Health.** HHS
    is launching *The Million Hearts Climate Change & Cardiovascular
    Disease Collaborative (CCC)*, a national forum for health care
    organizations to learn about climate change and the effects of air
    pollution on cardiovascular health, and to review evidence-based
    interventions to address those threats.   
-   **Health Sector Emissions Assessment Toolkit.** HHS’s Agency for
    Health Care Research Quality (AHRQ) will release a suite of
    resources to facilitate consistent measurement and reporting of
    health facility emissions data and to provide guidance on
    transitioning to greener models of care delivery.  
-   **Federal Funding for Climate Smart Health Facilities.** The
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the Green
    Mortgage Insurance Premium which will provide incentives for ongoing
    care facilities to implement energy and water efficiency upgrades.
    This program will lower costs for renovation and rehabilitation of
    facilities and increasing the safety of the populations they serve. 

*Private Health Care Systems Leading the Way*

Private health care systems are taking up the mantle on climate action –
going beyond the HHS Health Care Sector Climate Pledge to achieve even
greater progress on climate resilience:

-   **Tackling Super-Polluting Medical Gases:** Providence Health,
    Advocate Aurora Health, and Children’s National Hospital have
    committed to reduce emissions from medical anesthetic gases used in
    surgical procedures by over 75% — keeping these dangerous greenhouse
    gasses from being vented into the environment. AstraZeneca and
    Chiesi Group are tackling emissions from fluorinated gases used in
    common devices like inhalers, with the goal of reducing their carbon
    footprint by at least 90%.  
-   **Investing in Clean Energy:** Blue Shield of California, NYC
    Health + Hospitals, AmerisourceBergen, Kaiser Permanente, Children’s
    National Hospital and others have constructed on-site solar arrays
    and other clean energy generation sources to reduce emissions and
    provide direct benefits for surrounding communities. Kaiser
    Permanente has added over 44 MW of on-site solar generation – enough
    to power 9,600 homes, while the energy from Children’s National
    Hospital will benefit communities through a solar program that will
    lower utility costs for 325 families by up to $500 a year.   
-   **Achieving Carbon Neutrality:** Seattle Children’s Hospital,
    Philips, Kaiser Permanente, and Blue Shield California have all
    surpassed their pledge commitment and already achieved carbon
    neutrality.  
-   **Building Climate Resilience in Vulnerable Communities:** Valley
    Children’s Healthcare, University of Utah, and CommonSpirit Health
    have developed and implemented detailed climate resilience plans
    that put the focus on communities most vulnerable to the impacts of
    climate change, because the cascading impacts on health such as poor
    air quality from wildfires, extreme heat, and increased instances of
    vector-borne diseases are hitting those communities first.  
-   **Increasing Transparency on Climate Costs-Impacts:** Vizient,
    AstraZeneca, and DaVita are leading the charge to ensure that
    company costs and accounting include risks to organizations from
    climate impacts through the Task Force of Climate Related Financial
    Disclosure. These actions will ensure that companies make
    climate-smart investments with information about how climate can
    disrupt health care supply chains, damage facilities or impact
    energy supply.
