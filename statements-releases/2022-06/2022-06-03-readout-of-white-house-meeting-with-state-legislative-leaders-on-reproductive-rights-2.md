title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Legislative Leaders on Reproductive\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director and
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director,
hosted a meeting with state legislative leaders in Kansas, Louisiana,
and North Carolina on efforts to defend reproductive health and rights.

Legislative leaders discussed the status of ongoing attacks in these
states on reproductive rights, as well as their efforts to protect
access to critical reproductive health care. On August 2, 2022, Kansans
will vote on a ballot measure that would strip the right to abortion
from the state constitution. The Kansas Supreme Court has twice ruled
that the Kansas state constitution guarantees the fundamental right to
abortion. Louisiana’s legislature will adjourn in a matter of days, and
multiple bills are currently circulating that would undercut women’s
rights. In North Carolina, ongoing work is required to protect access to
care.  White House Senior Officials thanked participants for their
leadership and efforts to defend reproductive freedom.

Today’s engagement follows [a meeting senior White House officials held
