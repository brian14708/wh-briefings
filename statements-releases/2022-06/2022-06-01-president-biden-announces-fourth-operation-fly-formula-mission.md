title: "President\_Biden Announces Fourth Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"
---
 
*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately 4.6
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of  Bubs Australia infant formula.
Additional deliveries will follow*.

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
two flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Bubs Australia
infant formulas from Melbourne, Australia to Pennsylvania and California
on June 9 and June 11 respectively. This delivery will include 380,000
pounds of Bubs Australia infant formula, approximately 4.6 million
8-ounce bottles. Additional deliveries of Bubs Australia Infant formula
will be announced in the coming days.  
   
Last week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the
agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Bubs Australia can
export infant formula. Under this increased flexibility, Bubs Australia
plans to export to the United States enough powdered formula to produce
27.5 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of several varieties of its
infant formulas, including Bubs Organic Infant Formula S1, Bubs Organic
Follow On Formula S2, Bubs Supreme Infant Formula, Supreme Follow On
Formula, Bubs Goat Milk Infant Formula S1, and Bubs Goat Milk Follow On
Formula S2.  
   
President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
are authorized to use Department of Defense (DOD)-contracted commercial
aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and
safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. Earlier today,
the President announced a third Operation Fly Formula mission to air
ship approximate 3.7 million 8-ounce equivalents of Kendamil infant
formula,  
   
In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis
facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers
can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the
U.S. market.
