title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on the Louisiana Abortion\_\
  Bill"
---
 
The Louisiana legislature has taken the latest step in a growing attack
against the fundamental freedoms of Americans. Louisianaâ€™s extreme bill
will criminalize abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest and
punish reproductive healthcare professionals with up to ten years in
prison. The President is committed to protecting the constitutional
rights of Americans afforded by Roe for nearly 50 years, and ensuring
that women can make their own choices about their lives, bodies, and
families. An overwhelming majority of the American people agree and
reject these kinds of radical measures.
