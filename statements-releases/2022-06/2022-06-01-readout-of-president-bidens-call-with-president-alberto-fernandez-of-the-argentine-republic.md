President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Alberto
Fernandez of the Argentine Republic in advance of the Summit of the
Americas. The President invited President Fernandez to visit Washington
in July to build upon active U.S.-Argentina engagement on bilateral,
regional, and global issues, specifically human rights, food insecurity,
climate change and energy, technological innovation, and critical supply
chains. The President also outlined his vision for a region that is
secure, middle class, and democratic, which is fundamentally in the
national security interest of the United States. The President
reiterated that the U.S. relationship with the Americas is based on
partnership, mutual respect, and a shared objective of promoting a green
and equitable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
