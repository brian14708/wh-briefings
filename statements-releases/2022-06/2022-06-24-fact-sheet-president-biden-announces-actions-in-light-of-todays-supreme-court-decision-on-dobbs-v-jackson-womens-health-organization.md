title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces Actions In Light of Today\u2019s Supreme\
  \ Court Decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health\_Organization"
---
 
Today, President Biden announced actions that his Administration is
taking to protect women who will face the grave consequences of today’s
Supreme Court decision. This decision expressly took away a
Constitutional right from the American people that it had recognized for
nearly 50 years – a woman’s right to choose, free from government
interference.

This decision will have devastating consequences in the lives of women
around the country.

The President made clear that the only way to secure a woman’s right to
choose is for Congress to restore the protections of *Roe* as federal
law. Until then, he has announced two actions the Administration is
taking to protect women.

**Protecting the Right to Seek Medical Care**

As the [Attorney General made
clear,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Justice%20Department%20will%20use,civil%20rights%20of%20all%20Americans.%E2%80%9D)
women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek the
care they need.

A person has the right to travel between states for whatever reason they
want – it is no one else’s business – especially the government’s. If a
woman lives in a state that restricts abortion, the Supreme Court’s
decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home to a state
that allows it.

If any state or local official tries to interfere with women exercising
this basic right, the Biden Administration will fight that deeply
un-American attack.

**Protecting Access to Medication**

The President directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to
protect women’s access to critical medications for reproductive health
care that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration—including
essential preventive health care like contraception and medication
abortion.

More than 20 years ago, the FDA approved mifepristone to safely end an
early pregnancy; this drug is also commonly used to treat miscarriages.
The American Medical Association and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote to President Biden and Vice
President Harris, asking the federal government to protect access to
this care. In the face of threats from state officials saying they will
try to ban or severely restrict access to medication for reproductive
health care, the President directed the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to identify all ways to ensure that mifepristone is as widely
accessible as possible in light of the FDA’s determination that the drug
is safe and effective—including when prescribed through telehealth and
sent by mail.
