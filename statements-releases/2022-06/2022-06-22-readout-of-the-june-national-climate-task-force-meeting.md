*Task Force Discussed Tackling Extreme Heat, Bolstering Resilience, and
Lowering Energy Costs*

Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the
12<sup>th</sup> meeting of the National Climate Task Force to discuss
President Biden’s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable Americans
from extreme heat, strengthening the nation’s resilience to extreme
weather events, and lowering energy costs for families.

The Task Force received a science briefing on this summer’s forecasted
extreme heat, drought and wildfires in the West and flood risk across
the East. The Task Force discussed how these climate and weather
extremes disproportionately impact historically disadvantaged
communities across America, and how the Task Force is taking action to
fight back by weatherizing homes; updating building codes to boost
resilience; setting flood-risk reduction standards to protect homeowners
and businesses; shielding workers from extreme heat exposure on the job;
increasing federal firefighters pay across the country to fight
wildfires; and accelerating construction of grid-strengthening clean
energy projects that will cut consumer costs.

In addition, the Task Force discussed efforts to leverage domestic
climate action to spur international efforts, including recent successes
advanced through the President’s action-focused [call to world
