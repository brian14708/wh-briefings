title: "President\_Biden Names Twentieth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing two new federal judicial nominees, both of
whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule
of law and our Constitution.

This is President Biden’s twentieth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his seventh slate of nominations in 2022,
bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 107.

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
