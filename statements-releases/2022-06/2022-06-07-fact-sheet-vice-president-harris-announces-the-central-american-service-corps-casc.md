title: "Fact Sheet: Vice President Harris Announces the Central American Service Corps\_\
  (CASC)"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced the Central American
Service Corps (CASC).  The CASC initiative was developed by public,
private, and philanthropic partners in response to the Vice President’s
Call to Action for northern Central America. CASC—a $50 million
initiative, which will be administered by the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID)—will provide young people in El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras with paid community service
opportunities, mentorship, and a path to future employment. Young people
are looking for meaningful opportunities to build their futures and CASC
is aimed at addressing the range of challenges youth face in the region.
By supporting life and job skills, offering hope, and building
confidence and a sense of belonging for youth, the CASC initiative will
generate leadership potential and help foster optimism among youth in
Central America that a better future is possible for themselves and for
their communities.  
   
This initiative is in support of the U.S. Strategy to Address the Root
Causes of Migration in northern Central America, which the Vice
President launched in July 2021.

Through CASC, youth will be offered opportunities to work in their own
communities on local priorities such as educational support and
tutoring, climate action, food security, green jobs, health education
and services, violence prevention, and other civic-engagement
activities.  
   
CASC will help address the drivers of irregular migration among those
most likely to migrate by engaging youth in local driven service
opportunities, providing a modest stipend, offering work and life skills
acquisition, and enhancing young people’s sense of rootedness and
commitment to their communities.  
   
Youth service programs harness the energy of young people to meet
critical local development needs, while providing them a pathway to
education, employment, and a sense of civic responsibility and
belonging.  Educated, healthy, employed, and civically engaged youth are
critical for driving economic growth, democracy, and prosperity.  
   
CASC programs will be funded in part through FY 2022 appropriations,
which included $50 million for the  Central America Youth Empowerment
Program.  The  initiative is a multi-sectoral effort that will benefit
from technical and financial support provided by a wide range of
stakeholders in the public, private, and philanthropic sectors.  
   
**<u>Partnerships</u>**  
   
USAID’s coordination of CASC will promote the development of a robust
network of youth service corps programs in Central America. It builds on
a collaboration between USAID, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and
Salvadoran NGO Glasswing International on a youth service pilot program
which launched in 2021 with $13.2 million provided exclusively by the
Buffett Foundation.  CASC also builds on a collaborative effort between
the Partnership for Central America (PCA) and Glasswing International to
implement a community service program for young adults in the region in
response to the Vice President’s Call to Action.  
   
Further, Peace Corps will draw upon its experience in partnering with
host countries Costa Rica, Paraguay, and Peru to help Glasswing and
other partners establish this service initiative.  The Inter-American
Foundation will leverage its broad network of civil society grantees and
partners in the region to support CASC.   
   
In addition, more than a dozen businesses affiliated with PCA that
collectively employ tens of thousands of people across the region have
committed to support CASC through such possible activities as matching
participants to potential jobs, training and mentoring, facilitating
financial inclusion efforts, and direct financial support.
