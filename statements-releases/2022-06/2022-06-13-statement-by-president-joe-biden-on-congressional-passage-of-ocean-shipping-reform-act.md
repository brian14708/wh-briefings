title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Congressional Passage of Ocean Shipping\
  \ Reform\_Act"
---
 
Lowering prices for Americans is my top priority, and I applaud the
Congress for passing the Ocean Shipping Reform Act on a bipartisan
basis, which will help lower costs for American retailers, farmers and
consumers. I want to thank Senator Klobuchar, Senator Thune,  Rep.
Garamendi, and Rep. Dusty Johnson for their leadership and helping drive
forward this important legislation.

In my State of the Union address, I called on Congress to address ocean
carriers’ high prices and unfair practices because rising ocean shipping
costs are a major contributing factor to increased costs for American
families. During the pandemic, ocean carriers increased their prices by
as much as 1,000%. And, too often, these ocean carriers are refusing to
take American exports back to Asia, leaving with empty containers
instead. That’s costing farmers and ranchers—and our economy—a lot of
money. 

This bill will make progress reducing costs for families and ensuring
fair treatment for American businesses—including farmers and ranchers. I
look forward to signing it into law.
