*$1 Billion from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Made Available to
Communities, First Tranche of $5 Billion to Help Communities Tackle
Water Contaminants*

President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that every American
deserves to drink clean water. But for too many communities across this
country, children and families are drinking water that is contaminated
with lead and dangerous chemicals. That is why the President and Vice
President unveiled a [plan to combat water
pollution](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-plan-to-combat-pfas-pollution/) and,
six months ago, launched the [Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/) outlining
how the Administration is leveraging $55 billion from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to replace all of America’s lead pipes. Together,
these plans represent how the President and Vice President have
activated an unprecedented effort to deliver clean water across America
and mobilized federal, state, and local investments to confront
contamination, protect public health, and advance environmental
justice.    
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new findings and
actions that will help to protect Americans’ drinking water from
contamination, including from “forever chemicals” like per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are a set of human-made
chemicals that can cause cancer and other severe health problems, pose a
serious threat across rural, suburban, and urban areas, and that
disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities. PFAS are considered
“forever chemicals” because they are environmentally persistent,
bioaccumulative, and remain in human bodies for a long time.  
  
**NEW PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION  
**  
First, EPA is publishing four new drinking water lifetime health
advisories for certain PFAS as part of the [President’s plan to combat
PFAS
pollution](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-plan-to-combat-pfas-pollution/#:~:text=Consistent%20with%20President%20Biden's%20commitment,from%20discharging%20PFAS%20into%20America's) and
the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) [PFAS
Roadmap](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-strategic-roadmap-epas-commitments-action-2021-2024). These
health advisories reflect the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
to follow the science and up-to-date public health
information. Specifically:

-   EPA is releasing *<u>interim</u>* updated drinking water lifetime
    health advisories for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
    perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) that replace those issued by
    EPA in 2016. The updated advisory levels are based on new science
    that indicates that some negative health effects may occur with
    concentrations of PFOA or PFOS in water that are near zero   
-   EPA is also releasing *<u>final</u>* health advisories for
    perfluorobutane sulfonic acid and its potassium salt (PFBS), and
    hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) dimer acid and its ammonium salt
    (“GenX” chemicals). In chemical and product manufacturing, GenX
    chemicals are considered a replacement for PFOA, and PFBS is
    considered a replacement for PFOS.  

**INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS TO ADDRESS WATER POLLUTION**  
  
Second, EPA is making available $1 billion in grant funding through
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help communities that
are on the frontlines of PFAS contamination, the first of $5 billion
through the Law that can be used to reduce PFAS in drinking water in
communities facing disproportionate impacts. These funds can be used in
small or disadvantaged communities to address emerging contaminants like
PFAS in drinking water through actions such as technical assistance,
water quality testing, contractor training, and installation of
centralized treatment technologies and systems.  
  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a historic $5 billion in a
new Emerging Contaminants in Small or Disadvantaged Communities Grant
Program for states to reduce PFAS and other contaminants in drinking
water in underserved communities. In total, the President’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law provides $10 billion in funding to specifically
address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in water.  
  
EPA will be reaching out to states and territories with information on
how to submit their letter of intent to participate in this new grant
program. EPA will also consult with Tribes and Alaskan Native Villages
regarding the Tribal set-aside for this grant program. This funding
complements $3.4 billion in funding that is going through the Drinking
Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) and $3.2 billion through the Clean
Water SRFs that can also be used to address PFAS in water this year.  
  
**  
TOOLS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERMMENTS**  
  
Third, in addition to these resources outlined above, the Administration
is outlining additional tools state and local governments can use to
address PFAS pollution and protect drinking water:

-   Implementing a recently-launched new [nationwide monitoring
    program](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-nationwide-monitoring-effort-better-understand-extent-pfas-drinking) for
    PFAS in water systems to detect more types of PFAS, at lower levels,
    in more drinking water systems;
-   Proactively using the EPA’s Clean Water Act federal permitting
    authorities to [restrict discharges of
    PFAS](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-04/npdes_pfas-memo.pdf) at
    the source and to obtain more comprehensive monitoring information
    on potential sources of PFAS; 
-   Developing a national drinking water standard for certain PFAS that
    will be proposed this fall; and
-   Publishing the results of water quality tests in non-DOD drinking
    water systems that are located near and downstream of military
    installations.

**ADDITIONAL COORDINATED STEPS TO TACKLE PFAS**  
  
The White House is coordinating a government-wide approach to emerging
science and policy in real-time. The Council on Environmental Quality
leads the Interagency Policy Committee on PFAS and the Office of Science
and Technology Policy continues to coordinate accelerated PFAS research
within the National Science and Technology Council’s Joint Subcommittee
on Environment, Innovation, and Public Health. Both groups continue to
assess the need for new policies and scientific research that result
from emerging information about PFAS. There will also be enhanced
coordination by senior leadership and staff from the Environmental
Protection Agency, Department of Defense, and Council on Environmental
Quality under the Interagency Policy Committee on PFAS concerning issues
around military installations and their communities to accelerate
solutions and increase transparency.  
  
Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to work with
Congress to secure the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request,
which includes $126 million for EPA to assess the impacts of PFAS on
human health and advance technologies needed to detect PFAS in water.
The Administration is also prioritizing prevention of contaminated water
supplies as part of the re-ignited Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we
know it which is a pillar of the President’s Unity Agenda for the
country.   
  
Outlined below is how the Biden-Harris Administration is leveraging
tools from across the government to **restrict**PFAS from entering the
nation’s water, air, land, and food; **clean up** PFAS pollution and
holding polluters accountable; and accelerate** research and
development **on PFAS science and solutions.   
  
***Restricting PFAS from entering Americans’ water, air, land, and
food:***  

-   **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** **is continuing to expand
    its testing of the food supply,**including expanding its PFAS
    analysis method development and announcing additional testing
    results from the general food supply and targeted testing of seafood
    as those results become available.  
-   **The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency
    (FSA) has amended the **[**Dairy Indemnity Payment
    Program**](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fsa.usda.gov%2Fnews-room%2Fnews-releases%2F2021%2Fusda-opens-2022-signup-for-dairy-margin-coverage-expands-program-for-supplemental-production&data=04%7C01%7C%7C3f988a7f1f5a407fccf508d9fd5dd53e%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C637819401718059648%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=%2BDVK%2BWMv8Mp5%2Fu2WMOQE7YubxyG2%2BGS7bSKM68w52RM%3D&reserved=0)** regulations
    to compensate dairy farmers **whose cows cannot be put on the market
    due to PFAS contamination.  
-   **The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is leading a set of
    initiatives to investigate and remediate PFAS and protect emergency
    responders, including the first-ever inventory of PFAS use and prior
    releases from its facilities, like fire-fighting foam and possible
    water source contamination.  
    **
-   **The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented a policy
    to eliminate the discharge of firefighting foam containing PFAS for
    testing purposes,** and has also provided funding for airports to
    use systems that do not require the discharge of foam. FAA is
    partnering with DOD on research on PFAS-free firefighting foam.

***Cleaning up PFAS pollution and to hold polluters accountable:***  

-   **In the coming weeks, EPA will issue a proposed rule to designate
    PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances **under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),
    which will enable EPA to leverage the full range of Superfund
    authorities, including requiring reporting of PFOA and PFOS releases
    and to hold polluters accountable by recovering cleanup costs.
-   **EPA has developed a **[**National PFAS Testing
    Strategy**](https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/national-pfas-testing-strategy) and
    has issued the first in a series of Toxic Substances Control Act
    (TSCA) test orders to require companies to conduct and submit
    testing PFAS.
-   [**EPA recently
    added**](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-adds-five-pfas-chemicals-list-regional-screening-and-removal-management-levels)** five
    PFAS to the list of Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) and Regional
    Removal Management Levels (RMLs),** which help EPA determine if
    further investigation or actions are needed to protect public health
    in locations where PFAS is detected.
-   **DOD will issue guidance in early summer to implement EPA’s
    recently updated Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) for PFAS across
    DOD’s PFAS sites nationwide.  **These lower values will incorporate
    the latest peer-reviewed science and will result in more sites
    moving forward in the cleanup process.  
-   **DOD continues to address its PFAS releases and has completed
    initial assessments at over 300 of 700 installations and started 168
    remedial investigations**, the next step in the cleanup process. DOD
    is also continuing research and demonstration on over 100 projects
    related to PFAS treatment technologies, sampling, analysis, and
    monitoring. 
-   **The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
    Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) have, since
    October of 2021, released six **[**PFAS exposure
    assessment**](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments.html)**reports **for
    communities located in Westfield, Hampden County,
    Massachusetts; [Berkeley County, West
    Virginia](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/berkeley-county-wv.html); [New
    Castle County,
    Delaware](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/new-castle-county-de.html); [Spokane
    County,
    Washington](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/spokane-county-wa.html); [Lubbock
    County,
    Texas](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/lubbock-county-tx.html);
    and [Moose Creek, Fairbanks North Star Borough,
    Alaska](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/fairbanks-north-star-borough-ak.html). 

***Accelerating the research and development of PFAS science and
solutions include:***

-   **ATSDR is partnering with EPA to expand on the environmental
    measurements gathered as part of ongoing PFAS exposure
    assessments.** The investigation will collect environmental samples
    to evaluate levels of PFAS in the indoor and outdoor environment
    that may contribute to elevated levels of PFAS in blood in study
    participants.   
-   **The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine
    (NASEM) **has been funded by CDC/ATSDR and the National Institute of
    Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)** to review the current
    evidence regarding human health effects of PFAS** that will help
    inform clinician guidance regarding PFAS exposure.  
-   **The National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing a
    new reference material, expected to be available by the end of the
    year, for PFAS in aqueous firefighting foams, a fire suppressant
    used in firefighting.** NIST is working with organizations including
    the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
    and the US Fire Administration on research to understand how much
    PFAS from the foams gets on fire-fighting gear and how PFAS is
    released, including exposure from use of Personal Protective
    Equipment, to help reduce a firefighter’s risk of being exposed to
    PFAS.
