President Biden met today with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic
of Korea and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan on the sidelines of
the NATO Summit. This was a historic trilateral meeting in which the
three Leaders discussed enhancing trilateral cooperation throughout the
Indo-Pacific, particularly in regard to addressing the evolving threat
posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s unlawful weapons of
mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. They also followed up
on their detailed and productive conversations in Seoul and Tokyo last
month. President Biden underscored the United States’ unshakable
commitment to the defense of both Japan and the Republic of Korea.
