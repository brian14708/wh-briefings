title: "President\_Biden Announces Ninth Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"
---
 
Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Bubs Australia infant
formula from Melbourne, Australia to Los Angeles, California on June 26
and to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 5. These two deliveries will
include in total approximately 320,000 pounds of Bubs Organic Infant
Formula S1, Bubs Organic Follow On Formula S2, Bubs Supreme Infant
Formula Supreme Follow On Formula, Bubs Goat Milk Infant Formula S1,
Bubs Goat Milk Follow On Formula S2, the equivalent of approximately 5.5
million 8-ounce bottles. The product will be available through Target,
Albertsons, Kroger, Walmart and other retailers.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Bubs Australia can export
additional infant formula into the U.S. Bubs Australia will import both
standard and specialty infant formulas to the U.S. including Bubs
Organic Grass Fed, Bubs Supreme A2 Beta-Casein Protein and Bubs
Easy-digest Goat Milk. Bubs plans to export approximately 27.5 million
8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. By
June 26, Operation Fly Formula will have completed 32 flights and
imported almost 19 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula.

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at whitehouse.gov/formula.
