title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and\
  \ Pacific Islander Leaders on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Yesterday, Erika Moritsugu, Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI)
Liaison, the White House Office of Public Engagement, the White House
Gender Policy Council, and the Office of the Vice President convened a
meeting with AA and NHPI leaders on reproductive health and rights.
Participants discussed the devastating consequences that
overturning *Roe v. Wade* would have on AA and NHPI communities, who
overwhelmingly support reproductive rights, which have been guaranteed
under *Roe v. Wade* for nearly 50 years and are integral to equality,
opportunity, and self-determination.  
  
Advocates highlighted the importance of using an intersectional
approach anchored on ensuring accessibility, language access, and
cultural competency; all crucial in reproductive freedom.   

Senior Administration officials highlighted the President and Vice
President’s commitment to supporting reproductive health and rights and
the Administration’s commitment to including the diverse AA and NHPI
communities in conversations on this critical issue and other key
priorities.  
  
Participants included representatives from:  
  
National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF)   
Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC   
Empowering Pacific Islander Communities (EPIC)  
RISE  
Asian Pacific Institute for Gender Based Violence (API-GBV)  
Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF)  
National Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations
(AAPCHO)
