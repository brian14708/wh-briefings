title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Additional Security Assistance to\_Ukraine"
---
 
The people of Ukraine continue to inspire the world with their courage
and resolve as they fight bravely to defend their country and their
democracy against Russian aggression. The United States will stand with
our Ukrainian partners and continue to provide Ukraine with weapons and
equipment to defend itself.  

Today, I am announcing a significant new security assistance package to
provide timely and critical aid to the Ukrainian military. Thanks to the
additional funding for Ukraine, passed with overwhelmingly bipartisan
support in the U.S. Congress, the United States will be able to keep
providing Ukraine with more of the weapons that they are using so
effectively to repel Russian attacks. This new package will arm them
with new capabilities and advanced weaponry, including HIMARS with
battlefield munitions, to defend their territory from Russian advances.
We will continue to lead the world in providing historic assistance to
support Ukraine’s fight for freedom.
