title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Disabled Activists on Reproductive\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Yesterday, the White House Gender Policy Council and the White House
Office of Public Engagement convened a meeting with Disabled leaders. 
Participants discussed how access to reproductive health care, including
abortion, is shaped by disability status and underscored the importance
of bodily autonomy, self-determination and health equity, including
culturally competent care.  Participants discussed the disproportionate
effect that Americans with disabilities will face if *Roe v* *Wade* is
overturned, and highlighted numerous barriers such as the lack of
accessible facilities and transportation.

During the conversation, participants also raised that the right to
parent is also a disability rights issue and that Disabled people have
the right to access services that will ensure they are able to parent in
their fullest capability.

Advocates stressed the importance of mobilizing the Disabled community
in support of reproductive freedom. White House officials affirmed that
participants were essential partners in the effort to protect
reproductive rights and invited advocates into continued dialogue.

Participants included:

-   Julia Bascom, Autistic Self-Advocacy Network
-   Lydia Brown, Autistic Women and Nonbinary Network
-   Giovanna Burno, Activist
-   Tory Cross, Be a Hero
-   Elena Hung, Little Lobbyists
-   Monica Porter, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law
-   Leslie Templeton, Disability Policy Consortium
-   Maria Town, American Association of People with Disabilities
-   Angelica Vega, Activist
-   Robin Wilson-Beattie, Activist
