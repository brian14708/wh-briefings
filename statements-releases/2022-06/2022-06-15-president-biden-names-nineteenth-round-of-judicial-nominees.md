title: "President\_Biden Names Nineteenth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing seven new federal judicial nominees, all of
whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule
of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and
professional backgrounds.

For example, if confirmed, this slate would include the first Latino to
serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, the first woman of color to serve on the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the first South Asian person to serve on
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the first
openly LGBT federal district court judge in Puerto Rico.  
  
This is President Biden’s nineteenth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his sixth slate of nominations in 2022, bringing
the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 105.  
  
President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
