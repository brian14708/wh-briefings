Torture remains a moral stain on the world’s collective conscience. That
is why today, 35 years after the United Nations Convention Against
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
came into effect, I am proud to re-affirm that the United States stands
unequivocally against this barbaric act. As one of the original drafters
of the Convention, the United States remains committed to eradicating
torture throughout the world.  
   
Any instance of torture is one too many, and yet every year countless
victims suffer this brutal violation of their human rights and dignity.
This year we have been shocked by the horrific acts committed by Russian
forces in Ukraine, including multiple, credible reports of torture such
as beatings, electric shocks, and mock executions. In Mali and Burkina
Faso, terrorist groups have been documented to have massacred and
tortured local populations, while in Mali and Central African Republic,
Kremlin-aligned Wagner mercenaries have reportedly employed similar
cruel and unlawful tactics. In the Americas, transnational crime
organizations, including cartels and gangs, have been reported as
torturing journalists, activists, and minorities, including LGBTQI+
individuals, as a tactic to sow fear and intimidation. In Burma, reports
document security forces torturing and killing those who support
democracy, including through electrocution, rape, and other forms of
sexual violence. Each of these examples tears at our humanity.  
   
Today, I reaffirm the United States’ dedication to eliminating torture
and supporting its victims. The United States has legally prohibited
torture in all of its forms, without exception. We also remain the top
contributor to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture,
which helps nearly 50,000 victims and their families receive medical,
psychological, legal, social, and other assistance necessary to rebuild
their lives. And this year, I submitted to Congress a budget that
requests the largest ever funding amount for the U.S. Survivors of
Torture Program in HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.  
   
When a government commits torture, it surrenders its moral authority and
undermines its own legitimacy. And, critically, when torture is
committed in the name of national security, it only emboldens and
multiplies enemies, fuels unrest, and leaves governments isolated
internationally.  
   
Today, and every day, let us stand in solidarity with survivors of
torture, while calling on all nations to end this inhuman practice.
