title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on\_Juneteenth"
---
 
One year ago, I had the great honor of signing legislation to establish
Juneteenth as a national holiday—the first new federal holiday since Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day nearly four decades ago. Juneteenth marks
both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation and a promise of a
brighter morning to come. It is a day of profound weight and power that
reminds us of our extraordinary capacity to heal, hope, and emerge from
our most painful moments into a better version of ourselves. Great
nations don’t ignore their most painful moments. They confront them to
grow stronger. And that is what this great nation must continue to do. 

But, it’s not enough to just commemorate Juneteenth. Emancipation marked
the beginning, not the end, of America’s work to deliver on the promise
of equality. To honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, we must not rest
until we deliver the promise of America for all Americans.

That is why Vice President Harris and I have appointed leadership in
the federal government that looks like America. Our Administration is
taking a whole-of-government approach to advance
equity and racial justice and address the lasting impacts of systemic
racism on Black communities. We have implemented initiatives
to expand economic opportunity for Black families, provided historic
support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, improved health outcomes for Black
communities, and taken important steps to protect voting rights, advance
police reform, and enhance access to justice.

This is a day to celebrate, to educate, and to act. As
we mark Juneteenth, my Administration will continue our efforts to root
out inequity from our country and institutions and ensure true liberty
and justice for all.
