title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Supreme Court Ruling on West Virginia\
  \ v.\_EPA"
---
 
The Supreme Court’s ruling in *West Virginia vs. EPA* is another
devastating decision that aims to take our country backwards. While this
decision risks damaging our nation’s ability to keep our air clean and
combat climate change, I will not relent in using my lawful authorities
to protect public health and tackle the climate crisis.

I have directed my legal team to work with the Department of Justice and
affected agencies to review this decision carefully and find ways that
we can, under federal law, continue protecting Americans from harmful
pollution, including pollution that causes climate change.

Since the Clean Air Act was passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress
in 1970, the landmark law has enabled both Democratic and Republican
administrations to protect and improve the air we breathe, cutting air
pollution by 78 percent even as our economy quadrupled in size. Yet
today’s decision sides with special interests that have waged a
long-term campaign to strip away our right to breathe clean air.

We cannot and will not ignore the danger to public health and
existential threat the climate crisis poses. The science confirms what
we all see with our own eyes – the wildfires, droughts, extreme heat,
and intense storms are endangering our lives and livelihoods.

I will take action. My Administration will continue using lawful
executive authority, including the EPA’s legally-upheld authorities, to
keep our air clean, protect public health, and tackle the climate
crisis. We will work with states and cities to pass and uphold laws that
protect their citizens. And we will keep pushing for additional
Congressional action, so that Americans can fully seize the economic
opportunities, cost-saving benefits, and security of a clean energy
future. Together, we will tackle environmental injustice, create
good-paying jobs, and lower costs for families building the clean energy
economy.

Our fight against climate change must carry forward, and it will.
