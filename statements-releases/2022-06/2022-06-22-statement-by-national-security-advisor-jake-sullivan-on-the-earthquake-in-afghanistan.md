title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Earthquake in\_\
  Afghanistan"
---
 
The United States is deeply saddened to see the devastating earthquake
that took the lives of at least 1,000 people in Afghanistan. President
Biden is monitoring developments and has directed USAID and other
federal government partners to assess U.S. response options to help
those most affected. The United States is proud to be the single largest
donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, and our humanitarian partners
are already delivering medical care and shelter supplies on the ground.
We are committed to continuing our support for the needs of the Afghan
people as we stand with them during and in the aftermath of this
terrible tragedy.
