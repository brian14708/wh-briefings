*The Vice President, U.S. Department of State, and the Partnership for
Central America (PCA), come together to announce private sector
commitments now total more than $3.2 billion*  
  

Vice President Kamala Harris today announced more than $1.9 billion in
new private sector commitments to create economic opportunity in
northern Central America, more than doubling the value of initial
private sector investments in response to her Call to Action.  As part
of her role addressing the root causes of migration from Central
America, in May 2021, the Vice President
[launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/27/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-a-call-to-action-to-the-private-sector-to-deepen-investment-in-the-northern-triangle/)
the Call to Action for businesses and social enterprises to make
significant commitments to promote economic opportunity for people in
the region. This is in support for the [U.S. Strategy to Address the
Root Causes of
Migration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Root-Causes-Strategy.pdf)
which the Vice President launched in July 2021. A summary of progress in
implementation of the Root Causes Strategy can be found

The announcement today builds on the announcement the Vice President
made in [December
2021](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-new-commitments-as-part-of-the-call-to-action-for-the-private-sector-to-deepen-investment-in-central-america-now-totaling-over-1-2-billion/)
of $1.2 billion in private sector commitments.  Aggregate commitments
under this initiative now total more than $3.2 billion.  Taken together,
these investments are creating an ecosystem of opportunity and helping
to provide hope for people in the region to build safe and prosperous
lives at home.    
   
The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that long-term development in
northern Central America requires more than just the resources of the
U.S. Government. For this reason, Vice President Harris called upon the
private sector to draw upon its resources and expertise to support
inclusive economic growth in northern Central America. Over the course
of the past year, the Vice President has convened CEOs and philanthropic
leaders to advance this effort, and will do so again on the margins of
the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles at events hosted by the
Partnership for Central America and Chamber of Commerce.  
   
**<u>New Commitments</u>**  
  
The following 10 companies and organizations announced major new
commitments today, joining 30 companies that have already invested since
the launch of the Call to Action in May 2021:  
   
**<u>Agroamerica</u>**:  Agroamerica, a family-owned sustainable food
and ingredients corporation, will invest more than $100 million in six
new projects that will generate 1,000 permanent, living-wage jobs in
northern Central America over the next 5 years.  Future projects include
a food ingredients refinery, a 600-hectares banana plantation, a large
avocado plantation and processing plant, and the expansion of a Natural
Ingredients Processing Plant.  Agroamerica expects to drastically reduce
food waste in the region while presenting an innovative business line
for small and independent producers of raw ingredients and tropical
fruits produced in Central America.  
   
**<u>COATL</u>**: COATL, a digital service firm, will invest $35 million
in El Salvador to expand rural access to high-speed internet over the
next 5 years by expanding and operating a highly reliable rural
broadband network over existing high-power electricity lines. This work
will allow equal access to a digital ecosystem in rural areas, enabling
online education, financial inclusion, and e-services.  
   
**<u>Fundación Terra</u>**:  Fundación Terra, an independent foundation
funded by contributions from Terra Inversiones, which works in the
energy, petroleum, retail, and real-estate sectors, will invest $24.5
million in new programs over 5 years.  These programs will support
secondary education, digital access, entrepreneurship, and environmental
conservation, including scholarships to tutor 40,000 students in El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in Math and Spanish, which will
promote financial inclusion.  
   
**<u>Gap Inc.</u>**: Gap Inc. is committed to sourcing in Central
America, and their current production in Central America supports an
estimated 8,200 manufacturing jobs in the region held primarily by
women. Gap Inc. plans to increase its sourcing in Central America by
approximately $50 million per year, for a total growth commitment of
$150 million by 2025, as part of its strategy to increase supply chain
resilience by nearshoring more production to the Western
Hemisphere. These increased purchases from the region will support an
estimated 5,000 additional jobs in Central America.  
   
**<u>Millicom</u>: ** Millicom, a telecommunications company, will
invest $700 million to expand and maintain its mobile and broadband
networks in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador over the next two
years.  This investment will advance Millicom’s efforts to accelerate
economic growth in the region via increased connectivity as penetration
rates for broadband in these markets are well below regional averages.
 In addition, Millicom’s investments will be made in line with the Race
to Zero, the UN-backed campaign aimed at promoting a healthy, resilient,
zero-carbon recovery.  
   
**<u>Pantaleon</u>**:  Pantaleon, a conglomerate including investments
in agroindustry and real-estate, will invest $9.4 million to fund the
initial phase of a 1,200-acre industrial park on Guatemala´s Southern
Coast.  Once completed, the park is expected to house a mix of
manufacturing, logistics, and distribution businesses, among others.  
   
**<u>SanMar</u>**:  SanMar, a U.S.-based apparel wholesaler, will
increase its purchases of products manufactured in northern Central
America by $500 million by 2025.  These purchases will support the
supply of products to SanMar’s over 60,000 customers, the overwhelming
majority of which are American small businesses engaged in domestic
light manufacturing.  The increased capacity required for this growth
will lead to the creation of 4,000 additional full-time jobs at Elcatex,
a Honduras-based apparel manufacturer owned in part by SanMar.   
   
**<u>Unifi</u>**:  Unifi, a company that produces recycled and synthetic
yarns, established its manufacturing and sales operation in El Salvador
(Unifi Central America) in 2010 and has been invested in El Salvador and
the region since then.  Unifi is making significant investments in the
footprint capacity and innovation of its El Salvadoran operation and has
committed to investing $15 million over the next five years to expand
capacity, improve efficiency, and reduce energy use.  The investment
includes new innovative texturing technology that will increase the
company’s polyester yarn production in El Salvador by 40% and support
continuous training and job growth in the region.  
   
**<u>Visa</u>**:  Visa will invest more than $270 million over the next
five years to expand financial inclusion and digital infrastructure,
with the goal of adding 6.5 million people and 1 million small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) into the formal financial system in Guatemala,
El Salvador, and Honduras. Visa will focus on helping the local
financial sector deploy innovative payment technology, improving
citizens’ financial capabilities while driving efficiencies in key areas
of the economy including: agriculture, digital disbursement of
government subsidies, and remittances, while also expanding financial
education for citizens and SMEs, thus increasing acceptance of digital
payments and bringing more people into the formal economy.  
   
**<u>Yazaki</u>:  **Yazaki North America, an automotive components
producer, will invest an additional $110 million to hire over 14,000 new
employees in Guatemala and El Salvador by the end of 2026.  This builds
upon a recent announcement to invest $10 million in a new factory in
Guatemala, which is scheduled to start production with its first 1,000
employees in January 2023.  Yazaki NA provides electrical wire harnesses
for General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, and other global automakers.  
  
**<u>Updates on Previously Announced Commitments</u>**  
   
Starting with just 12 companies and organizations, the Call to Action
now includes 40 companies and organizations that have made commitments
to invest in the region, representing financial services, textiles and
apparel, agriculture, technology and telecommunications, and
nonprofits.  In addition, the Call to Action has generated new
collaboration across participating companies, further boosting the
initiative’s impact.  
  
Highlights of progress to date include:

-   **Microsoft** announced in December that they have expanded
    broadband internet access to nearly 2 million people. The company
    anticipates reaching 3 million individuals across the region by
    July 2022. Additionally, Microsoft expanded on its initial
    commitment and will provide digital skills training for 1 million
    individuals by 2025.
-   **Nespresso** committed in May 2021 to support regional economies
    with a minimum of $150 million in investment by 2025. To date,
    Nespresso has signed over $100 million in contracts for coffee
    procurement, including the first-ever Nespresso coffee shipments
    from Honduras and El Salvador, which will increase incomes for
    thousands of farmers. 
-   **Accion** through its work with partners in northern Central
    America, has brought over 140,000 people living in Guatemala —
    including 90,000 women — into the formal financial sector.
-   **Davivienda** has brought over 201,000 individuals into the formal
    financial sector through expansion of digital services, signed a new
    Loan Portfolio Guarantee Agreement with the U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation and the U.S. Agency for
    International Development (USAID), and extended over $100 million in
    low-cost loans for housing and small businesses.

**<u>How to Respond to the Call</u>**  
  
The Call to Action is facilitated through a public-private partnership
between the State Department and the independent organization the
Partnership for Central America, in close coordination with USAID.
 The Call to Action’s six focus areas are intended to support long-term
development of the region, including: promoting a reform agenda; digital
and financial inclusion; food security and climate-smart agriculture;
climate adaptation and clean energy; education and workforce
development; and public health access. It serves as one component of the
Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive Strategy to Address the Root
Causes of Migration, which involves significant commitments of U.S.
government resources to support the long-term development of the
region—including by fostering economic opportunity, strengthening
democratic governance, combatting corruption, and improving security.
This approach will leverage commitments and resources from the
governments in the region, as well as partnerships with multilateral
development banks, international financial institutions, and other
partner countries.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration looks forward to increased collaboration
with private companies from around the world to build upon this Call to
Action in the months and years to come. The Administration welcomes
additional commitments to participate in this initiative and promote
economic opportunity in northern Central America. Vice President Harris
invites interested parties to visit the State Department’s website
