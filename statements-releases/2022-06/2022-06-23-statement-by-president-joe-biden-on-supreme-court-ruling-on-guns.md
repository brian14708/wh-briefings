title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Supreme Court Ruling on\_Guns"
---
 
I am deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court’s ruling in *New York
State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. *Since 1911, the State of New
York has required individuals who would like to carry a concealed weapon
in public to show a need to do so for the purpose of self-defense and to
acquire a license. More than a century later, the United States Supreme
Court has chosen to strike down New York’s long-established authority to
protect its citizens. This ruling contradicts both common sense and the
Constitution, and should deeply trouble us all.  
   
In the wake of the horrific attacks in Buffalo and Uvalde, as well as
the daily acts of gun violence that do not make national headlines, we
must do more as a society — not less — to protect our fellow Americans.
I remain committed to doing everything in my power to reduce gun
violence and make our communities safer. I have already taken more
executive actions to reduce gun violence than any other President during
their first year in office, and I will continue to do all that I can to
protect Americans from gun violence.   
   
I urge states to continue to enact and enforce commonsense laws to make
their citizens and communities safer from gun violence. As the late
Justice Scalia recognized, the Second Amendment is not absolute. For
centuries, states have regulated who may purchase or possess weapons,
the types of weapons they may use, and the places they may carry those
weapons. And the courts have upheld these regulations.  
   
I call on Americans across the country to make their voices heard on gun
safety. Lives are on the line.
