title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with State Legislative Leaders on Reproductive\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director,
convened a meeting with state legislative leaders from Colorado, New
Mexico, and Nevada on reproductive rights.

Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada have taken and will continue to take
critical steps to improve reproductive health care and protect access to
abortion. In the 2022 legislative session, Colorado passed the
Reproductive Health Equity Act, which codifies the right to make
reproductive health decisions free from government interference. In
2021, New Mexico repealed an abortion ban that had been in place since
1969, before the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Roe v Wade*.

This fall, Nevadans will also vote on an Equal Rights Amendment to the
state constitution, which would prohibit the denial or abridgement of
rights on account of an individual’s race, color, creed, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, ancestry or
national origin.

Legislators from all three states discussed specific policy measures
that would advance women’s reproductive health, including expanding
coverage of abortion care and protecting the safety and security of
doctors and clinics. They also discussed the need to prepare for an
anticipated surge in out-of-state patients seeking abortion care; after
Texas’s six-week abortion ban went into effect last September, some
clinics in the region experienced a [500%
increase](https://www.krqe.com/health/new-mexico-abortion-clinics-seeing-increase-in-texas-patients/)
in patients.

Senior Administration officials thanked the state legislative leaders
for their efforts to protect reproductive rights and expand access to
reproductive health care, and committed to working together in the
months ahead.

State legislative leaders from today’s meeting included:

-   Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro
-   Colorado House Majority Caucus Co-Chair Meg Froelich
-   Colorado State Senator Julie Gonzales
-   New Mexico House Majority Floor Leader Javier Martinez
-   New Mexico State Senator Shannon Pinto
-   New Mexico State Representative Micaela Cadena
