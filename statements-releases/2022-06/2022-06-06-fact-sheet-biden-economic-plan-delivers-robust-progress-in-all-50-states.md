title: "Fact Sheet: Biden Economic Plan Delivers Robust Progress in all 50\_States"
---
 
Today, the White House released new state-by-state fact sheets that
highlight several economic indicators —including state employment,
unemployment insurance claims, gross domestic product, supplemental
poverty, and vaccination rates—which demonstrate the robust economic
progress under President Biden’s leadership. This wasn’t by accident.
This is the result of President Biden’s plan to build the economy from
the bottom up and the middle out.  
  
When President Biden took office, our economy was in crisis and COVID-19
was wreaking havoc on our country. Thanks to his American Rescue Plan,
unemployment is near historic lows, the vast majority of Americans are
vaccinated, the number of adults with a [positive
outlook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202205.pdf)
on their overall financial well-being reached an all-time high last
year, the number of Americans relying on government unemployment
benefits has dropped by more than 90%, and new businesses are being
created at record rates.   
  
The fact sheets highlight our historic economic recovery strong
foundation to transition to stable and steady growth that works for
working families. Fact sheets for all 50 states are linked below.
