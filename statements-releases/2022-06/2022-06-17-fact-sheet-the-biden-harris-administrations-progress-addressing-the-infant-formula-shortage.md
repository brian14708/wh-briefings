title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Progress Addressing\
  \ the Infant Formula\_Shortage"
---
 
On Friday, June 17<sup>th</sup>, Vice President Harris will travel to
Dulles International Airport to announce the arrival of over 14,000
pounds of Kendamil infant formula—the equivalent of more than 200,000
8-ounce bottles of formula—that will be used to add more supply to
shelves. This shipment is the latest through the Biden-Harris
Administration’s **<u>Operation Fly Formula</u>**, a multi-agency
partnership through which the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the General Services
Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) ship infant
formula so it can get to store shelves faster.   
  
By this week’s end, Operation Fly Formula will have delivered the
equivalent of 13 million 8-oz bottles since its inception—4 million of
which were delivered this week alone. The shipment that the Vice
President announces on Friday was donated by United Airlines and
constitutes just one of ten international shipments of baby formula
facilitated through Operation Fly Formula for the week of June
13<sup>th</sup>, which also include:

-   **June 13:** A United Airlines flight arrived at Dulles
    International Airport from London Heathrow carrying Kendamil infant
    formula.
-   **June 14:** Two United Airlines flights arrived at Dulles
    International Airport from London Heathrow carrying Kendamil infant
    formula.
-   **June 15:** A United Airlines flight arrived at Dulles
    International Airport from London Heathrow carrying Kendamil infant
    formula.
-   **June 16:** A flight arrived in Columbus, OH, from Melbourne,
    Australia, carrying Bub’s Australia infant formula. And, a flight
    arrived in Louisville, Kentucky from Switzerland carrying medical
    specialty infant formula from Nestlé.
-   **June 18:** A United Airlines flight will arrive at Dulles
    International Airport from London Heathrow carrying Kendamil infant
    formula.
-   **June 19:** Two United Airlines flights will arrive at Dulles
    International Airport from London Heathrow carrying Kendamil infant
    formula.

Operation Fly Formula represents just one component of the Biden-Harris
Administration’s multi-pronged approach to ensuring families are able to
access safe baby formula. While there is more work to do, these
successes have meant more product on shelves and fewer families in
need.  
  
<u>***Additional Actions Taken to Get Formula Back on Shelves and
Increase the Supply of Infant Formula Quickly and Safely***</u>*  
*  
The Administration is executing an all-of-government approach to produce
more infant formula and get it on the shelf. The federal
government—including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Agriculture
(USDA), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Transportation (DOT),
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Defense (DoD), and the White
House—has worked around the clock to address the shortfall in infant
formula production while the Sturgis plant remains offline. The recent
actions described below build upon the prior actions taken by FDA and
USDA to address this shortage at its earliest stages.

-   **<u>Invoking the Defense Production Act:</u>** To ensure that
    manufacturers have the necessary ingredients to make safe, healthy
    infant formula here at home, President Biden has invoked authorities
    under the Defense Production Act (DPA). The DPA empowers the
    government to require suppliers to direct needed resources to infant
    formula manufacturers before any other customer who may have ordered
    that good. The Administration has already invoked this authority to
    direct firms to prioritize and allocate the production of key infant
    formula inputs like raw materials, formula ingredients and bottling
    and packaging materials. This will continue to help manufacturers
    increase production and speed up supply chains. To date, the
    President’s invocation of the DPA has resulted in three priority
    orders:
    -   Abbott Nutrition receiving priority orders of raw materials like
        sugar and corn syrup for infant formula, enabling a planned 25%
        increase production so they can manufacture at 100% capacity.
    -   Reckitt receiving priority orders for consumables like
        single-use products such as filters, which Reckitt expects will
        allow the company to expand production by 40%. 
    -   Cargill Inc. receiving priority on materials such as corn
        products, sweeteners, and oils to maximize production of
        formula. 
-   **<u>Cutting Red Tape to Increase Imports:</u>** The FDA is cutting
    red tape to increase the supply of safe, high-quality formula
    through increased imports. The FDA, with import inspection support
    from USDA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is encouraging
    infant formula manufacturers worldwide to take advantage of these
    flexibilities, and will continue to actively work with USDA, the UK,
    Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and European authorities to
    expedite entry for products made abroad, and FDA. The Administration
    has thus far approved nine applications, representing over 210
    million 8-ounce equivalent bottles eligible and committed for
    import, including:
    -   Bubs Australia will provide at least 1.25 million cans of
        several varieties of its infant formula from Melbourne,
        Australia, which will make at least 27.5 million 8-ounce
        bottles.
    -   Kendal Nutricare will provide at least 58 million
        bottle-equivalents of its routine infant formula from the UK.
    -   Nestle will provide approximately 33 million bottle-equivalents
        of Gerber Good Start Gentle formula from Mexico.
    -   Nutricia (Danone) will provide 5 million bottle-equivalents of
        its Neocate Infant DHA/ARA specialty formula from the UK.
-   **<u>Facilitating WIC Waivers for Families in Need:</u>** Earlier
    this month, the President called on WIC state agencies that were not
    yet taking full advantage of the of flexibilities available in WIC
    to act immediately to adopt any waivers that could help those they
    serve. Since then, all 50 states have acted, allowing greater
    flexibility for WIC families to get the formula they need.
     Additionally, thanks to Congress’ quick action, USDA will also have
    added flexibility to waive rules and allow WIC participants to
    purchase multiple brands of formula during supply chain disruptions
    or other crises. This new legislation will also require formula
    companies to demonstrate they have a plan in place to respond to an
    infant formula recall, including how they would prevent shortages.
-   **<u>Getting the Abbott Facility Reopened Safely:</u>** This past
    February, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the
    country—Abbott Nutrition—initiated a voluntary recall of several
    lines of powdered formula. This came after concerns about bacterial
    contamination at Abbott’s Sturgis, Michigan, facility after four
    infants fell ill and two died. The Sturgis plant closed as a result
    of the contamination. Since then FDA has entered into a consent
    decree with Abbott to ensure its facility can reopen safely. FDA is
    working with Abbott to ensure that the product manufactured at the
    Sturgis plant is safe for families. 
-   **<u>Cracking Down on Price Gouging:</u>** The DOJ is engaging with
    state attorneys general to encourage them to use their powers to
    monitor and address price gouging in the infant formula market, and
    urging them to devote more resources to monitoring predatory
    behavior in the market for infant formula, which states like New
    Jersey have recently announced. In addition, following President
    Biden’s call for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to use all its
    available tools to monitor and investigate reports of illegal and
    predatory conduct, the FTC launched an inquiry into the ongoing
    shortage for infant formula including examining deceptive,
    fraudulent, or otherwise unfair business practices that take
    advantage of families.
