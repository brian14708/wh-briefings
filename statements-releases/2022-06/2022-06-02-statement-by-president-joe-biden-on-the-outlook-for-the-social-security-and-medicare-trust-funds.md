title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the Outlook for the Social Security and\
  \ Medicare Trust\_Funds"

Today’s report from the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare
trust funds shows that the strong economic recovery driven by my
economic and vaccination plans has strengthened programs that millions
of Americans rely on and has put our nation in a better fiscal position.
The Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Funds will be
able to pay benefits on a timely basis for longer than previously
projected before the American Rescue Plan passed. The Trustees report
says that those improvements are a result in part of a faster recovery
in employment, earnings, and economic growth than previously projected.
Last month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that
the deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this year – the largest deficit
reduction in a single year on record – and that the deficit this year
will be lower than CBO projected before passage of the Rescue Plan.

While my economic agenda has put us in a better fiscal position –
cutting the deficit by the largest amount in a single year on record and
strengthening Social Security and Medicare – Congressional Republicans
have put forward a different approach. Led by Chair Rick Scott, their
plan would put these programs on the chopping block every five years.
That’s not the way to strengthen these programs. I will work with anyone
willing to have an open and honest conversation about growing our
economy, bringing down inflation, improving our fiscal position, and
strengthening the programs that millions of Americans rely on.
