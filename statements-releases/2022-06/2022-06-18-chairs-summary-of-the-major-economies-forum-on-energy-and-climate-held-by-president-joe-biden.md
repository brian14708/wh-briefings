title: "Chair\u2019s Summary of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Held\
  \ by President Joe\_Biden"

On June 17, 2022, President Biden convened his third Major Economies
Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) to build on the progress achieved at
COP 26 by further strengthening climate action while also addressing
urgent energy and food security concerns arising from Russia’s further
invasion of Ukraine.  Participants shared steps they are taking to
strengthen their national climate efforts, and many joined the United
States in initiatives to reduce methane emissions, speed the
commercialization of critical technologies, put more zero-emission
vehicles on the road, decarbonize ocean-based shipping, and increase
fertilizer efficiency and alternatives.  The initiatives will bolster
energy security and food security, speed the clean energy transition,
and accelerate efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, the European
Commission, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United
Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Vietnam, and the U.N. Secretary-General
participated in the virtual meeting.

Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry opened the meeting by
noting the valuable role the Major Economies Forum played in 2021 in
contributing to the progress achieved at the United Nations Climate
Change Conference in Glasgow (COP 26) and emphasizing the urgency of
building on that progress at COP 27 in November in Sharm el-Sheikh.

President Biden emphasized that, while COP 26 brought the world much
closer to a 1.5-degree Celsius limit on temperature rise, the world’s
leading scientists have since underscored once more, with increased
alarm, the rapidly narrowing window for decisive action to stem the
climate crisis.  In line with the United States’ “Implementation-Plus”
approach, the President called on countries to dedicate themselves to
implementing existing goals while undertaking additional efforts to
strengthen climate ambition.  Noting that the Glasgow Climate Pact calls
on countries to revisit and strengthen their 2030 Nationally Determined
Contribution (NDC) emissions targets as necessary to align with the
Paris Agreement temperature goal, he urged participants to share any
steps they are taking to update their targets.  The President also
outlined new initiatives in the energy, transportation, and agriculture
sectors and invited participants to join the United States in
undertaking them.

President Biden and President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt announced
that the United States and Egypt will partner on Adaptation in Africa,
including at COP 27, with a focus on tangible actions to improve
people’s lives and build resilience to a changing climate.

Leaders spoke to the imperative and urgency of further strengthening
action in this critical decade, including references to the importance
of countries updating NDC targets this year that are not yet in line
with the Paris Agreement temperature goal and to the need for submitting
or updating long-term strategies.  Many emphasized the link between
climate security and energy security, noting that Russia’s war in
Ukraine only highlights the need to accelerate the clean energy
transition and that renewable energy supports energy security.  Many
highlighted the importance of scaling up finance and investment and
underscored the economic and social benefits of a just energy
transition.  Leaders commended Egypt for its efforts to ensure the
success of COP 27.

With respect to 2030 NDC targets:

-   Australia noted that it submitted this week an enhanced NDC to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.
-   Chile announced that it will strengthen its NDC, aiming to bring it
    in line with the vital goal of keeping within reach a 1.5 degree C
    limit on global temperature rise.
-   Egypt announced that it is putting the finishing touches on an
    updated NDC, which will include specific ambitious quantitative
    targets in multiple sectors.
-   Indonesia indicated that it is in the process of updating its NDC.
-   Mexico intends to submit an enhanced 2030 NDC target in line with
    the Paris temperature goal ahead of COP 27.
-   Turkey said it will submit an updated NDC by the end of this year.
-   The United Arab Emirates announced that it intends to submit an
    enhanced 2030 NDC target this year.
-   Vietnam will enhance its NDC.

Participants also announced other steps to strengthen national and
regional climate efforts, including closing coal-fired power plants;
instituting and expanding carbon pricing; setting ambitious national
zero-emissions vehicle targets; setting ambitious national methane
targets and developing methane abatement plans; increasing renewables,
including through specific targets, incorporating climate assessments
into the development of national budgets; modernizing hydroelectric
plants; making large-scale investments in solar energy; pursuing efforts
in the agricultural sector to promote emission reductions and food
security; pursuing sustainable forestry initiatives; investing in
hydrogen and ammonia; promoting reliable supplies of clean energy
minerals and materials; strengthening national adaptation efforts; and
pursuing regional mitigation and resilience efforts.

With respect to new joint initiatives:

-   The United State and the European Union, building on the Global
    Methane Pledge (GMP) they launched last year, announced a new
    **Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway** , with Argentina, Canada,
    Egypt, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, and Norway as
    inaugural members.  The Energy Pathway aims to encourage all nations
    to capture the maximum potential of cost-effective methane
    mitigation in the oil and gas sector and to eliminate routine
    flaring as soon as possible, and no later than 2030.  The
    participants cover two-fifths of global gas production and
    three-fifths of global gas import volumes.  Countries and supporting
    organizations have announced $59 million in dedicated funding and
    in-kind assistance in support of the Pathway. With Egypt joining the
    Global Methane Pledge with respect to the oil and gas sector, 120
    countries have now joined the Pledge.
-   Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy,
    the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates expressed support
    for the **Clean Energy Technologies Demonstration Challenge** to
    raise $90 billion of public funding by 2026 to build
    commercial-scale demonstration projects that the IEA reports are
    needed this decade to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.  In
    support of this goal, the United States and the European Commission
    highlighted planned investments totaling more than $50 billion.
    Countries are to announce their specific investment levels and
    action plans at the Global Clean Energy Action Forum this September
    in Pittsburgh.
-   Canada, Chile, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy,
    Mexico, Norway, and the United Kingdom joined the United States in
    **a collective 2030 zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) deployment goal** of
    ZEVs comprising 50 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales by 2030,
    to include battery electric, fuel cell electric, and plug-in hybrid
    vehicles. 
-   Canada, Chile, the European Commission, France, Germany, Indonesia,
    Republic of Korea, Mexico, Norway, and the United Kingdom expressed
    support for the **Green Shipping Challenge**, which encourages
    governments, ports, maritime carriers, cargo owners, and others to
    come forward at COP 27 with concrete steps, such as producing
    zero-emission fuels or creating green shipping corridors, that will
    help put the international shipping sector on a credible pathway
    this decade toward full decarbonization no later than 2050.
-   The European Commission, Germany, and Norway expressed support for
    the **Global Fertilizer Challenge**, which aims to raise $100
    million by COP 27 to strengthen food security and reduce
    agricultural emissions by advancing fertilizer efficiency and
    alternatives.  The initiative will seek to ease pressure on
    fertilizer and natural gas supplies, lower nitrous oxide emissions,
    increase fertilizer availability and agricultural productivity, and
    reduce food insecurity globally by helping countries with high
    fertilizer usage and loss adopt efficient nutrient management and
    alternative fertilizers and cropping systems.

In closing remarks, Special Presidential Envoy Kerry said the
announcements made, including with respect to NDC enhancement and the
various new initiatives, will bring the world closer to keeping a 1.5
degree C limit on temperature rise within reach.  He noted that each
initiative addresses a different aspect of the climate challenge and an
area where countries can work together.  He stressed the need to move
away from business as usual and “break the mold.”  He urged leaders to
further strengthen the spirit of cooperation on the road to COP 27 and
beyond.
