title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Announces the Americas Partnership for Economic\_\
  Prosperity"
---
 
At the opening ceremony of the Summit of the Americas, President Biden
will announce the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, a
historic new agreement to drive our hemisphere’s economy recovery and
growth, and deliver for our working people. Accounting for 31.9 % of
global GDP, the Western Hemisphere is one of the most dynamic economic
regions in the world, and the United States’ ties with the rest of the
hemisphere are broad and deep.  

Still reeling from the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
Latin America and the Caribbean has seen the deepest economic
contraction of any region in the world. Income inequality is widening,
millions of people are being cast back into poverty, and global
inflation – made worse by Putin’s war in Ukraine – is straining
families’ budgets.  The Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity
will rebuild our economies from the bottom up and middle out.

Together with partners, we deepen our economic cooperation, focusing on
the largest drivers of middle-out growth, and shaping new tools for the
challenges facing us today and, in the decades, to come. We will
strengthen our supply chains to be more resilient against unexpected
shocks. We will foster innovation in both the public and private
sectors, so governments can better address society’s most pressing
challenges, and businesses can enhance their productivity. And we will
tackle the climate crisis by growing climate-related industries that
will give rise to high-quality jobs. 

As a high-standards approach that is built on shared values, this
partnership will support U.S. business and workers and support
hemispheric recovery, resilience, and stability across the Americas.
Following the conclusion of the Summit of the Americas, the United
States will hold initial consultations with partners in the hemisphere
and stakeholders on the following areas of focus:  

-   **Reinvigorating Regional Economic Institutions and Mobilizing
    Investment**. To deliver on our aspirations, we will work to pivot
    our public institutions and financing mechanisms to leverage far
    greater levels of private investment.  We will together reinvigorate
    the hemisphere’s regional economic institutions, such as the
    Inter-American Development Bank, including through reforms to drive
    climate ambition, social inclusion and private sector development
    with the possibility of future capital for IDB Invest, and ensure
    international financial and economic institutions adequately
    prioritize the region. We will also work to support countries that
    are host to large numbers of migrants or refugees, or who want to
    make ambitious reforms in line with the Partnership’s goals.

-   **Making More Resilient Supply Chains.** Our economic security rests
    on supply chains that are diverse, secure, transparent, and
    sustainable. We recognize the importance of diversifying and
    rebalancing our supply chains to minimize disruption risks.  As we
    work to create resilient supply chains, we will prioritize
    development of our workforce and take steps to ensure supply chains
    are transparent and free of exploitative labor conditions.   

<!-- -->

-   **Updating the Basic Bargain.** Public investments and innovations
    in public administration can make life better and fairer for our
    respective citizens.  We will explore how to broaden participation
    in the formal economy, including tax and anti-corruption measures,
    as well as cooperation and infrastructure investments in areas such
    as migration, education, health, unemployment and retirement,
    childcare, and women’s economic empowerment.

<!-- -->

-   **Creating Clean Energy Jobs and Advancing** **Decarbonization and
    Biodiversity**. In line with our climate goals and to support good
    jobs, we will work together to accelerate clean energy technology,
    more sustainable forest conservation and management, and low
    emission and resilient agricultural practices. We will work to
    decarbonize our economies, enhance biodiversity, and build
    resilience to climate impacts.  We will deepen cooperation on
    technologies and best practices, mechanisms to increase public and
    private investment, and explore technical assistance to advance
    quality infrastructure and programming.

<!-- -->

-   **Ensuring Sustainable and Inclusive Trade.** The pandemic has only
    underscored the importance of secure and resilient regional trade
    flows, as well as the growing role that digital technologies and
    services play in our economies. We will focus on how to better
    cooperate on customs facilitation, advance transparency and good
    regulatory practices, pursue high standards on the digital economy,
    responsibly support emerging technologies, build resilience in our
    energy and food supply chains, advance strong labor and environment
    standards, and incentivize corporate accountability and a race to
    the top to foster regional economic development.
