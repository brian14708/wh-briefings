title: "Fact Sheet: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces Action on COVID-\u2060\
  19 Pandemic Response and Improving Health Systems and Health Security in the\_Americas"
---
 
The COVID-19 pandemic took a devastating human toll on Latin America and
the Caribbean, taking the lives of more than 2.7 million people across
our hemisphere — accounting for more than 40 percent of global reported
deaths.  It showed us the many cracks in our global health systems and
underscored the importance of strong and resilient health systems for
the entire population, health security, and pandemic preparedness and
response, starting with a strong foundation based on cooperation,
transparency, and accountability. 

Today President Biden led leaders of the Americas in adopting an
“**Action Plan on Health and Resilience in the Americas.”**  The Action
Plan will help our partners prevent, prepare for, and respond to future
pandemic threats and other public health emergencies while also
expanding the equitable delivery of healthcare and public health
services to remote, vulnerable, and marginalized populations.  As
implementing this Action Plan will require additional investments in our
health systems, the Administration is proud to announce the **Americas
Health Corps**, a new initiative aligned with the recently
announced [Global Health Worker
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-global-health-worker-initiative/). 

The Administration remains committed to advancing pandemic response and
global health security and has prioritized additional activities in the
Americas for this year and into the future. These activities will help
the region better respond to the current COVID-19 pandemic and prepare
for future pandemics by building the capability to prevent outbreaks,
detect infectious disease threats, and respond effectively when
outbreaks occur.

**<u>Action Plan on Health and Resilience in the
Americas:</u>**  Leaders committed that this Action Plan — which will
strengthen our health systems and coordination, preparing us for future
health emergencies and improving regional coordination, transparency,
and accountability — will be fully in effect by 2030.  This work
requires close coordination among governments and engagement with the
private sector and civil society.  With this in mind, the Administration
is poised to launch the Economy and Health Dialogue of the Americas, and
looks forward to working with health and economy ministries to create
and implement the Action Plan in coordination with the private sector
and civil society.  Their efforts will strengthen public health and
health care systems, consider how to make access to public health
services and health care more equitable, and enhance pandemic
prevention, preparedness, and response while increasing economic
resilience in the region.

**<u>Strengthening the Health Workforce:</u>  **The U.S. Government
intends to continue and expand investments in the health workforce,
which is central to strengthening the resilience of health systems. The
U.S. Government and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) launched
Americas Health Corps — Fuerza de Salud de las Americas — which will
provide basic and specialized training to 500,000 public health, health
science, and medical professionals throughout the region within five
years.  In line with the Biden-Harris Administration’s Global Health
Worker Initiative, the Americas Health Corps will support the expansion
and training of a robust, resilient, and highly skilled workforce
capable of providing health services to all segments of society. The
Americas Health Corps will function as a consortium and partner with
academic institutions in the United States and throughout the Americas
region to leverage and expand existing U.S. Government and PAHO training
programs. It will serve as an opportunity to work together on promoting
the next generation of global health workforce leaders by identifying,
mentoring, and empowering professionals and community health workers,
which will strengthen and expand health system capacity and equitable
access to health systems in the region.  ****

**<u>United States COVID-19 Response in the Americas:</u>  **As the
Americas face a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the threat of new
variants, the U.S. Government remains committed to ending the acute
phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting recovery in the region.
During the Second Global COVID-19 Summit on May 12, 2022, the U.S.
Government reiterated its commitment to get shots into arms, enhance
access to testing and treatment, protect the health workforce, and
finance and build health security for future pandemics and other health
crises. The Summit raised more than $3.2 billion in new commitments, yet
significant gaps remain.

-   **Vaccinating the Americas**: In support of the global effort to
    vaccinate 70 percent of the population in all countries, the U.S.
    Government has donated more than 65 million doses of COVID-19
    vaccines to countries across Latin America and the Caribbean and
    invested more than $94 million in complementary assistance to expand
    access to COVID-19 vaccinations and ensure safe delivery,
    distribution, and administration of these vaccines.  As part of the
    whole-of-government Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global
    VAX), the United States will continue to help ensure vaccination of
    eligible populations, with an emphasis on countries where coverage
    remains well below the regional average, by:
    -   Leveraging long-standing U.S. Government health investments,
        such as the United States President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS
        Relief (PEPFAR), to strengthen systems needed for vaccine
        delivery and to get shots in arms;

    <!-- -->

    -   Establishing vaccination sites, including mobile units, to
        expand access to vaccines;

    <!-- -->

    -   Fighting misinformation and disinformation to increase vaccine
        confidence and demand — including amongst rural, indigenous,
        migrant, and health worker groups where hesitancy may remain
        high; and 

    <!-- -->

    -   Evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccination
        programs. 

<!-- -->

-   **Saving Lives Now**: COVID-19 continues to take a toll on the Latin
    American and Caribbean region. The region has been one of the
    hardest-hit by the virus, with over 40 percent of total COVID-19
    deaths reported globally, despite making up only 8 percent of the
    world’s population. The U.S. Government is building off decades of
    investments in the region’s health systems. This includes:
    -   Continuing efforts to detect and characterize new variants of
        the virus that causes COVID-19; and 

    <!-- -->

    -   Fostering closer ties with other partners in the Americas,
        including PAHO, the Caribbean Public Health Agency, and
        countries’ Chief Medical Officers.

**<u>Strengthening Global Health Security in the Americas</u>: **The
Biden-Harris Administration understands that the health of one is
directly connected to the health of all. That is why the United States
is committed to continuing to engage with partners throughout the
Americas to strengthen our global health security by:

-   Expanding the number of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) experts on the ground at the CDC South America
    Regional Office and through a new CDC Central America and Caribbean
    Regional Office in Panama, and increasing engagement with regional
    organizations including detailing staff to the Caribbean Public
    Health Agency (CARPHA);
-   Expanding USAID’s global health security programs and staffing to
    seven countries in South America, Central America, and the
    Caribbean, as requested in the President’s Budget;
-   Expanding the U.S. Government commitment to the Global Health
    Security Agenda (GHSA) by adding Guatemala as an intensive support
    country, a group of countries that the U.S. Government has pledged
    to help meet the GHSA 2024 overarching target; and
-   Diversifying public health supply chains through bilateral and
    regional engagements and supporting regulatory capacity for a faster
    and more agile response to future biothreats.

These collective efforts will be complemented by expansion of health
security programs including:

-   Strengthening surveillance networks, laboratories, and data
    modernization in South and Central America through development and
    improvement of National Public Health Institutes;
-   Improving detection and response to infectious diseases by
    supporting acute febrile illness surveillance and increasing
    capacity for genomic surveillance in Central and South America;
-   Building partnerships in Costa Rica and beyond to implement a
    climate-based dengue early warning system through State’s regional
    science hub and Embassy Science Fellows;
-   Strengthening partnerships with private, non-governmental, and
    international organizations to improve global health security in
    intensive support countries and throughout the region;
-   Identifying and engaging new partners to join the GHSA Legal
    Preparedness Action Package to build capabilities in countries to
    map, develop, refine, and utilize legal frameworks and authorities
    to prepare for and respond to health emergencies; and 
-   Exploring the development of a South America One Health University
    Network through State’s regional science hub for South America and
    its Embassy Science Fellows program.
