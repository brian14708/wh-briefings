  s Virtual Roundtable with Human Rights Activists for LGBTQI+ Pride\_Month"
---
 
Today, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer participated
in a virtual roundtable with leading LGBTQI+ human rights activists from
around the world as part of the broader White House celebration of Pride
Month.  Mr. Finer emphasized the Biden-Harris Administration’s strong
commitment to protecting and defending LGBTQI+ human rights globally, in
line with President Biden’s February 2021 Memorandum on this issue and
June 15<sup>th</sup> Executive Order on Advancing Equality for LGBTQI+
Individuals.  Participating activists highlighted the resilience of the
LGBTQI+ community in the face of both incremental gains and increasing
repression in various contexts, as well as sustained societal
discrimination, violence, and criminalization. Activists also
highlighted increasing online attacks and state surveillance as a
priority concern.  Mr. Finer was joined by Jessica Stern, U.S. Special
Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons; Jay Gilliam, USAID
Senior Coordinator for LGBTQI+ Issues; and senior members of the
National Security Council staff.
