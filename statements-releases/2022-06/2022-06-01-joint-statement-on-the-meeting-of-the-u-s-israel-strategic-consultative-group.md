On May 31, 2022, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and
Israeli National Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata convened a meeting at
the White House of the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group (SCG).
They were joined by senior representatives from their respective foreign
policy, defense, and intelligence agencies. The officials committed to
coordinate on efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon
and toward deterring Iranâ€™s aggressive regional activities. They also
discussed economic and diplomatic steps to achieve these goals and
reviewed ongoing cooperation between the U.S. and Israeli militaries.
The U.S. and Israeli officials committed that, working toward the same
goal, they will remain in close coordination on the full range of issues
of mutual interest and to remain united against all threats to their
national security.
