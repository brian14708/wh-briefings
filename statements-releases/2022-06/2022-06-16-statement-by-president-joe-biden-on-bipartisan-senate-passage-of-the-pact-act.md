title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Bipartisan Senate Passage of the PACT\_\
  Act"
---
 
As part of the Unity Agenda that I laid out in my State of the Union
address, I called on Congress to make sure that veterans and their
families and caregivers impacted by toxic exposures finally get the
benefits and comprehensive health care they earned and deserve. Today,
the United States Senate answered that call by overwhelmingly passing
the bipartisan* Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT
Act of *2022­—the largest single bill in American history to address our
service members’ exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances.  

This bill will provide expanded access to health care and disability
benefits for veterans harmed by certain toxic exposures, whether in the
jungles of Vietnam or the mountains of Afghanistan. It will also let the
Department of Veterans Affairs move more quickly and comprehensively in
the future to determine if illnesses are related to military service,
and it will offer critical support to survivors who were harmed by
exposures, including from water contamination at Camp LeJeune.
Importantly, the bill includes the tools and resources to ensure that
the VA can effectively implement it. 

Above all, this legislation makes good on our sacred obligation to care
for veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. I want to thank
Chair Tester and Ranking Member Moran for their remarkable work to pass
the PACT Act, and I urge the House to swiftly pass this bill so I can
sign it into law right away.
