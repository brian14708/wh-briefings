*Record-Breaking Private U.S. Investments to Help Build 250,000 Chargers
Per Year, Create More Than 2,000 Jobs*  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting how President
Biden’s leadership on electric vehicles is catalyzing more than $700
million in investments from the private sector that will increase our
domestic capacity to manufacture more than 250,000 new electric vehicle
(EV) chargers each year, add at least 2,000 good-paying jobs, and make
EV charging more affordable, accessible, and equitable. The historic
private investments will follow the $7.5 billion from President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build a national network of EV
chargers, enabling convenient and uniform charging at home, work, and
across the country.  
  
President Biden’s vison, leadership and the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law have positioned the United States to lead the electric future and
make it in America. The President

automakers and autoworkers around an ambitious target for 50% of new
vehicles sold in 2030 to be electric, passed the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to [build a national network of
chargers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-proposes-new-standards-for-national-electric-vehicle-charging-network/)
for a seamless charging experience, and

the federal government’s purchasing power to procure more zero-emission
vehicles by 2027 and 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2035. The
President’s actions will make EV charging convenient, reliable, and
affordable for all Americans, including when driving long distances.  
  
Today’s announcements demonstrate how the President is catalyzing
private investment to boost our domestic manufacturing capacity,
enabling America to create a national network of chargers and create
thousands of new high-quality, union jobs building, installing, and
maintaining it. Today, the auto industry renaissance continues as the
private sector steps up to invest in American-made charging across the
country.  
  
**<u>KEY INDUSTRY INVESTMENTS</u>**

-   **Electrify America**, a leading network of fast chargers, today
    announced a new investment of $450 million into its charging network
    by Siemens, a global technology and electrification leader, and
    Volkswagen Group. These investments will support the rapid
    deployment of up to 10,000 ultra-fast chargers at 1,800 charging
    stations, more than the number of high-power chargers available in
    the United States today.  
-   **Siemens** is on track to build one million EV chargers over the
    next four years by investing more than $250 million in the U.S. in
    the past six months, including expansions of its Grand Prairie, TX
    and Pomona, CA manufacturing sites. Siemens has created 500 new,
    good-quality, union manufacturing jobs across the U.S to support
    critical power and EV charging infrastructure. And, they announced a
    $25 million minority stake investment in a US-based wireless
    charging company. Siemens has a new manufacturing facility coming
    online later this year and is introducing a new Buy
    America-compliant AC charger this fall.

**<u>ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY ACTIONS</u>**

-   **ABB E-mobility** is adding 125 jobs across its operations this
    year alone, including at two new facilities. In Sugarland, Texas,
    they are opening a training center where ABB will provide authorized
    service partners with hands on training for servicing and
    maintaining EV chargers. In Southern California, ABB E-mobility is
    opening a product development and research facility where it will
    design, develop, and test EV chargers for the U.S. market.  
-   **ChargePoint**, a leading EV charging network, is expanding its
    partnership with SMTC Corporation to expand DCFC production,
    establish a manufacturing line for Level 2 chargers at their
    Milpitas, CA, facility, and create approximately 250 new
    manufacturing jobs. The expanded facility will be able to produce
    10,000 DCFC dispensers and 10,000 Level 2 chargers by 2026.  
-   **FLO,** a North American EV charging network operator and smart
    charging solutions provider, announced a $3 million investment in
    its first U.S. assembly facility located in Auburn Hills, Michigan
    earlier this month. By 2028, the facility will produce upwards of
    30,000 Buy America compliant charging stations and fast chargers
    annually, create upwards of 730 jobs, and bolster Michigan’s economy
    by $76 million.  
-   **Tesla** is making *investments at its Gigafactory in Buffalo, New
    York* to support the deployment of new fast charging stations to add
    to its fast-charging network. More than 1,600 employees work at Giga
    New York producing the Tesla Solar Roof and Supercharger stations,
    which are capable of charging vehicles up to 250 kW. Tesla is
    expanding production capacity of power electronics components that
    convert alternating current to direct current, charging cabinets,
    posts and cables. Later this year, Tesla will begin production of
    new Supercharger equipment that will enable non-Tesla EV drivers in
    North America to use Tesla Superchargers.  
-   **Tritium**, who previously
    [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-ensuring-future-is-made-in-america/)
    a Tennessee EV charger manufacturing facility at a White House event
    with President Biden, is accelerating its production schedule to
    manufacture DC fast chargers in the third quarter of 2022. They also
    plan to build their first Buy America chargers in early 2023. This
    facility will create more than 500 local jobs and will be capable of
    producing up to 30,000 fast charger units per year.

**<u>WORKFORCE DEVELOPMMENT AND EQUITY</u>**

-   **IBEW**, as part of the Administration’s [Talent Pipeline
    Challenge,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/17/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-talent-pipeline-challenge-supporting-employer-investments-in-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/)
    pledged to train 10,000 of their members through the Electric
    Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP) by this August.
    Philanthropies, including the Hewlett Foundation, committed a total
    of $250,000 to support women and workers of color training for the
    EVITP-certification – with an emphasis on geographic diversity.    
-   **ChargePoint** recently partnered with the National Electrical
    Contractors Association (NECA) to prepare its nearly 4,000-member
    companies, all of which are IBEW unionized, to install EV charging
    infrastructure quickly and professionally in advance of the release
    of NEVI funding to States.  
-   **Volta**, a national owner operated ad-driven EV charging provider,
    expanded its “Charging for All” initiative, a multimillion-dollar
    commitment to ramp up equitable planning and charging investment.
    They will use PredictEV, a planning intelligence platform, to extend
    services to any state or city looking to maximize impact of public
    investment, while also delivering free media-space to State
    Departments of Transportation to ensure inclusive engagement.
