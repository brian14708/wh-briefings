title: "FACT SHEET:\_Vice President Harris Launches the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership\
  \ to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC\_2030)"
---
 
Today, Vice President Harris announced the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to
Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030).  PACC 2030 is the
Biden-Harris Administration’s new initiative involving fresh commitments
to — and integration of — climate adaptation and resilience and clean
energy programs across the Caribbean region.  The Biden-Harris
Administration recognizes the unique and evolving climate and energy
challenges facing Caribbean nations, and we are committed to working
together on solutions.  This comprehensive, adaptive, and goal-oriented
approach will support our Caribbean neighbors in addressing energy
security and climate adaptation and resilience with the urgency these
challenges demand.      
   
The Caribbean is on the front lines of the climate crisis, including sea
level rise that threatens low-lying islands and exacerbates storm surge
associated with hurricanes.  The climate crisis is also compounding the
challenges facing Caribbean nations as a result of COVID-19-related
economic disruptions.  Addressing energy security and building climate
resilience can unlock new opportunities and safeguard communities.  
   
PACC 2030 establishes a framework to elevate U.S. cooperation with
Caribbean countries to support climate adaptation and strengthen energy
security, while building the resilience of critical infrastructure and
local economies to the climate crisis.  PACC 2030 will serve as the U.S.
government’s primary mechanism for regional climate adaptation and
resilience and energy cooperation through 2030, as we work toward
meeting the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement and the 2030
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  
   
This approach recognizes that all countries in the region are vulnerable
to climate change and extreme weather events and require support to
address these challenges.  
   
Our collaboration under the PACC 2030 framework will advance two
strategic objectives:

1.  **Strengthening Energy Security:  **The United States will partner
    with Caribbean nations and regional institutions to promote stable
    access to clean energy resources and resilient energy infrastructure
    on a timely, sustainable, and affordable basis. This includes
    enhancing the resilience of the region’s energy systems to both
    natural and manmade shocks, from hurricanes to oil price spikes. 
2.  **Promoting Climate Adaptation and Resilience**:  The United States
    will collaborate with governments in the region to enhance the
    Caribbean’s adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change;
    facilitate access to climate-smart services, tools, and technical
    assistance; and support the design and development of
    climate-resilient infrastructure.

To achieve these objectives, PACC 2030 will organize its activities and
programs under four pillars:

1.  **Improving Access to Development Financing: ** Recognizing that
    access to financing is critical to achieving the region’s climate
    and clean energy objectives, PACC 2030 will work to expand existing
    access to project financing and unlock new financing mechanisms to
    support climate and clean energy infrastructure development in the
    region.  Key actions under this pillar will include increasing U.S.
    International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) financing for
    climate and clean energy projects in underserved Caribbean
    countries, as well as collaborating with multilateral development
    banks (MDBs) and multilateral climate and environmental trust funds
    to improve the policy environment and unlock access to
    additional infrastructure financing, for the Caribbean.
2.  **Facilitating Clean Energy Project Development and Investment: **To
    attract private investment in clean energy infrastructure and
    climate adaptation projects in the region, PACC 2030 will support
    the development of bankable infrastructure projects, promote sound
    regulatory policies, build project pipelines, and facilitate
    investment opportunities. ** **Key actions under this pillar will
    include the establishment of a new PACC 2030 Investment Facilitation
    Team and a new PACC 2030 Technical Assistance Program that can help
    mobilize private investment and partner with electric utilities and
    regulators to integrate more clean energy into Caribbean power and
    transportation systems.

1.  **Enhancing Local Capacity Building: ** With the goal of enhancing
    local capacity to assess, plan for, predict, mitigate, and respond
    to extreme weather events and related risks in a changing climate,
    PACC 2030 will increase access to and effective utilization of
    climate and weather information and decision-support tools.
     Additionally, PACC 2030 will establish clean energy and
    climate-focused educational exchanges, internships, and trainings to
    support pathways to careers in climate adaptation and clean energy.
     Key actions under this pillar will include providing access to
    global climate data and new forecasting tools, as well as expanding
    the 100,000 Strong in the Americas public-private partnership to the
    Caribbean.
2.  **Deepening Collaboration with our Caribbean Partners:**  Leveraging
    engagements at all levels — from leader-level Summits to technical
    working groups — to achieve strategic objectives, PACC 2030 will
    focus on translating high-level climate and clean energy political
    commitments to policy roadmaps, implementation plans, and concrete
    outcomes.  Key actions under this pillar will include collaboration
    with the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
    (CCREEE) and the Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation;
    participating in the Caribbean Sustainable Energy Forum to elevate
    technical engagement on clean energy and transportation development
    in the region; and collaboration with the Caribbean Disaster
    Emergency Management Agency, the Regional Security System, and the
    Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology on climate
    adaptation and resilience issues.
