At the G7 Summit, President Biden met with President Macky Sall of
Senegal. Senegal is the current chair of the African Union, and the two
presidents discussed the impact of Putin’s war against Ukraine on food
security in Africa. President Biden discussed the coming G7 announcement
on further efforts to support food security. The two also discussed the
G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment which includes a
new flagship project to invest in a new industrial-scale vaccine
manufacturing facility in Senegal which will have the potential to
produce hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines annually for COVID-19
and other diseases.
