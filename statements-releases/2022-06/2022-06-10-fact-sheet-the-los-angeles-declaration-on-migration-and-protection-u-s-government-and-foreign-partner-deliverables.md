title: "Fact Sheet: The Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection U.S. Government\
  \ and Foreign Partner\_Deliverables"
---
 
Today, President Biden joins leaders from across the Western Hemisphere
to present the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection at
the Summit of the Americas. The Declaration seeks to mobilize the entire
region around bold actions that will transform our approach to managing
migration in the Americas. The Declaration is organized around four key
pillars: (1) stability and assistance for communities; (2) expansion of
legal pathways; (3) humane migration management; and (4) coordinated
emergency response. 

In preparation for the Summit, the United States and other countries in
the region developed a suite of bold new migration-related deliverables.

**Pillar I: Stability and Assistance for Communities**

Addressing the unprecedented migration crisis in the region requires us
to rethink how we view multilateral development finance and how we
manage the strains on our economies. Globally, International Financial
Institutions (IFIs) and development assistance have been directed to
poor and low-income countries, designations which no longer apply to
most of Latin America and the Caribbean. The need for economic
stabilization and support is particularly important in countries housing
the more than six million refugees and migrants.

-   **Belize will implement in August 2022 a program to regularize
    Central American and CARICOM migrants** who have been living
    illegally in the country for a specified time.

<!-- -->

-   **Colombia’s leadership in responding to Venezuelan migrants and
    refugees with forward-leaning policies based on solidarity,
    humanitarian relief, and protection:** Colombia reaffirms its
    commitment to fully implement its announcement of temporary
    protected status for displaced Venezuelan migrants and refugees in
    its territory. As of June 10, it has granted regularization
    documents to over 1.2 million individuals, allowing them to work
    legally, access public and private services, integrate successfully,
    and contribute to Colombia’s economy and society. Colombia further
    reaffirms its commitment to grant regularization permits to 1.5M
    Venezuelan migrants and refugees in total, by the end of August
    2022.

<!-- -->

-   **Costa Rica commits to plan for a renewal of the special temporary
    complementary protection category scheme for migrants from
    Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba**, that have arrived prior to March
    2020, contingent on obtaining necessary financial resources, and to
    convene an international task force to secure additional direct
    support and financial resources to support its implementation.

<!-- -->

-   **Ecuador issued an executive decree that creates a path to a
    regular migration status for Venezuelans who entered the country
    regularly via an official port of entry, but who are currently out
    of status.** This process includes unaccompanied or separated
    migrant children and a migration amnesty. It contemplates the
    provision of identification documents for the regularization
    process, taking into account the current difficulties facing
    Venezuelan citizens. It intends to expand this process to include
    all Venezuelans.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will provide additional U.S. support for a
    crisis response mechanism on migration**. Working with Congress, we
    will provide an additional [$25
    million](https://www.state.gov/support-to-the-global-concessional-finance-facility-gcff/)
    to the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) housed at the
    World Bank to prioritize countries in Latin America such as Ecuador
    and Costa Rica in their newly announced regularization programs for
    displaced migrant and refugee populations residing within their
    respective countries.  The new funding would support registration
    processes, the extension of social services, integration programs,
    and would benefit host communities that have generously opened their
    doors to the most vulnerable.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will announce $314 million in new PRM and USAID
    funding for stabilization efforts in the Americas.**
    [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/jun-10-2022-united-states-announces-more-314-million-new-stabilization-efforts-venezuela)
    and the [State
    Department](https://www.state.gov/additional-314-million-for-u-s-humanitarian-response-to-the-venezuela-regional-crisis/)’s
    Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) will announce
    more than $314 million in new funding for humanitarian and
    development assistance for refugees and vulnerable migrants across
    the hemisphere. This includes support for socio-economic integration
    and humanitarian aid for Venezuelans in 17 countries of the region.

**Pillar II: Legal Pathways and Protection**

Expanding legal pathways for protection and opportunity is at the heart
of efforts to humanely address irregular migration in the Americas. The
goal is to *change the way* people migrate. Countries in the region have
strategically pegged priority legal pathway programs with the primary
reasons for migrating: (1) jobs; (2) protection; and (3) family
reunification.

-   **Canada’s resettlement and complementary pathways initiative:**
    Canada is welcoming record numbers of refugees and in line with
    Canada’s immigration levels plans. As part of these growing efforts,
    Canada will increase refugee resettlement from the Americas and aims
    to welcome up to 4,000 individuals by 2028, providing durable
    solutions to a number of refugees in the region. Canada recognizes
    the important support of the UNHCR and the IOM in the region. Canada
    will also look to promote its regular pathways in the region to help
    provide opportunities including to those in vulnerable situations.
    For example, Canada will advance a promotion and recruitment efforts
    related to its Francophone Immigration Program which may offer
    opportunities to French speaking newcomers such as Haitians with
    skills and experience, some of which may gave have been displaced
    due to the pandemic. 

<!-- -->

-   **Canada is addressing root causes and** **investing $26.9 million,
    in 2022-2023, in additional funding toward migration- and
    protection-related capacity building in the Americas.** This funding
    is supporting projects across Latin America and the Caribbean
    focused on supporting the socio-economic and labour market
    integration of refugees and migrants; improving border and migration
    management systems; contributing to the safeguarding of migrants,
    refugees and host communities’ rights; advancing gender equality and
    inclusive economic growth; and preventing and tackling migrant
    smuggling and trafficking in persons.

<!-- -->

-   **Canada expects to welcome more than 50,000 agricultural workers
    from Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean in 2022.** Canada is a
    strong supporter of labour mobility and continues to actively
    promote regular pathways for migration, including temporary foreign
    worker programs that respond to employer labour needs, to address
    our labour market gaps and as alternatives to irregular migration.

<!-- -->

-   **Guatemala approves new legislation to promote legal labor
    migration programs.** On June 1, the Government of Guatemala
    approved new legislation to incentivize fair recruitment and expand
    legal pathways for its citizens. The legislation exempts airline
    tickets from value-added and departure taxes for those traveling for
    temporary work abroad contracts obtained through the Ministry of
    Labor.  The new initiative is part of a broader set of Guatemalan
    programs and policies to expand access to labor migration programs,
    ensure ethical recruitment, and promote legal protections for
    Guatemalan workers.

<!-- -->

-   **Mexico will expand the existing Border Worker Card program to
    include 10,000 to 20,000 additional beneficiaries.** This program
    allows greater labor mobility to meet employer needs in Mexico,
    promote economic development in Central America, and provide an
    alternative to irregular migration.  

<!-- -->

-    **Mexico will launch a new temporary labor program providing work
    opportunities in Mexico for 15,000 to 20,000 workers from Guatemala
    per year.**  The Government of Mexico aims to expand eligibility for
    that program to include Honduras and El Salvador in the medium-term.

<!-- -->

-   **Mexico will integrate 20,000 recognized refugees into the Mexican
    labor market over the next three years.** With the support of UNHCR,
    the program would connect individuals with legal status as
    recognized refugees in Mexico to work opportunities in regions with
    labor shortages. A joint initiative with UNHCR, the private sector
    and the Mexican Government, both refugees and firms will benefit
    from successful integration into Mexico’s formal labor market.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will launch the development of a $65 million
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) pilot program to support U.S.
    farmers hiring agricultural workers under the H-2A program. **In
    collaboration with other agencies,
    [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/06/10/us-department-agriculture-invest-65-million-pilot-program)
    is exploring a multi-year pilot program funded by the President’s
    American Rescue Plan to provide grants to agricultural employers
    that hire farmworkers from Northern Central American countries under
    the seasonal H-2A visa program and agree to additional protections
    to benefit both U.S. and H-2A workers. The pilot will promote the
    resiliency of our food and agricultural supply chain and three major
    Administration priorities: (1) driving U.S. economic recovery by
    addressing current labor shortages in agriculture; (2) reducing
    irregular migration through the expansion of legal pathways; and (3)
    improving working conditions for U.S. and migrant agricultural
    workers. USDA will enter into a cooperative agreement with the
    United Farm Workers of America (UFW), which will work with relevant
    stakeholders, including farmers, farmworkers, farmworker advocates
    and unions, to ensure that the agency benefits from a wide range of
    views in designing this program.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will provide 11,500 H-2B nonagricultural
    seasonal worker visas for nationals of Northern Central America and
    Haiti.** To address labor shortages in key sectors of the U.S.
    economy and reduce irregular migration, the [Department of Homeland
    Security](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/03/31/dhs-and-dol-supplement-h-2b-cap-additional-visas-second-half-fiscal-year-2022)
    (DHS) and Department of Labor (DOL) made an additional 11,500 H-2B
    visas available in late May. These visas are dedicated for nationals
    of the Northern Central America countries and Haiti for this fiscal
    year. This is combined with new employer oversight provisions.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will roll out new Fair Recruitment Practices
    Guidance for Temporary Migrant Workers with the cooperation of major
    employers, including Walmart.** As the United States and various
    other countries expand temporary worker programs in the Western
    Hemisphere, President Biden recognizes the importance of
    safeguarding against exploitation of workers. This is why his
    Administration will issue first-of-its-kind “[Guidance on Fair
    Recruitment Practices for Temporary
    Workers](http://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20220610).”
    The guidance promotes best practices for governments seeking to
    increase participation in the H-2 visa programs and employers
    relying on these programs. The United States has also mobilized the
    support of major U.S. retailer Walmart, which notes the importance
    of H-2A migrant workers to U.S. agriculture and that the fair
    recruitment guidance aligns with the company’s own expectations
    around responsible recruitment.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will commit to resettle 20,000 refugees from the
    Americas during Fiscal Years 2023 to 2024.** This represents a
    three-fold increase from this year and reflects the Biden
    Administration’s strong commitment to welcoming refugees. The
    protection needs are significant in the Western Hemisphere. More
    than 5 million Venezuelans have been displaced in the Americas, and
    hundreds of thousands more people from other countries across Latin
    America and the Caribbean are also displaced \[across borders\]. As
    the United States scales up its resettlement operations in the
    Americas, we call on other governments to do the same. 

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will increase resettlement of Haitian
    refugees.** Reflecting the President’s commitment to support the
    people of Haiti, the United States also commits to receiving an
    increased number of referrals to the [U.S. Refugee Admissions
    Program](https://www.state.gov/u-s-refugee-admissions-program/) for
    Haitians. The United States encourages other governments to join us
    in strengthening legal pathways for protection and opportunity for
    Haitians and other displaced populations in the Americas.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will resume and increase participation in the
    Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program. **The Department of
    Homeland Security will announce the resumption of the Haitian Family
    Reunification Parole Program, which allows certain eligible U.S.
    citizens and lawful permanent residents to apply for parole for
    their family members in Haiti. Additionally, U.S. Citizenship and
    Immigration Services will take steps to increase participation in
    the program by reducing barriers to access. New invitations to apply
    under the program are anticipated to be issued in early fall 2022.
     Concurrently, the Department of State will increase efforts to
    process Haitian immigrant visas and reduce the existing
    backlog. State is in the process of assessing options to
    augment consular adjudicator staffing in Embassy Port-au-Prince and
    review additional operational efficiencies to decrease the immigrant
    visa backlog for Haitians.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will resume the Cuban Family Reunification
    Parole Program.** Last month, the United States announced the
    resumption of operations for the Cuban Family Reunification Parole
    Program (CFRP). CFRP provides a safe, orderly pathway to the United
    States for certain Cuban beneficiaries of approved family-based
    immigrant petitions.
    [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/06/09/fact-sheet-dhs-resumes-cuban-family-reunification-parole-cfrp-program-and-haitian)
    will resume processing cases this summer, work with the Department
    of State to begin interviews in Cuba by early fall, and build
    capacity to consider and process approved applicants, thus
    contributing to migration accord targets over the next two years.

***Observer States***

-   **Spain will double the number of labor pathways for Hondurans** to
    participate in Spain’s circular migration programs.

**Pillar III: Humane Border Management**

Securing borders with humane border management policies and practices is
essential to reducing irregular migration and collaboratively managing
migration across the hemisphere. The focus moving forward should be
on: 1) humane border enforcement; 2) return of migrants lacking
protection needs or other legal basis to remain; 3) facilitating returns
to countries of most recent residence or origin; 4) support for assisted
voluntary returns; and 5) strengthened bilateral and regional law
enforcement information sharing and cooperation to combat migrant
smuggling and human trafficking.

-   **The United States will announce a multilateral “Sting Operation”
    to disrupt human smuggling networks across the Hemisphere.** The
    President will announce a first of its kind campaign, unprecedented
    in scale, to disrupt and dismantle smuggling networks in Latin
    America. In the last two months, the United States, led by
    [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/06/09/fact-sheet-dhs-leads-first-its-kind-campaign-unprecedented-scale-foil-human),
    has surged over 1,300 personnel throughout the region and invested
    over $50 million to support these activities. Through the end of
    May, efforts have produced approximately 20,000 total disruption
    actions including arrests and prosecutions, seizures of property
    such as houses and vehicles used to hide and smuggle people, and
    criminal investigations. DHS assesses that this has led to 900 fewer
    migrants arriving at the Southwest border each day, and we are just
    getting started. The U.S. will seek to expand efforts with other
    governments in the region to improve information sharing, build
    capacity, and advance criminal investigations.

<!-- -->

-   **The United States will improve the efficiency and fairness of
    asylum at the border.** In late May,
    [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/05/26/fact-sheet-implementation-credible-fear-and-asylum-processing-interim-final-rule)
    and Department of Justice began implementing a new process that
    improves and expedites processing of asylum claims made by
    noncitizens subject to expedited removal, to ensure that those who
    are eligible for asylum are granted relief quickly, and those who
    are not are promptly removed. The new process is a further step
    toward a more functional and sensible asylum system that reduces the
    caseload in immigration courts while also providing individuals with
    a prompt and fair decision in their case. DHS is phasing in the
    implementation of this rule and when fully implemented, the rule
    will shorten the administrative process from several years to just
    several months.
