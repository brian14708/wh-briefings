  19 Vaccines for America\u2019s Youngest\_Kids"

Today is a day of huge relief for parents and families across America.
Following a rigorous scientific review, the Food and Drug Administration
has authorized the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under the age of
five. As early as next week, pending recommendations from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), parents will finally be able
to get their youngest kids the protection of a safe and effective
COVID-19 vaccine.  
  
We are the first country to protect our youngest children with COVID-19
vaccines, offering safe and highly effective mRNA doses to children as
young as six months old. My administration secured vaccine doses for
America’s youngest children and now with FDA’s authorization, we will
begin shipping millions of vaccine doses for kids to thousands of
locations parents know and trust—including pediatricians’ offices,
children’s hospitals, and pharmacies. As doses are delivered, parents
will be able to start scheduling vaccinations for their youngest kids as
early as next week, with appointments ramping up over the coming days
and weeks.  
  
Thanks to my administration and partners across the country, we have
come a long way in our fight against COVID these past 17 months. The
vaccines, treatments and other tools my Administration has made widely
available are protecting the American people from serious illness,
keeping them out of the hospital, and bringing down daily deaths due to
COVID-19 by 90 percent.  
  
Today’s decision will help build on this progress, giving parents
much-needed relief and peace of mind and helping our nation continue to
move forward safely. We look forward to hearing from the CDC on its
recommendations.
