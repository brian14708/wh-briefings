  Landmine\_Policy"

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing an important step
to limit the United States’ use of anti-personnel landmines. At the
President’s direction, the United States will align its policy
concerning use of these weapons outside of the Korean Peninsula with
key provisions of the Ottawa Convention, the international treaty
prohibiting the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of
anti-personnel landmines. Additionally, the President will prohibit the
development, production, and acquisition of anti-personnel landmines
prohibited under the Ottawa Convention, and will direct the Department
of Defense to undertake diligent efforts to pursue alternatives to
anti-personnel landmines that would be compliant with and ultimately
allow the United States to accede to the Ottawa Convention, while
ensuring our continued ability to respond to global contingencies.   
   
The world has once again witnessed the devastating
impact that anti-personnel landmines can have in the context of Russia’s
brutal and unprovoked war in Ukraine, where Russian forces’ use of these
and other munitions have caused extensive harm to civilians and civilian
objects. President Biden is committed to continuing the United
States’ role as the world’s leader in mitigating the harmful
consequences of anti-personnel landmines worldwide.  Since 1993, the
United States has invested more than $4.2 billion in more than 100
countries to promote international peace and
security through conventional weapons destruction programs.  We will
continue this important work as we take another step to reclaim American
leadership on the world stage.
