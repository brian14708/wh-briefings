  \ Women, Mothers, and Families"

Today, the White House released the Biden-Harris Administration’s
 [Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health
Crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Maternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf),
a whole-of-government approach to combatting maternal mortality and
morbidity. For far too many mothers, complications related to pregnancy,
childbirth, and postpartum can lead to devastating health outcomes —
including hundreds of deaths each year. This maternal health crisis is
particularly devastating for Black women, Native women, and women in
rural communities who all experience maternal mortality and morbidity at
significantly higher rates than their white and urban counterparts.

Under President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership, this
Administration is now taking the next step towards a future where the
United States will be the best country in the world to have a baby. The
Biden-Harris Administration is committed to cutting the rates of
maternal mortality and morbidity, reducing the disparities in maternal
health outcomes, and improving the overall experience during and after
pregnancy for people across the country. This commitment will require
bold, unprecedented action through a whole-of-government strategy.

To start, the Administration is calling on Congress to improve and
expand coverage by closing the Medicaid coverage gap and requiring
continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, as well as making
the significant investments included in the President’s FY23 budget to
reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.

The Administration also recognizes that addressing the maternal health
crisis in the United States requires immediate action. That is why, in
addition to urging Congressional action, the White House has mobilized
over a dozen federal agencies to develop the White House Blueprint for
Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis. The Blueprint outlines five
priorities to improve maternal health and outcomes in the United States:

• Increasing access to and coverage of comprehensive high-quality
maternal health services, including behavioral health services.  
• Ensuring women giving birth are heard and are decisionmakers in
accountable systems of care.  
• Advancing data collection, standardization, harmonization,
transparency, and research  
• Expanding and diversifying the perinatal workforce.  
• Strengthening economic and social supports for people before, during,
and after pregnancy.

**For women who are pregnant, postpartum, or hoping to become pregnant,
the actions in the Blueprint mean:**

• **Extended Postpartum Coverage:** States are encouraged to extend
Medicaid coverage from two months to one year postpartum, so that women
do not lose or have changes in their coverage during or soon after
pregnancy.  
• **Investments in Rural Maternal Care:** Rural health care facilities
will have more staff and capabilities to provide maternal care through
increased funding from the expanding the Rural Maternity and Obstetrics
Management Strategies Program and more robust training for rural health
care providers.  
• **A Maternal Mental Health Hotline:** Providers will be trained on
mental health during pregnancy, and women will have access to a
national, confidential, 24-hour, toll-free hotline if they are
experiencing mental health challenges.  
• **Substance Use Services:** Federal agencies will partner with
community-based organizations to ensure that addiction services and
people trained in substance use disorder during pregnancy are more
available.  
• **No More Surprise Bills:** Through the No Surprises Act, women are
now protected from certain unexpected medical bills, which may occur
during pregnancy, postpartum care, and/or delivery.  
• **Better Trained Providers:** More providers will be trained on
implicit biases as well as culturally and linguistically appropriate
care, so that more women are listened to, respected, and empowered as a
decisionmaker in their own care.  
• **Improved Maternal Health Data:** Through enhanced federal
partnerships with state and local maternal health data collection
entities, communities, hospitals, and researchers will have access to
better data to they can analyze poor outcomes during pregnancy and make
improvements to support healthy pregnancies.  
• **A More Diverse Maternal Care Workforce:** Federal agencies will
invest more in hiring, training, and deploying more physicians,
certified nurse midwives, doulas, and community health workers to
support women during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum. The federal
government will work to ensure these providers come from diverse
communities and backgrounds.  
• **Better Access to Doulas and Midwives:** The Administration will work
with states to expand access to doulas and midwives, and encourage
insurance companies to cover their services.  
• **Expanded Social Services:** Stronger partnerships between the
Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, and Health
and Human Services will help make it easier to enroll in federal
programs for housing, food, childcare, and income assistance, as we know
health care is only one part of what makes for a healthy pregnancy.  
• **Stronger Workplace Protections for Mothers:** Federal agencies will
promote greater awareness of workplace protections and accommodations
for new parents, like access to a private lactation room and break time
to pump.

The actions outlined in the Blueprint are just the latest in this
Administration’s multi-year effort to combat maternal mortality and
morbidity. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has
taken significant steps to address the maternal health crisis in the
United States, including:

• **Extending Postpartum Medicaid Coverage.** Through the American
Rescue Plan, states now have an easier pathway to extend Medicaid
coverage from two to twelve months postpartum. Currently, 14 states and
the District of Columbia have availed themselves of this opportunity,
extending coverage for more than 250,000 women.  
• **Announcing the New “Birthing Friendly” Hospitals Initiative.**
During the December Call to Action, the Vice President announced that,
through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Administration
will be deploying a “Birthing Friendly” hospitals designation—the first
federal hospital quality designation with a focus on maternal health.  
• **Hosting the First-Ever Meeting of Cabinet Officials on Maternal
Health.** In April of this year, Vice President Harris hosted the
first-ever meeting of Cabinet officials to discuss maternal health. This
meeting brought together twelve agency leaders including leaders from
the Departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, Veterans Affairs,
Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development to discuss ways that this
Administration could deploy the resources of the federal government to
tackle maternal mortality and morbidity.  
• **Leading the White House’s First-Ever Maternal Health Day of
Action.** In December 2021, the Vice President issued a nationwide Call
to Action for federal agencies, businesses, and non-profits to
collaboratively solve the maternal health crisis. During that event, the
Vice President announced that this Administration had secured millions
of dollars in private sector commitments aimed at improving maternal
health.

As we continue taking bold action to confront the maternal mortality and
morbidity crisis, we will continue to listen to people who are pregnant
and new mothers and ensure their feedback informs our approach to
improve maternal health and strengthen our health care system. With the
support of all parts of government and society, we can make this vision
a reality.
