title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Young Leaders on Reproductive Justice\
  \ and Civil\_Rights"
---
 
Yesterday, the White House Office of Public Engagement, the White House
Gender Policy Council, and the Office of the Vice President convened a
meeting with young leaders on reproductive health and rights.
Participants discussed the devastating consequences that
overturning *Roe v Wade* would have on young people, who overwhelmingly
support reproductive rights, which have been guaranteed under *Roe v.
Wade *for nearly 50 years and are integral to equality and full
opportunity.   Advocates highlighted the importance of mobilizing and
organizing young people in support of reproductive freedom, including on
college campuses.

Senior Administration officials highlighted the President’s commitment
to supporting reproductive health and rights and the Administration’s
commitment to including young people in conversations on this critical
issue and other key priorities.

Participants included:

-   Advocates for Youth
-   Generation Progress
-   Generation Ratify
-   Gen Z For Change
-   Planned Parenthood
-   Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity (URGE)
