title: "A Message to the Congress on the\_Continuation of the National Emergency with\
  \ Respect to the Western\_Balkans"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans
that was declared in Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001, under which
additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003,
and which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 14033 of June 8,
2021, is to continue in effect beyond June 26, 2022. 

The acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity, and the
situation in the Western Balkans, which stymies progress toward
effective and democratic governance and full integration into
transatlantic institutions, outlined in these Executive Orders, continue
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that
it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 13219 with respect to the Western Balkans.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. 

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
June 13, 2022.
