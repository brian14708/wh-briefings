The U.S.-EU Task Force on European Energy Security met virtually on June
22, 2022 convened by co-chairs Amos Hochstein, U.S. Senior Advisor for
Energy Security, and Björn Seibert, Head of Cabinet of the European
Commission President, and under the leadership of Ditte Juul Jørgensen,
European Commission Director General for Energy, and Melanie Nakagawa,
Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Climate and
Energy at the National Security Council.  The discussion focused on
reviewing progress since the March 25 Joint Statement by Presidents
Biden and Von der Leyen and charting its next steps. The sides denounced
Russia’s continued energy coercion of European Union Member States and
underscored their continued commitment to reduce dependency on Russian
fossil fuels by diversifying Europe’s energy supply and taking concrete
steps to reduce energy demand through energy efficiency, smart
technology deployment and greater use of renewable energy.
