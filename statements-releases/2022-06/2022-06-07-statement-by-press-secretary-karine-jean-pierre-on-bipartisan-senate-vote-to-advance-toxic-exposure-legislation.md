title: "Statement by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Bipartisan Senate Vote\
  \ to Advance Toxic Exposure\_Legislation"
---
 
Today’s bipartisan Senate vote to advance the *Sergeant First Class
Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022* is a critical step towards
delivering health care and benefits to veterans and survivors impacted
by toxic exposures. Veterans and advocates across the country have
spoken out about the importance of this legislation, which represents
one of the most significant and substantive expansions of benefits and
services in the Department of Veterans Affairs history. We also
appreciate the Senate working across the aisle to address outstanding
concerns and ensure that the Department has the support to effectively
implement it.  
   
We owe it to our veterans and their families to address these
consequences comprehensively. Unfortunately, it has taken decades to
understand the dangerous effects of harmful environmental
exposures—leaving too many veterans without the benefits and services
they need and deserve.  
   
America’s veterans are the best of us. Delivering for our veterans is a
key pillar of the Unity Agenda the President outlined at the State of
the Union – because we can all unite around supporting veterans who have
served our nation. President Biden looks forward to working with
Congress to swiftly enact this legislation and continue to uphold our
sacred obligation to support those who have served our nation, their
families, caregivers, and survivors.
