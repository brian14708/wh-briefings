I welcome the announcement today of a continuation of the truce in the
Yemen conflict.  The last two months in Yemen, thanks to the truce
brokered in April, have been among the most peaceful periods since this
terrible war began seven years ago.  Thousands of lives have been saved
as fighting receded.  For the first time in seven years, Yemenis are
able to fly from Sana’a to destinations outside Yemen. We have also
seen additional fuel ships moving through the port of Hudaydah, helping
ease Yemen’s fuel crisis.  The parties to the conflict have now extended
this truce for another two months, and it’s important that we work from
here to make it permanent.

Ending the war in Yemen has been a priority of my administration.  I am
grateful for the tireless work of my Special Envoy Tim Lenderking, and
the UN’s Envoy to Yemen, Hans Grundberg.  Their work, however, is not
finished.  I urge all parties to move expeditiously towards a
comprehensive and inclusive peace process.  Our diplomacy will not rest
until a permanent settlement is in place.

This truce also would not have been possible without cooperative
diplomacy from across the region.  Saudi Arabia demonstrated courageous
leadership by taking initiatives early on to endorse and implement terms
of the UN-led truce.  Oman played a central role in hosting and
facilitating dialogue.  Egypt and Jordan opened their airports to
flights from Yemen over the past month thereby enabling a key component
of the truce process.  

The United States will remain engaged in this process over the coming
weeks and months.  As we continue to support regional diplomacy to
de-escalate tensions wherever possible in the Middle East region, the
United States is also focused intensively on deterring threats to our
friends and partners.  Our friends can rely on the United States as the
security partner of choice.
