  \ Leadership of the Call to Action for Northern Central\_America"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris tonight hosted a dinner in Los Angeles with
business executives and leadership of the Call to Action for northern
Central America, her effort to bring together the private sector and
social enterprises to invest in and support the long-term development of
the region. This dinner is part of a series of engagements in which the
Vice President will participate on the margins of the Summit of the
Americas to further her work addressing the root causes of migration
from northern Central America. The Vice President believes that
governments cannot solve these problems alone, which is why she has
focused on bringing the private sector and civil society to the table.Â 
In advance of roundtable meetings tomorrow, the Vice President and the
business executives discussed how to further strengthen our
collaboration and strategize on next steps as we continue to create
economic opportunities for those in northern Central America. They also
reviewed progress made thus far, including progress on the investments
from 40 companies and organizations that have participated thus far in
the Call to Action.
