title: "Statement from the President on Unemployment Claims and Manufacturing\_Progress"
---
 
Today we received more data that, despite the global challenges we face,
America is on the move. Unemployment benefits have reached historic
lows. Since I took office, the number of Americans relying on
unemployment benefits  is now down 95%, and  our economy has added 8.3
million jobs

And, as we make the transition from an historic jobs recovery to steady,
stable economic growth, companies are investing in manufacturing in
America — strengthening supply chains, lowering costs for working
families, and securing our energy independence. During my first year in
office, the U.S. economy created more manufacturing jobs on average per
month than any other President in the last 50 years. Two new
announcements today will add to that historic manufacturing boom. Ford’s
$3.7 billion investment to create more than 6,000 good-paying,
union jobs in Michigan, Ohio, and Missouri building new electric
vehicles is great news for American workers. Stellantis’ agreement to
purchase up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium per year that CTR is
producing from geothermal brine in California’s Imperial County sets the
U.S. on a path to being a leading producer of sustainably sourced, low
carbon lithium. This builds on announced investments by dozens of
companies over the past year, from Intel’s $20 billion investment to
build semiconductors in America to Tesla, America’s largest manufacturer
of electric vehicles.  

This isn’t an accident – it’s the result of my economic plan to grow the
economy from the bottom up and middle out. My Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law was a major step forward in making America a place where businesses
invest and good jobs grow, including our national electric vehicle
charging infrastructure and battery supply chain. I urge Congress to
continue this transition toward steady and stable economic growth that
benefits all Americans, extend and expand incentives for clean vehicles,
chargers, batteries, and semi-conductors, and to pass the Bipartisan
Innovation Act to catalyze even more domestic manufacturing.
