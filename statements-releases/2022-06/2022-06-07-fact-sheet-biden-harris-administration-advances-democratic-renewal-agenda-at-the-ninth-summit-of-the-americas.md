title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Advances Democratic Renewal\
  \ Agenda at the Ninth Summit of the\_Americas"
---
 
Promoting democratic values and good governance has been a core
component of the Summit of the Americas since the first Summit in 1994,
with leaders at the Third Summit in 2001 articulating the principles
that would later be embodied in the Inter-American Democratic Charter
and pledging to further fight corruption that undermines democratic
governance at the Eight Summit in 2018. This Summit, with the theme
“Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future,” continue this
tradition. Our Administration and partners will push back against the
threats to our democracies by fortifying democratic institutions,
investing in civil society, strengthening independent media, and
following through on a regional digital transformation that is
transparent and equitable.  

-   **Implementing the Inter-American Action Plan on Democratic
    Governance**: The Administration announced the “[Presidential
    Initiative for Democratic
    Renewal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/09/fact-sheet-announcing-the-presidential-initiative-for-democratic-renewal/)”
    at the December 2021 Summit of Democracy, and the Department of
    State and USAID have dedicated over $477 million to support
    democracy, human rights, fighting corruption, and the rule of law in
    the Western Hemisphere. We will also advance the work of governments
    in the Western Hemisphere related to financial transparency and
    justice reform in line with the Summit for Democracy Year of Action.
    Our continued contributions will support the UN Convention Against
    Corruption (UNCAC) Implementation Review Mechanism and the Follow-Up
    Mechanism to the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption
    (MESICIC).    
-   **Investments in Civil Society**: A resilient, effective, and
    thriving civil society is an essential building block of democracy,
    fighting corruption, and inclusive, equitable development. Working
    with Congress, the Administration will invest approximately $75
    million over three years across 300 locally based, community-led
    organizations via the U.S. Government’s Inter-American Foundation to
    empower local civil society organizations, including
    underrepresented and underserved populations. Additional support
    will strengthen the Citizen Forum of the Americas to build civil
    society’s capacity to engage with governments and monitor
    implementation of Summit commitments, and expand the Citizen
    Corruption Observatory, which provides technical assistance for
    civil society’s anti-corruption efforts.  
-   USAID will launch the interagency **Voices (Voces) Initiative**,
    devoting $42 million to protect, defend, and promote civic space in
    Central America. These programs will focus on Promoting Digital
    Democracy and Countering Digital Authoritarianism; Promoting Freedom
    of Expression and Strengthening Independent Media; and Countering
    Criminalization and Providing Protection. The Unite States will work
    alongside like-minded partners—governments in the region and beyond,
    the international community, civil society, the private sector, and
    others—to advocate for protection of internationally recognized
    human rights such as freedom of expression and association.  
-   **Promoting Independent Media and Information Integrity: **The
    United States joined Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, the
    Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay as inaugural
    members of the Organization of American States (OAS) Group of
    Friends of Freedom of Expression and Journalism and will work with
    these countries to address attacks against media and efforts to
    silence critical voices. In parallel, we will provide seed funding
    and will endorse the OAS and U.S.-based non-government partners to
    launch the Center for Media and Information Integrity program. The
    United States will also expand its Digital Communications Network, a
    cross-section of digital leaders, developers, influencers,
    educators, and specialists to bridge the divide between digital,
    traditional media, and new media, to the Americas to enable local
    partners to better address disinformation.  
-   **Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment
    and Abuse: **Online harassment and abuse is a shared challenge to
    the full and equal participation of women and girls, one that spans
    hemispheres. Reinforcing our countries’ shared commitments to
    advancing the status of women and girls as a precondition of
    strengthening our democracies, Canada and Chile will join the United
    States as members of the [Global Partnership for Action on
    Gender-Based Online Harassment and
    Abuse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2022/03/18/launching-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/).
    First announced at the U.S. Summit for Democracy, the Global
    Partnership brings together a core set of partner countries to
    jointly commit to a Year of Action—in consultation with government
    partners, international organizations, academics, civil society, and
    the private sector—to improve the response to technology-facilitated
    gender-based violence and promote effective prevention strategies.
