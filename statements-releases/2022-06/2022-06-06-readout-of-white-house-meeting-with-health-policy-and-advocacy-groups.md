Last week, the White House Gender Policy Council, the White House
Domestic Policy Council, and the White House Office of Public Engagement
convened a meeting with national health policy and advocacy groups on
protecting access to health care, including access to abortion. 
Participants discussed the health care crisis that the nation will face
if *Roe v. Wade* is overturned and underscored that all individuals have
a right to make decisions about their health and well-being.  They also
discussed access to reproductive health care as an issue of health
equity and economic security and highlighted the disproportionate impact
that restrictions have on underserved communities. Administration
officials affirmed the President’s strong commitment to reproductive
rights and committed to continued engagement and partnership with these
groups.Participants included representatives from:

-   Center for American Progress 
-   Community Catalyst 
-   Families USA 
-   Protect Our Care 
-   Young Invincibles
