title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Support for Ukraine and Call with President\
  \ Zelenskyy of\_Ukraine"
---
 
This morning, I spoke with President Zelenskyy to discuss Russia’s
brutal and ongoing war against Ukraine. I reaffirmed my commitment that
the United States will stand by Ukraine as it defends its democracy and
support its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of
unprovoked Russian aggression.

I informed President Zelenskyy that the United States is providing
another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including
additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition
for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need
to support their defensive operations in the Donbas. We also discussed
Secretary Austin’s efforts in Brussels today to coordinate additional
international support for the Ukrainian armed forces.

We also remain committed to supporting the Ukrainian people whose lives
have been ripped apart by this war. Today, I am also announcing an
additional $225 million in humanitarian assistance to help people inside
Ukraine, including by supplying safe drinking water, critical medical
supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to
purchase essential items.

The bravery, resilience, and determination of the Ukrainian people
continues to inspire the world. And the United States, together with our
allies and partners, will not waver in our commitment to the Ukrainian
people as they fight for their freedom.
