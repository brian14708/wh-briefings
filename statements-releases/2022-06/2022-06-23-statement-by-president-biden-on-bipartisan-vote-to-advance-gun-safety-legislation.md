title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Bipartisan Vote to Advance Gun Safety\_Legislation"
---
 
When I made the heartbreaking visit to families in Newtown nearly ten
years ago, I promised them then that we would take action to help keep
our kids safe in the classroom.  
  
It’s taken a decade, because for too long Congress has failed to make
meaningful progress on gun safety reform. Our country has endured too
many tragedies since then, most recently with the horrific shootings in
Buffalo and Uvalde.  
  
When I traveled to Uvalde last month, I heard a clear message from
families there: do something. Since then, I’ve carried their message
forward – enough is enough, this time we have to do something.

Today, with the bipartisan cloture vote in the Senate, I am glad to see
Congress has moved significantly closer to finally doing something –
passing bipartisan legislation that will help protect Americans.

Our kids in schools and our communities will be safer because of this
legislation. I call on Congress to finish the job and get this bill to
my desk.
