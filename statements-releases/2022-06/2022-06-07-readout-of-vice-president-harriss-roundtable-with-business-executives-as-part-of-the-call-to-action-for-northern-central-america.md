sector and civil society to invest in and support the long-term
development of the region. The Vice President and the business
executives welcomed the announcement that the Call to Action has
generated more than $3.2 billion of investments in the region from 40
companies and organizations. They discussed progress made on previous
investments and next steps to continue to provide economic opportunities
for people in northern Central America. They discussed the innovative
public-private partnership that has been developed, and how companies
and organizations can collaborate to reinforce each otherâ€™s work across
multiple sectors.
