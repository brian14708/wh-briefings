title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on the 50th Anniversary of Title\_IX"
---
 
Fifty years ago, Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink—the first woman of
color elected to Congress—led the effort to write and pass Title IX,
which President Nixon signed into law. Title IX stated that no one
should be excluded from participation or face discrimination on the
basis of sex in any education programs or activity receiving federal
assistance. It consisted of just 37 words of legislative language, but
it transformed our nation.

Over the last fifty years, our nation has made monumental progress in
advancing equity and equality for all students, including by narrowing
gender gaps in sports, expanding opportunities in science and technology
fields, and protecting students from sex discrimination, including
sex-based harassment and sexual violence.

This is what America is all about: possibilities. Millions of women and
girls have benefited from the change that Title IX helped make possible.
More women and girls are participating and excelling in countless
fields—from professional sports, to science, math, and technology than
ever before. Their leadership, achievements, and success bear out the
legacy of countless women throughout history who fought hard for a place
at the table and for equal opportunity in all fields.

Yet there is more work to do. As we look to the next fifty years, I am
committed to protecting this progress and working to achieve full
equality, inclusion, and dignity for women and girls, LGBTQI+ Americans,
all students, and all Americans.

My Administration will continue to fight tirelessly to realize the
promise of Title IX—that every person deserves an opportunity to pursue
their education free from discrimination and realize their full
potential.
