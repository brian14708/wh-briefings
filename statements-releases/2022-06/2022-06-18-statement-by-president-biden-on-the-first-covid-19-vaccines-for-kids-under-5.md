title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the First COVID-\u206019 Vaccines for Kids\
  \ Under\_5"

Today is a monumental step forward in our nation’s fight against the
virus, with virtually every American now eligible for the protections
that COVID-19 vaccines provide. After a rigorous and independent
scientific review, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention have now authorized and recommended the
first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under the age of five.

For parents all over the country, this is a day of relief and
celebration. As the first country to protect our youngest children with
COVID-19 vaccines, my Administration has been planning and preparing for
this moment for months, effectively securing doses and offering safe and
highly effective mRNA vaccines for all children as young as six months
old.

We are ready to build on the progress of our historic vaccination
program that has resulted in over 220 million Americans fully
vaccinated, more than 100 million Americans boosted, and over 2 million
American lives saved. 

This coming week, parents will be able to start scheduling appointments
at places like pediatricians’ offices, children’s hospitals, and
pharmacies. Appointments will ramp up as more doses are shipped out, and
in the coming weeks, every parent who wants a vaccine will be able to
get one. As the vaccination program ramps
up, [Vaccines.gov](http://vaccines.gov/) will be live next week with
vaccine availability and appointments increasing throughout the week.

These vaccines are safe, highly effective, and will give parents the
peace of mind of knowing their child is protected from the worst
outcomes of COVID-19. If you are a parent who wants to protect your
child, I urge you to speak with your child’s pediatrician and make a
plan to get your child vaccinated as soon as the vaccine becomes
available to you.
