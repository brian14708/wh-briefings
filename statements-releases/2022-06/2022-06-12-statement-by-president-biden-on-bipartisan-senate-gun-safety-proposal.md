title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Bipartisan Senate Gun Safety\_Proposal"
---
 
I want to thank Senator Chris Murphy and the members of his bipartisan
group—especially Senators Cornyn, Sinema, and Tillis—for their tireless
work to produce this proposal. Obviously, it does not do everything that
I think is needed, but it reflects important steps in the right
direction, and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to
pass Congress in decades. With bipartisan support, there are no excuses
for delay, and no reason why it should not quickly move through the
Senate and the House. Each day that passes, more children are killed in
this country: the sooner it comes to my desk, the sooner I can sign it,
and the sooner we can use these measures to save lives.
