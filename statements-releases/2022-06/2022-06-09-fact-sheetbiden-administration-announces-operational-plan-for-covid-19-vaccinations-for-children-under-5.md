title: "FACT SHEET:Biden Administration Announces Operational Plan for COVID-\u2060\
  19 Vaccinations for Children Under\_5"
---
 
Driven by President Biden’s comprehensive COVID-19 strategy, including a
historic vaccination program that has gotten 220 million Americans fully
vaccinated, over 100 million people a booster shot, and made vaccines
free, widely available and convenient—daily COVID-19 deaths are down 90
percent since he took office.  
  
COVID-19 vaccines remain the single-most important tool that we have to
protect people against COVID-19 and its most serious outcomes. Next
week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) will consider whether to authorize and
recommend the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under the age of 5. If
FDA authorizes and CDC recommends one or both of the COVID-19 vaccines
for this age group, it would be a historic milestone in the nation’s
fight against the virus—and would mean nearly every American is eligible
for the protection that vaccination provides.  
  
Today, the Biden Administration is announcing an operational plan that
will ensure that vaccines—if authorized by FDA and recommended by
CDC—are readily available for our youngest kids and that we continue the
critical work of ensuring that all families know the benefits of getting
their children vaccinated against COVID-19.  
  
The Administration’s vaccination program for America’s youngest children
will focus on addressing the specific needs of this age group and their
families—recognizing that many parents and guardians will choose to get
their kids vaccinated through their pediatrician or primary care doctor.
As always, state and local governments, health care providers, federal
pharmacy partners, national and community-based organizations, and other
entities will be critical to the success of this historic, nationwide
effort. And, the Administration will continue to work with trusted
messengers, including pediatricians, to make a concerted effort to
ensure that all families have answers to their questions and know about
the importance of getting their children vaccinated.  
  
As the FDA and CDC conduct their independent review processes, the Biden
Administration is planning for all scenarios, including for the first
vaccinations to start as early as the week of June 20th—with the program
ramping up over time as more doses are delivered and more appointments
become available.  
  
For months, the Administration has been working with a range of
stakeholders to get ready. The Administration has made 10 million
vaccine doses available for states, Tribes, territories, community
health centers, federal pharmacy partners, and others to pre-order. If
the FDA authorizes a vaccine, the Administration will immediately begin
shipping doses across the country—and will launch an effort to ensure
that parents can get their youngest children vaccinated easily. 85
percent of children under the age of five live within five miles of a
potential vaccination site.  
  
**The Biden Administration’s plan includes:**  
  
**<u>Securing vaccine supply for our nation’s children.</u>** The
Administration has procured a significant supply of vaccines for this
age group, with 10 million doses available initially and millions more
available in the coming weeks. To ensure that we are able to reach a
broad range of pediatric providers—including those in smaller practices
and in rural settings—vaccines will be available in package sizes of 100
doses and will come with all of the supplies that health care providers
need to serve younger kids, including small needles.  
  
**<u>Making vaccinations available in convenient places parents and
families know and trust.</u>** Working with states, localities, Tribes
and territories, the Administration will make vaccinations for our
nation’s youngest children widely available at thousands of trusted,
accessible sites across the country—with 85 percent of children under
the age of five living within five miles of a potential vaccination
site. Vaccinations will be available at pediatricians’ and other
doctors’ offices, community health centers, rural health clinics,
children’s hospitals, public health clinics, local pharmacies, and other
community-based organizations. The Administration will also work with
state and local public health departments and others to ensure that
every child—including those who may not have a pediatrician or primary
care provider—has access to the vaccine. And, the Administration will
work with states and other entities to make vaccinations available at
convenient hours for children, parents and their guardians—including
after school and evenings, and on weekends.

-   Pediatricians and primary care providers: The Administration will
    make vaccinations available at thousands of pediatric and primary
    care sites across the country. Pediatricians continue to be one of
    the most trusted sources of information about COVID-19 for parents
    and will play a critical role in the nationwide effort to get our
    youngest children vaccinated—as they are the most common, trusted
    location for routine childhood vaccines. More than three in four
    children under the age of five receive their flu vaccine in a
    doctor’s office. Well-patient visits are also an opportunity for
    pediatric providers to conduct recommended screenings and provide
    counseling. The Administration is working hand-in-hand with states,
    localities, Tribes, and territories to prioritize these providers
    and ensure that they have the supply, resources, and support they
    need. The Administration will also continue to make vaccines
    available directly to health centers and rural health clinics, who
    together serve more than 2.2 million children under five
    nationwide.  
-   Children’s hospitals and health systems: The Administration will
    make vaccinations available at more than 100 children’s hospitals
    and health systems nationwide. Children’s hospitals play an
    essential role in our efforts to ensure access for our nation’s
    highest-risk kids, including those with obesity, diabetes, asthma or
    immunosuppression.  Through the Administration’s partnership with
    the Children’s Hospital Association, more than 120 children’s
    hospitals across 47 states and D.C. will provide pediatric
    vaccinations across their health care systems and in trusted
    community sites.  
-   State and local public health clinics and sites: The Administration
    will build on its longstanding work with state and local health
    departments across the country to ensure that we are reaching those
    hardest-to-reach, including families who may not have regular access
    to a pediatrician, through public health clinics. The Administration
    will make available federal funding to support states as they stand
    up and operate these clinics, and will work hand-in-hand with states
    to maximize vaccination coverage and availability, particularly in
    the hardest-hit, highest-risk communities.  
-   Local pharmacies: The Administration will make vaccinations for
    children available at thousands of local pharmacies nationwide
    through the federal pharmacy program. Participating pharmacies will
    offer vaccinations for this age group in a more limited set of
    locations, in many cases at clinics staffed by health care providers
    with primary care experience. And pharmacies will offer convenient
    hours and advanced scheduling to best meet the needs of parents and
    communities.

**<u>Leveraging federal programs to reach parents and families with
information and advance equity.</u>** As with prior vaccination efforts,
the Administration will leverage existing federal programs and
capabilities to ensure that we are reaching parents and families with
the information they need. And, as always, the Administration will
remain laser-focused on equity and making sure that we reach those
hardest-hit and most at-risk communities.

-   Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program: In addition to other
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, the Administration
    will engage families through the Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which serves
    over 6 million people, including almost half of all infants born in
    the United States. A longstanding partner to immunization programs,
    WIC settings across the country will be provided with tailored
    resources for talking to families about the COVID-19 vaccine and
    will continue providing families with referrals to vaccination
    providers, including those co-located with WIC settings.  
-   Head Start Program: Through the Administration for Children and
    Families at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the
    Administration will work with Head Start grantees to get critical
    vaccination information to the approximately 1 million families they
    serve. Head Start has always played a crucial role in improving
    health outcomes for families, and COVID-19 is no different. The
    Administration will support training and resources for grantees to
    learn about vaccines for kids under five and how grantees can talk
    to families about them, and it will ensure that any Head Start
    location is ready and able to provide vaccinations to its community
    gets the help it needs.  
-   Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV)
    Program: The Administration will engage families through HHS’
    Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV)
    Program, which each year reaches more than 140,000 parents and young
    children across the country that are at risk for poor maternal and
    child health outcomes. MIECHV home visitors will leverage these
    established relationships to help families learn more about COVID-19
    and the safety, efficacy, and benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and,
    upon request, will refer families to local vaccination sites.  
-   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs: The
    Administration will launch an effort to reach more than 800,000
    children age five and under supported by HUD programs, including
    children in households that receive housing-choice vouchers and
    children living in public housing and Section 8 housing. Building on
    successful campaigns with children in other age groups, these
    efforts will include education events and on-site vaccination
    clinics near HUD-supported housing where appropriate, in
    coordination with other vaccination locations in the community.  
-   Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP): The
    Center for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) will take steps to
    support and push the message about the importance of vaccinating the
    millions of children under 5 who are enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP.
    This outreach will involve engaging states, local jurisdictions, and
    stakeholders to get the latest information on vaccines for this age
    group to Medicaid beneficiaries and their families. This effort
    builds on the work that CMS has already done to require state
    Medicaid programs to pay health care providers for providing
    counseling visits to parents and guardians about the importance of
    kids’ vaccination—giving families the support they need to engage
    with trusted community providers.

**<u>Supporting education and engagement efforts to build trust among
parents and families.</u>** While many parents are eager to vaccinate
their youngest children, others have questions. To ensure that parents
and families have answers to their questions and information from
sources that they trust, HHS will work with a broad range of national
organizations to launch a national public education campaign that
reaches parents, guardians, and families with facts and information that
they need to make informed choices for both their youngest and their
older children.

-   The HHS COVID-19 Community Corps will reach parents and families
    about vaccinations for kids under the age of five. Launched last
    April to empower people and organizations to build vaccine
    confidence in their communities, the Community Corps now has over
    17,000 members, including health care, faith, rural, sports, and
    youth organizations. The ‘HHS We Can Do This’ campaign will provide
    a pediatric COVID-19 vaccination toolkit—in both English and
    Spanish—to trusted messengers, health care providers, and state and
    local organizations so they can reach people where they are
    in-person and online. HHS will also provide additional materials for
    stakeholders, including a superhero-themed toolkit with creative
    resources for hospitals and pediatricians. And, pending FDA
    authorization and CDC recommendation, the Administration also plans
    to release a new public service announcement (PSA) letting parents
    of children 6 months and older know that the new COVID-19 vaccines
    are available and offer one more way to keep their children safe.
    The PSA, filmed in both English and Spanish, will be distributed
    broadly to local television and radio networks, and would air in
    early July.  
-   American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family
    Physicians (AAFP), two leading medical, will provide a “Speaker’s
    Bureau” of pediatricians and family doctors who will lend their
    trusted voices to raise awareness, answer common questions among
    parents, and encourage vaccine confidence through community events,
    vaccine and health fairs, and other key opportunities to reach
    parents. AAP and AAFP will also work with HHS to co-brand a toolkit
    of resources geared toward pediatricians and primary care doctors,
    providing these and other health care providers the information and
    materials they need to support vaccine confidence among their
    patients and parents.  
     
-   Association of Children’s Museums (ACM), a champion for children’s
    museums with more than 460 members in 50 states and 19 countries,
    will work with local member museums to: host vaccine pop-up clinics;
    provide in-person and virtual events including information sessions,
    community forums, and other events featuring museum leaders and
    medical experts to answer parent questions; display a museum exhibit
    providing educational information about vaccination in English and
    Spanish; and amplify digital and social content to reach families.  
-   The National Diaper Bank Network, a nationwide organization with
    more than 200 member diaper bank programs that distributed over 68
    million diapers last year, will distribute educational material to
    parents and caregivers through member diaper banks, packing fact
    sheets, postcards, and other materials in diaper boxes, sharing
    resources with local agency partners, and hosting virtual and
    in-person events with pediatricians and other trusted messengers.  
-   The American Library Association (ALA) will provide resources to
    assist the nation’s 17,000 public libraries in providing trusted
    vaccine information to parents and guardians. ALA will conduct a
    national webinar for librarians and staff featuring a pediatrician
    from AAP and other trusted messengers to provide information to
    public librarians and staff on how they can support vaccine
    education and outreach, share resources through children’s
    programming, and host in-person events and vaccine pop-up clinics to
    promote vaccines in their communities. Public libraries have played
    an important role in the pandemic by equipping their communities
    with trusted information, supplies like masks and COVID-19 tests,
    and hosting pop-up vaccine clinics.  
-   The National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) has been hosting
    dozens of vaccine pop-up clinics to reach parents, teachers, and
    school staff. The National PTA will continue to engage parents of
    school-aged children, as well as parents of younger children, by
    hosting a national symposium for local PTA leaders and affiliates
    featuring a pediatrician from AAP and other trusted messengers;
    hosting vaccine pop-up clinics in key geographic markets to reach
    parents of both school-aged and younger children; and hosting
    virtual events to reach parents and empower community leaders to act
    as trusted messengers and amplify vaccine information.   
-   The National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC), the
    leading association for community health centers, will provide
    culturally appropriate and evidence-based training to empower
    community health centers to act as trusted messengers with parents
    of school-aged and younger children and other patients in their
    communities. NACHC will also host virtual events, including
    webinars, trainings, and podcasts to aid in the dissemination of
    campaign materials and messaging about the importance of
    vaccinations for young children, and how community health workers
    can play a key role in reaching parents with trusted messaging.  
-   Latino community-focused organizations, including the League of
    United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the largest and oldest
    Hispanic serving organization in the US with over 1,000 LULAC
    Councils, will hold in-person and virtual educational events for
    parents and caregivers and will design and distribute bilingual,
    culturally relevant resources (printed and digital) to community
    members and partner organizations.  
-   Black community-focused organizations, including the W. Montague
    Cobb Health Institute, a consortium of scholars working toward the
    elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities within the
    National Medical Association, will host “Stay Well Health Fairs and
    Vaccine Clinics,” an ongoing series of health fairs offering free
    vaccines, educational materials, health screenings, and pediatric
    roundtables featuring subject matter experts. The Women’s Missionary
    Society Foundation, with 800,000 members across the African
    Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church’s boundaries, will host “family fun
    day” vaccine events reaching Black families and will collaborate
    with AME Church daycares and pre-schools to share information and
    messaging about pediatric vaccines.  
-   Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander
    community-focused organizations, including the Asian Community
    Development Council, The Progressive Vietnamese American
    Organization, Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resource
    Center, Chinese Community Center, Filipino Family Health Initiative,
    and Thai Community Development Center will: engage with local
    communities in Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog and other
    languages where possible through in-person engagement, phone
    banking, social media and written resources; reach families through
    WIC Market Match, which serves parents with small children who are
    on WIC; and host weekly vaccine clinics and vaccine education
    classes and events.  
-   Native American community organizations, including Native Roots
    Radio, a leading radio station for Native Americans to discuss
    local, regional, and national Native American news and events will
    conduct virtual conversations including physicians, community
    advocates, and Tribal leadership speaking on the COVID-19 pandemic
    including vaccinations for children, boosters, mental health and
    long COVID; and the USDA Food Distribution Program on Indian
    Reservations in partnership with the Great Plains Tribal Leaders
    Health Board will distribute educational materials to food
    distribution centers to be packaged in food boxes promoting
    vaccinations that are regionally and culturally tailored to Native
    American audiences.

What to Expect, a platform of over 20 million moms, will author a blog
series featuring doctors and other trusted experts answering questions
about pediatric COVID-19 vaccines, and how moms, expecting moms, and all
parents can get the information they need to get themselves and their
children vaccinated; author new articles dispelling myths about the
COVID-19 vaccine and children; and create and amplify new What to Expect
social media content, reaching moms where they are and fighting vaccine
misinformation across all platforms.
