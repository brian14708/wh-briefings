  \_Rights"

Today, White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and the
White House Office of Public Engagement convened a meeting with labor
leaders—including nurses and teachers—on access to health care and
workers’ rights. Participants shared their experiences of union women
advocating and organizing for health care, including reproductive health
care. They also discussed the challenges posed by extreme state laws
that restrict access to critical reproductive health services and the
direct impact these restrictions have on women in the workforce
including impact on negotiated health care benefits.

  
Senior Administration officials underscored the President’s commitment
to reproductive rights and thanked participants for their leadership and
efforts to protect access to reproductive health care in their
communities. The Administration also committed to continued engagement
and collaboration with these labor leaders.
