title: "Readout of Vice President Harris\u2019s Meeting with Faith Leaders on Reproductive\_\
  Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris held a roundtable in Los Angeles,
California with faith leaders to discuss some of the most urgent
challenges facing our communities, including protecting reproductive
rights and addressing the epidemic of hate that is gripping our
nation.  
   
Attendees discussed the importance of protecting access to reproductive
health care, preserving the right to self-determination for individuals
and families, and working together to chart the path forward. The Vice
President affirmed the key role faith leaders play in bringing people
together to move our country in the direction of justice, and she
highlighted the constitutional rights affirmed in *Roe*, including the
right to privacy, which protects the right to use contraception and the
freedom to marry the person you love.  
   
Participants underscored the importance of ensuring that health care
decisions are made by women without government interference, and the
need to work together as a coalition to safeguard this right. The Vice
President raised that the Louisiana legislature passed a bill that would
ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest, saying the bill
illustrates that there is a clear and imminent threat to the shared
principle of allowing women to make decisions about their own bodies.  
   
During the conversation, the Vice President also raised the issue of gun
violence that has been plaguing our nation. The Vice President thanked
the faith leaders for the important role they play in working toward
healing, hope, and unity in their congregations and communities.  
   
The Vice President affirmed that faith leaders are essential partners to
the Administration and that she looks forward to continuing to work with
them to build coalitions across faiths.
