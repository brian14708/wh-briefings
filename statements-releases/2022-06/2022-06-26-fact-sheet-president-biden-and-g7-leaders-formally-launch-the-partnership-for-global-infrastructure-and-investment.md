title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden and G7 Leaders Formally Launch the\_Partnership\
  \ for Global Infrastructure and\_Investment"
---
 
*The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment* *will deliver
game-changing projects to close the infrastructure gap in developing
countries, strengthen the global economy and supply chains, and advance
U.S. national security *  
   
*President Biden will announce new flagship projects and lay out the
Administration’s comprehensive effort to execute the Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment.*

At the 2021 G7 Summit, President Biden and G7 leaders announced their
intent to develop a values-driven, high-impact, and transparent
infrastructure partnership to meet the enormous infrastructure needs of
low- and middle-income countries and support the United States’ and its
allies’ economic and national security interests. Over the past year,
members of the Administration have traveled to hear directly from
countries on how we can meet their infrastructure needs, deepened our
coordination across the U.S Government and with the G7, honed our
infrastructure investment tools, and closed game-changing deals.  
   
At the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Schloss Elmau, Leaders will formally launch
the **Partnership for Global Infrastructure (PGII) **to mobilize
hundreds of billions of dollars and deliver quality, sustainable
infrastructure that makes a difference in people’s lives around the
world, strengthens and diversifies our supply chains, creates new
opportunities for American workers and businesses, and advances our
national security.  
   
**Today, President Biden will announce that the U.S. aims to mobilize
$200 billion for PGII over the next 5 years through grants, Federal
financing, and leveraging private sector investments.** Together with G7
partners, we aim to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 in global
infrastructure investments. And this will only be the beginning. The
United States and its G7 partners will seek to mobilize additional
capital from other like-minded partners, multilateral development banks,
development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and more.  
   
**President Biden will release a Presidential Memorandum to execute the
PGII across four priority pillars that will define the second half of
the 21<sup>st</sup> century.**  
  
This includes:

-   Tackling the climate crisis and bolstering global energy security
    through investments in climate resilient infrastructure,
    transformational energy technologies, and developing clean energy
    supply chains across the full integrated lifecycle, from the
    responsible mining of metals and critical minerals; to low-emissions
    transportation and hard infrastructure; to investing in new global
    refining, processing, and battery manufacturing sites; to deploying
    proven, as well as innovative, scalable technologies in places that
    do not yet have access to clean energy.  
     
-   Developing, expanding, and deploying secure information and
    communications technology (ICT) networks and infrastructure to power
    economic growth and facilitate open digital societies—from working
    with trusted vendors to provide 5G and 6G digital connectivity, to
    supporting access to platforms and services that depend upon an
    open, interoperable, secure, and reliable internet and mobile
    networks with sound cybersecurity.  
     
-   Advancing gender equality and equity—from care infrastructure that
    increases opportunities for economic participation by women, to
    improved water and sanitation infrastructure that addresses gender
    gaps in unpaid work and time use – in order to boost the global
    economic recovery by ensuring that half the population is not forced
    to sit on the sidelines.  
     
-   Developing and upgrading the infrastructure of health systems and
    contributing to global health security through investments in
    patient-centered health services and the health workforce; vaccine
    and other essential medical product manufacturing; and disease
    surveillance and early warning systems, including safe and secure
    labs. Addressing the current pandemic and preventing and preparing
    for the next one is crucial to U.S. economic and national security.

**President Biden will announce flagship projects of PGII, **[along with
additional projects that have been undertaken over the past
year.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Other-PGII-projects.pdf)
**PGII will demonstrate how millions of dollars can mobilize tens or
hundreds of millions in further investments and tens or hundreds of
millionscan mobilize billions.**

-   With support from the U.S. Department of Commerce and the
    Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), U.S. firm
    AfricaGlobal Schaffer (Washington, DC), in collaboration with U.S.
    project developer Sun Africa (Miami, FL), signed a contract with the
    Government of Angola to develop a $2 billion solar project in four
    southern Angola provinces. The project will include solar
    mini-grids, solar cabins with telecommunications capabilities, and
    home power kits. In addition to supporting up to $1.3 billion in
    U.S. exports, the project will help Angola meet their climate
    commitments, including generating 70% carbon-free power by 2025.  
     
-   In collaboration with G7 members as well as the European Union and
    multilateral organizations, the U.S. International Development
    Finance Corporation (DFC) is disbursing a $3.3 million technical
    assistance grant to Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) for early-stage
    project development for an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine
    manufacturing facility in Senegal with potential annual capacity of
    millions of doses of COVID-19 and other vaccines, potentially using
    both viral vector and mRNA technologies. DFC’s grant is part of a
    $14 million grant financing package that also includes $3.3 million
    from the International Finance Corporation, $2 million from the
    Agence Française de Développement, and $5.2 million from the
    European Investment Bank (EIB). DFC, along with other development
    finance institutions, is currently evaluating a loan to support
    IPD’s expansion to supplement EIB’s recent announcement of a nearly
    $80 million sovereign loan financing package.  
     
-   U.S. telecommunications company SubCom (Eatontown, NJ), awarded a
    $600 million contract, to build the Southeast Asia–Middle
    East–Western Europe 6 submarine telecommunications cable that will
    connect Singapore to France through Egypt and the Horn of Africa.
    The submarine cable will stretch over 17,000 km and connect
    countries across the region with high-speed, reliable connectivity.
    The U.S. Government, including through the U.S. Department of State,
    Commerce’s Advocacy Center, EXIM, and the U.S. Trade and Development
    Agency’s (USTDA) commitment of nearly $4 million in additional
    capacity building to support five countries using SubCom’s
    technology, collectively helped secure the award of the construction
    and deployment of the undersea fiber optic cable for SubCom.

    will provide $14 million in support for the Front-End Engineering
    and Design study for Romania’s deployment of a first-of-its-kind
    small modular reactor (SMR) plant. Building on U.S. Government
    efforts, including advocacy support from Commerce and technical
    assistance from State and USTDA, this investment is meant to
    mobilize a multi-billion-dollar effort and showcase U.S. ingenuity
    in the advanced nuclear sector, accelerate the clean energy
    transition, create thousands of jobs, and strengthen European energy
    security while upholding the highest standards for nuclear safety,
    security, and nonproliferation.  
     
-   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will aim to
    commit up to $50 million over five years to the World Bank’s new
    global Childcare Incentive Fund – $200 million public-private
    partnership to address the gap in suitable childcare infrastructure;
    boost women’s employment opportunities, productivity and income, and
    broader economic growth; and promote human capital and early
    learning for children. Other partners include the Governments of
    Canada and Australia, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the
    Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Echidna Giving, the Ford Foundation,
    the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and the LEGO Foundation.  
     
-   DFC will invest up to $25 million in the Uhuru Growth Fund I-A,
    which will provide needed growth capital to small-and medium-sized
    enterprises in West Africa – including women-led businesses. Some of
    the largest economies in Africa, including Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote
    d’Ivoire, are facing a shortage of growth capital. Uhuru has
    committed to investing at least 30 percent of capital in eligible
    portfolio companies that support DFC’s 2X women’s economic
    empowerment initiative, and over 40 percent of the Uhuru team
    members are women. In addition to U.S. support, like-minded partners
    are investing including $35 million from the German Development
    Finance Institution, $30 million from the European Investment Bank,
    and $15 million from British International Investment, among others.
    Through this investment, DFC expects to mobilize $78 million in
    private capital.     
     
-   The Digital Invest program will leverage $3.45 million in State and
    USAID funding to mobilize up to $335 million in investment capital
    for internet service providers and financial technology companies in
    Africa, Asia, and Latin America that use secure network equipment
    and advance competition and choice in emerging markets. This new
    blended finance program for fund managers and project developers
    through the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership will
    promote the growth of resilient, secure digital ecosystems in
    developing countries.  
     
-   USAID will invest $40 million in the Southeast Asia’s Smart Power
    Program to decarbonize and strengthen the region’s power system by
    increasing regional energy trade, accelerating the deployment of
    clean energy technologies, and actively engaging private sector
    leaders and key development partners in shared priorities. The
    program is expected to mobilize $2 billion in financing as a result
    of U.S. Government assistance, increase regional energy trade by
    five percent, and result in 2 gigawatts of advanced energy systems
    deployed.  
     
-   DFC will invest up to $30 million in Omnivore Agritech and Climate
    Sustainability Fund 3, an impact venture capital fund that invests
    in entrepreneurs building the future of agriculture, food systems,
    climate, and the rural economy in India. The Fund seeks to invest in
    companies that increase food security and promote both climate
    resilience and climate adaptation in India, as well as improve the
    profitability and agricultural productivity of smallholder
    farms. The Fund is targeting a $65 million first close in September
    2022 and a final close in 2023 to reach its target capitalization of
    $130 million. Through this investment, DFC expects to mobilize $30
    million in private capital.
