  \ Leaders\_Meeting"

President Joe Biden will host a virtual leader-level meeting of the
Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) on June 17, 2022, at
8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. This will be President Biden’s third
leader-level convening of the MEF since taking office.

This meeting of the MEF is a continuation of the President’s efforts to
use all levers to tackle the global climate crisis, urgently address
rising costs around the world exacerbated by Russia’s war on Ukraine,
and put the U.S. and allies on a path to long-term energy and food
security.  In urging countries to enhance climate ambition, he invited
fellow leaders to join the United States in a set of concrete,
collective initiatives that will accelerate global action on climate as
well as our energy security and food security efforts. 

The MEF includes countries representing 80 percent of global GDP,
population, and greenhouse gas emissions.  Other leaders critical to the
global effort to tackle the climate crisis have also been invited to
participate.
