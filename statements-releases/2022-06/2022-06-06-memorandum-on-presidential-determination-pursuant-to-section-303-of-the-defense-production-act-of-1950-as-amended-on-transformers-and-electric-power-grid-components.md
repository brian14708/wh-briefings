MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY

SUBJECT: Presidential Determination Pursuant to  Section 303 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, on Transformers and Electric
Power Grid Components

Ensuring a robust, resilient, and sustainable domestic industrial base
to meet the requirements of the clean energy economy is essential to our
national security, a resilient energy sector, and the preservation of
domestic critical infrastructure.  Therefore, by the authority vested in
me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
America, including section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as
amended (the “Act”) (50 U.S.C. 4533), I hereby determine, pursuant to
section 303(a)(5) of the Act, that:

\(1\)  transformers and electric power grid components are industrial
resources, materials, or critical technology items essential to the
national defense;

\(2\)  without Presidential action under section 303 of the Act, United
States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability
for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology
item in a timely manner; and

(3)  purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to
section 303 of the Act are the most cost effective, expedient, and
practical alternative method for meeting the need.

Pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, I find that action to
expand the domestic production capability for transformers and electric
power grid components is necessary to avert an industrial resource or
critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national
defense capability.  Therefore, I waive the requirements of section
303(a)(1)–(a)(6) of the Act for the purpose of expanding the domestic
production capability for transformers and electric power grid
components.

You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the
*Federal Register*.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
