title: "President\_Biden Announces Twelfth Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"
---
 
*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately 2
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Danone’s Nutricia specialized
medical infant formula on July 8*

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Danone’s Nutricia
specialized medical formulas from Europe to New York, New York and
Chicago, Illinois on July 8 These two deliveries will include a total of
approximately 190,000 pounds of Neocate Junior and Neocate Infant
DHA/ARA, the equivalent of approximately 2 million 8-ounce bottles and
are for babies with severe cow’s milk or multiple food protein
allergies. The specialty formula will be mainly available through
medical distributors.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Danone can export
additional infant formula, including Neocate Infant DHA/ARA and Aptamil
First Infant Milk Stage 1. Danone plans to export approximately 38
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market, which also
includes their Aptamil baby formula from Ireland and New Zealand.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores and medical
distributors as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the
Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant
formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to
families who need it faster. *By July 3, Operation Fly Formula will have
transported more than 37.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the
U.S.*

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at whitehouse.gov/formula.
