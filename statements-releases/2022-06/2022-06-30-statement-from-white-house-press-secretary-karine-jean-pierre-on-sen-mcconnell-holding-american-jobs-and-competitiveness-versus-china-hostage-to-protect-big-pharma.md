title: "Statement from White\_House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Sen. McConnell\
  \ Holding American Jobs and Competitiveness Versus China Hostage to Protect Big\_\
  Pharma"
---
 
The Republican Senate leader is holding hostage a bipartisan package to
strengthen American competitiveness versus China, that would yield
hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in places like Southern
Ohio, Idaho, and other states around the country.  It would lower the
cost of countless products, and end our reliance on imports.  Why? To
protect the ability of big pharmaceutical companies to price gouge.
Senate Republicans are literally choosing to help China out compete the
U.S. in order to protect big drug companies. This takes loyalty to
special interests over working Americans to a new and shocking height. 
We are not going to back down in the face of this outrageous threat.
