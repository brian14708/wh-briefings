title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Action Plan on Global Water Security\
  \ and Highlights the Administration\u2019s Work to Build Drought\_Resilience"
---
 
*The Historic Action Plan Elevates Water Security as Foreign Policy
Priority*

More than two billion people today lack access to safely managed
drinking water, and nearly half the world’s population lacks access to
safely managed sanitation services. An accelerating climate crisis will
increase pressure on water resources during this decade, and half the
world’s population is expected to face severe water stress by 2030.
Water insecurity threatens lives and livelihoods and can lead to popular
unrest and population movements. These conditions can undermine states
and governments—particularly those that are already experiencing weak
state capacity or legitimacy.  
   
In response to this growing challenge, Vice President Harris is
announcing the launch of the first-of-its-kind [White House Action Plan
on Global Water
Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/water-action-plan_final_formatted.pdf),
which outlines an innovative approach to advancing water security at
home and abroad. This plan identifies the direct links between water and
U.S. national security, and it will harness the resources of the U.S.
Government—from leveraging science and technology to informing our
diplomacy, defense, and development efforts—to advance global water
security and foreign policy goals. In addition to increasing gender
equity and economic growth, water security is a central element of
preventing conflict and promoting global peace and stability.  
   
This announcement builds on the [Biden-Harris Lead Pipe Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/)
and other historic steps the Biden-Harris Administration has already
taken to improve water security at home, including investments through
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to increase drought resilience,
replace lead pipes, and invest in water infrastructure to deliver safe
drinking water to families and children. The Drought Resilience
Interagency Working Group, co-led by the Department of the Interior and
the Department of Agriculture, has worked to coordinate Drought
Resilience funding across the Federal family to provide targeted support
to drought-stricken communities and build American communities’
resilience to worsening drought conditions caused by climate change, as
outlined in its [one-year summary
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DroughtIWGReport_Final_Embargoed-Until-June-1-at-6AM-ET.pdf).
The Administration’s work at home will help mitigate the cost of
inaction—in 2020 alone, wildfires caused by extreme drought resulted in
$16.6 billion in damages.  
   
Today’s newly announced White House Action Plan on Global Security uses
a broad definition of water security, emphasizing that having “water
security” implies sustainable access to safe drinking water, sanitation,
and hygiene services, as well as water to sustain ecosystems and for
agriculture, energy, and other economic activities. As countries around
the world face the growing threat of water insecurity, global progress
toward meeting water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) goals has been
modest; water systems are not always well managed, inhibiting
sustainable, reliable service delivery.  
   
In response, the Action Plan elevates water security as an essential
element of the United States’ international efforts to achieve national
security objectives that include increasing equity and economic growth;
decreasing the risk of vulnerability to shocks, conflict and
instability; building inclusive and resilient societies; bolstering
health and food security; advancing gender equity and equality; and
tackling climate change. This action plan will be operationalized
through Federal departments’ and agencies’ contributions to the U.S.
Global Water Strategy, mandated by the Congress in the Senator Paul
Simon Water for the World Act of 2014.  
   
The plan is organized around three pillars:  
 

1.  **Advancing U.S. leadership in the global effort to achieve
    universal and equitable access to sustainable, climate-resilient,
    safe, and effectively managed WASH services without increasing
    greenhouse gas emissions.** Recognizing the immense progress needed
    to achieve global WASH goals, the plan emphasizes the importance of
    affordable and sustainable WASH services, locally led solutions, and
    addressing the inequity that results from water
    insecurity—particularly for women and girls.

1.  **Promoting sustainable management and protection of water resources
    and associated ecosystems to support economic growth, build
    resilience, mitigate the risk of instability or conflict, and
    increase cooperation.** The United States’ world-leading scientific
    and technical expertise will support efforts to use water resources
    efficiently and effectively to support agriculture and food security
    needs, health systems strengthening, and conflict prevention
    efforts. At the same time, this approach recognizes the importance
    of nature-based solutions, including drawing on Indigenous and local
    knowledge.

<!-- -->

1.  **Ensuring that multilateral action mobilizes cooperation and
    promotes water security.** Efforts to promote water cooperation
    through regional and multilateral fora are essential to facilitating
    greater collaboration among countries that share water resources.
    Elevating water security across U.S. diplomatic efforts will mean
    integrating water into our development programming and
    infrastructure initiatives, including those the United States
    undertakes with international partners. We will identify
    opportunities where engagement around the management of water
    resources at all levels, from high-level to technical, can lead to
    stronger regional ties.

Through this Action Plan, the United States will highlight, reinforce,
and where needed reorient existing U.S. Government tools to advance
progress toward global water security goals. This process will champion
the use of data in decision-making and break down barriers to
collaboration across the U.S. Government. The United States will also
increase its focus on working in partnership with nongovernmental
organizations, local communities, and the private sector in order to
maximize the impact of its programming and investments. This
comprehensive, systems-based approach will recognize the unique
challenges in each region and community and address them to ensure that
water strengthens, rather than undermines, U.S. national security.
