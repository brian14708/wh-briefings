*Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investments to Enable Families to
Plug-In, Charge Up, and Drive Across America*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new steps to meet
President Biden’s goal to build out the first-ever national network of
500,000 electric vehicle chargers along America’s highways and in
communities, a key piece of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

The Department of Transportation, in partnership with the Department of
Energy, is [proposing new
standards](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-takes-key-step-forward-building-national-network-user)
to make charging electric vehicles (EVs) a convenient, reliable, and
affordable for all Americans, including when driving long distances.
Without strong standards, chargers would be less reliable, may not work
for all cars, or lack common payment methods. The new standards will
ensure everyone can use the network –no matter what car you drive or
which state you charge in.

The proposed standards, along with new coordinated federal actions on
EVs, support President’s Biden’s priorities  to lower costs for
families, create good-paying jobs, and combat climate change. He is
pressing Congress on his plan to provide tax credits that make EVs more
affordable, so families’ budgets aren’t hurt by volatile gas prices. The
actions will spur good-paying jobs with strong workforce requirements
for America’s steelworkers, electrical workers, and laborers to build,
install, and maintain the network. And, making chargers and EVs more
accessible will help tackle the climate crisis – reducing emissions,
increasing cleaner air, and advancing the President’s Justice40
Initiative.

Thanks to President Biden’s bold vision, leadership, and actions EV
sales have doubled since he took office, and there are now more than two
million EVs and 100,000 chargers on the road. The Biden Administration
has positioned the United States to lead the electric future and make it
in America:

-   Secured historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law –
    $7.5 billion for EV charging infrastructure and more than $7 billion
    for the critical minerals supply chains necessary for batteries,
    components, materials, and recycling.
-   United automakers and autoworkers around an [ambitious
    target](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/)
    for 50% of new vehicles sold in 2030 to be electric.
-   Triggered a string of investment commitments of over $100 billion
    from private companies to make more EVs and their parts in America,
    create jobs for our autoworkers, and strengthen our domestic supply
    chains.
-   Activated the purchasing power of the federal government to procure
    100% zero-emission light-duty vehicles by 2027 and all vehicles by
    2035.
-   Finalized the strongest passenger vehicle emissions and fuel economy
    standards in history.

**<u>Historic Infrastructure Investments in Charging</u>**

The $7.5 billion for EV charging infrastructure in President Biden’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will build a convenient and equitable
charging network through two programs. The National Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure (NEVI) program will provide $5 billion in formula funding
to States to build out charging infrastructure along highway corridors –
filling gaps in rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach locations while
instilling public confidence in charging. Today’s minimum standards and
requirements will guide States on how to spend federal funds in a way
that makes chargers function the same from state-to-state, easy to find,
use, and pay for, no matter who operates chargers. The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law also provides $2.5 billion in competitive grants to
support community and corridor charging, improve local air quality, and
increase EV charging access in underserved and overburdened communities.
 DOT will open applications for this program later this year.

These federal charging programs were designed to catalyze additional
private sector investments that complement the build-out of a
user-friendly, cost-saving, and financially sustainable national EV
charging network. Together, President Biden’s leadership is mobilizing
public and private charging investment to accelerate the adoption of EVs
and create good-paying jobs across manufacturing, installation, and
operation. These chargers will also make sure the new renewable
electricity sources like solar and wind can power the cars we drive and
reduce energy costs for families.

**<u>Setting the Standard</u>**

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also established a [Joint Office of
Energy and Transportation](https://driveelectric.gov/) to work
hand-in-hand with States, industry leaders, manufacturers, and other
stakeholders to meet the President’s goals. And to ensure that this
electric transformation is both timely and equitable, Vice President
Harris launched an [EV Charging Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-electric-vehicle-charging-action-plan/)
that fast tracks federal investments and targets equity benefits for
disadvantaged communities – and the Department of Transportation
released a [Rural EV
toolkit](https://www.transportation.gov/rural/ev/toolkit) to help ensure
all Americans, regardless of where they live, have the opportunity to
benefit from the lower operating costs, reduced maintenance needs, and
improved performance that EVs provide. These investments, steered by the
standards proposed today, will create a public charging system that
meets our goals of being reliable, affordable, equitable and seamless
between states and networks. They will also use workforce standards such
as the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP) to
increase the safety and reliability of charging station’s functionality
and usability – creating and supporting good-paying, highly-skilled
union jobs in communities across the country.

**<u>Additional Steps to Drive Progress</u>**

Today, as part of an Administration-wide strategy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing a fleet of actions from nine federal
agencies across the charging ecosystem to complement the NEVI program –
creating good-paying jobs in the U.S., reducing emissions, and putting
us on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050.

-   **The** **Joint Office of Energy and Transportation** [announced the
    formation](https://driveelectric.gov/work-with-us/) of a new Federal
    Advisory Committee called the EV Working Group that will be a key
    advisory body to “make recommendations regarding the development,
    adoption, and integration of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty
    electric vehicles into the transportation and energy systems of the
    United States,” including on infrastructure topics. The 25 members
    will be selected in the coming months. The joint office also
    announced a partnership to support EV charging with the American
    Public Power Association, Edison Electric Institute, and National
    Rural Electric Cooperative Association to inform electric system
    investments and support state planning.
