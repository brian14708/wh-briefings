  America"
---
 
Spain and the United States are Allies, strategic partners, and friends.
Our bilateral relationship is based on deep historical ties, shared
democratic values, and a common vision for addressing global challenges.
Spain and the United States are committed to upholding peace and
security, protecting the planet’s climate for future generations,
promoting democracy and human rights, and enhancing economic prosperity
around the world. To affirm our commitment to working closely together
to advance these goals, the President of the Government of Spain, Pedro
Sánchez Pérez Castejón, and the President of the United States of
America, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., on the occasion of President Biden’s
visit to Spain on June 28-30, 2022, have reached the following
understandings:

**Reinforcing multilateral responses to transatlantic and global
challenges  
  
**1. Spain and the United States condemn Russia’s unjustified and
unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine, which has fundamentally
altered the global strategic environment. This aggression constitutes
the most direct threat to transatlantic security and global stability
since the end of the Cold War. Russia’s actions also threaten the food
security of some of the most vulnerable people around the world. Spain
and the United States intend to continue working together, along and
with other partners and allies, including the rest of the EU and the G7,
to support the government and the people of Ukraine and to hold Russia
accountable for its violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity, including gross violations of international law by targeting
civilians with violence, and conflict-related sexual violence. Spain and
the United States also reiterate their strong support for Ukraine’s
determination to choose its own future.

2. Spain and the United States are committed to defending the
rules-based international order, which has been the foundation for
preserving our security and advancing our prosperity over the past seven
decades. We are fully committed to the goals of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. We intend to strengthen international and
multilateral institutions to promote strong, sustainable, and inclusive
economic growth, defend democratic governance, and advance solutions to
global challenges.  We stand united in our determination to address
challenges to that international order.  In this regard we continue to
encourage China to uphold its commitments within the rules-based
international order, to contribute to international security, and to
cooperate in the provision of global public goods, including on climate
change, biodiversity and gender equality.

**Strengthening defense cooperation  
  
**3. The United States and Spain recognize the central importance of the
NATO Alliance in ensuring transatlantic peace and security. As NATO
Allies for 40 years, Spain and the United States are steadfastly
committed to providing NATO with ready forces and capabilities,
strengthening their transatlantic ties, and ensuring a 360-degree
approach to security, particularly by enhancing the relationship with
mutual partners, such as the European Union. The Madrid Summit hosted by
Spain will ensure that NATO is united behind a new Strategic Concept
guiding the Alliance’s approach towards strategic competitors and
transnational threats, and that NATO’s military and political activities
are resourced to address a more dangerous security environment.

4. Spain and the United States underline their commitment to the
U.S.-Spain Agreement on Defense Cooperation signed in 1988, which,
together with the shared use of Spain’s bases in Rota and Morón, is an
essential piece of the bilateral defense cooperation between the two
countries. Spain and the United States intend to expand their defense
cooperation through the permanent stationing of additional U.S. naval
vessels in Rota. The two countries intend to hold regular meetings
within the framework of the bilateral High-Level Defense Group to
strengthen defense cooperation.

**Defending democracy, human rights, and gender equality  
  
**5. Spain and the United States share the fundamental values ​​of
support for freedom, equity and equality, democracy, and the rule of
law. Both countries reaffirm their commitment to a foreign policy guided
by the defense of human rights, especially the rights of women and
vulnerable populations, such as people living in poverty, members of
racially or ethnically marginalized groups, LGBTQI+ persons, members of
religious minority groups, persons with disabilities, refugees,
migrants, internally displaced persons, older adults, children, gender
non-conforming persons, and trafficking victims.  
  
6. The United States and Spain underscore the importance of promoting
gender equity and equality globally. Both countries intend to work
together to promote policies and initiatives that advance the rights of
women and girls, including through the Women, Peace, and Security
agenda.  As underscored during this Summit for Democracy Year of Action,
they are committed to cooperation in strengthening democratic governance
and the protection and promotion of human rights throughout the world,
particularly with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean where
the United States and Spain both have deep and enduring affiliations.

**Intensifying collaboration on justice and security issues  
**

the management of irregular migration flows, ensuring the just and
humane treatment of migrants. Both countries also plan to coordinate

challenges of irregular migration in the North Africa region.

including to accelerate global efforts to make financial flows
consistent with low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient
development.  Both countries also underscore the importance of making
continued progress towards the collective goal to mobilize annually 100

Methane Pledge, improving adaptation to the impacts of climate change,
and promoting a climate resilient development, especially in the most
vulnerable countries.

implementation of mechanisms to safeguard these principles. They express
the importance of coordinating actions to mitigate security risks in the
digital environment, especially the importance of working with trusted
suppliers, and cooperating in defining and utilizing international
standards, including open standards, and best practices that contribute
to reliable and secure digitalization. They express their commitment to
cooperation initiatives in the transatlantic framework, such as the
EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council, as a tool for addressing
challenges in the trade, economic and technological sphere.

15\. Spain and the United States intend to continue promoting joint
science, space, and innovation initiatives carried out by research
organizations, universities, and private companies in all fields of
