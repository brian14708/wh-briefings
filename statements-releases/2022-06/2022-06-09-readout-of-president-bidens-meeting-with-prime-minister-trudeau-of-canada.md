President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau of Canada in Los Angeles on the margins of the Ninth Summit of
the Americas to review regional cooperation on economic development, the
COVID-19 pandemic, migration, and food insecurity. The President and
Prime Minister underscored their commitment to continue holding Russia
accountable for its brutal actions in Ukraine, and reviewed their
ongoing efforts to provide economic, development, and humanitarian aid
to the millions of Ukrainians affected by the violence, as well as to
provide security assistance to the government of Ukraine.  The President
lauded Canada’s close partnership with the United States throughout this
crisis and its leadership in enacting comprehensive sanctions and
restrictions on Russia. The President also stated he looks forward to
seeing the Prime Minister in Madrid for the NATO Summit.  
   
The Leaders also discussed the potential of developing critical minerals
in both countries and joint efforts to make our supply chains and
economies more resilient to external shocks, including through the work
of [the U.S.-Canada Supply Chain Working
Group](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CANADA-U.S.-SUPPLY-CHAINS-PROGRESS-REPORT.pdf). 
As major energy producers, both Canada and the United States play key
roles in supporting security and resilience of supply chains, but
Leaders also emphasized a shared commitment to achieve net-zero
emissions by 2050 to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. The
President thanked the Prime Minister for Canada’s support to bolster
democracy in the Americas and throughout in the world, and for Canada’s
support of the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity and the Los
Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. Both Leaders reaffirmed
the strong bonds between our nations and their commitment to deepening
the U.S.-Canada relationship across the breadth of our bilateral agenda.
