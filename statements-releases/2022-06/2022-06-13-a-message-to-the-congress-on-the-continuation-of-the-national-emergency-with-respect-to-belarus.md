title: "A Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency with\
  \ Respect to\_Belarus"
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Belarus that was
declared in Executive Order 13405 of June 16, 2006, which was expanded
in scope in Executive Order 14038 of August 9, 2021, is to continue in
effect beyond June 16, 2022. 

The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus
and other persons, and the Belarusian regime’s harmful activities and
long-standing abuses, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United
States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405 with respect to
Belarus.        

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
June 13, 2022.
