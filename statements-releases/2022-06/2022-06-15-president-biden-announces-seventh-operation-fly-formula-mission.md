title: "President\_Biden Announces Seventh Operation Fly Formula\_Mission"
---
 
*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately
548,000 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestlé Alfamino*® *and
Alfamino*®*Junior specialty infant formula this week*

  
Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé infant
formula from Switzerland to Louisville, Kentucky on June 16. This
delivery will include over 44,000 pounds of Nestlé Health Science
Alfamino® and Alfamino® Junior specialty formula, the equivalent of
approximately 548,000 8-ounce bottles. The product will be available
primarily through a distribution pipeline serving hospitals, home health
companies, and WIC programs around the U.S., with additional deliveries
of Nestlé formula being announced in the coming days.

Since May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the
agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Nestlé can export
additional infant formula into the U.S. Nestlé will import both standard
and specialty infant formulas to the U.S. including Nestlé NAN
SupremePro 1, Nestlé NAN SupremePro 2, Nestlé Health Science
Alfamino/Alfamino, Jr., Gerber® Good Start® Gentle and Gerber Good
Start® Extensive HA®. Nestle plans to export approximately 42 million
8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster.
 This is the seventh Operation Fly Formula mission and will be Operation
Fly Formula flights landing the week of June 13. By June 19, Operation
Fly Formula flights will have imported nearly 13 million 8-ounce bottle
equivalents of infant formula.

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
at whitehouse.gov/formula.
