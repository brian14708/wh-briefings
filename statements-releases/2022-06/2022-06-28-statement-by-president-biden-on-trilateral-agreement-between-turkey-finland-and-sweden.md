title: "Statement by President\_Biden on Trilateral Agreement Between Turkey, Finland,\
  \ and\_Sweden"

I congratulate Turkey, Finland and Sweden on signing a trilateral
memorandum, which paves the way for Allies to invite Finland and Sweden
to join NATO at the Madrid Summit. When I welcomed President Niinistö
and Prime Minister Andersson to the White House last month, I told them
that the United States strongly supports their membership. Finland and
Sweden are strong democracies with highly capable militaries. Their
membership will strengthen NATO’s collective security and benefit the
entire Transatlantic Alliance. I look forward to working with NATO
Secretary General Stoltenberg, our Allies, and with Congress to ensure
that we can quickly welcome them into our Alliance. As we begin this
historic NATO Summit in Madrid, our Alliance is stronger, more united
and more resolute than ever.
