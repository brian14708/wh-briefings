title: "Readout from Vice President Harris\u2019s Meeting with\_Constitutional Law,\
  \ Privacy, and Technology Experts on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris held a roundtable with
constitutional law, privacy, and technology experts to discuss what is
at stake if *Roe v. Wade* is overruled. The roundtable followed recent
meetings about reproductive rights that the Vice President held with
faith leaders, and with health care providers, and is part of the
Administration’s work to build coalitions and preparedness in response
to the attack on reproductive rights.  
   
During the meeting, the Vice President said that the principles of
liberty and self-determination are at stake in the Supreme Court’s
leaked opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.* The
conversation highlighted the real-world limitations to liberty that the
American people will experience if *Roe v. Wade* is overruled. The
participants discussed constitutional law and the history and meaning of
the right to privacy. The participants expressed concerns that if *Roe
v. Wade* is overturned, states with abortion bans could potentially
restrict in vitro fertilization if their definition of life begins at
the point of fertilization. They raised the impact that overturning
*Roe* could have on access to contraception and same-sex marriage. They
also discussed implications on data privacy – including concerns that
states that make abortion illegal may subpoena women’s personal data.  
   
The participants also discussed the maternal health care crisis, which
disproportionately impacts Black women, rural women, and Native women –
and they described the detrimental impact that overturning *Roe v. Wade*
will have on women’s health.  
   
The Vice President raised the connection between restrictions on
reproductive rights and limitations on other rights, noting that many of
the states that have trigger ban laws where abortion will be banned if
the Supreme Court overrules *Roe v. Wade* are also the states that are
passing laws to restrict voting rights and LGBTQ+ rights.  
   
Vice President Harris called on the legal experts to use their voices to
inform the American people about the potential consequences of the
Court’s decision. The Vice President affirmed that the Administration
will continue to fight for the health, safety, and wellbeing of women.
