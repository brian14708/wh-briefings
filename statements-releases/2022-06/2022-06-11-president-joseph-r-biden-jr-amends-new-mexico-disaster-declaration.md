title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Amends New Mexico Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. made additional disaster
assistance available to the State of New Mexico by authorizing an
increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and
emergency protective measures undertaken in the State of New Mexico as a
result of wildfires and straight-line winds beginning on April 5, 2022,
and continuing.

Under the President’s major disaster declaration issued for the State of
New Mexico on May 4, 2022, Federal funding was made available for Public
Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance at 75 percent
of the total eligible costs.

Under the President’s order today, the Federal share for debris removal
and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance
has been increased to 100 percent of the total eligible costs for the
first 90 days of the incident period. The 90 day period is designed to
serve as a bridge between emergency operations and the potential passage
of the pending Hermits Peak Fire Assistance Act legislation that would
require FEMA to establish a claims office to enable individuals to apply
for a broader range of assistance than what is available under the
Stafford Act.

This additional support will help ensure that New Mexico has no
financial limitations related to immediate lifesaving and life
sustaining operations related to the ongoing wildfires, including urgent
debris removal.
