title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Attorneys General Nessel of Michigan\
  \ and Ellison of Minnesota on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs
Director, Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director,
and Stacey Grigsby, Deputy White House Counsel, met with Attorneys
General Dana Nessel of Michigan and Keith Ellison of Minnesota to
discuss efforts underway in key states to protect reproductive rights.
Vice President Harris later joined the meeting and reaffirmed the
Administration’s commitment to fighting for reproductive rights. The
Vice President discussed the pivotal role that Attorneys General play in
safeguarding the rights of the people of their states, and she
encouraged them to continue to use their authority to defend
reproductive rights and freedoms.

Both Attorneys General have taken significant action to protect access
to abortion. Attorney General Nessel pledged not to deploy state
resources to enforce Michigan’s 1931 abortion ban, a relic of an era
before *Roe* was decided. On June 21, Attorney General Ellison reassured
Minnesotans and the people of every state that no one will be prosecuted
in Minnesota for seeking, helping someone else seek, or providing an
abortion that is legal in Minnesota.

Senior Administration officials thanked the Attorneys General for their
efforts to protect reproductive rights, and committed to working
together in the months ahead to protect a woman’s right to make
decisions about her own body. Today’s conversation followed a meeting
