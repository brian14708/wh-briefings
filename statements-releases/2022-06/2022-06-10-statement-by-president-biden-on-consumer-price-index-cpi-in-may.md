Today’s report underscores why I have made fighting inflation my top
economic priority. While it is good to see critical “core” inflation
moderating, it is not coming down as sharply and as quickly as we must
see. Putin’s Price Hike hit hard in May here and around the world: high
gas prices at the pump, energy, and food prices accounted for around
half of the monthly price increases, and gas pump prices are up by $2 a
gallon in many places since Russian troops began to threaten
Ukraine. Even as we continue our work to defend freedom in Ukraine, we
must do more—and quickly—to get prices down here in the United States.

My Administration will continue to do everything we can to lower prices
for the American people. Congress must act urgently as well. I call on
Congress to pass a bill to cut shipping costs this month, and get it to
my desk, so we can lower the price of goods. And, I call on Congress to
pass legislation to cut costs for families like energy bills and
prescription drugs. The deficit has come down more under my watch as
President than at any time in history, but if Congress would pass tax
reform to make the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their
fair share, we could reduce this inflationary pressure even more. These
are the most significant things Congress can do to help families now and
complement the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring inflation down.

Prices at the pump are a major part of inflation, and the war in Ukraine
is a major cause of that. The United States is on track to produce a
record amount of oil next year, and I am working with the industry to
accelerate this output. But it is also important that the oil and gas
and refining industries in this country not use the challenge created by
the war in Ukraine as a reason to make things worse for families with
excessive profit taking or price hikes.

We all have work to do to get inflation down. What will not help is the
plan by some Republicans in Congress to raise taxes on the middle class
and working families. That would be a step in the wrong direction, and I
strongly oppose it.
