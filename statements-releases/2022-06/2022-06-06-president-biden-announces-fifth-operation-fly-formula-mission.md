*Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately 1.6
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of* *Nestlé* *NAN SupremePro Stage 1*
*infant formula this week*

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Nestlé infant
formulas from Cologne, Germany to Fort Worth, Texas on June 9. This
delivery will include 110,000 pounds of Nestlé NAN SupremePro Stage 1
infant formula, approximately 1.6 million 8-ounce bottles. The product
will be available across the country through Nestlé/Gerber distribution
channels, and additional deliveries of Nestlé formula will be announced
in the coming days.

Last week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the
agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Nestlé can export
additional infant formula into the U.S. Nestlé will import both standard
and specialty infant formulas to the U.S. including Nestlé NAN
SupremePro 1, Nestlé NAN SupremePro 2, Nestlé Health Science
Alfamino/Alfamino, Jr., Gerber® Good Start® Gentle and Gerber Good
Start® Extensive HA®. Nestle plans to export approximately 41 million
8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster.
Operation Fly Formula has
[shipped](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/22/biden-administration-announces-second-operation-fly-formula-flight/)
1.5 million bottle equivalents of Nestle infant formula, and is sourcing
flights for an additional 8.3 million bottle equivalents of [Bubs

and [Kendamil infant
formula](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/01/president-biden-announces-third-operation-fly-formula-mission/).

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis
facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers
can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the
U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found at
whitehouse.gov/formula.
