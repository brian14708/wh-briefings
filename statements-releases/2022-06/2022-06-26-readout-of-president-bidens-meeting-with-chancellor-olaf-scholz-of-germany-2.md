underlined their commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity, as well as their continued provision of military, economic,
humanitarian, and diplomatic support to help Ukraine defend its
democracy against Russian aggression. The leaders also discussed efforts
to alleviate the impacts of Russia’s war in Ukraine on global food and
energy security. The President welcomed Germany’s historic commitment to
significantly boost defense spending and meet its NATO commitments,

posture. Finally, the leaders also discussed the challenges posed by
China and our shared commitment to provide transparent and high-standard
solutions to address global gaps in key infrastructure.
