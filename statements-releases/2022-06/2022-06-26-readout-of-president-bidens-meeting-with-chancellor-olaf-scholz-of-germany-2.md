underlined their commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity, as well as their continued provision of military, economic,
humanitarian, and diplomatic support to help Ukraine defend its
democracy against Russian aggression. The leaders also discussed efforts
to alleviate the impacts of Russia’s war in Ukraine on global food and
energy security. The President welcomed Germany’s historic commitment to
