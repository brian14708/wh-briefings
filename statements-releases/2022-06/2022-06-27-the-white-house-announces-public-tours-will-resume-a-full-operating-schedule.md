The Biden-Harris Administration is pleased to announce public tours of
the White House will resume a full operating schedule from Tuesdays
through Saturdays beginning on Tuesday, July 19, 2022. Public tours will
be available from 8:00 AM to 12:30 PM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, excluding Federal holidays or unless
otherwise noted. All White House tours are free of charge. The White
House tour schedule is subject to change based on inclement weather or

**Public White House Tour Requests**

Public tour requests are scheduled on a first come, first served basis
and must be submitted through a Member of Congress and their
Congressional Tour Coordinator. Constituents may reach your Member of
Congress and Congressional Tour Coordinator through the U.S. House of
Representative’s Switchboard at 202-225-3121, the U.S. Senate
Switchboard at 202-224-3121, or online
at [www.congress.gov/members](http://www.congress.gov/members).

Consistent with prior practices, public White House tour requests must
be submitted a minimum of 21 days in advance and no more than 90 days in
advance of the requested tour date(s). Reservations cannot be accepted
for tour dates outside this 21 – 90-day window. Congressional Tour
Coordinators will be able to submit tour requests for the full operating
schedule on Monday, June 27, 2022. 

The White House will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation
with guidance based on recommendations from the CDC, and other public
health officials and medical experts, and reserves the right to adjust
availability of the public tours as necessary to adhere to the latest
health guidance. Within the 10 days prior to the public tour, anyone who
has tested positive for COVID-19, has had any COVID-19 symptoms, or been
in close contact with someone confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19,
should stay home. Face masks will be available when entering the White
House complex for those who choose to wear them.
