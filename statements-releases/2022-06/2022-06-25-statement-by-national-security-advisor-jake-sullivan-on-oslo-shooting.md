title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Oslo\_Shooting"
---
 
The horrific shooting in Norway this morning has been felt around the
world. The United States strongly condemns this act of terror. We stand
in solidarity with the families of the victims, the diverse and
strong LGBTQI+ community of Oslo, our close NATO ally Norway, and all
who have been devastated by this senseless act. The United States has
been in touch with the Norwegian government and offered to provide
assistance. We remain committed to continuing to partner with Norway to
advance a more equitable and just world for all, free from violence and
discrimination.
