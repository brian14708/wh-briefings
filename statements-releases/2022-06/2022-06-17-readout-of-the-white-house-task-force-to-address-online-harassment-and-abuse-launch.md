title: "Readout of the White\_House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse\_\
  Launch"
---
 
Yesterday, the Gender Policy Council and National Security Council
launched the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and
Abuse. The Task Force was established through a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/16/memorandum-on-the-establishment-of-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
signed on Thursday. Following remarks by Vice President Harris, Attorney
General Merrick Garland, and U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, senior
Administration officials heard from a panel of survivors and experts,
who shared personal stories and recommendations on online harassment and
abuse.  
  
Survivors and experts highlighted the offline impact of online abuse,
ranging from psychological distress and additional negative health
impacts, to self-censorship, disruptions to education and economic loss,
as well as experiences of other forms of physical and sexual violence.
Participants noted that online harassment and abuse disproportionately
impacts women, girls – especially women and girls of color – and LGBTQI+
individuals.  Participants also provided concrete recommendations to
prevent and respond to online harms.     
  
Senior Administration officials reaffirmed the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to preventing and addressing gender-based
violence wherever it occurs, including online. They [outlined key

the Administration is already taking to address online harassment and
abuse, and explained that the Task Force will provide a blueprint for
action within 180 days with recommendations on additional steps the
federal government can take. This blueprint will include a focus on
expanding research to better understand the impact and scope of the
problem, improving prevention efforts, increasing support for survivors,
and strengthening accountability for offenders and technology platforms.
Recommendations will also address the nexus between online misogyny,
radicalization, and violence.   
  
Following yesterday’s launch, the Task Force will hold roundtables to
hear from survivors, advocates, legal experts, law enforcement and other
stakeholders in the coming weeks and months.  The Task Force is
co-chaired by the White House’s Gender Policy Council and National
Security Council and members include Cabinet officials, senior White
House leadership, and the heads of department and agencies with policy
and programmatic responsibilities key to preventing and addressing
online harassment and abuse.

    health advocate
