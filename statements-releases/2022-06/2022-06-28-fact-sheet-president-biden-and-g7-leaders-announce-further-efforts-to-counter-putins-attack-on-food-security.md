  \ Putin\u2019s Attack on Food\_Security"

*Biden-Harris Administration is Driving a Multi-Pronged Response to
Global Food Security Crisis*

President Biden and G7 leaders will announce that they will contribute
over $4.5 billion to address global food security, over half of which
will come from the United States. President Biden will announce $2.76
billion in additional U.S. Government funding commitments to help
protect the world’s most vulnerable populations and mitigate the impacts
of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine on growing food
insecurity and malnutrition. These new investments will support efforts
in over 47 countries and regional organizations, to support regional
plans to address increasing needs.

Vladimir Putin’s actions have strangled food and agriculture production
and have used food as a weapon of war, including through the destruction
of agricultural storage, processing, and testing facilities; theft of
grain and farm equipment; and the effective blockade of Black Sea ports.
Russia’s choice to attack food supplies and production have an impact on
markets, storage, production, negatively impacting consumers around the
globe. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, combined with the impacts from
COVID-19, increasing conflict, high prices for fuel and fertilizer, have
combined to devastate already fragile global food security and
nutrition. Millions of people living far from the conflict face an
increased risk of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition as a result of
Putin’s war. Estimates suggest that up to 40 million more people could
be pushed into poverty in 2022 as a result of Putin’s war in Ukraine and
its secondary effects.  
  
While the entire globe will continue to be affected by Russia’s actions,
the most immediate needs will present in the Horn of Africa, as it
experiences a record-setting fourth straight season of drought, that may
lead to famine. As many as 20 million people may face the threat of
starvation by the end of the year. The prolonged drought is also having
dire nutrition impacts, putting children at severe risk of malnutrition
and in need of treatment.  
  
To address and mitigate further impacts on global food security, the
U.S. Government will continue life-saving food assistance to address
these growing needs and leverage additional financial commitments. Of
the newly announced commitment of an additional $2.76 billion in
humanitarian and economic assistance, $2 billion will be to help save
lives through emergency interventions and $760 million will be for
sustainable near-term food assistance to help mitigate further increases
in poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in vulnerable countries impacted by
high prices of food, fertilizer, and fuel.    
  
**The U.S. government’s multi-pronged response to combat global food
insecurity includes:**  
  
***Global Humanitarian Assistance***  
Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February,
the United States has provided $2.8 billion to scale up emergency food
operations in countries impacted by the food security crisis*.* In
addition to this funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) is committing another $2 billion in international disaster
assistance (IDA) funds for emergency humanitarian needs over the next
three months. These funds include direct food assistance, as well as
related health, nutrition, protection, and water, sanitation and hygiene
services, in countries with high levels of acute food insecurity,
reliance on Russian or Ukrainian imports, and vulnerability to price
shocks, and will support countries hosting refugee populations.  
  
***Global Development Assistance***  
As we continue to address acute humanitarian needs, the U.S. government
will continue to strengthen food systems and mitigate medium-term
impacts on food security. The U.S. Government is investing $760 million
to combat the effects of high food, fuel, and fertilizer prices – now
being driven up by Putin’s war – in those countries that need it most.

-   The United States, through USAID, will program $640 million to
    support bilateral targeted agriculture and food security programs to
    strengthen agricultural capacity and resilience in more than 40 of
    the most vulnerable countries ­– Ukraine, as well as across 24
    countries and regions in Africa, 10 countries in Asia, 6 countries
    and regional presence in Latin American and the Caribbean, and 6
    countries in the Middle East. These investments will tackle urgent
    global fertilizer shortages, purchase resilient seeds, mitigate
    price shortages for fertilizer, scale-up social safety nets for
    families suffering from hunger and malnutrition, and avert food and
    humanitarian crises in the most vulnerable countries.  These
    solutions will be tailored to mitigate specific needs within
    specific contexts, driven by local solutions that can be scaled for
    maximum impact.  
-   The United States will also undertake multilateral efforts to
    protect livelihoods and nutrition and help vulnerable countries
    build their resilience to shocks, including food price volatility,
    supply chain issues, climate impacts, and other stresses beyond the
    immediate term. Specifically, in working with Congress, the United
    States will provide $120 million to the following
    efforts:           

<!-- -->

-   Support for the African Development Bank’s (AfDB) African Emergency
    Food Production Facility (AEFPF) to increase the production of
    climate-adapted wheat, corn, rice, and soybeans over the next four
    growing seasons in Africa.  
-   Support for the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s
    (IFAD) Crisis Response Initiative (CRI) to help protect livelihoods
    and build resilience in rural communities.  
-   Support for the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to develop a
    pipeline of bankable projects in Africa, to leverage private
    equity.  
-   Support for the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC) Africa Disaster Risk
    Financing Programme (ADRiFi) to help African governments to respond
    to food system shocks by increasing access to risk insurance
    products.  
-   A fertilizer efficiency and innovation program to enhance the
    efficiency of fertilizer use in countries where fertilizer tends to
    be overapplied.  
-   Support for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will fund
    soil mapping spanning multiple countries to provide information
    allowing for wiser water usage, greater fertilizer conservation, and
    improved climate resilience impacts.

***Expansion of Feed the Future***  
Feed the Future (FTF), the U.S. government’s flagship global food
security initiative led by USAID, is expanding its global footprint in
eight new target countries from 12 to 20 target countries, in Africa
that were also most vulnerable to the impacts of Russia’s war in
Ukraine. The new target countries are the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and
Zambia. This expansion of Feed the Future countries delivers on
President Biden’s $5 billion commitment in September 2021 to end global
hunger, malnutrition and build sustainable, resilient food systems
abroad.  
  
The U.S. government currently invests more than $1.9 billion per year
through Feed the Future, which builds on existing technical expertise,
programs and partners in more than 35 countries. In these countries, the
U.S. government investments pave the way for further investments from
the private sector, donors and local governments.  
  
***Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP)***  
The United States through the U.S. Treasury, continues to exercise
leadership in the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) –
a $2 billion multilateral financing mechanism that has helped the
world’s poorest countries increase investments in agriculture and food
security. The United States is contributing $155 million to support
projects that raise agricultural productivity, link farmers to markets,
improve livelihoods, reduce vulnerability, and enhance resilience to
shocks. The United States is also newly serving as Co-Chair of the GAFSP
Steering Committee. In this leadership position, the United States will
help deepen and accelerate GAFSP’s response to the food security
crisis.  
  
**USG Leadership in Driving Global Action**  
From the beginning, the United States has been at the forefront of
global efforts to confront this crisis.

-   The Department of the Treasury is also providing $500 million to the
    European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which will
    help support the EBRD’s Resilience and Livelihood Framework.  This
    package of investments, expected to reach €2 billion over the next
    two years, will support businesses and public services across all
    sectors affected by the war in Ukraine and neighboring countries. 
    The funding will support Ukraine’s energy and food security needs;
    investing in improvements in municipal infrastructure to provide
    energy, water and wastewater services, and other needs, and
    supporting internally displaced persons.  The United States
    contribution is helping to mobilize an additional $500 million in
    support from other donors.     
-   In April, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture (USDA) and USAID took the extraordinary
    step to draw down the full balance of the Bill Emerson Humanitarian
    Trust (BEHT) as part of an effort to provide $670 million in food
    assistance to countries in need as a result of Putin’s unprovoked
    further invasion of Ukraine. USDA will provide $388 million in
    funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to cover
    ocean freight transportation, inland transport, internal transport,
    shipping and handling, and other associated costs. USAID will use
    the BEHT’s $282 million to procure U.S. food commodities to bolster
    existing emergency food operations in six countries facing severe
    food insecurity: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and
    Yemen.  
-   In May, the United States chaired a Global Food Security Call to
    Action Ministerial and launched the Roadmap for Global Food Security
    – endorsed by 94 countries – which affirms a commitment to act with
    urgency, at scale, and in concert to respond to the urgent food
    security and nutrition needs of millions of people in vulnerable
    situations around the world. Ninety-four countries have endorsed the
    Roadmap and committed to provide immediate humanitarian assistance,
    build resilience of those in vulnerable situations, support social
    protection and safety nets, and strengthen sustainable, resilient,
    and inclusive food systems in line with the objectives of the United
    Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable
    Development Goals, and the objectives of the 2021 UN Food Systems
    Summit. The United States also convened the UN Security Council
    during its May presidency to underscore the intersection of food
    insecurity and conflict, particularly in the context of Russia’s war
    in Ukraine, and to urge the international community to action.  
-   In June, the United States, in coordination with partners, raised
    awareness of growing food insecurity at the World Trade Organization
    (WTO) 12th Ministerial Conference. Key outcomes included: a
    Ministerial Declaration on the Emergency Response to Food
    Insecurity, in which WTO Members committed to take concrete steps to
    facilitate trade and improve the functioning and long-term
    resilience of global markets for food and agriculture; and a
    Ministerial Decision in which Members agreed to exempt World Food
    Programme food purchases from export restrictions and prohibitions.
