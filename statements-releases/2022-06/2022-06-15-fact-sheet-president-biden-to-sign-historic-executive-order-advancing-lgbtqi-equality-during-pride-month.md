title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Sign Historic Executive Order Advancing LGBTQI+\
  \ Equality During Pride\_Month"
---
 
President Biden believes that no one should face discrimination because
of who they are or whom they love. Since President Biden took office, he
has championed the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans and people around the
world, accelerating the march towards full equality.  
  
As President Biden said during his first joint address to Congress, the
President has the back of LGBTQI+ people across the country. That is why
he taking these bold actions and continuing to fight for full equality
for every American – including urging Congress pass the Equality Act and
provide overdue civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ people.   
  
Today, to mark Pride Month, President Biden will sign an Executive Order
Advancing Equality for LGBTQI+ Individuals, and he will welcome LGBTQI+
families, advocates, elected officials, and leaders to the White House
for a reception.   
  
President Biden’s Executive Order builds on the historic progress he has
made for LGBTQI+ people by:  

-   Addressing discriminatory legislative attacks against LGBTQI+
    children and families, directing key agencies to protect families
    and children; 
-   Preventing so-called “conversion therapy” with a historic initiative
    to protect children from the harmful practice;
-   Safeguarding health care, and programs designed to prevent youth
    suicide;
-   Supporting LGBTQI+ children and families by launching a new
    initiative to protect foster youth, prevent homelessness, and
    improve access to federal programs; and
-   Taking new, additional steps to advance LGBTQI+ equality. 

**ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATIVE ATTACKS  
**  
Over 300 anti-LGBTQI+ laws have been introduced in state legislatures
over the past year, and many of them specifically target transgender
children and their parents by banning access to medical care and support
at school. President Biden is addressing these harmful, hateful, and
discriminatory attacks head-on – not only by speaking up for America’s
families, but taking action to stand up to the bullies targeting LGBTQI+
people. 

To help support impacted families, President Biden is charging the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with protecting LGBTQI+
children and families from attacks on their access to health care, and
has instructed HHS to release new sample policies for states on how to
expand access to comprehensive health care for LGBTQI+ patients. The
President is also directing the Department of Education with addressing
the impacts of state laws that target LGBTQI+ students, and has charged
the department with releasing a sample school policy for achieving full
inclusion for LGBTQI+ students. 

**ADDRESSING “CONVERSION THERAPY”  
**  
As a candidate, President Biden pledged to help end so-called
“conversion therapy” – a discredited and dangerous practice that seeks
to suppress or change the sexual orientation or gender identity of
LGBTQI+ people. Today, President Biden is using his executive authority
to launch an initiative to protect children across America and crack
down on this harmful practice, which every major medical association in
the United States has condemned. 

Children who are exposed to so-called “conversion therapy” face higher
rates of attempted suicide and trauma. Numerous states across the
country have already passed bipartisan laws to prevent exposure to
so-called “conversion therapy,” with Republican and Democratic governors
signing state bans on conversion therapy into law. Yet despite these
efforts, many people in the United States and around the world are still
subjected to this practice. 

President Biden is charging HHS with leading an initiative to reduce the
risk of youth exposure to this dangerous practice. HHS will explore
guidance to clarify that federally-funded programs cannot offer
so-called “conversion therapy.” HHS will also increase public awareness
about its harms, provide training and technical assistance to health
care providers, and expand support for services to help survivors. 

President Biden is also encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to
consider whether the practice constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or
practice, and whether to issue consumer warnings or notices. And, he is
directing the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and HHS to develop an
action plan to promote an end to so-called “conversion therapy” around
the world and ensure that U.S. foreign assistance dollars do not fund
the practice.  
  
**SAFEGUARDING HEALTH CARE AND PREVENTING LGBTQI+ YOUTH SUICIDE  
**  
Because of discrimination and bullying, nearly half of LGBTQI+ youth
seriously considered suicide last year. LGBTQI+ people of all ages also
face significant barriers to accessing health care, and LGBTQI+ patients
face significant health disparities. To safeguard access to health care
for LGBTQI+ patients and address the LGBTQI+ youth mental health crisis,
President Biden is charging HHS with taking steps to address the
barriers and exclusionary policies that LGBTQI+ individuals and families
face in accessing quality, affordable, comprehensive health care,
including mental health care, reproductive health care, and HIV
prevention and treatment. The President’s Order charges HHS to work with
states to promote expanded access to gender-affirming care. It also
charges HHS to help prevent LGBTQI+ suicide by expanding youth access to
suicide prevention resources, and to issue new guidance through the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on providing
evidence-informed mental health care for LGBTQI+ youth.   
  
**SUPPORTING LGBTQI+ CHILDREN AND FAMILIES   
**  
LGBTQI+ children and families deserve the same dignity and respect as
all American families. But LGBTQI+ children and families continue to
face significant barriers and discrimination. For LGBTQI+ young people,
family rejection can lead to disproportionately high rates of
homelessness and over-representation in foster care. And for LGBTQI+
parents and households, significant barriers remain in accessing vital
government benefits and services, and achieving housing
security. Providing these young Americans and families with the
resources and support they need will help ensure more children and
families have access to loving homes that decrease the risk of abuse and
suicide.   
President Biden’s Executive Order will:

-   **Address discrimination and barriers faced by LGBTQI+ youth,
    parents, caretakers, and families in foster care. **Although LGBTQI+
    parents play a vital role in ensuring that every child in America
    has a loving home, and are seven times more likely to adopt a child
    from foster care, these parents continue to face barriers and biases
    in the child welfare system. To address these disparities, President
    Biden is charging HHS with strengthening LGBTQI+ non-discrimination
    protections in the foster care system. His Executive Order also
    charges HHS with launching a new initiative to partner with state
    child welfare agencies to improve outcomes for LGBTQI+ youth in
    care; increase training for child welfare personnel on best
    practices for supporting LGBTQI+ youth; promote placements of
    children into environments that will support their sexual
    orientation and gender identity; and study and address the
    disproportionate rates of child removals that LGBTQI+ parents face,
    especially women of color.  
-   **Support families with LGBTQI+ youth. **When youth come out as
    LGBTQI+, parents and family members often seek help to learn how to
    best support their child. When children face rejection by their
    families, they risk higher rates of homelessness and attempted
    suicide. To support families with LGBTQI+ youth, President Biden is
    directing HHS to expand access to voluntary family counseling and
    support programs to help support youth and families. The President’s
    Executive Order also charges the Center for Disease Control and
    Prevention with researching the impacts of family rejection on the
    mental health and long-term wellbeing of LGBTQI+ individuals.  
-   **Review access, and barriers, for families to federal programs and
    benefits. **In spite of important progress in ensuring that same-sex
    married couples can access federal programs, many LGBTQI+ families
    continue to face barriers in accessing vital benefits and services.
    For LGBTQI+ people who have faced family rejection and rely on
    family structures without legal or blood ties, these barriers can be
    particularly pronounced. To strengthen supports for all families,
    the President’s Executive Order directs HHS to conduct a study of
    how current eligibility standards for federal programs impact
    LGBTQI+ and other households, and issue recommendations for more
    inclusive standards. The Executive Order also directs the Office of
    Management and Budget to coordinate with agencies as they seek
    opportunities to implement those recommendations in their programs
    and services.   
-   **Address LGBTQI+ homelessness and housing instability. **President
    Biden is directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development
    with launching a new Working Group on LGBTQI+ Homelessness and
    Housing Equity. That Working Group will lead new efforts to identity
    and address the barriers to housing faced by LGBTQI+ people, provide
    guidance and technical assistance to housing providers on serving
    LGBTQI+ individuals, and seek new funding opportunities for
    culturally appropriate services that address barriers to housing for
    LGBTQI+ individuals.   
-   **Support LGBTQI+ students in our Nation’s schools and educational
    institutions. **The President’s Executive Order directs the
    Department of Education to establish a new Working Group on LGBTQI+
    Students and Families, which will advance policies for states,
    school districts, and other educational institutions to promote safe
    and inclusive learning environments in which all students thrive.  
-   **Support LGBTQI+ youth in juvenile justice systems. **The Executive
    Order charges the Attorney General with establishing a new
    clearinghouse within the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
    Prevention to provide effective training, technical assistance, and
    other resources for jurisdictions to better serve LGBTQI+ youth
    involved in the juvenile justice system. 

**ADDITIONAL STEPS TO ADVANCE LGBTQI+ EQUALITY**  
President Biden’s Executive Order also includes additional new steps to
advance LGBTQI+ equality, including:

-   **Strengthen supports for LGBTQI+ older adults. **Older LGBTQI+
    people face significant rates of discrimination, isolation, and
    poverty. The President’s Executive Order directs HHS to publish a
    “Bill of Rights for LGBTQI+ Older Adults” and new guidance on the
    non-discrimination protections for older adults in long-term care
    settings. It also charges HHS with exploring new rulemaking to
    establish that LGBTQI+ individuals are included in the definition of
    populations of “greatest social need” under the Older Americans
    Act.  
-   **Promote expanded federal data collection on sexual orientation and
    gender identity. **To strengthen the federal collection of sexual
    orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”) data, the President’s
    Executive Order establishes a new federal coordinating committee on
    SOGI data, which will lead efforts across agencies to identify
    opportunities to strengthen SOGI data collection, while safeguarding
    privacy protections and civil rights for LGBTQI+ individuals.

**BUILDING ON HISTORIC PROGRESS**  
  
Today’s announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s
historic progress to advance LGBTQI+ equality since taking office,
including:

-   **Strengthening civil rights protections. **On his first day in
    office, President Biden signed an [Executive

    discharged or separated, solely on the basis of their HIV-positive
    status. The Department of Veterans Affairs also strengthened
    services and supports for LGBTQI+ veterans, including by removing
    the outdated ban on comprehensive gender-affirming care for
    transgender veterans.  
-   **Fighting back against state-level attacks on LGBTQI+
    children. **The Department of Justice has intervened and filed
