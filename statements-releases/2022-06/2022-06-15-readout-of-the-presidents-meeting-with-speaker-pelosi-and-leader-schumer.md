title: "Readout of the President\u2019s Meeting with Speaker Pelosi and Leader\_Schumer"
---
 
This afternoon, President Biden hosted Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer
to talk about their shared agenda of tackling inflation and lowering
prices and transitioning from a historic economic recovery to stable,
steady growth. Thanks to their shared leadership, weâ€™ve seen
unprecedented job and small business creation. They discussed their
plans for fighting the global problem of inflation that is affecting
every major economy, such as bringing down prescription drug and energy
costs, and adding to the historic deficit reduction we have
accomplished.
