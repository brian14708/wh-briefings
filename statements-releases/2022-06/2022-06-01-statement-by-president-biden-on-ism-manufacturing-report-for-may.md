title: "Statement by President\_Biden on ISM Manufacturing Report for\_May"
---
 
I have long said that making more in the United States is key to any
serious strategy to prevent the kinds of supply disruptions that have
led to price spikes for American families this year. When we make more
here at home, we make our supply chains more resilient and help avoid
the kinds of disruptions that have driven up prices in the wake of the
pandemic. It is why my economic plan has prioritized American
manufacturing and resilient supply chains, and has helped usher in an
historic American manufacturing boom. Today, we learned that American
manufacturing continued to grow in May. Since I took office, we’ve added
545,000 manufacturing jobs—and more manufacturing jobs were created in
2021 than in any year in nearly 30 years. This didn’t happen by
accident—this is a direct result of my economic plan to grow the economy
from the bottom up and middle out. Congress should take the next step by
swiftly passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which is going to help
lower prices, and make sure that the next generation of innovation and
advanced manufacturing happens right here in America, with American
workers.
