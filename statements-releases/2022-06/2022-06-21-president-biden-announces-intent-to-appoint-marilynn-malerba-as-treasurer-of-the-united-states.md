Today, President Biden announces his intent to appoint Marilynn Malerba

The Treasurer of the United States directly oversees the U.S. Mint, the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Fort Knox, and is a key liaison with
the Federal Reserve. Chief Malerba will also serve as a senior advisor
to the Secretary of the Treasury in the areas of community development
and public engagement.

appointment made by the Tribeâ€™s Council of Elders. Prior to becoming
Chief, she served as Chairwoman of the Mohegan Tribal Council, and
served in Tribal Government as Executive Director of Health and Human
Services. Preceding her work for the Mohegan Tribe, Malerba had a
lengthy career as a registered nurse, ultimately serving as the Director
of Cardiology and Pulmonary Services at Lawrence & Memorial Hospital.
Additionally, Malerba currently serves as a member of the Treasury
Tribal Advisory Committee. This seven-member committee advises the
Secretary of the Treasury on significant matters related to the taxation
of Indians, the training of Internal Revenue Service field agents, and
the provisions of training and technical assistance to Native American
financial officers.
