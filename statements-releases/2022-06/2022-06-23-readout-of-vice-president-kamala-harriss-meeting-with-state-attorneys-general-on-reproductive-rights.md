title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with State Attorneys\
  \ General on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened Attorneys General from
seven states to discuss the fight for reproductive rights. The
roundtable followed recent meetings about reproductive rights that the
Vice President held with health care providers, faith leaders, and
constitutional law, privacy, and technology experts, and was part of the
Administration’s work to build coalitions and preparedness in response
to the attack on reproductive rights.  
   
The Vice President told the Attorneys General that they play a pivotal
role in defending a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body.
She spoke about how Attorneys General have a role in protecting the
health, safety, and wellbeing of the women in their state — and as a
result, can consider the various authorities they have to defend
reproductive rights and freedoms, including access to abortion. The
officials shared the steps they have taken so far to protect access to
reproductive health care in their states, and they discussed their
powers under their authority as their state’s chief legal officers.  
   
The Vice President thanked the Attorneys General for their leadership in
safeguarding our nation’s most fundamental rights and freedoms. She
encouraged them to continue striving for new ways to protect
reproductive rights.
