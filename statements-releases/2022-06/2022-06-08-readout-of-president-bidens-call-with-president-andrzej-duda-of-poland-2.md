President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Andrzej Duda
of Poland.  Following President Biden’s trip to Poland in March, the
leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to further strengthening our
bilateral security and economic cooperation. They also discussed their
ongoing support for the people and government of Ukraine in response to
Russian aggression. President Biden underscored the U.S. commitment to
the security of Poland and NATO’s eastern flank, sending his best wishes
for a successful Bucharest Nine (B9) Summit later this week.
