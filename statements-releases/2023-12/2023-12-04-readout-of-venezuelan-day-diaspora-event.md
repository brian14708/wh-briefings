Latino leaders from the Venezuelan community to discuss the Biden-Harris
Administration’s ongoing efforts and investments within the Latino
community.  
  
During the first panel, participants discussed the Biden-Harris
Administration’s effort to expand legal pathways, including the
expansion and redesignation of Venezuela TPS as well as the Cuban,
Nicaraguan, Haitian, and Venezuelan parole program, and shared their
personal stories about these programs.   
  
In the second panel, Biden-Harris Administration officials discussed how
President Biden’s economic agenda Bidenomics is helping to create
economic opportunities for Latinos and outlined initiatives available
for equitable access of government programs including the Department of
Health and Human Services’ Language Access Plan, the Small Business
Digital Alliance, and the Hispanic Initiative for Educational
Excellence.  
  
Speakers also uplifted the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to
