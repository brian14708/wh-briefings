title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Agreement Reached at\_COP28"
---
 
Eight years ago, the world came together in Paris to announce a historic
commitment to address climate change and protect the planet for future
generations. On my very first day in office, I took action to return the
United States to the Paris Agreement, restoring America’s global climate
leadership.   
   
Since then, my Administration has set the United States on an
unprecedented course to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad –
securing the largest climate investment in the history of the world,
unlocking clean energy breakthroughs that will power a clean economy and
create thousands of jobs, and rallying leaders around the world to raise
our collective ambition.  
   
Today, at COP28, world leaders reached another historic milestone –
committing, for the first time, to transition away from the fossil fuels
that jeopardize our planet and our people, agreeing to triple renewable
energy globally by 2030, and more. While there is still substantial work
ahead of us to keep the 1.5 degree C goal within reach, today’s outcome
puts us one significant step closer.    
   
But we didn’t just arrive at this inflection point. Vulnerable countries
have called on major economies to take urgent action. And in every
corner of the world, young people are making their voices heard,
demanding action from those in power. They remind us that a better, more
equitable world is within our grasp. We will not let them down.  
   
The climate crisis is the existential threat of our time. But as America
has always done, we will turn crisis into opportunity – creating clean
energy jobs, revitalizing communities, and improving quality of life.  
   
It is our collective responsibility to build a safer, more hopeful
future for our children. We can’t be complacent. We must keep going, and
we will.
