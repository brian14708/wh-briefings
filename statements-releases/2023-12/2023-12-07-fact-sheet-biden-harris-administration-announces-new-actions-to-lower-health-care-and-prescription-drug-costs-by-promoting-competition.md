title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Lower\
  \ Health Care and Prescription Drug Costs by Promoting\_Competition"
---
 
President Biden believes that health care should be a right, not a
privilege. For too long, corporate special interests and trickle-down
economics have allowed Big Pharma to make record profits, while millions
of Americans struggle to afford health care and prescription drugs to
treat common and chronic conditions. As part of the President’s
Bidenomics agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration is cracking down on
price gouging and taking on special interests to lower costs for
consumers and ensure every American has access to high-quality,
affordable health care.  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to
promote competition in health care and support lowering prescription
drug costs for American families, including the release of a proposed
framework for agencies on the exercise of march-in rights on
taxpayer-funded drugs and other inventions, which specifies that price
can be a factor in considering whether a drug is accessible to the
public. The Administration believes taxpayer-funded medications should
be reasonably available and affordable. These actions build on the steps
the Administration has already taken to lower health care costs,
including capping the cost of insulin at $35 per product per month for
seniors, finally allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug
prices, requiring drug companies to pay rebates to Medicare if they
raise prices faster than inflation, and locking in $800 per year in
health insurance savings for 15 million Americans under President
Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

***Lowering Prescription Drug Costs  
***  
Currently the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies control around [70% of
industry revenues](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126). Other parts
of the health care industry also face limited competition. Over [75% of
Americans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-your-rising-health-care-bills-secret-hospital-deals-that-squelch-competition-1537281963)
live in highly concentrated hospital markets, and just three or fewer
issuers of individual health insurance control [80% of the
market](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105672.pdf) in 44 states.  In
addition, five insurers control [over
70%](https://acdis.org/articles/news-growing-lack-competition-medicare-advantage-markets-study-shows#:~:text=The%20five%20largest%20insurers%20by%20MA%20market%20share,%2811%25%29%2C%20Kaiser%20Permanente%20%287%25%29%2C%20and%20Elevance%20Health%20%286%25%29.)
of the Medicare Advantage market.  This consolidation contributes to
higher costs for taxpayers, lower wages for health care workers, and
[worse quality of
care](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Gaynor_PP_FINAL.pdf)
for patients.  
  
New research released by the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) finds that a lack of competition in drug markets is highly
correlated with higher prices. Among the highest priced drugs (i.e.,
those in the top 10% of price per prescription), 89% of small molecule
drugs and 100% of biological products had only one manufacturer.
Meanwhile, nearly [three in ten
individuals](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-july-2023-the-publics-views-of-new-prescription-weight-loss-drugs-and-prescription-drug-costs/)
struggle to pay for the drugs they need.

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a new action to support
lowering prescription drug costs and increase Americans’ access to
life-saving medications:

-   **Promoting equitable access to lower-priced taxpayer-funded
    drugs. **Taxpayers have spent [hundreds of
    billions](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP_133-Cleary-et-al-Govt-innovation.pdf__;!!FiG2giev53vN!_KitF4DERv7fUrAkMj4ruEhFlA4bf7JgJAUyUCm9Hp8VMZkY8GWm-etXVzOOjlnZkX_eSe9itY3G7mhDJIAztsR80R9ozwqe$) of
    dollars on research catalyzing the discovery and development of new
    prescription drugs. The Biden-Harris Administration
    believes taxpayer-funded drugs and other taxpayer-funded inventions
    should be available and affordable to the public. When an invention
    is made using taxpayer funds, under certain circumstances march-in
    authority under the Bayh-Dole Act enables the federal government to
    license the invention to another party. The prior Administration
    proposed a rule preventing the government from exercising this
    authority on the basis of high price alone. The Biden-Harris
    Administration decided not to finalize that proposal earlier this
    year, consistent with President Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting
    Competition in the American Economy. Today, the Department of
    Commerce (DOC) and HHS released a proposed framework for agencies on
    the exercise of march-in rights that specifies for the first time
    that price can be a factor in determining that a drug or other
    taxpayer-funded invention is not accessible to the public. DOC and
    HHS invite public input on how this framework can promote access to
    taxpayer-funded inventions, including treatments for patients, while
    promoting innovation.

***Scrutinizing Anticompetitive Acquisitions and Anticompetitive
Practices  
***  
Consolidation in health care markets has accelerated in recent decades,
too often leading to higher costs, worse quality, and less access to
care—particularly in rural areas. For example, a [review of hospital
merger
studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283910115_The_Impact_of_Hospital_Consolidation_-_Update) finds
that mergers in concentrated markets led to price increases often
exceeding 20%. Consolidation has also led to a rapid decline in
independent physician practices, with research finding that patients of
hospital-owned practices pay nearly [$300
more](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/saving-independent-medical-practice-is-key-to-keeping-us-healthcare-affordable-in-the-post-covid19-era.html)
for similar care than at independent physician practices. At the same
time, private-equity ownership in the health care industry has
ballooned, with approximately [$750 billion in
deals](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Private-Equity-I-Healthcare-Report-FINAL.pdf)
between 2010 and 2020—in sectors including, but not limited to,

and [lower quality

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new efforts to stop
anticompetitive mergers and anticompetitive practices by dominant
corporations in health care markets:

-   **Launching a cross-government public inquiry into corporate greed
    in health care.** The Biden-Harris Administration believes that the
    health care system should serve patients, not corporate profiteers.
    The Administration is concerned that our health care system is
    increasingly being financialized, with corporate owners like
    private-equity firms and others maximizing their profits at the
    expense of patients’ health and safety, while increasing costs for
    patients and taxpayers alike. The Department of Justice (DOJ), the
    Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and HHS will issue a joint Request
    for Information to seek input about how private equity and other
    corporations’ increasing power and control of our health care is
    affecting Americans. The agencies will use this joint Request for
    Information to identify areas for future regulation and enforcement
    prioritization, and they will continue to work together on case
    referrals, reciprocal training programs, data-sharing, and further
    development of additional health care competition policy
    initiatives. As part of this effort, HHS will appoint a Chief
    Competition Officer and DOJ’s Antitrust Division and FTC will name
    Counsels for Health Care to lead these efforts.  
-   **Identifying anticompetitive “roll ups” that currently evade
    antitrust review**. Businesses, including private equity firms,
    health insurers, and health systems sometimes use a “roll up”
    strategy, in which a series of relatively small acquisitions can
    lead to the consolidation of a market and contribute to worse
    patient outcomes while increasing taxpayer costs. These serial
    acquisitions may violate the antitrust laws. However, each
    individual acquisition may fall below the size thresholds for
    reporting the prospective deal to the antitrust enforcement agencies
    before consummating the acquisition—making it more challenging for
    the enforcement agencies to identify anticompetitive transactions at
    the outset. Today, HHS, DOJ, and FTC announced that they will, to
    the maximum extent possible, engage in data sharing to help the
    antitrust enforcers identify potentially anticompetitive
    transactions that might otherwise evade ready review by antitrust
    enforcers.    
-   **Increasing ownership transparency.** HHS, through the Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has taken unprecedented action
    to shed light on ownership trends in health care. The Biden-Harris
    Administration is the first to make ownership data on hospitals,
    nursing homes, hospice providers, and home health agencies publicly
    available, and today, CMS is releasing, for the first time,
    ownership data on Federal Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health
    Clinics on data.cms.gov. Making ownership information transparent
    allows for identification of common owners with histories of poor
    performance, analysis of trends on how market consolidation impacts
    consumers, and evaluation of the relationships between ownership and
    changes in health care costs and outcomes.  
-   **Increasing Medicare Advantage transparency.** Currently, about 50%
    of Medicare enrollment is in Medicare Advantage and the government
    is expected to spend over [$7 trillion on Medicare
    Advantage](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/medicare-advantage-overview#:~:text=Payments%20to%20MA%20plans%20more%20than%20doubled%20between,pay%20MA%20health%20insurance%20companies%20over%20%247%20trillion.)
    over the next decade. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed
    to ensuring Medicare Advantage insurance plans best meet the needs
    of people with Medicare, there is timely access to care, and the
    market has healthy competition. To support this work, CMS must have
    comprehensive and high-quality Medicare Advantage programmatic data,
    including understanding the effects of market shifts on consumers
    and care outcomes. CMS has taken steps to improve Medicare Advantage
    data transparency and today, it is announcing a new phase of this
    work, which will start with soliciting information from the public
    early next year to strengthen CMS’ data capabilities and Medicare
    Advantage transparency efforts.

***Building on Past Actions to Increase Health Care Competition and
Lower Prescription Drug Costs  
***  
Today’s announcements build on steps the Administration has already
taken to lower health care costs, increase competition, and improve the
quality and availability of care across the health care industry. These
include:

-   **Negotiating and lowering drug prices.** Thanks to President
    Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the Administration has announced
    [10 prescription
    drugs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-first-ten-drugs-selected-for-medicare-price-negotiation/)
    for which Medicare will negotiate prices directly with participating
    manufacturers. These drugs cost people with Medicare $3.4 billion
    out of pocket in 2022. This builds on other progress to lower
    prescription drug costs. Individuals with Medicare can now receive
    certain vaccines for free under the President’s lower cost
    prescription drug law, which previously would have cost [an average
    of
    $70](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/15/seniors-people-with-disabilities-likely-save-over-230-million-vaccines-thanks-inflation-reduction-act-according-new-hhs-report.html) in
    out-of-pocket costs. The Inflation Reduction Act also capped the
    cost of insulin at $35 per product per month for almost four million
    seniors and others on Medicare with diabetes, which can lead [to
    hundreds of
    dollars](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/24/new-hhs-report-finds-major-savings-americans-who-use-insulin-thanks-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act.html) in
    savings for a month’s supply.  
-   **Stopping Big Pharma tactics that raise prices for working
    families.** In September, the FTC [issued an enforcement policy
    statement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-issues-policy-statement-brand-pharmaceutical-manufacturers-improper-listing-patents-food-drug)
    explaining that Big Pharma companies may face legal action if they
    delay entry of generic competitors with improper patent listings in
    the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) publication “Approved
    Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” commonly
    known as the “Orange Book.” When a brand pharmaceutical company
    improperly lists a patent in the Orange Book, it may lead to a
    30-month statutory stay that blocks the approval of competing drug
    products, including lower-cost generic alternatives. Such improper
    listings [may delay competition and raise
    prices](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2023.09.14-statement-of-chair-lina-m-khan-at-sept-ocm-re-orange-book.pdf)
    for life-saving products like asthma inhalers. FTC and FDA are
    [working](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/11/ftc-challenges-more-100-patents-improperly-listed-fdas-orange-book)
    to address such improper listings, with FTC [announcing last
    month](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/11/ftc-challenges-more-100-patents-improperly-listed-fdas-orange-book)
    that it is using FDA’s regulatory Orange Book patent listing dispute
    process to challenge more than 100 patents listed for brand-name
    asthma inhalers, epinephrine autoinjectors, and other drug
    products.  
-   **Cracking down on anticompetitive and anti-consumer practices in
    Medicare Advantage.** Medicare Advantage—which serves over [30
    million](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2023-enrollment-update-and-key-trends/)
    American seniors and people with disabilities—is increasingly
    dominated by just a few large national plans. Last month, HHS
    announced new steps to stop predatory marketing and steering of
    patients to Medicare Advantage plans that may not best meet their
    needs. HHS, through CMS, [proposed a
    rule](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2023-24118.pdf)
    that would, if finalized as proposed, stop large insurance plans
    from offering brokers and agents lavish compensation—such as cash
    bonuses, volume bonuses, and perks—and working with marketing
    middlemen who are more likely to contract with larger insurers,
    leading to steerage of patients to plans based on compensation to
    the broker or agent, rather than based on the patients’ best
    interests. The agency also proposed new steps to ensure seniors and
    people with disabilities can actually access supplemental benefits
    like hearing and dental coverage that these large plans market and
    help drive up Medicare costs—so that they aren’t merely marketing
    ploys. In addition, CMS will continue to implement updates to
    Medicare Advantage payment that improve payment accuracy, address
    gaming, and recover overpayments. Addressing overpayment in Medicare
    Advantage will help to make the market more competitive between
    Medicare Advantage plans and create a more level playing field
    between Medicare Advantage and Traditional Medicare.  
-   **Making hearing aids available over the counter.** To lower the
    price of hearing aids and expand access, President Biden’s Executive
    Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy called on the
    FDA to act promptly to make hearing aids available over the counter,
    without a prescription. That is now a reality. Under a [final
    rule](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-historic-rule-enabling-access-over-counter-hearing-aids-millions-americans)
    issued by the FDA, hearing aids [are now on store
    shelves](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/17/fact-sheet-cheaper-hearing-aids-now-in-stores-thanks-to-biden-harris-administration-competition-agenda/)
    across the country—for thousands of dollars less than before. The
    rule is also spurring competition [among
    providers,](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/health/hearing-aids-dementia.html)
    leading to new features and models.   
-   **Cracking down on nursing homes that endanger resident safety.** In
    recent years, there has been a disturbing trend towards private
    equity firms and other large corporate owners purchasing nursing
    homes and slashing levels of staff to maximize profits. The
    Biden-Harris Administration has taken [numerous
    steps](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-steps-to-crack-down-on-nursing-homes-that-endanger-resident-safety/)
    to crack down on nursing homes that put the well-being of their
    residents at risk, including proposing a rule that, if finalized as
    proposed, would establish a federal floor for safe staffing levels.
    In addition, last month CMS [finalized a
    rule](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/disclosures-ownership-and-additional-disclosable-parties-information-skilled-nursing-facilities-and-0)
    that will provide the public with more information about who owns a
    nursing home—including whether facilities are owned by a private
    equity company or a real estate investment trust—so that families
    can make more informed decisions about where to seek nursing home
    care for their loved ones.  
-   **Reforming the organ transplant system.** President Biden recently
    [signed a bipartisan
    law](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2023/09/22/bill-signed-h-r-2544/),
    the Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
    Act, to break up the monopoly that has controlled the organ
    transplant system for its entire nearly four decade history. HHS
    will harness competition with the intent to make multiple awards to
    different entities to benefit from best-in-class vendors and provide
    a more efficient system that strengthens oversight and improves
    patient safety.  
-   **Addressing anticompetitive misuse of the patent system.** The FDA
    and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are [working
    together](https://www.uspto.gov/blog/director/entry/the-biden-administration-is-acting)
    on a robust set of initiatives aimed at protecting and promoting
    U.S. innovation while advancing marketplace competition that can
    lower drug prices and expand access.  
-   **Banning non-compete agreements that trap health care workers and
    others.** The FTC [proposed a
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-which-hurt-workers-harm-competition)
    to ban employers from using non-compete clauses. The estimated [18%
    of
    workers](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/226/Non_Compete_Contracts_Econimic_Effects_and_Policy_Implications_MAR2016.pdf#:~:text=Non-compete%20agreements%20have%20become%20quite%20common%20among%20a,under%20one%20at%20some%20point%20during%20their%20career.)
    covered by non-compete clauses include many across the health care
    industry such as doctors and nurses, who will have more employment
    opportunities if the rule is finalized.  
-   **Promoting competition in eyeglasses.** Bundling eye exams with the
    purchase of eyeglasses reduces competition in the market for
    eyeglasses—raising prices and reducing options for consumers. The
    FTC [proposed an update to its Eyeglass
    Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/ftc-proposes-updating-eyeglass-rule-require-prescribers-get-signed-confirmation-when-providing?utm_source=govdelivery)
    to make sure that eye doctors give patients their prescriptions
    immediately after their eye exam—facilitating consumers’ ability to
    choose where to get their eyeglass prescriptions filled.  
-   **Developing new payment models for doctors including supporting
    independent doctors.** Succeeding in value-based care can be
    challenging for small, independent physician practices. Beginning
    July 1, 2024, the CMS Innovation Center’s Making Care Primary Model
    will provide a pathway for primary care clinicians to gradually
    adopt prospective, population-based payments that support the
    delivery of advanced primary care.  
-   **Improving transparency of hospital charges**. [CMS hospital price
    transparency
    regulations](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/hospital-price-transparency-fact-sheet)
    lay the foundation for a patient-driven health care system by making
    hospitals’ standard charges’ data available to the public.  Last
    month, CMS strengthened these regulations to require hospitals to
    make charges available in a more standardized manner to streamline
    enforcement capabilities. This will help the public learn how much
    an insurance company pays for a particular hospital service, for
    third parties to develop consumer-friendly materials, for hospitals
    to comply, and for CMS to enforce the regulations.
