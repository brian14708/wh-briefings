title: "Statement from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on U.S.\_Steel"
---
 
The President believes U.S. Steel was an integral part of our arsenal of
democracy in WWII and remains a core component of the overall domestic
steel production that is critical to our national security. And he has
been clear that we welcome manufacturers across the world building their
futures in America with American jobs and American workers. However, he
also believes the purchase of this iconic American-owned company by a
foreign entity—even one from a close ally—appears to deserve serious
scrutiny in terms of its potential impact on national security and
supply chain reliability. This looks like the type of transaction that
the interagency committee on foreign investment Congress empowered and
the Biden Administration strengthened is set up to carefully
investigate. This Administration will be ready to look carefully at the
findings of any such investigation and to act if appropriate.  
   
Steel is the backbone of American manufacturing on everything from
infrastructure to cars to our clean energy future. Since President Biden
took office, 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created. Because of
President Biden’s policies, factories are coming back home, jobs are
coming back home, American companies are making things in America again.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure law, Inflation Reduction Act, and Chips
and Science Act are fueling a Made in America manufacturing rebound.
President Biden has taken action to protect the U.S. steel companies
against unfair and market-distorting trade practices in China and other
countries.  
   
The United Steelworkers (USW) has been a leader in all of these efforts,
and are an example of why union leadership is critical in building the
economy from the middle out and bottom up. President Biden believes
union workers are the best workers in the world. And that’s why his
Administration is committed to doing everything it can to ensure
steelworkers can compete on a level playing field, through policies that
both combat unfair trade practices and recognize that a strong U.S
domestic steel industry is vital to our economy and national security.
