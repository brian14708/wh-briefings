title: "Readout of White\_House Convening of CEOs of RSV Immunization Manufacturing\_\
  Companies"
---
 
On Tuesday, senior Administration officials convened the CEOs of the
three principal companies that together manufacture RSV immunizations
for infants, including Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and Thermo Fisher
Scientific. In the meeting, senior Administration officials once again
stressed the importance of working with urgency to meet demand and
increase availability of RSV immunizations for infants through the
commercial market this viral season. The call follows several
engagements with manufacturers on increasing the availability of RSV
immunizations for infants. Following these conversations, last week RSV
immunization
manufacturers [confirmed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/14/readout-of-latest-white-house-meeting-with-rsv-immunization-manufacturers/) that
230,000 additional doses of RSV immunizations for infants would be made
available in January, on top of the 77,000 additional doses which
were [released](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/28/readout-of-white-house-meeting-with-rsv-immunization-manufacturers/) in November.
Senior Administration officials and manufacturer CEOs also agreed on the
importance of continued communication during manufacturers’ planning for
the next 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.
