President Joe Biden and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico
spoke this morning about ongoing efforts to manage migratory flows in
the Western Hemisphere, building on the Los Angeles Declaration for
Migration and Protection that President Biden launched in Los Angeles in
June 2022. The President and President López Obrador agreed that
additional enforcement actions are urgently needed so that key ports of
entry can be reopened across our shared border.  President Biden has
asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security
Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz
Sherwood-Randall to travel to Mexico in the coming days to meet with
President López Obrador to discuss further actions that can be taken
together to address current border challenges.
