title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Sullivan Welcoming Appointment of\
  \ Sigrid Kaag as UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for\_Gaza"
---
 
Yesterday’s announcement appointing Sigrid Kaag as United Nations Senior
Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza is an important
step as we continue to work with the UN as a critical partner in
the delivery and distribution of life-saving humanitarian assistance in
Gaza. The United States is the largest financial supporter of the
humanitarian assistance efforts to support Palestinian civilians who are
caught in the middle of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. We
welcome Ms. Kaag’s leadership and look forward to working together
closely to increase the flow of aid into Gaza, and ensure safety and
security for the aid delivery and the humanitarian staff providing the
life-saving support to those in need.
