Yesterday, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy
Council Jennifer Klein, as well as other senior officials from the
Gender Policy Council and the National Security Council, met with Dr.
Cochav Elkayam-Levy, Chair of Israel’s Civil Commission on October 7
Crimes by Hamas Against Women and Children. From the earliest days of
the conflict, the Biden-Harris Administration has been deeply concerned
by the horrific reports of sexual violence used by Hamas against Israeli
women and children as part of the October 7 attacks. As
[President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/05/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-reception-weston-ma/)
Biden has again underscored, the world cannot look away from the
accounts by survivors and witnesses detailing the brutality of that
day.  
   
During the meeting, Dr. Elkayam-Levy spoke about her work to gather
testimony and document evidence of the events of October 7 and develop a
comprehensive accounting of gender-based violence committed by Hamas.
The group discussed the imperative to unequivocally denounce sexual
violence by Hamas, and the need for broad commitment across the
international community to hold perpetrators accountable and support
survivors. Director Klein reiterated the President’s commitment to
exercising all financial, diplomatic and legal tools to address sexual
violence in conflict, and the ongoing efforts by the Administration to
secure the release of the women and girls that continue to be held as
hostages by Hamas.
