title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Launch of the National Law Enforcement\
  \ Accountability\_Database"

As part of my Administration’s executive order on policing, we committed
to create a first of its kind database to track records of law
enforcement misconduct so that agencies are able to hire the best
personnel. Today, I am fulfilling that promise by launching the National
Law Enforcement Accountability Database. This database will ensure that
records of serious misconduct by federal law enforcement officers are
readily available to agencies considering hiring those officers. We are
also working to allow and encourage state, Tribal, local, and
territorial law enforcement agencies to make available and access
similar records as part of their hiring processes.  
   
In May 2022, I signed this executive order to help rebuild trust and
deliver the most significant police reform in decades. Since then, we’ve
taken critical steps towards effective, accountable policing, including
by requiring that federal law enforcement agencies ban chokeholds,
strengthening use-of-force policies, restricting no-knock warrants, and
directing other measures to advance effective, accountable policing that
increases public safety.  
   
Protecting public safety depends on trust between law enforcement and
the communities they serve. By building trust, we can strengthen public
safety and we can more effectively fight crime in our communities. The
executive order is a measure of what we can do together to heal the very
soul of this nation; to address the profound fear and trauma that
particularly Black Americans have experienced for generations; and to
channel that private pain and public outrage into progress on behalf of
all communities.    
   
But we know implementing real and lasting change at the state and local
levels requires Congress to act. I urge Congress to pass the George
Floyd Justice in Policing Act to advance accountability, transparency,
and public trust in law enforcement across the nation. Send it to my
desk and I will sign it.
