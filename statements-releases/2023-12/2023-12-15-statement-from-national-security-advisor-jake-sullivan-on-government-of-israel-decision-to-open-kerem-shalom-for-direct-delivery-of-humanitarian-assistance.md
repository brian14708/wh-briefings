title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Government of Israel\
  \ Decision to Open Kerem Shalom for Direct Delivery of Humanitarian\_Assistance"
---
 
Before departing Israel, I was informed by my counterpart, Israeli
National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, that the Government of Israel
has taken the decision to open its border crossing at Kerem Shalom for
direct delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in
Gaza. We welcome this significant step. President Biden raised this
issue in recent phone calls with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and it was an
important topic of discussion during my visit to Israel over the past
two days. The United States remains committed to expanding and
sustaining the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. We will
continue to work closely with Egypt and other partners on the delivery
and distribution of humanitarian assistance through Rafah crossing, and
we hope that this new opening will ease congestion and help facilitate
the delivery of life-saving assistance to those who need it urgently in
Gaza.
