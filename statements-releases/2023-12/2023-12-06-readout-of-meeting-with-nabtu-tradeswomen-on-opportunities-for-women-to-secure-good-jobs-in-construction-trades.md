title: "Readout of Meeting with NABTU Tradeswomen on Opportunities for Women to Secure\
  \ Good Jobs in Construction\_Trades"
---
 
On Monday, National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard, Domestic Policy
Advisor Neera Tanden, and Investing in America Chief Economist Heather
Boushey met with a group of union tradeswomen and North America’s
Building Trades Unions (NABTU) representatives. They discussed
opportunities and challenges for women in the skilled construction
trades and how the Biden-Harris Administration is working to help women
enter and succeed in good construction jobs—including the importance of
investing in flexible child care and other supportive services,
expanding pre-apprenticeship programs, strengthening mentoring
initiatives, and confronting discrimination and harassment.  
   
President Biden’s Investing in America agenda—including the American
Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and
Inflation Reduction Act—is creating millions of good-paying jobs across
the nation, most of which don’t require a college degree. The
Biden-Harris Administration is using all tools available to ensure these
investments encourage strong union protections, equity, and training.
Under the President’s leadership, we’ve added [670,000
construction](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USCONS) jobs since
January 2021, creating a nationwide demand for skilled trades. These are
well-paying, union jobs that provide a living wage and a path for
economic mobility.  
   
This past year saw the highest participation rate of women in the
workforce to date, yet women make up only [14
percent](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t21.htm) of the
construction workforce and 4 percent of the trades. Participants noted
that President Biden’s Investing in America agenda creates an
opportunity to attract more women into the construction sector while
meeting the demand for highly skilled workers. Recruiting and retaining
women for these good jobs in the trades is critical to rebuilding our
nation’s infrastructure, expanding the manufacturing boom, and
accelerating the clean energy revolution. The Biden-Harris
Administration is promoting supportive services, such as [child
care](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2021/child-care-funding-released-american-rescue-plan),
and launched five Workforce Hubs across the country over the last year
to create new pipelines to good jobs created by public and private
sector investments mobilized by the Administration’s economic agenda.
President Biden has also secured [historic
funding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/16/biden-harris-administration-roadmap-to-support-good-jobs/)
to expand and diversify registered apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship
programs, doubling down on programs that we know work to bring more
people into the trades. Companies receiving funding through the CHIPS
and Science Act are [required to provide child
care](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/08/icymi-experts-agree-chips-manufacturing-and-national-security-bolstered-by-childcare/)
in order to make these good jobs accessible. The Department of Labor’s
[Megaprojects
Program](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2023/03/14/the-biden-harris-administration-advances-equal-pay-and-promotes-gender-equity-through-president-bidens-invest-in-america-agenda/)
is providing support for equal employment opportunities and
non-discrimination practices at large federal construction sites. The
President has also signed an [Executive Order on the Use of Project
Labor
Agreements](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/02/04/executive-order-on-use-of-project-labor-agreements-for-federal-construction-projects/),
requiring project labor agreements with limited exceptions for Federal
contractors on construction projects.
