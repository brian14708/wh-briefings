title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Record 2024 Affordable Care Act Health\
  \ Care\_Enrollment"

The Affordable Care Act is more popular than ever, and Affordable Care
Act coverage is more affordable than ever. More Americans have signed up
for health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces
than ever before. With nearly a month left in open enrollment, more than
19 million people have signed up for coverage, breaking all previous
records. Enrollment has grown by more than 7 million people since I took
office. 

Thanks to policies I signed into law, millions of Americans are saving
hundreds or thousands of dollars on health insurance premiums. Right
now, four out five Americans who sign up for health insurance through
the Affordable Care Act can find health care coverage for $10 a month or
less.

Extreme Republicans want to stop these efforts in their tracks. While
I’ve called for making lower premiums permanent, they’ve repeatedly
pushed to repeal my Affordable Care Act improvements. That would raise
costs for millions of people, especially older Americans and small
business owners who rely on the marketplace for their coverage. And
that’s just a stepping stone toward Republicans’ larger plan to repeal
the Affordable Care Act, just as my predecessor repeatedly tried and
failed to do. At every turn, extreme Republicans continue to side with
special interests to keep prescription drug prices high and to deny
millions of people health coverage.

I won’t let that happen on my watch. My Administration will continue
fighting to expand health coverage and lower prescription drug costs for
all – because every family deserves the dignity and peace of mind that
comes with health insurance. And I’ll continue to encourage all
Americans to visit HealthCare.gov before January 16th, 2024 to sign up
for health coverage for this coming year.
