title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Death of American Service\_Members"
---
 
Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the loss of eight American
service members when their aircraft crashed off the coast of Japan last
week during a routine training mission. Since then, we were focused on
search and rescue, which ended today after an extensive week-long
effort.Â  Our service members and their families are the backbone of our
nation. We owe them everything. Jill and I are praying for the families
and friends who lost a loved one in this terrible accident. We are also
grateful to the Government of Japan for assisting in the search and
rescue and ongoing recovery efforts. Our entire nation mourns this
tragic loss.
