title: "JOINT FACT SHEET: Launching the U.S.-ROK Next Generation Critical and Emerging\
  \ Technologies\_Dialogue"
---
 
Today, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and the Republic of
Korea (ROK) National Security Advisor Cho Tae-yong chaired the inaugural
U.S.-ROK Next Generation Critical and Emerging Technologies (CET)
Dialogue in Seoul.  The launch of the Next Generation CET Dialogue
fulfills a commitment that President Biden and President Yoon made
during the April 2023 State Visit to upgrade bilateral technology
cooperation as the two countries take monumental strides to modernize
the U.S.-ROK alliance, now in its 70<sup>th</sup> year.   
  
National Security Advisors Sullivan and Cho underscored their intent to
anchor the initiative in strategic technologies that will be of greatest
consequence to bolstering economic prosperity; enhancing resilience
against supply chain disruptions; and securing competitive advantages
for our two nations and like-minded partners.  At the outset, the Next
Generation CET Dialogue will drive cooperation across six main strategic
technology areas, including semiconductor supply chains and technology;
biotechnology; batteries and clean energy technology; quantum science
and technology; digital connectivity; and artificial intelligence.  The
National Security Advisors also highlighted the crucial importance of
aligning and adapting our technology protection toolkits, including the
recently announced Disruptive Technology Protection Network and
investment screening mechanisms, as an important effort to prevent the
leakage of sensitive and dual-use technologies.  
  
In addition to the National Security Advisors, the Next Generation CET
Dialogue featured high-level representation from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Ministry of Science and Information and Communication
Technologies, the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the Ministry
of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry of Education on the ROK side. 
They were joined by senior officials from the Department of State, the
Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the White House
Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, and the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy.  The two sides committed to
carrying forward the Next Generation CET Dialogue as an
outcomes-oriented, whole-of-government endeavor across the innovation
value chain to advance high-level CET policy priorities.    
  
During the inaugural CET Dialogue, the United States and the ROK
welcomed enhanced cooperation between our governments, industry, and
academia across the following domains:  
  
**Semiconductor Supply Chains and Technology:**
