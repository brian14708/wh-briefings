title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on President\_Biden\u2019\
  s National Security Supplemental\_Request"
---
 
The President’s supplemental request is critical to advancing our
national security interests—from delivering aid to Israel and Ukraine,
to providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians across the
globe, to strengthening border security and fighting the flow of
fentanyl into the United States. These are bipartisan priorities that
deserve bipartisan support. Today’s vote does nothing to change the fact
that Congress must take action to address these pressing needs—including
by providing urgently-needed funding for Ukraine before the end of this
year.  
   
There is a broad, bipartisan majority in Congress that supports Ukraine.
That was true the day Putin launched this brutal war, and it remains
true today. With funds to arm Ukraine nearly exhausted, we now face a
defining moment of truth: will the United States continue to stand with
Ukraine in its fight for freedom, or will we ignore the lessons of
history and let Putin and autocracy prevail?  
   
The stakes are too high and the consequences too grave to allow a
minority in Congress to hold Ukraine funding hostage over any unrelated
issue. The world is watching, and history will judge us. If we walk away
and Putin takes Ukraine, he won’t stop there. It’s time for Congress to
fund our critical national security priorities. It’s time for Congress
to fund Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorists, Ukraine’s
right to defend itself against Russian aggression, and the United States
to secure our border and stop the flow of fentanyl into the country.
