  \ and Small Business Owners, Reiterates Call for Continued\_Support"

*New report from the Small Business Administration shows Community
Navigator Program delivers outsized results for traditionally hard to
reach businesses.*

Today, Small Business Administration Administrator Isabel Guzman,
National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, and White House
American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling met with participants of
the Community Navigator Pilot Program to discuss the transformational
effects the program has had in helping historically underserved small
businesses access support.  

**The Small Business Administration’s (SBA) American Rescue Plan-funded
Small Business Community Navigators Pilot Program is the
largest-everdedicated federal investment in navigator services for small
businesses.** Designed to reduce barriers that all types of small
businesses face in accessing critical support – including those owned by
disadvantaged groups such as veterans, women, and those from rural
communities and communities of color – the Community Navigator program
provided competitive funding to 51 organizations that worked with
hundreds of local groups to connect entrepreneurs to resources to help
their small businesses recover and thrive. 

SBA analysis illustrates how the program is meeting small businesses
where they are and helping to close resource, capital, and educational
gaps for historically underserved small businesses by connecting
entrepreneurs to trusted and culturally competent service providers in
their communities. It demonstrates key features of the Community
Navigator program’s success:

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Wide-reaching:</span> In
    less than two years Community Navigator grantees have successfully
    helped to **deliver training to over 350,000 entrepreneurs and 1:1
    counseling services to over 33,000 small business owners** for
    everything from how to access loan opportunities to on-site
    technical assistance. The Community Navigator program has served
    small business owners in all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
-   Strong return on investment: SBA projects that navigators will have
    helped secure at least $300 million in approved funding, including
    state and municipal grants, bank loans, lines of credit, and SBA
    loans, by the end of pilot program.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Successfully reached small
    businesses not served by existing services: </span>**Roughly 75% of
    small businesses reached with counseling services through the
    Community Navigators program report not having previously done
    business with the SBA in the prior five years**, illustrating the
    program’s success in reaching entrepreneurs who may have missed out
    on available supports in the past. One example of expanded reach
    made possible by the Community Navigator program is the five-fold
    increase in SBA collaborations with Native entrepreneur-serving
    organizations, helping small businesses on tribal lands secure more
    than $11 million in approved financial support through the navigator
    program.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Helped underserved small
    businesses across the country:</span> **Four out of five Community
    Navigator clients are from groups traditionally underserved or
    underrepresented among small business owners.** Nearly one out of
    every six clients served by the Community Navigator program operate
    in a rural area, and thousands of small business clients reached
    with counseling services report having a disability. The program
    also has a strong track record of serving entrepreneurs that are
    veterans, the spouse of a veteran, or an active military member.
    More than two-thirds of the clients served were Black and Hispanic
    small business owners.

The American Rescue Plan provided the Community Navigator Pilot program
funding for two years. President Biden has
[called](https://www.sba.gov/sites/sbagov/files/2023-05/FY_2024_CBJ-508.pdf)
on Congress to extend funding for this successful program beyond 2023.
Today at the White House, leaders and participants in the Community
Navigator Program met with Administration officials to share the impact
the program has had on their businesses. Businesses shared how the
program had helped them secure funding, navigate state and federal
certification and procurement processes, and receive specific technical
assistance services that they were unable to find elsewhere. One service
provider shared their experience helping ten businesses in his community
secure microloans totaling $84,000, and described how their
organizations’ ability to service clients in multiple languages filled a
much-needed gap in the community. One of the large grantee organizations
remarked on how the unique hub and spoke model of the program has
allowed for the type of localized and specialized support that small
businesses often need. Participants expressed a commitment to continue
providing these services going forward.
