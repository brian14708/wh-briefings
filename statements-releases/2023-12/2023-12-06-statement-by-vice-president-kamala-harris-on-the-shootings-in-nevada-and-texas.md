  Texas"

Every person in every community across America should have the freedom
to live safe from gun violence. But instead, our nation is being torn
apart by the fear and trauma of this epidemic.  
   
Today, it was another campus of students terrorized while being told to
RUN-HIDE-FIGHT as an active shooter opened fire at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas – only miles from the site of the deadliest mass
shooting in American history.  
   
And yesterday, it was two more communities in Texas experiencing a
string of senseless violence as a gunman killed six people and injured
three more, including two police officers, in Austin and San Antonio –
only miles from the sites of devastating mass shootings in Uvalde and
Sutherland Springs.    
   
Doug and I are mourning those who were killed and praying for the
victims and their families. We are grieving for the students and so many
more whose lives are forever changed. And we are thinking of the members
of law enforcement who put themselves in harm’s way to bring these
shooting sprees to an end.  
   
While we have more to learn about these incidents, we know that they are
sadly not unique in America. An average of 120 people are killed by a
gun every single day across our country. Gun violence is the leading
cause of death for children throughout our nation. And one in five
Americans has lost a family member to this epidemic. These are not
simply statistics; these are our loved ones, our neighbors, and our
classmates.  
   
It does not have to be this way. Solutions do exist. Congress must make
background checks universal, pass red flag laws, and renew the assault
weapons ban. It is past time. In the meantime, President Biden and I
will use every tool we have to urgently advance commonsense gun safety
policies and save lives, including through the White House Office of Gun
Violence Prevention. There is not a moment to spare, nor a life to
spare.
