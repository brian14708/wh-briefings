*Participants discuss how Biden-Harris Administration’s actions are
creating a small business boom and expanding access to capital for
traditionally underserved entrepreneurs*

Today, the White House National Economic Council (NEC) and the U.S.
Small Business Administration (SBA) hosted a Small Business Lending
Summit to discuss the Administration’s strong record on lending to small
businesses, and how the federal government is working with lending
partners to close gaps and ensure capital access for all small
businesses, especially those that are traditionally underserved or hard
to reach.  
  
Bringing together many of the largest SBA lending partners, this Summit
provided an opportunity for lenders to discuss shared priorities for
supporting small business growth around the country, and for
Administration officials to learn about how Biden-Harris Administration
policies are being implemented on the ground. In addition, SBA announced
that they will be creating a Small Business Lending Federal Advisory
Committee in the coming months to continue hearing directly from lenders
and other stakeholders about how to best meet the capital needs of small
businesses, especially in underserved communities.  
  
Last year, the SBA [provided $50 billion in
capital](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/21/fact-sheet-ahead-of-small-business-saturday-biden-harris-administration-announces-latest-steps-to-support-small-businesses/)
to small businesses nationwide, partnering with lenders to provide a
historic $34 billion in small business loans through their signature
7(a) and 504 loan programs. These loans have helped promote inclusive
economic growth, with $5 billion going to women-owned businesses, a
record $3 billion going to Latino-owned businesses, and a doubling of
loans to Black-owned businesses since 2020. In addition, under President
Biden, Americans have filed a record 14.6 million new business
applications and business ownership rate among families has risen 9%
since 2019, with particularly strong gains for Hispanic and Black
households. Today’s roundtable provided an opportunity for
administration officials and lending leaders to discuss strategies to
build on these successes and bring small business growth to new
heights.  
  
The summit featured two roundtable discussions as well as remarks by SBA
Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman, NEC Director Lael Brainard, and
Council of Economic Advisors Member C. Kirabo Jackson. In the first
roundtable, participants discussed emerging trends in small business
lending, including new technology and financing structures, and how
federal agencies can support continued innovation. Participants shared
successes from their small business lending strategies and highlighted
how [recent SBA
changes](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/11/01/biden-harris-administration-takes-historic-step-expanding-access-capital-filling-lending-gaps)
to modernize their lending programs have allowed for a broader and more
diverse set of credit worthy businesses to access loans, and how their
improved processes have accelerated access to capital for small business
borrowers. For the second roundtable, participants heard from Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau Director (CFPB) Rohit Chopra and Acting
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Michael J. Hsu about key actions these
independent regulators have taken to expand access to capital for
underserved communities – including the issuance of

rules](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2023/bulletin-2023-32.html#:~:text=Summary,Community%20Reinvestment%20Act%20(CRA).).

equity in small business lending, as well as how better data collection
and reporting can help banks further target their lending to underserved
communities.
