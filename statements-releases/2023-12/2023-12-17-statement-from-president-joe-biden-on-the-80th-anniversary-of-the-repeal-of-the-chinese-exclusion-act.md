title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 80th Anniversary of the Repeal\
  \ of the Chinese Exclusion\_Act"
---
 
Our nation was founded on the fundamental idea that we are created equal
and deserve to be treated equally. But for 61 years, the Chinese
Exclusion Act failed to live up to that promise. It weaponized our
immigration system to discriminate against an entire ethnic group and
was followed by further discrimination against many in Europe and all of
Asia. The Act, along with racism and xenophobia in other parts of
American life, was part of the anti-Chinese “Driving Out” era which
included the Rock Springs and Hells Canyon massacres. In 1943, the
Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed and it was followed by laws that led
to an immigration system that better reflected our values as a nation of
immigrants.    
   
On this anniversary, we remember those whose lives, families, and
communities were irreparably harmed. We remember the brave and diverse
voices – from Frederick Douglass to Blanche Bruce to Pearl Buck to the
American Jewish Committee and so many others – who spoke up in
solidarity against that Act and demanded a fairer and more just
immigration system. And we recognize that despite the progress we have
made, hate never goes away. It only hides. Today, there are those who
still demonize immigrants and fan the flames of intolerance. It’s wrong.
I ran for President to restore the soul of America. To bring people
together and make sure we give hate no safe harbor. To celebrate the
diversity that is our country’s strength.  
   
For generations, people of Chinese heritage have enriched our country –
from Chinese laborers who did backbreaking work to build the
transcontinental railroad in the 1800s to the Chinese Americans who
serve in our military, to the authors, artists, scientists,
entrepreneurs, and scholars of today. We honor them, and all immigrants,
who continue to make extraordinary contributions to our nation.
