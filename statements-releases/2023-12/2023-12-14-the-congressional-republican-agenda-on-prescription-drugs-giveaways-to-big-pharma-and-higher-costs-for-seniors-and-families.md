title: "The Congressional Republican Agenda on Prescription Drugs: Giveaways to Big\
  \ Pharma and Higher Costs for Seniors and\_Families"
---
 
President Biden has taken historic action to reduce prescription drug
costs for seniors and for working-age people who get health insurance
through their jobs. Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans are actively
fighting to roll back the reforms the President signed into law and to
keep Big Pharma’s taxes low.  
  
Congressional Republicans’ agenda for Big Pharma giveaways includes:  
  
**Repealing prescription drug inflation rebates. **The Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) cuts costs for Medicare and seniors by requiring
pharmaceutical companies to pay a rebate to Medicare if they increase
prices faster than inflation. Dozens of Republicans
have [signed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/812) [onto](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4953) legislation
that would revoke the rebate requirement.  
  
By 2031, repealing this
provision [would](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-02/58850-IRA-Drug-Provs.pdf):

-   Cost seniors $5 billion per year.

<!-- -->

-   Increase federal deficits by $7 billion per year.
-   Give away over $10 billion per year to pharmaceutical companies.

**Taking away Medicare’s ability to negotiate prescription drug
prices. **The IRA finally gave Medicare the authority to directly
negotiate with drug companies on the high prices they charge for
prescription drugs. Republican Chairs and Ranking Members of the
committees with jurisdiction over Medicare
have [publicly](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/23/gop-drug-price-repeal-target) [committed](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/fact-sheet-democrats-drug-price-setting-scheme-dismantles-medicares-promise-undermines-seniors-health) to
repealing this authority, which would allow Big Pharma to go back to
charging seniors exorbitant prices for life-saving drugs.  
  
By 2031, repealing this
provision [would](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-02/58850-IRA-Drug-Provs.pdf):

-   Cost seniors $7 billion per year.
-   Increase federal deficits by $14 billion per year.
-   Give away over $20 billion to pharmaceutical companies per year.

**Opposing caps on insulin prices. **Monthly insulin costs for Medicare
beneficiaries are
now [capped](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/16/fact-sheet-one-year-in-president-bidens-inflation-reduction-act-is-driving-historic-climate-action-and-investing-in-america-to-create-good-paying-jobs-and-reduce-costs/) at
$35—providing certainty and critical cost savings for seniors who in
some cases were paying as much as $400 for a month’s supply of insulin.
The Republican Study
Committee [budget](https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/202306141135_fy24_rsc_budget_print_final_c.pdf),
as well as the House Budget Committee-passed
budget [plan](https://budget.house.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_concurrent_resolution_on_the_budget_legislative_text.pdf),
propose to repeal this and other IRA drug price reforms.    
  
Repealing this provision would mean the 1.5 million Medicare
beneficiaries who use
insulin [could](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/bd5568fa0e8a59c2225b2e0b93d5ae5b/aspe-insulin-affordibility-datapoint.pdf) see
their annual costs rise by an average of $500.  
  
**Protecting Big Pharma’s ability to avoid paying taxes. **President
Biden [negotiated](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/11/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-to-announce-steps-to-forge-a-more-fair-and-inclusive-global-economy/) a
historic agreement with over 130 countries that would enable the U.S.
and its partners to ensure Big Pharma and other multinationals pay at
least a minimum tax rate and has proposed that the U.S. implement that
agreement with a 21% minimum tax rate on multinationals. Congressional
Republicans are not only blocking the U.S. from implementing the global
minimum tax agreement
and [vowing](https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/in-germany-ways-means-members-highlight-how-oecd-global-tax-deal-harms-jobs-emboldens-china-and-would-spark-global-tax-instability/) to [never](https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/tax-subcommittee-chairman-kelly-hearing-on-bidens-global-tax-surrender-harms-american-workers-and-our-economy/) raise
taxes on Big Pharma and other multinationals by implementing it, they
also [traveled](https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/at-oecd-chairman-smith-warns-that-congress-will-reject-new-job-killing-global-tax-surrender/) [to](https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/in-germany-ways-means-members-highlight-how-oecd-global-tax-deal-harms-jobs-emboldens-china-and-would-spark-global-tax-instability/) [Europe](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/in-paris-ways-and-means-republicans-caution-european-officials-against-rubber-stamping-biden-global-tax-surrender/) this
summer to try to persuade other countries to withdraw from the global
agreement and keep taxes low for Big Pharma and other multinationals.  
  
Blocking implementation of the President’s international tax reform
proposals means:

-   Protecting a system in which Big Pharma can lower its taxes
    to [under
    12%](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JCT%20-%20pharma%20tax%20data%205.4.23.pdf) by
    shifting profits offshore.
-   The U.S. would lose out on hundreds of billions in savings from
    adopting the President’s proposals to implement the international
    agreement. Based on a PhRMA-funded analysis, [nearly $100
    billion](https://www.phrma.org/-/media/Project/PhRMA/PhRMA-Org/PhRMA-Org/PDF/PWC-FY2022-Budget-Revenue-Effects-20210909.pdf) of
    the savings – or almost one-fifth of the total revenue – from
    implementing the President’s 21% minimum tax proposal would come
    from cracking down on pharmaceutical industry tax avoidance.
