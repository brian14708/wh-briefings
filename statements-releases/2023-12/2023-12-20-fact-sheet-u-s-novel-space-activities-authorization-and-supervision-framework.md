title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. Novel Space Activities Authorization and Supervision\_Framework"
---
 
Today, at the Biden-Harris Administration’s third National Space Council
meeting, Vice President Harris will announce the [United States Novel
Space Activities Authorization and Supervision
Framework](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Novel-Space-Activities-Framework-2023.pdf),
a new policy that complements the National Space Council’s (NSpC)
legislative proposal, the “[Authorization and Supervision of Novel
Private Sector Space Activities
Act](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Authorization-and-Supervision-of-Novel-Private-Sector-Space-Activities_Legislative-Text_final.pdf)”,
which was transmitted to Congress in November.  
At the September 2022 National Space Council meeting, Vice President
Harris tasked the NSpC to develop a proposal for the clear and
predictable authorization and supervision of commercial novel space
activities, taking into account space safety. Novel space activities are
those that are not directly regulated under the current U.S.  regulatory
system for private sector space activities.  
  
The current U.S. commercial space regulatory framework is underpinned by
the U.S. obligation in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty to authorize and
provide continuing supervision of national activities in outer space.
 Although much of the U.S. regulatory licensing system was updated
within the past five years, the underlying legacy statutes, which were
developed before the growth in commercial space capabilities, are
inadequate for effective regulation of novel space activities.  
  
The NSpC legislative proposal updates this system to grant the
Departments of Commerce (DOC) and Transportation (DOT) further
authorities to oversee novel space activities, which will facilitate
innovation and further U.S. leadership in the safety, security, and
long-term sustainability of outer space activities.  
  
The United States Novel Space Activities Authorization and Supervision
Framework, a companion executive action to the proposed legislation,
will enable the Executive Branch to better prepare for and shape the
future space regulatory environment.

**Key Elements of the Framework:**

-   Sets principles to guide implementation of the Framework by
    departments and agencies;
-   Aligns DOC and DOT rulemaking timelines and comment periods;
-   Requests DOC and DOT to consider expanding existing or establishing
    new Federal Advisory Committees to further Framework implementation;
-   Bolsters international collaboration for the development and
    implementation of best practices and standards, maintaining U.S.
    leadership in setting rules for space;
-   Directs the use of existing DOC and DOT internal processes to
    recommend best practices to guide private sector space activities,
    absent additional legislation;
-   Provides a process for updating U.S. Government orbital debris
    mitigation standard practices;
-   Creates a knowledge repository about U.S. novel private sector space
    activities to improve U.S. Government awareness; and 
-   Establishes a standing Private Sector Space Activities Interagency
    Steering Group to formulate longer term policy and best practices to
    inform the work of regulatory agencies.

The U.S. space private sector is experiencing rapid innovation through
investments from private and equity entities, as well as from the U.S.
Government. The U.S. Government is partnering with the commercial space
industry to advance national objectives including space exploration,
national security, combating the climate crisis, and international
partnerships, including building commercial space stations, in-space
assembly and manufacturing, extracting and using resources on the Moon,
addressing the hazard of space debris, and fueling stations in orbit.

Ongoing collaboration with the commercial space industry and additional
stakeholders will be required to ensure that government and private
sector approaches and interests are aligned.
