title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson Welcoming the Ceasefire in\
  \ Eastern Democratic Republic of the\_Congo"
---
 
The United States welcomes the 72-hour ceasefire committed to by the
parties to the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC). This development is a follow-up to the confidence building
measures secured during Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril
Haines’ travel November 19-20 to the DRC and Rwanda, and her subsequent
engagements with Presidents Felix Tshisekedi of the DRC and Paul Kagame
of Rwanda.  
   
Today, starting at noon Central Africa Standard Time (GMT+2), armed
forces and non-state armed groups ceased fighting to facilitate the
withdrawal of forces occupying the locality of Mushaki and the RP1030
road (Kirolwire-Kitchanga).  
   
The DRC and Rwanda have expressed support for the U.S. proposal of a
72-hour ceasefire to advance the implementation of the confidence
building measures to protect civilians and de-escalate tensions in
eastern DRC.  
   
The U.S. Government will use its intelligence and diplomatic resources
to monitor the activities by armed forces and non-state armed groups
during the ceasefire. In addition, the United States supports the
resumption of the Nairobi and Luanda processes, which seek to address
the current and historic factors perpetuating this longstanding
crisis.
