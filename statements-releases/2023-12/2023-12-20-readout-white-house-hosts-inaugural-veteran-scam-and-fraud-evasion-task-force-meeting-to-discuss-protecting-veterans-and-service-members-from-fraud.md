  \ Force Meeting to Discuss Protecting Veterans and Service Members from\_Fraud"

*Task Force agrees to pursue “no wrong door approach” for veterans and
service members to receive resources and report fraud and scams*

On Tuesday, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough,
National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard, and Domestic Policy Advisor
Neera Tanden convened the first meeting of the Veteran Scam and Fraud
Evasion (VSAFE) Task Force to discuss implementation of a “no wrong
door” approach for veterans and service members to access reporting
tools and resources to combat fraud. Fraud against veterans and service
members is widespread. From 2015-2019, the [Federal Trade Commission
received
163,000](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2019/11/veterans-servicemembers-and-fraud-numbers) fraud
reports from veterans and nearly 13,000 from active-duty service
members. Furthermore, veterans face particularly high risks for fraud
with the median loss for veterans from fraud 44% higher than other
civilians. In November, as part of his Unity Agenda for the
nation, [President Biden launched the VSAFE campaign and task
force](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/10/fact-sheet-to-mark-veterans-day-biden-harris-administration-highlights-historic-care-benefits-new-actions-to-support-veterans-and-their-families/) to
combat fraud and scams perpetrated against veterans, service members,
and their families. His announcement included a set of actions the Task
Force will tackle including releasing a fraud prevention tool kit and
creating a one-stop shop for resources and reporting tools.   
   
At the meeting, Administration officials spoke to the actions their
agencies are currently taking to address fraud against veterans and
service members, as well as outlined next steps towards implementing the
“no wrong door” approach.

-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced they will
    establish a new permanent office to coordinate the work of the VSAFE
    Task Force, ensuring a unified whole-of-government approach. VA has
    also stood up a new interagency planning team focused specifically
    on protecting Veterans from claims sharks and other fraudulent
    activities. This builds on the VA’s commitment to conduct a 10-stop
    nationwide listening tour of veterans in populations that are highly
    targeted by predatory actions, release a fraud prevention tool kit,
    and publish a series of public service announcements unpacking
    different forms of fraud.
-   The Department of Defense (DoD) spoke to their work providing
    financial literacy training to all service members and optional
    financial literacy courses for families, including topics on
    military consumer and credit protection, throughout the military
    lifecycle and at personal milestones. Additionally, the DoD has
    included the VSAFE toolkit and VSAFE “Do’s and Don’ts” to their
    military support network, including on Military OneSource and to
    over 2,000 Military and Family Life Counselors to help ensure
    service members know how to access these critical resources.
-   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) spoke to its ongoing work to
    serve the military community through MilitaryConsumer.gov, and the
    impact of their recently [finalized Combating Auto Retail Scams
    (CARS)
    rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-announces-cars-rule-fight-scams-vehicle-shopping) that
    prohibits bait-and-switch tactics and junk fees. Auto-related issues
    are [in the FTC’s top ten report
    categories](https://www.militaryconsumer.gov/blog/servicemembers-combating-auto-retail-scams) for
    military consumers, and on average servicemembers have twice as much
    auto debt as civilians. The CARS rule provides clear protections for
    members of the military and their family who are often targeted with
    junk fees and deceptive information.
-   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) spoke to their
    efforts to crack down on scams and frauds that go after veterans’
    benefits, rein in data brokers that may misuse the sensitive and
    personal data of service members and veterans, and root out digital
    payment app schemes that target veterans. The CFPB
    is [working](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/coaches-consultants-advertise-ability-to-assist-with-va-benefits-claim-but-may-not-be-accredited/) with
    the VA to address reports that unscrupulous actors have misled some
    veterans into paying thousands of dollars in claim preparation fees.
    The CFPB is also acting to address data brokers’ misuse of service
    members’ and veterans’ personal information. Finally, last month,
    the
    CFPB [proposed](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-new-federal-oversight-of-big-tech-companies-and-other-providers-of-digital-wallets-and-payment-apps/) to
    extend its oversight to larger nonbank companies that offer services
    like digital wallets and payments apps, which the [CFPB previously
    found ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_osa-annual-report_2022.pdf)to
    pose a unique heightened risk to veterans and service members.
-   The Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) has already taken
    actions to block active robocalling scams that have resulted in
    a [99% drop in auto warranty robocalls and an 88% drop in student
    loan scam
    robocalls](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-393325A1.pdf).
    The FCC will build upon these efforts by working to identify the
    originators of scam calls targeting veterans and service members to
    enable it to order phone companies to block these calls.
-   The Department of Education discussed how they are [implementing
    regulations to protect
    veterans](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-unveils-final-rules-protect-veterans-and-service-members-improve-college-access-incarcerated-individuals-and-improve-oversight-when-colleges-change-owners) from
    predatory for-profit colleges and created the [most effective ever
    gainful employment
    rule](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-landmark-final-rules-protect-consumers-unaffordable-student-debt-and-increase-transparency) that
    will support veterans and service members who enroll in career
    training programs. In addition, the Department has approved more
    than $22.5 billion in debt relief from more than 1.3 million
    borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them, closed suddenly, or
    are covered by related court settlements, which can often include
    veterans and service members that are aggressively recruited by
    these institutions.

Participants also agreed on new actions to implement the President’s
vision of a “no wrong door” approach for veterans and service members to
access resources and reporting tools to address fraud. Specifically,
agency leaders agreed to collaboratively draft shared call scripts,
training, and procedures for call center staff regarding fraud response
routing and information to improve the veteran experience in the short
term. Furthermore, the White House will convene an interagency working
group to evaluate options to implement the no wrong door approach and
report back to task force leadership by the end of the first quarter of
2024.  
  
**These actions build on Biden-Harris Administration’s work to support
veterans, service members, their families, caregivers and survivors
. **[In August
2022](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/10/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-the-pact-act-and-delivers-on-his-promise-to-americas-veterans/),
President Biden signed the PACT Act, the most significant expansion of
benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans in more than 30 years
to strengthen health care benefits to veterans and survivors. VA has
been committed to supporting veterans by delivering more benefits and
services than ever before, this includes expanding eligibility for
low-or no-cost health care to all living World War II veterans, awarding
$105 million in grants for community-based organizations to deliver and
coordinate suicide prevention programs, and issuing $1 billion in
funding to community organizations to support housing, transitional
housing, and case management for veterans experiencing and at risk of
experiencing homelessness. President Biden has also taken executive
action to support veterans, signing executive orders [to strengthen the
economic
security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/06/09/executive-order-on-advancing-economic-security-for-military-and-veteran-spouses-military-caregivers-and-survivors/) of
