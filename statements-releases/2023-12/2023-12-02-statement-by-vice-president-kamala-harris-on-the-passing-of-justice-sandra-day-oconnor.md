title: "Statement By Vice President Kamala\_Harris On The Passing Of Justice Sandra\
  \ Day\_O\u2019Connor"
---
 
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was a trailblazer.  
  
As the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States,
Justice O’Connor was guided by a deep respect for the rule of law.
Opinions she authored will continue to shape our nation for decades to
come.  
  
As an associate justice of the Supreme Court, as a state senator, and as
a proud daughter of Arizona, Justice O’Connor dedicated her life to
public service. A champion of civics education, Justice O’Connor helped
countless young Americans better understand the nature and importance of
our democracy.  
  
I first met Justice O’Connor years ago. Like so many who knew her, I
will always remember her kindness, intelligence, and deep love for our
country.

Today, Doug and I send our prayers to Justice O’Connor’s family.
