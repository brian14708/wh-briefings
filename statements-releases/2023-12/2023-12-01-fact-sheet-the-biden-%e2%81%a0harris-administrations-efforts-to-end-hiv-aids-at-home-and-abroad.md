title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\u2019s Efforts to End HIV/AIDS\
  \ At Home and\_Abroad"
---
 
On this 35th commemoration of World AIDS Day, we remember those we have
lost to HIV/AIDS and commit to accelerating our efforts to fight the
disease and support those with and experiencing risk for HIV. The
Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to implementing
the [National HIV/AIDS
Strategy](https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/national-hiv-aids-strategy/national-hiv-aids-strategy-2022-2025) (NHAS)
and achieving the bipartisan goal of ending the HIV epidemic
domestically and globally.  This year, the Administration also
celebrated the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the U.S. President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest commitment by any
nation in history to fight a single disease.

The global community, including the U.S., is making progress toward
eliminating HIV transmission, but we must accelerate these efforts. In
too many communities, barriers to comprehensive HIV prevention and
treatment limit awareness, access, and engagement in HIV services by
priority populations with or most at risk of HIV. In addition,
HIV-related criminalization, stigma, and discrimination continue to
undermine the effective use of tools to reduce HIV transmissions to our
2030 goals.

Nevertheless, thanks to the efforts of community, state, and federal
partners, we are making important progress toward the National HIV/AIDS
Strategy (NHAS) and the PEPFAR Strategy goals. Recent data that indicate
that:

-   New HIV infections in the U.S. have declined in recent years, after
    a period of general stability. Estimated annual new HIV infections
    were 12% lower in 2021 compared to 2017—dropping from about 36,500
    infections to about 32,100.
-   Overall, in 2022, 36% of the 1.2 million people in the U.S. who
    could benefit from PrEP were prescribed it, compared to 23% in 2019,
    though significant racial/ethnic and gender disparities persist.
-   Nearly 90% of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients receiving HIV
    medical care in 2022 reached viral suppression, significantly higher
    than the 69.5% in 2010. 
-   Over the course of its 20 years, PEPFAR saved 25 million lives and
    enabled 5.5 million babies to be born HIV-free to mothers living
    with HIV.
-   Across 55 countries, PEPFAR supports lifesaving antiretroviral
    treatment for more than 20 million people.

Over the past year, the Administration has taken action to:

**Accelerate Our Domestic HIV Efforts**

-   **Releasing the NHAS Interim Action Report. **On December 1, 2023,
    the White House Office of National AIDS Policy (ONAP) released the
    2022 NHAS Interim Action Report, highlighting work done by federal
    and community partners to energize and invigorate our collective
    national work to end the HIV epidemic and ensure that no population
    or region is left behind.  
     
-   **Implementing the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE)
    initiative.** The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    initiated [EHE](https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/overview) in
    2019 to provide a targeted infusion of funds and resources to
    populations and regions with the greatest need. EHE advances
    innovative, community-driven solutions that leverage scientific
    advances in HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and outbreak. It
    also works to address racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities.
    Increasing **pre-exposure prophylaxis (**PrEP) coverage is one of
    the key prevention strategies outlined in the EHE initiative. Among
    many EHE accomplishments, in October 2023, CDC published preliminary
    data on PrEP coverage indicating that in 2022, for the first time,
    more than one-third of people in the U.S. who could benefit from
    PrEP had been prescribed it. Further, HHS’s Health Resources and
    Services Administration (HRSA) Health Center Program awarded more
    than $17 million in EHE–Primary Care HIV Prevention Awards to 46
    health centers to expand access to PrEP and other HIV prevention
    services that decrease the risk of HIV transmission in underserved
    communities.  
     
-   **Requesting unprecedented investments to end the HIV epidemic.** In
    his FY2024 budget proposal, President Biden requested $850 million
    to aggressively reduce new HIV cases by increasing access to HIV
    prevention, care, and treatment and supporting research initiatives
    implemented in the U.S. and worldwide. The budget included funding
    for domestic HIV activities across multiple agencies, a boost in
    funding for the EHE initiative, and proposals for a national PrEP
    delivery program to improve PrEP access for Medicaid beneficiaries.

**Respond to HIV/AIDS Globally**

Over the last 20 years, PEPFAR has supported more than 55 countries
worldwide, saved more than 25 million lives, enabled 5.5 million babies
to be born HIV-free, and prevented millions of new HIV infections, all
while strengthening global health and economic security. The
Administration has taken action over the past year to build on that
impact, including by:

-   **Building on 20 years of lifesaving impact**. When PEPFAR was
    announced by President George W. Bush in 2003, an AIDS diagnosis was
    a death sentence, with only 50,000 of the more than 4 million people
    across Africa who needed life-saving HIV/AIDS treatment receiving
    it. To date, PEPFAR has saved more than 25 million lives and
    prevented millions of new HIV infections. PEPFAR’s flagship
    Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe
    (DREAMS) program, which has reached millions of adolescent girls and
    young women, has played a major role in reducing new HIV infections
    across 55 countries PEPFAR supports. In FY23, PEPFAR supported more
    than 71 million people with HIV testing services and 1.95 million
    people to newly enroll in antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis
    (PrEP), an increase of 30 percent over FY22. In addition, PEPFAR
    directly supported more than 327,000 health workers to deliver
    HIV-related prevention, treatment and supportive services in FY23,
    building on its longstanding investments to support and train health
    workers around the world.  Based on modeling data based on FY23
    results in 12 high-disease burden countries, PEPFAR projects that it
    will prevent at least 5.2 million AIDS-related deaths and 6.4
    million new HIV infections (including 1 million new infections among
    children), as well as prevent more than 4 million children from
    being orphaned due to AIDS between 2024 and 2030.   
     
-   **Leveraging PEPFAR’s strong programmatic base. **On August 1, 2023,
    Secretary of State Antony Blinken launched the U.S. Department of
    State Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy (GHSD), which
    brings together the strong PEPFAR programmatic base with the State
    Department’s diplomatic depth and experience to further progress
    toward control of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and address
    other global health security threats.  Longstanding PEPFAR
    investments in creating sustainable health systems to respond to
    HIV/AIDS have enabled PEPFAR and partner countries to respond
    quickly and effectively to cholera, COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza,
    tuberculosis, and other health threats.  
     
-   **Sustaining U.S. global leadership.**  For more than 20 years,
    PEPFAR has enjoyed strong bipartisan support and has been one of our
    nation’s most profound, transformational investments.  The United
    States has invested more than $110 billion since 2003 in the global
    HIV/AIDS response through PEPFAR and the multilateral Global Fund to
    Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The United States held a
    historic Global Fund Replenishment in 2022, helping to raise over
    $15.7 billion in pledges.  To achieve the goal of ending HIV/AIDS as
    a public health threat by 2030, the Biden-Harris Administration
    supports a clean, five-year PEPFAR reauthorization.

**Address HIV Stigma and Discrimination**

-   **Following the science.** The U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration [updated](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-move-recommend-individual-risk-assessment-determine-eligibility-blood-donations) its
    blood donor eligibility guidance, ending longstanding discriminatory
    policies that excluded gay and bisexual people from donating blood
    while maintaining appropriate safeguards to protect recipients of
    blood products. Further, the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned
    Corps [updated its medical
    standards](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/new-us-public-health-service-commissioned-corps-medical-standards-expand-applicant-pool-to-people-with-chronic-hepatitis-b-and-human-immunodeficiency-virus/) to
    accept future applicants with chronic hepatitis B and HIV, expanding
    eligibility for those who want to serve their nation in uniform as a
    Public Health Service Officer.  
     
-   **Affirming the U=U message.** HHS continued to affirm the federal
    government’s commitment to “undetectable=untransmittable” (U=U)
    messaging, meaning that people with HIV who take HIV medicine as
    prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load will stay
    healthy and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative sexual
    partners. For example, CDC updated language for clinicians on
    treatment as prevention to reference U=U; SAMHSA’s Center for
    Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) published a nearly $21 million
    notice of funding opportunity to increase HIV services in existing
    substance disorder treatment programs, including incorporating U=U
    messages into communication strategies. HHS continued implementing
    “I am A Work of ART,” a community-informed campaign to encourage
    people with HIV to seek care, stay in care, and achieve viral
    suppression through antiretroviral therapy (ART).

**Ensure Equity**

-   **Diversifying PACHA membership.** President Biden added [13 new
    members](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/pacha-welcomes-13-new-members-opens-applications-for-others/) to
    the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA), representing
    the full diversity of the HIV epidemic, to share their knowledge and
    help further inform our HIV response. Membership includes people
    with HIV, clinicians, advocates, and leaders of national
    organizations such as Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc. and NMAC (formerly
    the National Minority AIDS Council.)  
     
-   **Engaging with the HIV community.** The Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC) and HRSA co-sponsored a series of [regional
    town hall listening
    sessions](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/capacity-building-assistance/community-engagement/index.html) to
    collaborate with the community to address longstanding HIV-related
    disparities and reach NHAS and EHE goals. PACHA also held
    numerous [PACHA-to-the-People](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/march-pacha-meeting-agency-updates-visits-to-local-organizations-community-listening-and-more/) community
    engagement sessions, and federal
    leaders [visited](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/listening-session-with-nhas-and-ehe-partners-in-louisiana-highlights-need-for-continued-partnerships/) EHE
    jurisdictions and participated in virtual town halls and discussions
    with people with lived experience of HIV, community-based
    organizations, state and local health departments, HIV advocates,
    and others.  
     
-   **Advancing equity for marginalized and underserved Americans.** To
    mark Pride Month 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration
    announced [new
    actions](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/08/fact-sheetbiden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-protect-lgbtqi-communities/) to
    protect LGBTQI+ communities from attacks on their rights and safety.
    These include launching a new LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership,
    strengthening resources for LGBTQI+ youth, and shielding LGBTQI+
    Americans from book bans threatening their rights. Further, the
    Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the posting
    of a proposed [National Coverage
    Determination](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/cms-proposes-medicare-coverage-for-prep-invites-public-comment-by-august-11/) for
    FDA-approved PrEP to ensure PrEP access for those for whom
    cost-sharing and deductibles are barriers to this highly effective
    HIV prevention tool.  
     
-   **Improving health outcomes for people aging with HIV.** With
    funding from the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund (MHAF), HHS’s Office of the
    Assistant Secretary for Health Office of Infectious Disease and
    HIV/AIDS Policy (OIDP) and Administration for Community Living (ACL)
    organized the Innovations for Needs of People Aging with
    HIV/Long-term Survivors in Urban Communities Challenge and the
    $500,000 Rural HIV and Aging Challenge to support innovative efforts
    aimed at improving health outcomes for people aging with HIV and
    long-term survivors, particularly among racial and ethnic minority
    and LGBTQI+ populations. In addition, HRSA’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS
    Program (RWHAP) launched the [Aging with HIV
    Initiative](https://targethiv.org/spns/aging) to support and
    evaluate groundbreaking interventions that seek to improve the
    well-being of people with HIV ages 50 and older served by RWHAP.  
     
-   **Promoting the equality, dignity, and safety of transgender
    Americans. **Transgender women are an NHAS priority population due
    to the disproportionate impact of HIV on this population. In honor
    of Transgender Day of Visibility, the Biden-Harris Administration
    announced [new
    steps](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/31/fact-sheet-white-house-honors-transgender-day-of-visibility/) to
    support transgender communities, including issuing a [landmark
    report](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/moving-beyond-change-efforts/pep22-03-12-001) on
    ways to support and affirm LGBTQI+ youth, especially transgender
    youth, and
    issuing [guidance](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility/reference-materials/guidance-regarding-gender-identity-and-inclusion-in-the-federal-workplace.pdf) on
    gender inclusion in the workforce. These efforts build on the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s other historic work to advance
    equality for transgender Americans since taking office. 

** Support and Treat People at Risk for “Syndemic” Conditions**

-   **Facilitating the linkage of HIV services to harm reduction
    programs*. ***The NHAS calls for integrated programs to address the
    interacting or “syndemic” conditions of HIV, STIs, viral hepatitis,
    and substance use and mental health disorders, including by
    facilitating the linkage of HIV services to evidence-based harm
    reduction programs. HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA) published its [Draft Harm Reduction
    Framework](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/harm-reduction/framework),
    the first document to comprehensively outline harm reduction and its
    role within HHS. Among many strategies, the Framework calls for
    health hubs that offer integrated HIV, viral hepatitis, and
    healthcare services for people who use drugs. The Biden-Harris
    Administration has identified harm reduction as a federal drug
    policy priority.  
     
-   **Supporting people affected by HIV during the mpox public health
    emergency.** While anyone can get mpox, CDC research shows that
    about 40% of people diagnosed with mpox in the U.S. also have HIV.
    The Biden-Harris Administration focused on expanding mpox
    vaccination for at-risk individuals and making testing more
    convenient for healthcare providers and patients nationwide. HHS
    provided [resources](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/18/fact-sheet-hhs-provides-resources-ways-communities-can-stay-protected-mpox.html) on
    ways communities can stay protected from mpox in advance of the
    summer months and worked with LGBTQ+ community partners in late
    winter 2022 and early Spring 2023 to motivate actions to prevent
    mpox during Pride festivals and events. NIH also launched the [STOMP
    trial](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/us-clinical-trial-evaluating-antiviral-monkeypox-begins) to
    determine whether the antiviral tecovirimat can safely and
    effectively treat mpox.  
     
-   **Implementing new approaches to preventing sexually transmitted
    infections (STIs). **CDC developed [draft
    guidelines](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-21725) on using
    STI post-exposure prophylaxis with doxycycline (Doxy PEP) to prevent
    some bacterial STIs and released them for public comment. STIs are
    pervasive and increasing rapidly in the U.S., and Doxy PEP has
    demonstrated substantial benefits in reducing new chlamydia,
    gonorrhea, and syphilis infections. Doxy PEP can benefit the health
    of some gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and
    transgender women who have increased chances of getting an STI.
    These draft guidelines represent a new approach to addressing STI
    prevention.  
     
-   **Providing stable housing to people with HIV and their
    families. **Achieving and maintaining stable housing can be a
    powerful structural intervention in preventing HIV and syndemic
    conditions and ending the HIV epidemic. The U.S. Department of
    Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD) [announced](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hud-announces-50-million-funding-opportunity-to-provide-stable-housing-to-people-with-hiv-and-their-families/) $50
    million in competitive funding through its Housing Opportunities for
    Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program to support housing assistance and
    supportive services for low-income people with HIV and their
    families, coordination and planning activities, and grants
    management and administration. Further, with MHAF resources,
    SAMHSA announced a new funding opportunity to support up to three
    pilot sites to deliver portable behavioral health, HIV, and other
    services for unsheltered racial and ethnic minority individuals.

**Advance New Research**

-   **Implementing a multiyear HIV research plan. **The National
    Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Office on AIDS Research continued
    implementation of its five-year [NIH Strategic
    Plan](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/fiscal-year-2021-2025-nih-strategic-plan-hiv-and-hiv-related-research),
    a roadmap for the NIH HIV/AIDS research program, ensuring that funds
    are allocated per established NIH scientific research priorities.
    The Plan guides the NIH investment, building on scientific progress
    and opportunities for advancing HIV/AIDS research toward ending the
    pandemic.  
     
-   **Beginning a new clinical trial of an HIV vaccine. **An
    NIH-supported trial of a preventive HIV vaccine candidate began
    enrollment at six sites in the U.S. and South Africa. The Phase I
    trial will evaluate a novel vaccine known as VIR-1388 for its safety
    and ability to induce an HIV-specific immune response in people.   
     
-   **Reducing heart disease risk in adults with HIV.** An
    NIH-supported [study](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/daily-statin-reduces-heart-disease-risk-among-adults-living-with-hiv/) showed
    that statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering medications, may
    offset the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease experienced by
    people with HIV by more than a third, potentially preventing one in
    five major cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack or stroke) or
    premature deaths in this population. The findings are expected to
    directly influence clinical guidelines and standards of care for the
    aging population of people with HIV.
