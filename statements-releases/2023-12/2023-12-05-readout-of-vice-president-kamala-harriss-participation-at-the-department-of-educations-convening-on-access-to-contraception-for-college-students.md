title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Participation at the Department\
  \ of Education\u2019s Convening on Access to Contraception for College\_Students"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris met with officials from 68 colleges
and universities in 32 states to discuss ongoing efforts to protect
access to contraception for college students. During the Department of
Education’s convening on access to contraception for college students,
the Vice President joined Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona,
Director of the White House Gender Policy Council Jen Klein, and Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education Amanda Miller in
speaking with leaders from a diverse range of institutions including
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving
Institutions, community colleges, and four-year public schools.
University leaders spoke about strides they are making in protecting and
expanding access to contraception for their students and shared
strategies that have been successful in improving access on campus.  
  
On her recent nationwide “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour,” the Vice
President heard from young leaders across the country about the issues
that are most important to them – reproductive freedom was often at the
top of that list. During today’s convening, Vice President Harris made
it clear that contraception is health care and that every person in
America should have the right to access the health care they need.
Speaking about extremists’ full-on attack on reproductive freedom in the
year since the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade*, she noted that
protecting access to contraception has become more important than ever.
The Vice President also thanked educators for the unique role they play
in protecting access to reproductive health care, and urged them to
test, implement, and share the strategies discussed during today’s
convening so that their campuses can serve as models for other schools
throughout the country.  
  
The Vice President has consistently led the fight to protect the freedom
of women to make decisions about their own bodies. She and President
Biden have championed three Executive Orders on access to reproductive
health care, including a June 2023 [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/23/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-strengthening-access-to-contraception/) on
strengthening access to affordable, high-quality contraception and
family planning services. Additionally,
she [spoke](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/04/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-at-the-second-meeting-of-the-task-force-on-reproductive-healthcare-access/) at
a 2022 meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access where
she called for protecting access to contraception. Today’s convening
also follows a series of meetings about reproductive rights that Vice
President Harris has held with students and young leaders in every part
of the nation.
