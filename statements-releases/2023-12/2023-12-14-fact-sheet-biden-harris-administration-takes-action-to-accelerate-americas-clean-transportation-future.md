*Leading U.S. Companies* *Join the Federal Government in Drive to Make
Business Travel Cleaner, Save Taxpayer Dollars, Tackle the Climate
Crisis, and Boost American Manufacturing*

As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to build a clean
transportation future, today the Administration is announcing new public
and private commitments to boost access to electric vehicles (EVs), save
taxpayer dollars, and tackle the climate crisis. This includes leading
by example on climate with the release of new Federal employee travel
guidelines that direct the use of sustainable transportation for
official and local travel, both domestically and internationally.  
  
These new commitments will save taxpayers money by increasing the use of
EVs and taking other cost-effective actions on clean transportation
associated with business travel for the Federal workforce. In addition,
the State of California, companies, and nonprofits are announcing new
commitments through the Biden-Harris Administration’s [EV Acceleration
Challenge](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/ev-acceleration-challenge/)
to expand EV fleets, increase consumer education, and grow the
availability of EV charging and other clean transportation
infrastructure.  
  
These commitments further advance President Biden’s [Investing in
America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/) agenda, a key pillar of
Bidenomics, to spur domestic manufacturing, strengthen supply chains,
boost U.S. competitiveness, and create good-paying jobs and healthier
communities. Under President Biden’s leadership, EV sales have tripled
and the number of publicly available charging ports has grown by nearly
70 percent since he took office. Private companies have announced more
than [$150
billion](/Users/ECHutchinson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/1BBFXUEB/invest.gov)
in investments in the EV and battery supply chain in the same time
period. There are now more than 166,000 public EV chargers across the
country, and the U.S. has already set a new record by selling more than
1 million EVs so far this year.    
  
**<u>Federal Commitments to Catalyze a Clean Transportation
Future</u>**  
  
As the Nation’s largest employer and with an annual business travel
purchasing power of $2.8 billion, the Federal Government is leading by
example by shifting to cleaner transportation options, including
American-made electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. In 2022
alone, Federal employees took more than 2.8 million flights, 2.3 million
vehicle rentals, and 33,000 rail trips. These operational changes will
accelerate the clean transportation transformation, increase good-paying
union jobs and create healthier communities.  
  
President Biden’s [Federal Sustainability
Plan](https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/index.html)
aims to reach net-zero emissions from overall Federal operations by
2050, including a 65 percent emissions reduction by 2030. Through new
Federal employee travel guidelines issued today, the Biden-Harris
Administration is advancing this goal by directing Federal agencies to
prioritize the use of sustainable transportation for official and local
travel, both domestically and internationally, including by:

-   **Prioritizing electric vehicle use when traveling:** Federal
    employees will rent an EV on official travel when the cost of the EV
    is less than or equal to the most affordable comparable vehicle
    available. Employees will also opt for cost-competitive EV options,
    where available, when using taxis and ride share platforms. This
    will save taxpayer money and reduce pollution that jeopardizes
    people’s health and fuels the climate crisis.  
-   **Expanding rail travel:** Federal employees will use rail for trips
    less than 250 miles when cost-effective and available, instead of
    taking an airplane or vehicle.  
-   **Increasing** **public transit use:** Federal employees will use
    public transit (e.g., subway, bus, light rail) when conducting local
    travel or upon arrival at the official travel location.

To support swift and successful whole-of-government implementation,
Federal agencies are being directed through an [Office of Management and
Budget (OMB)
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/memoranda/)
and [U.S. General Services Administration Travel
Bulletin](https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/FTR%20Bulletin%2024-02_%20Sustainable%20Transportation%20for%20Official%20Travel.pdf)
to take a comprehensive series of steps to ensure sustainable travel
options are easily accessible to employees when booking travel
arrangements. Agencies will have 120 days from today’s announcement to
report to OMB and the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)
on the plans and actions they have taken to carry out the policy and
goals of the OMB Memorandum.  
  
The State of California will join the Federal government by issuing
guidance by June 2024 to state employees, encouraging the use of Zero
Emission Vehicle commercial rentals on official travel where available
and operationally feasible.  
  
**<u>Private Sector Commitments to Catalyze a Clean Transportation
Future</u>**  
  
In order to grow sustainable travel options nationwide, the Federal
government, the travel industry, major corporations, and state, local,
and Tribal governments must collaborate.  
  
As part of President Biden’s goal of having at least 50% of all new
vehicle sales be electric by 2030, the Biden-Harris Administration has
issued an ongoing call to action through the EV Acceleration Challenge
to all stakeholders in the private and public sectors, including
advocacy and community groups, to dedicate resources and make
independent commitments to boost EVs in America.  
  
In conjunction with today’s announcements from the Biden-Harris
Administration, leading U.S. organizations across sectors are announcing
new commitments to build America’s clean transportation future as the
