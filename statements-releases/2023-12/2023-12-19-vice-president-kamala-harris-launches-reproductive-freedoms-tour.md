*The Vice President will kick off her nationwide tour to fight back
against extremist attacks with an event in Wisconsin on Jan. 22, the
51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade.*

**WASHINGTON – **Vice President Kamala Harris will embark on a
nationwide reproductive freedoms tour to continue fighting back against
extreme attacks throughout America. She will hit the road to states
across the country in early 2024 as she holds a series of events that
bring together thousands of people to fight for the freedom of every
American to make decisions about their own body. The Vice President’s
“Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour will kick off with an event in
Wisconsin on Jan. 22, the 51st anniversary of *Roe v. Wade. *Additional
dates and locations will be announced soon.  
  
“Extremists across our country continue to wage a full-on attack against
hard-won, hard-fought freedoms as they push their radical policies –
from banning abortion in all 50 states and criminalizing doctors, to
forcing women to travel out of state in order to get the care they
need,” **said Vice President Harris. **“I will continue to fight for our
fundamental freedoms while bringing together those throughout America
who agree that every woman should have the right to make decisions about
her own body – not the government.”  
  
During the Vice President’s reproductive freedoms tour, she will host
events that highlight the harm caused by these abortion bans while
sharing stories of those who have been impacted. Vice President Harris
will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion
ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of *Roe*, and outline
steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care.
Additionally, she will urge attendees to use their voices and stay
engaged in the fight for fundamental freedoms.  
  
Since the Supreme Court’s *Dobbs *decision, the Vice President has held
more than 50 convenings in at least 16 states while bringing together
hundreds of state legislators, state attorneys general, health care
providers, faith leaders, students, and advocates who are on the
frontlines of the fight for reproductive rights. Earlier this year, Vice
President Harris also embarked on a nationwide “Fight for Our Freedoms”
college tour in which she traveled to eight states, mobilized more than
15,000 students, and took questions directly from young leaders on a
range of issues including reproductive freedom.  
  
Details for media to RSVP to stops on the Vice President’s reproductive
freedoms tour will be available soon.
