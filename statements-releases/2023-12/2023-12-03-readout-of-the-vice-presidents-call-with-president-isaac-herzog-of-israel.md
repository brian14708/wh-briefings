Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today to President Isaac Herzog of
Israel on her flight to Washington, D.C., from Dubai, United Arab
Emirates, where the Vice President had several conversations with Arab
leaders on the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The Vice President
reiterated the strong U.S. support for Israel’s right to self-defense
and she and President Herzog discussed latest developments in Gaza. They
spoke about the situation in the West Bank and the Vice President
reiterated our concerns with steps that could escalate tensions,
including extremist settler violence.

Building on the Vice President’s meetings in Dubai, the Vice President
reiterated the importance of planning for the day after the fighting
ends in Gaza, and she underscored our commitment to a two-state
solution. The Vice President told President Herzog that, to follow-up on
this conversation and her meetings in Dubai on day-after planning, her
National Security Advisor, Dr. Phil Gordon, would travel to Israel and
the West Bank this week for additional discussions.
