title: "FACT SHEET: U.S. Leadership in the Fight Against Global\_Corruption"
---
 
Corruption poses an existential threat to prosperity, security, and
democracy – for Americans and for people around the world. When
officials steal from their citizens or oligarchs flout the rule of law,
honest businesses cannot compete, poverty grows, conflict deepens, and
trust in government plummets. In recognition of this grave threat,
President Biden
[established](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/03/fact-sheet-establishing-the-fight-against-corruption-as-a-core-u-s-national-security-interest/)
countering corruption as a core U.S. national security interest and
issued the first [United States Strategy on Countering
Corruption](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/06/fact-sheet-u-s-strategy-on-countering-corruption/).  
  
Today, we recognize International Anti-Corruption Day and mark two years
since the release of the Strategy, the United States is proud to host
the tenth Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations
Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC COSP). This week, thousands of
government representatives will be joined in Atlanta, Georgia by an
unprecedented number of civil society members, academics, and private
sector leaders – highlighting the importance of an inclusive approach to
countering corruption. As the only legally-binding global
anti-corruption instrument, the UNCAC serves as the bedrock for
multilateral coordination on corruption and the international benchmark
for how countries can be more transparent, responsive, and accountable
to their citizens. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda
Thomas-Greenfield is leading a robust U.S. government delegation to the
COSP; her keynote address is available
[here](https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1z/k1zal9rp0w).  
  
Following up on the commitment National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
made to “significant, genuine, real, tangible, recognizable progress on
this massive problem” at the [International Anti-Corruption
Conference](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/12/06/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-at-the-international-anti-corruption-conference-iacc/)
last year, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced this morning that the
President has signed a [Presidential
Proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/12/11/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-persons-enabling-corruption/)
restricting the entry into the United States for those who enable
corruption. Corrupt actors and their financial facilitators undermine
the U.S. and international financial systems – and will be held to
account. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield also announced today several new
programmatic investments, U.S. asset recovery actions, and progress in
implementing the Corporate Transparency Act.  
  
The United States remains resolute in its commitment to fighting
corruption. Key accomplishments and future areas of emphasis include:  
  
**Pillar One: Modernizing, Coordinating, and Resourcing U.S. Efforts to
Fight Corruption**

-   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) established a
    dedicated [**Anti-Corruption
    Center**](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption) within the new
    [Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and
    Governance](https://www.csis.org/events/rising-moment-launching-usaids-new-bureau-democracy-human-rights-and-governance)
    to make anti-corruption a durable Agency priority. The Department of
    State’s **Coordinator on Global Anti-Corruption** led the
    i**ntegration of anti-corruption priorities into bilateral policy
    processes and regional strategies, including those related to the
    U.S Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.**  
-   USAID [**commissioned
    research**](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/resources) on
    corruption dynamics, including Countering Corruption through Social
    and Behavior Change, Anti-Corruption Programming in Low Political
    Will States, and Performance Evaluation of USAID’S Response to
    Pandemic-Associated Corruption. The State Department oversaw
    research on state capture and strategic corruption and plans to
    initiate a small grants program to fund **anti-corruption learning
    products** in 2024.  
-   The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) implemented an expanded
    agreement with the State Department to deploy five **regional
    anti-corruption advisors** to strategic locations around the world
    and to coordinate more closely with the International
    Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre. The Department of Justice
    continued, in coordination with the Department of State, to place
    experienced anti-corruption Resident Legal Advisors and law
    enforcement experts in foreign jurisdictions seeking assistance to
    investigate and prosecute corruption and related offenses, and to
    recover assets.  

**Pillar Two: Curbing Illicit Finance**

-   The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) furthered efforts to
    prevent corrupt and other illicit actors from laundering funds
    through anonymous companies. Starting January 1, 2024, many domestic
    and foreign companies doing business in the United States will be
    [required to report](https://www.fincen.gov/boi) to Treasury
    information about their **beneficial owners**, the people who
    ultimately own or control them. Treasury is engaging in extensive
    outreach about this new reporting requirement and will soon finalize
    a rule establishing parameters around access to and protection of
    this information, which will be stored in a secure, non-public
    database.  
-   To prevent money laundering and misuse of residential property by
    corrupt and other illicit actors, Treasury aims to issue a proposed
    rulemaking on the **residential** **real estate sector** early
    in 2024. Treasury also aims to publish in 2024 a proposed rule
    applying anti-money laundering and other obligations to **investment
    advisers** to address the illicit finance risks associated with this
    sector.  
-   The Department of State funded programs to increase the capacity of
    international law enforcement to target and disrupt illicit finance,
    with results such as $20 million in seizures of gold, minerals,
    metals, and currency related to illicit **trade-based money
    laundering**. Future programming also will tackle **citizenship and
    residency by investment** schemes that are used to launder illicit
    funds.

**Pillar Three: Holding Corrupt Actors Accountable**

-   Today, President Biden issued a [**Presidential Proclamation on the
    Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons
    Enabling
    Corruption**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/12/11/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-persons-enabling-corruption/).
    Through this Proclamation, the United States is the first country to
    establish a visa restriction authority for those who facilitate and
    enable significant corruption and their immediate family members.
    The Proclamation also expresses the U.S. government’s intent to more
    vigorously use existing sanction authorities to target private
    enablers of public corruption – including by freezing their
    assets.  
-   In 2023, the Department of Justice’s **Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act** (FCPA) Unit secured over $500 million in penalties and
    disgorgements in five corporate resolutions, charged over 10
    individuals, and secured important convictions. For example, the
    former National Treasurer of Venezuela and her husband were
    sentenced to 15 years in U.S. prison for accepting and laundering
    over $136 million in bribes.  
-   This year, Treasury used **financial sanctions** to hold accountable
    more than 130 individuals and entities engaged in corruption and
    related activities, spanning 17 countries, while the Department of
    State issued public **visa restrictions** on more than 90
    individuals for their involvement in significant corruption. These
    designations have continued to prompt local investigations and
    create space for anti-corruption reformers to pursue accountability.
    In line with the Democracies against Safe Havens initiative, the
    Departments of State and Treasury have also coordinated sanction and
    visa actions with the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia this
    year. The United States also worked to strengthen the capacity of
    civil society to expose and report on corruption cases and continued
    dialogue with non-governmental organizations on anti-corruption
    sanctions policy and implementation.  
-   The United States vigorously pursued **law enforcement actions**
    against corrupt actors. For example, Roger Ng (former Managing
    Director at Goldman Sachs) was sentenced to 10 years in prison for
    conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from the
    Malaysian state-owned development fund known as “1MDB” and bribing
    government officials in Malaysia and UAE; Goldman Sachs admitted to
    conspiring to violate the FCPA in connection with the scheme and
    paid more than $2.9 billion as part of a multi-country resolution of
    this case. Glencore, a Swiss-based commodities and mining company,
    was ordered to pay more than $700 million in fines and forfeiture
    for its decade-long bribery scheme involving multiple countries in
    Africa and Venezuela.  
-   As part of its commitment to **returning stolen assets** for the
    benefit of the people harmed by corruption, where appropriate, the
    Department of Justice returned $1 million in corruption proceeds to
    the Federal Republic of Nigeria for renovating specific health
    centers. Additionally, the Department of Justice obtained a final
    order forfeiting approximately $53 million tied to the corruption
    and embezzlement scheme involving Nigeria’s former Petroleum
    Minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke. Subject to appropriate approvals,
    the United States and Nigeria intend to negotiate an agreement
    regarding how these funds will be used to benefit the people of
    Nigeria.   
-   The Department of State continued to build **justice sector
    capacity**, including through support for 11 Department of Justice
    trainings in Europe, Africa, Central America, and Asia for over 450
    investigators, prosecutors, and judges. USAID launched **Global
    Accountability Program/**[**Strengthening National Architectures to
    Counter
    Corruption**](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/nov-15-2023-usaid-awards-30-million-strengthen-national-architectures-counter-corruption),
    a five-year, up to $30 million program to enhance country systems
    and capacity to prevent, identify, track, investigate, and disrupt
    transnational corruption, grand corruption, illicit finance, and
    kleptocracy, including across high risk sectors.  
-   The role of non-governmental actors in advancing accountability was
    strengthened, including through the Department of State’s **Global
    Anti-Corruption Consortium**, which over the last year produced 36
    investigations, 60 legal submissions, and advocacy resulting in 25
    laws or policies changed around the world. USAID awarded the
    five-year up to $10 million **Empowering the Truth Tellers: Asia
    Investigative Reporting Network program** to foster cross-border
    collaboration among Asian investigative journalists on transborder
    crime and corruption.  
-   The Department of State’s **Global Initiative to Galvanize the
    Private Sector as Partners in Combating Corruption** launched a
    platform of more than 50 leaders from multinational companies and
    civil society to dialogue and develop tools that will level the
    playing field for fair competition, while USAID’s [**Doing Business
    with
    Integrity**](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=doing-business-with-integrity)
    call for innovations will award up to $4 million to private sector
    entities and others demonstrating how anti-corruption efforts can be
    good for business.  
-   The Administration is developing a **suite of legislative
    proposals** that would strengthen law enforcement and visa
    authorities for pursuing anti-corruption cases, and we look forward
    to partnering with Congress to advance these proposals in 2024.

**Pillar Four: Preserving and Strengthening the Multilateral
Anti-Corruption Architecture**

-   The State Department coordinated with partners to preserve and
    strengthen implementation of the multilateral anti-corruption
    architecture. As part of hosting the **UNCAC COSP** this week, the
    United States convened the first-ever Anti-Corruption Civil Society
    Forum and announced new support for **regional anti-corruption
    hubs** in Mexico, Colombia, Kenya, and Thailand to accelerate UNCAC
    implementation.  
-   The Department of Commerce and Office of the U.S. Trade
    Representative announced substantial conclusion of the negotiations
    with 13 partner countries on the anti-corruption and tax pillar
    (Fair Economy Agreement) of the **Indo-Pacific Economic Framework
    for Prosperity**, which will facilitate compliance with
    international anti-corruption standards.  
-   The United States proudly returned to the **Open Government
    Partnership** (OGP) [Steering
    Committee](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/us-general-services-administrator-robin-carnahan-leads-delegation-to-open-government-partnership-global-summit-in-estonia-09052023)
    and established its own **OGP Secretariat** in the General Services
    Administration to accelerate domestic implementation. USAID issued
    new three-year grants of up to $3.25 million to OGP and up to $3
    million to the **Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative** to
    accelerate country-level implementation, including on
    anti-corruption.  
-   The Department of State and USAID are co-leading a Summit for
    Democracy cohort on [**Financial Transparency and
    Integrity**](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/financialtransparencyandintegrity),
    bolstered by U.S. programmatic investments in procurement reform,
    beneficial ownership, and addressing enablers of corruption.
    Treasury, the Department of Justice, and the Department State worked
    to enhance international standards pertaining to beneficial
    ownership transparency and asset recovery at the **Financial Action
    Task Force**, and adherence to these standards**.** Multiple
    agencies plan to mark the 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the **OECD
    Anti-Bribery Convention** in 2024, emphasizing the need for robust
    implementation of the Convention and highlighting the significance
    of fighting foreign bribery to promote shared prosperity.

**Pillar Five: Improving Diplomatic Engagement and Leveraging Foreign
Assistance**

-   The United States provided **$252 million** in Fiscal Year 2022 to
    counter corruption, including programming across a range of sectors
    and countries.  
-   USAID’s [**Countering Transnational Corruption Grand Challenge for
    Development**](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/countering-transnational-corruption-grand-challenge)
    is providing seed funding and in-kind support to more than a dozen
    promising innovations, including in green energy mineral supply
    chains. USAID is seeking partners for new activities that, in 2024,
    include a focus on climate finance and global health supply chains.
    The Department of State’s [**Anti-Corruption Solutions through
    Emerging Technology**](https://hackcorruption.org/) program has
    generated nearly 20 technological approaches to strengthen
    e-governance and prevent corruption, and it awarded $7 million to
    improve budget transparency and support civil society through the
    **Fiscal Transparency Innovation Fund**.  
-   To support reformers, the Department of State announced the 2023
    honorees of the **Anti-Corruption Champions Award** last week and,
    since 2022, has organized anti-corruption **exchange programs** with
    over 400 participants.  
-   The Department of Defense (DOD) identified **security sector
    governance** as a strategic priority for 2025-2029 and increasingly
    incorporates **institutional capacity building** as an integral part
    of DOD security cooperation efforts. The Department of State
    provided strategic support on tackling corruption to partner
    nations’ national security and defense institutions through the
    [**Global Defense Reform
    Program**](https://www.state.gov/key-topics-office-of-global-programs-and-initiatives/#sfcb).  
-   USAID opened applications for [**Reporters
    Shield**](https://www.usaid.gov/democracy/reporters-shield), an
    innovative membership-based legal assistance program to combat legal
    harassment meant to silence investigative journalists and activists.
    Six months since it opened, Reporters Shield has already received
    applications from more than 45 countries and, so far, selected 25
    member organizations.  
-   The United States is working with partners to implement the [**Blue
    Dot Network**](http://www.state.gov/blue-dot-network/) initiative to
    certify quality, sustainable infrastructure projects that have met
    global standards, including for transparency and anti-corruption. 
    The United States is also supporting development of an
    Infrastructure Anti-Corruption Toolkit to help limit corruption in
    infrastructure development, in line with the requirements of the
    Blue Dot Network.  
-   **USAID’s** [**Integrity for
    Development**](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/integrityfordevelopment)
    campaign is rallying bilateral donors, foundations, and multilateral
    actors to match USAID’s anti-corruption investments, with the goal
    of bringing half a billion dollars to the fight against corruption
    by the end of 2024, subject to the availability of funds.
