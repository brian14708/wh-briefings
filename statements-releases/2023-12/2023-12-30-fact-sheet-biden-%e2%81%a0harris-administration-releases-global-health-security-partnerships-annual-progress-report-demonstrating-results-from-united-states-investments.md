title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Releases Global Health Security\
  \ Partnerships Annual Progress Report Demonstrating Results from United\_States\_\
  Investments"
---
 
The Biden-Harris Administration continues to prioritize global health
security as a critical component of national biodefense.  The COVID-19
pandemic, as well as HIV/AIDS, Ebola, mpox and other outbreaks in recent
years, has demonstrated the catastrophic impacts infectious diseases can
have on health, economies, and societies, regardless of where they
start.  The United States partners with countries around the world to
build stronger global health security capacity – the ability to prevent,
detect, rapidly respond to, and recover from new and emerging public
health threats and prevent their spread across borders. Partnering with
countries to stop infectious disease threats at their source, including
by strengthening equitable health systems in their own countries and
across regions, effectively protects the health of Americans and people
across the world.   
  
To show the American people the impact of these life-saving investments,
the Administration is releasing its annual report, *[Progress and Impact
of U.S. Government Investments in Global Health
Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Strengthening-Health-Security-Across-the-Globe.pdf) *today. This
report highlights the Administration’s bold actions to accelerate
implementation of the [National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation
Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness,
and Achieving Global Health
Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Biodefense-Strategy-and-Implementation-Plan-Final.pdf). 

**EXPANDING GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY PARTNERSHIPS  
**  
By 2025, the United States is committed to directly supporting at least
50 countries to strengthen and achieve regional, national and local
capacity in five critical areas to prevent, detect, and respond to
infectious disease threats.  Building these capabilities accelerates
country compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR) and
helps reach the [2024 Global Health Security Agenda
(GHSA)](https://globalhealthsecurityagenda.org/) target.  In 2022, the
Unites States expanded our bilateral global health security support from
19 to 25 partner countries: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte
d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Ghana,
Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique,
Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania,
Uganda, Ukraine (when the operating environment allows), Vietnam and
Zambia.  These partnerships strengthened disease surveillance and early
warning systems, biosafety and biosecurity, emergency operations,
training and support for health workers, community and national
leadership for global health security, and legal preparedness.

The United States employs a whole-of-government approach, assisting
partners to strengthen regional, national and local health systems to
better prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats in a safe and
secure manner, through the combined efforts of the U.S. Department of
State, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services U.S. Agency for
International Development, U.S. Department of Defense, and others.  To
directly achieve these measurable results and support additional
crosscutting and multilateral global health security activities, the
United States has provided nearly $800 million in bilateral support in
Fiscal Year 2022 funds, an increase of over $350 million from Fiscal
Year 2021, with broader complementary program investments further
supporting these efforts. The Administration will continue to utilize
the whole-of-government effort outlined in [Executive Order
13747](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/21/national-security-directive-united-states-global-leadership-to-strengthen-the-international-covid-19-response-and-to-advance-global-health-security-and-biological-preparedness/), [Executive
Order
13987](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/18/national-security-memorandum-on-countering-biological-threats-enhancing-pandemic-preparedness-and-achieving-global-health-security/),
and [National Security
Memorandum-15](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/18/national-security-memorandum-on-countering-biological-threats-enhancing-pandemic-preparedness-and-achieving-global-health-security/) to
accelerate progress.  
  
**DELIVERING RESULTS FROM UNITED STATES INVESTMENTS  
**  
Investing in global health security today to avert the next global
pandemic could save trillions of dollars and millions of lives. The
report released today details key outcomes from our Fiscal Year 2022
partner country activities, including that seven of our partner
countries achieved demonstrated capacity across five technical areas —
improving their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious
disease threats. Additionally, six countries are close to achieving this
goal. Across partner countries, there has been substantial progress in
strengthening zoonotic disease control, national laboratory capacity,
emergency preparedness, and risk communication. The report spotlights
the impact of United States investments in partnership with countries,
such as: the creation of a COVID-19 Country Systems Monitoring Tool in
48 countries to track progress; in Burkina Faso, the development of
standard operating procedures for international airports for the
detection and management of ill travelers; and in Vietnam, doubling the
number of healthcare facilities enrolled in a national surveillance
network for healthcare associated infections. The results are
clear: investing in preparedness and prevention saves lives, strengthens
resilience, and yields tangible results, including helping to rapidly
address outbreaks of Ebola, yellow fever, Lassa fever, polio, influenza,
and many others.   
  
**SPURRING OTHER DONORS AND MULTILATERAL PARTNERS TO ACT  
**  
Global health security is vital for international security and
solidarity, and cannot be achieved alone. In addition to expanding
bilateral partnerships, the United States will:

-   Use its unparalleled catalytic leadership to unlock more commitments
    from allies, donors, and other partners to bolster support for an
    additional 50 countries.   
-   Strengthen and support extension of the multilateral GHSA beyond
    2024, as a forum for working across countries, regions, and sectors
    to provide technical assistance, share best practices, and measure
    and hold global partners accountable for progress.   
-   Continue support to the Pandemic Fund at the World Bank, as a
    founding Board Member and the largest contributor, to deliver early
    impact for those countries and regions most in need of capital to
    prepare for future pandemics through grant funding.  
-   Accelerate achieving G7 goals set by the United States and its close
    partners in 2023, including meeting G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness
    milestones towards assisting at least 100 countries, and
    collaborating with Italy’s G7 and Brazil’s G20 presidencies to
    increase pandemic preparedness and response financing, bolster
    medical countermeasure development and delivery, and match the
    United States’ own 50 country target commitment; and  
-   Strengthen the global health security architecture, including WHO
    strengthening, and engage in ongoing negotiations to amend the IHR
    and develop a Pandemic Accord.

\[1\] Demonstrated capacity is defined as achieving a level four on the
World Health Organization (WHO) Joint External Evaluation (JEE) scale or
80 percent achievement on the WHO’s International Health Regulations
Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (IHR MEF), or comparable level on
other appropriate health security assessments.
