title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs Historic Executive Order to Usher in the\
  \ Next Era of Tribal Self-Determination"

*New Executive Order Will Underscore Respect for Tribal Nations’
Sovereignty and Autonomy*

Today, as part of the White House Tribal Nations Summit, President Biden
will sign a historic Executive Order on Reforming Federal Funding and
Support for Tribal Nations to Better Embrace Our Trust Responsibilities
and Promote the Next Era of Tribal Self Determination. This Executive
Order demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration’s respect for Tribal
sovereignty, and commitment to ushering in the next era of Tribal
self-determination by ensuring that Tribal Nations have greater autonomy
over how they invest federal funding.  

Historically, federal policies of past eras were attacks on Native
people’s basic rights to self-governance and caused lasting damage to
Tribal communities, economies, and governments. Beginning in the 1970s,
the federal government reversed course and championed Tribal
self-determination through policies and programs that have helped
rebuild Tribal governments and economies, while supporting Tribal
Nations in taking increased ownership over the services their citizens
need and deserve.

Today, Tribal Nations still face many barriers to fully exercise their
inherent sovereignty, especially in federal funding programs. Far too
many of the federal funding and support programs that Tribes rely on are
difficult to access, have overly burdensome federal reporting
requirements, have unnecessary limitations, or impose requirements on
Tribes that drain Tribal resources and undermine their ability to make
their own decisions about where and how to meet the needs of their
communities.

To address these challenges, today President Biden will sign an
Executive Order to reform how the federal government funds and supports
Tribal Nations. This Executive Order demonstrates the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to ushering in the next era of federal
policies that support Tribal self-determination and defines this next
era as one that should be grounded in even greater respect for Tribal
sovereignty and the autonomy of Tribal Nations, because the last 50
years has proven that a strong Tribal Nation is the most important
factor in ensuring the economic, political, and cultural well-being of
Native people. The Executive Order affirms that Tribal self-governance
is about the fundamental right of a people to determine their own
destiny and to prosper and flourish on their own terms. It also affirms
that Tribal governments must be treated as permanent, equal, and vital
parts of America’s overlapping system of government. To fulfill this
promise, the Executive Order:

-   **Requires federal agencies to take action to ensure federal funding
    for Tribes is accessible, flexible, and equitable.** The Executive
    Order directs all federal agencies to better live up to the federal
    government’s trust responsibilities and support Tribal
    self-determination by reforming federal funding programs that
    support Tribes. It moves federal funding programs closer to the
    model of the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance
    Act, which has allowed Tribal Nations to build and run their own
    hospitals, schools, and police forces to better meet the needs of
    their communities using the same federal dollars. It also directs
    federal agencies, in coordination with the White House Council on
    Native American Affairs, to redesign or administer programs in a
    manner that reflects trust in Tribal priorities and deference to
    Tribal decision-making, recognizing that Tribal governments bring
    invaluable expertise in how to effectively meet the needs of their
    citizens and steward their ancestral homelands. Agencies are
    directed to pursue compacting, contracting, co-management,
    co-stewardship, and other agreements with Tribal Nations that allow
    them to better partner with the federal government to administer
    federal programs and services. Agencies are also directed to
    identify programs where Tribal set-asides can be established,
    streamlined applications for funding to reduce the burden on Tribal
    governments can be identified, unnecessary restrictions on how
    Tribes can spend federal funds can be removed, and cost-sharing
    requirements for Tribal governments can be mitigated. As a result of
    this Executive Order, Tribes will spend less of their resources
    cutting through bureaucratic red-tape to apply or comply with
    federal administrative requirements and use federal dollars more
    effectively. No longer will Tribes be faced with seemingly
    unnecessary and arbitrary limitations when they are accessing
    critical funding for public safety, infrastructure, education,
    energy, and much more.
-   **Creates a one-stop-shop for federal funding available to Tribes.**
    The [Tribal Access to Capital
    Clearinghouse](https://www.bia.gov/atc) will be launched at the
    Tribal Nations Summit to provide a one-stop-shop for Tribes and
    Native businesses to find federal funding.
-   **Better embraces our trust responsibilities by assessing unmet
    federal obligations to support Tribal Nations.** The Executive Order
    directs the White House Council on Native American Affairs, the
    Office and Management and Budget, and the White House Domestic
    Policy Council to work across the Federal Government to measure the
    chronic funding shortfalls of existing federal funding for Tribes
    and develop recommendations for what additional funding and
    programming is necessary. On an annual basis moving forward, federal
    agencies will be required to report on their progress implementing
    those recommendations.

The Executive Order signed today is the third Order President Biden has
signed to strengthen our nation-to-nation relationship, strengthen
Tribal consultation, and deepen the federal government’s respect for
Tribal sovereignty. This Executive Order also builds on the historic
investments President Biden has made in Indian Country, including:

-   $32 billion in the American Rescue Plan, the largest direct federal
    investment in Tribal Nations in history.
-   $13 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build high-speed
    internet, roads, bridges, public transit, clean water, and improve
    sanitation in Tribal communities.
-   $700 million in the Inflation Reduction Act, to invest in Native
    communities for climate resilience and adaptation programs, drought
    mitigation, home electrification, and clean energy development.
-   Sending billions of federal contract dollars—and significant
    percentages of their overall procurement dollars—to Native-owned or
    controlled businesses through the Buy Indian Act, a law that has
    been re-invigorated under the Biden-Harris Administration. In FY
    2023, the Indian Health Service (IHS) awarded $444 million (30.6%),
    the Department of Health and Human Services awarded $1.55 billion
    (3.8%), the Department of the Interior awarded over $1.4 billion
    (16.9%), and Interior’s Indian Affairs Bureaus awarded $626 million
    (74.6%) of eligible contract dollars to Native-owned and controlled
    businesses.  
-   Securing the first ever advance appropriations for IHS, which was
    the only major federal healthcare system that was funded through
    discretionary appropriations and therefore more likely to be cut
    every year. These advance appropriations bring much needed stability
    to IHS and ensure that IHS hospitals can stay open to provide
    lifesaving care in the event of a lapse in government
    appropriations.
