title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Expanding Sanctions\
  \ Authorities Against Russia\u2019s Military Industrial\_Base"
---
 
The United States has rallied the world to stand with Ukraine in
response to Russia’s brutal invasion. Together with our allies and
partners, we have put in place the largest set of sanctions and export
control actions ever imposed on a major economy to undercut Russia’s
ability to wage war, and to hold Russia accountable for attempting to
conquer its neighbor by force and subjugate its people. Today, President
Biden will sign an Executive Order to continue tightening the screws on
Russia’s war machine and its enablers.

To date, our sanctions and export control actions have significantly
degraded Russia’s ability to replace the equipment, materials, and
technology it needs to fuel its aggression.  They have cut into Russia’s
financial resilience, forcing Russia to turn to rogue regimes for
supplies and make difficult decisions to resource its military
spending.  And importantly, our measures have also been tailored and
targeted to avoid unintended harm for the world economy.  

These new sanctions authorities will make clear to foreign financial
institutions that facilitating significant transactions relating to
Russia’s military industrial base will expose them to sanctions risk.
 We are sending an unmistakable message: anyone supporting Russia’s
unlawful war effort is at risk of losing access to the U.S. financial
system.
