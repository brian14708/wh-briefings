title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Continued Denials of Abortion\_Care"
---
 
No woman should be forced to go to court or flee her home state just to
receive the health care she needs. But that is exactly what happened in
Texas thanks to Republican elected officials, and it is simply
outrageous. This should never happen in America, period.  
   
Legal and medical chaos, as we are witnessing in states like Texas,
Kentucky and Arizona, is a direct result of *Roe v. Wade* being
overturned, and as we predicted would happen, women’s health and lives
now hang in the balance.  Republican elected officials have imposed
dangerous abortion bans that jeopardize women’s health, force them to
travel out of state for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors. Their
agenda is extreme and out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.  
   
The Vice President and I will continue to fight to protect access to
reproductive health care and to urge Congress to restore the protections
of *Roe v. Wade* now so that women in every state have the right to make
their own health care decisions.
