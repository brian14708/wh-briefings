title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Highlight How His Investing in America Agenda\
  \ Has Led to a Black Small Business\_Boom"
---
 
*Black small business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in over
30 years, and President Biden will announce new investments to support
underserved communities.  
*

Today, President Biden will visit the Wisconsin Black Chamber of
Commerce to highlight how Bidenomics is helping drive a Black small
businesses boom and announce new investments in Milwaukee and
communities across the country. Under President Biden’s leadership, the
United States is on track to have the three strongest years in history
for new small business applications, and with Black business ownership
growing at the fastest pace in 30 years.  
  
President Biden will be joined by the founder and owner of Hero
Plumbing, a Black-owned small business removing lead pipes in Milwaukee,
which will help meet President Biden’s
[commitment](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-action-to-protect-communities-from-lead-exposure/)
to remove all lead service lines in the country by the end of the decade
and benefit from the historic $15 billion in funding through the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.    
  
While President Biden highlights historic investments from his
Administration to support small business, including Black-owned
businesses, extreme Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to
dismantle the President’s small business agenda. Every single Republican
opposed the American Rescue Plan, which helped small businesses stay
afloat during the pandemic and spurred a record small business boom.
Many Republicans in Congress, including Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson,
opposed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. They also want to repeal key
provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that are lowering health care,
prescription drug, and energy costs. President Biden will continue
fighting for opportunity for working families and small business owners,
while Republicans in Congress want to return to failed trickle-down
economics that for too long left too many communities behind.  
  
Beyond attacks from Republicans in Congress, over the past few months,
there has been an intentional effort to erode ladders to Black economic
opportunity.  The President understands that diversity contributes to
our economic security and he has made unprecedented investments in Black
communities to preserve the American dream.    
  
**<u>Investing in Black Entrepreneurship and Opportunity</u>**  
  
Small businesses like Hero Plumbing are the backbone of the U.S.
economy, creating jobs and opportunities in local communities. President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda has driven historic gains in small
business creation and entrepreneurship.  Since taking office, Americans
have filed a record 15 million applications to start new businesses.
Black business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in 30 years, and
the share of Black households owning a business has doubled between 2019
and 2022, after falling between 2007 and 2019.  
  
When Black businesses do well, they create jobs, generate wealth in
their local communities and make the broader economy stronger. As a
result, Black wealth is up a record 60% from before the pandemic and
Black unemployment has reached historic lows. The Administration’s
investment in Black entrepreneurs is producing results, including:

-   Nearly [$70
    billion](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/07/18/biden-harris-administration-sets-record-breaking-163-billion-federal-procurement-opportunities-small)—a
    new record—in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 on federal contracts awarded to
    small, disadvantaged businesses (SDBs).  
-   $12 billion in community lenders to expand access to capital and
    resources to too-often sidelined entrepreneurs. The U.S. Department
    of Treasury estimates that these investments in community lenders
    will result in a $50 billion increase in lending to Latino
    communities and a nearly $80 billion increase in lending to Black
    communities over the next decade.   
-   $10 billion in in states, tribes, and territories to launch and
    expand capital access programs for roughly 100,000 small businesses,
    including $79 million to Wisconsin.

**<u>  
New investments and small business growth and local communities across
the country</u>**  
  
Investing in local, community-led economic development and small
businesses is critical to President Biden’s commitment to build the
economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
Milwaukee has seen an economic comeback under President Biden, with the
share of the Black population employed reaching a more than decade high
and new business applications up nearly 70%.  
  
Building on this progress, President Biden will announce that the Grow
Milwaukee Coalition is one of 22 finalists for the Department of
Commerce Economic Development Administration Distressed Area Recompete
Pilot (Recompete) Program. This program, funded by the CHIPS and Science
Act, is focused on investing in quality job creation, small business
growth and economic opportunity in America’s hardest-hit communities.  
  
The Grow Milwaukee Coalition proposal would invest in revitalizing
Milwaukee’s historic 30<sup>th</sup> Street Industrial Corridor and
connecting the historically segregated Black community to economic
opportunity across the city. Of the 22 Recompete finalists across 19
states and Puerto Rico, eight are specifically focused on growing
Black-owned businesses and entrepreneurship and supporting economic
development in disadvantaged communities that are majority-Black.  
  
The 22 Recompete finalists will compete for $190 million in flexible
implementation funding for locally-led economic development plans to
create and support small businesses, train workers and connect them to
good-paying jobs, investment in infrastructure, and technical
assistance.  
  
**<u>Today’s announcements build on historic progress and investments in
Black-owned businesses:</u>**

-   **President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) is supporting small
    businesses, including Black-owned small businesses in Wisconsin and
    across the country through:  
    **
    -   **A $10 billion investment, including $79 million in Wisconsin,
        to help small businesses access the capital they need**.  The
        American Rescue Plan invested $10 billion to launch and expand
        capital access programs for roughly 100,000 small businesses. To
        date, the Treasury Department has already approved more than $8
        billion in funding to all 50 states and an additional $108
        million in technical assistance grants to 32 states.  These
        funds include $79 million in capital dollars and $1.9 million in
        technical assistance for Wisconsin.  
    -   **The largest-ever dedicated federal investment to connect
        minority small businesses to support. ** The Small Business
        Community Navigators Pilot Program provided $100 million in
        funding to 51 organizations, including U.S. Black Chambers of
        Commerce and the National Urban League, that worked with local
        groups to connect entrepreneurs to resources to help their small
        businesses recover and thrive.  A recent [SBA
        analysis](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/2023-December-SBA%20Community%20Navigator%20Q7%20Snapshot-Public%20Facing-FINAL508.pdf)
        shows that shows that Community Navigators provided training and
        counseling to more than 350,000 small businesses, and roughly
        43% of the businesses served were Black-owned.  
    -   **The largest-ever direct federal investment in small business
        incubators and accelerators.** The Minority Business Development
        Agency (MBDA) Capital Readiness Program [awarded 43 non-profit
        community-based
        organizations](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/04/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-to-announce-support-to-help-historically-underserved-entrepreneurs-tap-into-bidenomics-fueled-small-business-boom/) $125
        million in funding to support underserved entrepreneurs launch
        and scale their small businesses, including $3 million for
        Wisconsin.  
    -   **Delivering roughly $150 million in support for small
        businesses in Wisconsin**.  The state of Wisconsin leveraged the
        ARP to provide $75 million for 5,200 businesses with Main Street
        Bounce Back Business Grants and invest $73 million in the
        Diverse Business Assistance Program to assist chambers and
        non-profit organizations providing assistance to small
        businesses.

<!-- -->

-   **President Biden’s Small Business Administration delivered $50
    billion to small businesses in Fiscal Year 2023**, with major
    increases in support for underserved businesses, including
    Black-owned businesses.  Since 2020, the share of the SBA’s loan
    portfolio going to minority-owned businesses has increased from 23%
    to over 32%.  The number and dollar value of SBA-backed loans to
    Black-owned businesses has more than doubled since 2020.  
-   **Achieving record federal contract spending on small disadvantaged
    businesses (SDBs).**  [In
    2022](https://www.sba.gov/article/2023/07/18/biden-harris-administration-sets-record-breaking-163-billion-federal-procurement-opportunities-small),
    the Biden-Harris Administration awarded a record-breaking $163
    billion in federal procurement opportunities to small businesses. 
    These awards include a record $69.9 billion, or 11.4% of federal
    contracting spending, to SDBs – exceeding the Administration’s FY22
    goal. Shortly after taking office, President Biden [set a
    goal](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-build-black-wealth-and-narrow-the-racial-wealth-gap/) of
    increasing the share of contracts with SDBs to 15% of all federal
    contracts by FY 2025, a 50% increase from spending levels when he
    first took office.  
-   **Supporting small and disadvantaged businesses through CHIPS Act
    Funding.** In addition to the Recompete program, the first CHIPS
    notice of funding opportunity for semiconductor manufacturing
    requires applicants to develop a workforce plan to create equitable
    pathways for economically disadvantaged individuals in their region,
    as well as a plan to support procurement from small, minority-owned,
    veteran-owned, and women-owned businesses. The Department also
    announced a $500 million funding opportunity catered toward smaller
    businesses to support the semiconductor supply chain.  
-   **Expanding and making the Minority Business Development Agency
    (MBDA) permanent.** President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
    expanded the geographic reach of the MBDA—by authorizing new
    regional offices and business centers—and codified the agency in
    statute. The law also increases MBDA’s grantmaking capacity and
    ability to partner with non-profits and Historically Black Colleges
    and Universities. In doing so, the law provided certainty and new
    resources to the more than nine million minority-owned businesses
    across the nation.  
-   **Increasing access to capital for small and disadvantaged
    businesses applying for infrastructure contracts.** The Department
    of Transportation and SBA have collaborated to connect small
    businesses seeking long-term loans or patient capital with Small
    Business Investment Companies (SBICs). This matchmaking provides
    small and minority businesses with financing that enables them to
    apply for larger contracts and projects than they would ordinarily
    be able to reach. In FY23 alone, the SBIC program set a record by
    delivering more than $4B in commitments to funds that support small
    businesses and startups. Last year, the SBA’s portfolio of 318 SBIC
    funds collectively provided financing to more than 1,200 small
    businesses and startups, which created or sustained over 130,000
    jobs. SBICs financed over $161 million for small businesses in
    Wisconsin in FY23, a 40% increase compared to FY22.  
-   **Supporting small and minority-owned businesses in clean energy
    industries.** As part of its historic investment in climate and
    clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris
    Administration has supported new efforts to grow disadvantaged clean
    energy businesses in underserved communities. That includes a [$6.3M
    investment](https://www.energy.gov/justice/articles/doe-awards-63-million-black-owners-solar-services-boss-advance-equity-clean-energy)
    in a group that is working to coordinate and train disadvantaged and
    minority-owned businesses on how to apply for clean energy funding.
    In addition, Environmental Protection Agency’s $27 billion
    Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will invest in clean energy technology
    projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities and build the
    capacity of community lenders to finance clean energy projects that
    support local economies.
