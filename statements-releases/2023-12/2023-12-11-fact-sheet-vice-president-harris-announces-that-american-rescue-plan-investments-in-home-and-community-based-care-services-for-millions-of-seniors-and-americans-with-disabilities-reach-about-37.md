title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces that American Rescue Plan Investments\
  \ in Home and Community-Based Care Services for Millions of Seniors and Americans\
  \ with Disabilities Reach About $37 Billion Across All 50\_States"
---
 
*New data featured as part of White House convening with care leaders,
workers, and champions, including Senator Bob Casey (PA), Governor Janet
Mills (ME), Governor Josh Shapiro (PA), and Governor Jared Polis (CO)
highlighting historic Biden-Harris Administration investments in
long-term care and the care workforce and lifting up the President’s
proposal to expand federal support for these services going forward.  
  
*Nationally, over seven million seniors and individuals with
disabilities and their families rely on home and community-based
services (HCBS) to help meet their long-term care needs in their home or
community, rather than in institutions or other isolated settings.
Facing unprecedented shocks and pressures during the pandemic
and responding to a significant need for more investment in home-based
care, the American Rescue Plan included significant support to help
states strengthen and expand home care programs and better attract,
retain, and more fairly compensate their care workforces.  
  
All 50 states are using this funding to improve their long-term care
systems. With the need for home-based care continuing to grow, this
50-state decision to expand access to home-based care and invest in care
workers underscores the need for the President’s proposed investment of
significant, sustained funding to improve and expand Medicaid home and
community-based services.  
  
Today, the White House is announcing actions and new data reflecting
this administration’s commitment to expanding access to long-term care
and investing in our direct care workforce:

-   **New data released today by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services (CMS) show that the American Rescue Plan is helping to
    deliver about $37 billion in support across *<u>all 50
    states</u>*** for activities and investments that enhance,
    expand, and strengthen home and community-based services
    programs. All 50 states have taken advantage of this additional
    funding, with the majority of it helping providers retain, recruit,
    and train care workers and provide bonuses and pay increases for
    care workers.  
-   **Key Care Worker Registries deliverable from the historic**
    [**Executive Order To Support the Care
    Economy**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-most-sweeping-set-of-executive-actions-to-improve-care-in-history/)**: **The
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is releasing new
    guidance outlining how states can use worker registries for
    Medicaid-funded Home and Community Based Services to ensure
    beneficiaries have awareness of and access to qualified workers to
    deliver these critical services. Worker registries are an important
    tool – helping families that need care match with care professionals
    as well as helping workers find clients and build sustainable work
    schedules. This is a key deliverable from President Biden’s historic
    care executive order in April. Today’s guidance details best
    practices for states in developing worker registries and how they
    can receive enhanced federal funding to develop and maintain them.

**New Data Shows How American Rescue Plan Investments are Delivering
Stronger and Expanded HCBS for Millions of Seniors and Americans with
Disabilities**  
New CMS data
[shows](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/downloads/arp-sec9817-overview-infographic.pdf)
that all 50 States are leveraging American Rescue Plan support to expand
and strengthen home and community-based services. In total, states have
committed about $37 billion in American Rescue Plan funding, including:

-   **All 50 states are investing over $25 billion to help retain,
    expand, and train their direct care workforces – funding worker
    retention, recruitment, training, and other efforts to keep
    providers staffed to improve services for seniors and individuals
    with disabilities: **States are investing over $25 billion to help
    providers support, recruit, retain, and train their care workforce,
    and to increase pay, improve benefits, and expand opportunities for
    career advancement for care workers. These funds are also allowing
    states to create Direct Care Worker registries, professional
    certification programs, scholarships, and tuition supports that help
    the direct care workforce. These investments are critical to all 50
    states’ efforts to keep their providers open and improve service to
    seniors and individuals with disabilities. For example:  
    -   **Colorado is using ARP funds to substantially raise base wages
        for thousands of direct care workers providing a range of
        services**. Colorado’s base wage increases are helping as many
        as 60,000 direct care workers across the state who provide
        in-home care to seniors and individuals with disabilities. In
        addition to significantly raising wages for thousands of
        workers, the state is providing grants to fund a range of
        training efforts, from Registered Behavior Technician Training
        with certification from a Registered Behavior Technician
        Training to providing training on Alzheimer’s and Dementia
        caregiving at home.   
    -   **Maine provided well-deserved bonuses to over 24,000 direct
        care workers in every county in the state worth $3,429 per
        worker **– driving significant retention of Maine’s Home and
        Community Based Services workforce, an overall increase in the
        number of direct care workers, and other critical workforce
        efforts, including wage increases.  
    -   **North Carolina invested ARP funds in rate increases – with 80%
        of the funds directly supporting worker wage increases** –
        impacting thousands of North Carolina direct care workers. North
        Carolina is also using ARP resources to establish a Direct Care
        Jobs Innovation Fund to support initiatives that improve
        recruitment and retention among the direct care workforce,
        including training opportunities and workforce supports.  
    -   **Ohio is using ARP funds to create a HCBS Workforce Development
        Strategic Fund to expand its behavioral health workforce.** Ohio
        is expanding residency training and fellowship programs for
        providers dedicated to serving the behavioral health, geriatric,
        and developmental disability community and supporting the growth
        of existing career-focused programming in behavioral health at
        the state’s two- and four-year colleges and universities. A
        student pursuing a degree or certificate in a behavioral health
        field will be eligible for up to $10,000 during their
        undergraduate and graduate studies and up to an additional
        $5,000 post-graduation in recruitment and retention bonuses for
        obtaining employment in a community behavioral health center in
        Ohio.  
    -   **Wisconsin is developing a professional statewide registry for
        direct care **workers which will incorporate data on
        professional credentialing and specialty education experience to
        assist those who struggle to identify qualified direct care
        support professionals. Wisconsin also increased wages for care
        workers substantially using ARP funds and invested in a
        statewide effort to recruit and train 10,000 new Certified
        Direct Care workers and develop innovative strategies to
        increase access to services.  
    -   **Pennsylvania is investing in a range of efforts to support its
        home care workforce, including increasing payment
        rates**,** raising wages, and recruiting and retaining
        workers. **Pennsylvania is increasing rates to improve wages for
        thousands of care workers, including helping raise wages for the
        state’s approximately 55,000 direct support workers who support
        individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
        The state is investing in training for home-based care nurses,
        including by paying newly hired nurses to participate in
        on-the-job training and shadowing experiences. Pennsylvania is
        also planning to use these funds to develop a worker registry
        that allows participants to locate, review and contact direct
        care workers who will best meet their care needs. Additionally,
        Pennsylvania is investing in recruiting and retaining thousands
        of home care workers in the state – from behavioral health
        workers to non-emergency medical transportation drivers who take
        home care beneficiaries to doctors’ appointments. Pennsylvania
        is also investing ARP State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds in
        the next generation of Pennsylvania nurses working in the
        state’s hospitals, funding up to $7,500 in student debt relief
        for nearly 7,000 nurses who practice in the state for three
        years.
-   **Supporting care and family support for people with Intellectual
    and Developmental Disabilities (IDDs) – with 41 states making
    investments in services for individuals with an IDD**. For example,
    North Carolina is using ARP funds to provide research-based
    behavioral health options for individuals with autism who are over
    21, an investment the state will continue supporting beyond its ARP
    investment.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Family Caregivers: **29 states are investing in efforts
    to offer family caregivers training, respite, new training websites,
    counseling support groups, and other services. For example, Delaware
    is funding a respite program for family caregivers of children with
    complex medical conditions, severe emotional disorders, and dual
    diagnoses of mental health and intellectual or developmental
    disabilities, and plans to continue this program even after it
    finishes its ARP investment.   
-   **Expanding access to community-based care by addressing waitlists –
    with 21 states reducing or eliminating their waiting lists for key
    services (many by thousands):** 21 states are eliminating or
    reducing Home and Community Based Services waiting lists by opening
    additional waiver slots and providing supports for those waiting for
    services – expanding services for tens of thousands of people.  
-   **Addressing key structural gaps and addressing social determinants
    of health such as housing: **For example, 24 States are providing
    housing-related services and supports to address social determinants
    of health. New Jersey is funding the development of subsidized and
    accessible rental units – “Healthy Homes” that will support better
    health outcomes for individuals at risk of homelessness or
    institutionalization. Colorado is investing in a pilot program to
    provide supportive housing services for 500 HCBS participants – with
    a focus on providing housing to individuals who have serious mental
    illnesses and have a history of experiencing homelessness and
    emergency care.
