title: "Readout of White\_House Follow Up Meeting with RSV Immunization Manufacturers"
---
 
On Tuesday, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials met again with
manufacturers and partners of RSV immunizations including Sanofi,
AstraZeneca, and Thermo Fisher and urged them to work expeditiously to
meet demand for immunizations this winter season through the commercial
market. This meeting follows numerous in-person and virtual meetings,
[including last
week](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/28/readout-of-white-house-meeting-with-rsv-immunization-manufacturers/),
to continue to identify ways manufacturers can make more RSV available
for infants. Last month, manufacturers released [77,000 additional
doses](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p1116-rsv-doses.html) of
RSV immunizations for infants following Administration efforts’ urging
the manufacturers to expedite the availability of doses.

During the meeting, manufacturers and senior administration officials
also continued to discuss efforts manufacturers are taking to increase
availability of RSV immunizations for the 2024-25 viral season.

The Biden-Harris Administration continues to prioritize access to safe
and effective vaccines for all Americans who want them, and continues to
encourage Americans to protect themselves and their loved ones by
getting vaccinated.
