title: "Readout of White\_House Event on Inclusive Approaches to Education in Artificial\
  \ Intelligence and Computer\_Science"
---
 
On Tuesday, December 5, the Biden-Harris Administration hosted an event
convening roughly 60 teachers, advocates, officials, and other education
leaders to discuss inclusive approaches to artificial intelligence (AI)
education in computer science. The event, held during Computer Science
Education Week, acknowledged the work of educators teaching AI in
computer science to students around the country, including from
underserved communities. Participants also discussed these efforts’
importance for skills development, the need for inclusive teaching in
this field, and ways to support educators.

The event was co-hosted by the National Economic Council and U.S.
National Science Foundation (NSF), and it was attended by officials from
the Office of the Vice President, Office of Science and Technology
Policy, Office of the National Cyber Director, the National Space
Council, and the Department of Education. Officials emphasized the role
of AI and computer science education in developing America’s future
workforce and how Administration actions on AI, like the [AI Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/),
prioritize this work.

In panel discussions, teachers, educators, and researchers shared their
experiences teaching AI and their efforts to make these opportunities
inclusive. Some described their emphasis on teaching AI as part of a
foundational computer science education, enabling students of all
backgrounds to succeed in advanced AI topics. Others highlighted their
efforts to connect AI lessons to broader conversations on AI’s
implications for equity and other social issues. Participants also
called for expanding these opportunities to more students and the need
for more teachers with the knowledge and skills to teach computer
science and AI.

Panel participants also discussed how leaders from government, labor,
and private sector can partner with educators to advance inclusive AI
education. They described union leaders’ work to engage with AI and
computer science teachers, address their concerns, and encourage members
to teach these subjects. Participants also highlighted collaboration
between educators and researchers to develop K-12 AI curricula, as well
as state policymakers working to prioritize AI educational offerings in
schools.

In commemoration of Computer Science Education Week, several
organizations also announced commitments to increase their support for
AI education in America’s classrooms.

-   **NSF announced the EducateAI initiative,** which will provide
    funding to efforts that support educators in creating high-quality
    and inclusive AI educational opportunities at the K-12, college, and
    postgraduate levels. NSF has published a [Dear Colleague
    Letter](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2024/nsf24025/nsf24025.jsp) seeking
    funding proposals for such projects.
-   **The National Science Foundation, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft,
    committed to support the development of new standards**
    incorporating AI into foundational computer science education.
-   **The Kapor Center will lead the Justice-Centered Computing
    Education Initiative** to design learning resources and curricula,
    to interrogate issues of ethics, equity and racial justice, and
    other social impacts related to computing and AI.
-   **The College Board will develop materials that incorporate
    fundamentals of AI into AP computer science courses and pilot their
    inaugural Career Kickstart cybersecurity courses**.
-   **Boise State University’s Institute of Pervasive Cybersecurity will
    expand its “Cyberdome” cyber education platform** to 12 rural K-12
    school districts across the State of Idaho and work with school
    districts to support critically needed pathways to cyber careers.
