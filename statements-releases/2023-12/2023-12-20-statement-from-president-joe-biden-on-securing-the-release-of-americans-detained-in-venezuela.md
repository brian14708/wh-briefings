title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Securing the Release of Americans Detained\
  \ in\_Venezuela"
---
 
Today, ten Americans who have been detained in Venezuela have been
released and are coming home, including all six wrongfully detained
Americans. These individuals have lost far too much precious time with
their loved ones, and their families have suffered every day in their
absence. I am grateful that their ordeal is finally over, and that these
families are being made whole once more.   
   
Additionally, a fugitive named Leonard Francis, who fled the United
States before he could be sentenced for his lead role in a brazen
bribery and corruption case – was arrested and returned to the United
States from Venezuela so that he will face justice for crimes he
committed against the U.S. Government and the American people.  
   
We are ensuring that the Venezuelan regime meets its commitments.  They
have announced an electoral roadmap – agreed to by opposition parties –
for competitive Presidential elections in 2024.  This a positive and
important step forward. And today, they are releasing twenty political
prisoners, on top of five released previously.  We will continue to
monitor this closely and take appropriate action if needed.  We stand in
support of democracy in Venezuela and the aspirations of the Venezuelan
people.  
   
As we welcome home our fellow citizens, I must also remind all Americans
of the long-standing warning against traveling to Venezuela. Americans
should not travel there.  
   
Reuniting wrongfully detained Americans with their loved ones has been a
priority for my Administration since day one. As is the return to the
United States of fugitives from justice.  
   
But even as we celebrate the return of these Americans, we also remain
deeply focused on securing the release of the hostages in Gaza and
wrongfully detained Americans around the world, including Evan
Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, who are being detained in Russia, and
Americans in Afghanistan, Syria, and China. We will not stop working
until we bring them all home.
