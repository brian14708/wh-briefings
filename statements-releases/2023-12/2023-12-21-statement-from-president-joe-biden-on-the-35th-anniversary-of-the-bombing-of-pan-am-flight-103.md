title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the 35th Anniversary of the Bombing\
  \ of Pan Am Flight\_103"
---
 
Thirty-five years ago today, terrorists detonated a bomb aboard Pan Am
Flight 103 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people
onboard or on the ground, including 190 Americans. Those lost that day
included students at Syracuse University, spouses heading home to their
families after business trips, parents traveling with their children,
and citizens from 21 countries, each with their own hopes and
aspirations for their futures. Their loss was a tragedy that
reverberated around the globe—and one that is still felt today by all
those families and friends who continue to grieve for their loved
ones.    
   
The United States will never waver in our pursuit of those who inflict
despicable acts of terrorism. We will never stop working to identify and
bring to justice anyone who commits an act of terrorism against
Americans at home or abroad. In the decades since this horrific attack,
the United States and our Scottish partners have not stopped in our
pursuit of justice: last year, the United States successfully took
custody of one of the main suspects behind the bombing, Abu Agila
Mohammad Mas’ud Kheir Al-Marimi, and now he will face charges for his
alleged involvement in this horrific terrorist plot.     
   
On this sad anniversary, we honor those who lost their lives by
upholding our commitment to protecting our homeland and countering
terrorist threats around the world.
