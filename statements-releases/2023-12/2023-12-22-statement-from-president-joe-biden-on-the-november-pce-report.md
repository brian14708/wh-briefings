---
 
Today marks a significant milestone with inflation over the last six
months at the pre-pandemic level of 2 percent. Americans have seen their
income grow by 3.7 percent over the last year, after adjusting for
inflation. As we head into the holidays, prices are down from a year ago
on important items including a gallon of gas, a gallon of milk, toys,
appliances, electronics, car rentals, and airline fares.  
   
A year ago, most forecasters predicted it would require a spike in
joblessness and a slowdown to get inflation down. I never believed that.
I never gave up on the hard work, grit, and resilience of millions of
Americans. And today, six-month inflation has come down to the
pre-pandemic level, the unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent for
22 months in a row, and wages, wealth, and the share of working-age
Americans with jobs are higher now than they were before the pandemic
began. This reflects the hard work we did together to fix our supply
chains and the surge of Americans into the workforce. It’s remarkable
progress.  
   
But make no mistake: while my economic plan is getting us back on track,
our work is far from finished. Prices are still too high for too many
Americans, and I know the strain that can put on hardworking families.
That’s why I’m laser focused on lowering costs—from bringing down the
price of insulin, prescription drugs, and energy, to addressing hidden
junk fees companies use to rip you off, to calling on large corporations
to pass savings on to consumers as their costs moderate.  
   
As Americans gather to celebrate the holidays, we can be grateful for
good jobs, rising wages, a growing economy, lower costs, and a new year
of progress ahead of us. We can be grateful for the time we will spend
with family and friends. And we can be grateful that we live in the
greatest nation on earth.
