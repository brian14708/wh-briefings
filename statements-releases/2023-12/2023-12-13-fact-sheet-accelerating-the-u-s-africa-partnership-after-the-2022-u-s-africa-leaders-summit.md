title: "FACT SHEET: Accelerating the U.S. \u2013 Africa Partnership After the 2022\
  \ U.S.-Africa Leaders\_Summit"
---
 
Since the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022, President Biden
kicked off an extraordinary year of U.S. engagement with Africa and made
progress in delivering on our high-profile commitments announced during
the Summit.  The Biden-Harris Administration is over-delivering on our
commitment to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years.  Over the
last year, the United States has welcomed the African Union as a
permanent member of the G20, expanded trade and investment partnerships,
advanced major food and health security investments, and launched a
digital transformation initiative, forged new security and good
governance cooperation, and catalyzed landmark diaspora-driven
engagement.  As the White House commemorates the one-year anniversary of
the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the United States remains all in on
Africa.   
  
**High Level Engagements**

In 2023, the United States accelerated high-level exchanges, directing
an unprecedented pace of visits to the continent.  In the last year, 17
Cabinet and leaders of U.S. Government Departments and Agencies have
visited 26 countries in Africa, with visits centered on expanding
substantive and meaningful partnerships with African countries,
institutions, and peoples across the continent, including a visit to
Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia by Vice President Harris where she announced
the mobilization of more than $8 billion in public and private sector
investments in climate and food security, women’s empowerment, and
digital inclusion across Africa.

**Trade and Investment**  
  
In the past year, the United States has supported and helped close 547
new deals for a total estimated value of $14.2 billion in new two-way
trade and investment between the United States and African countries.  
This represents an increase of approximately 60 percent in the number
and value of closed deals over 2022.  The results from these increased
investments have tangible impacts on the lives and livelihoods of people
in the United States and Africa, with highlights that include: 

1.  In 2023, the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
    committed over $2 billion across 46 transactions in Africa.  These
    projects are leading to significant development impacts across the
    continent, including supporting strategic infrastructure, job
    creation, small business growth, agricultural productivity, improved
    health outcomes, and open access to critical minerals. 
2.  In 2023, the U.S.-Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funded
    fifteen project preparation grants designed to help leverage more
    than $3.4 billion in infrastructure finance for projects across the
    continent. 
3.  In 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in concert with the launch
    of its department-wide Africa engagement strategy to leverage the
    full range of agency capabilities, facilitated nearly $3.6 billion
    in U.S. exports to Africa, and committed to fostering long-term
    commercial partnerships with a focus on priority sectors such as
    digitization, clean tech, creative industries, climate-smart
    agriculture, and infrastructure – all of which are driving inclusive
    growth, supply chain resilience, and quality jobs on both sides of
    the Atlantic.  The U.S. Department of Commerce has also launched new
    bilateral commercial dialogues with Tanzania and Zambia, renewed
    several existing engagements with other countries, led several trade
    missions, and is opening new Foreign Commercial Service offices in
    Côte d’Ivoire and Zambia.
4.  In March, Prosper Africa mobilized $274 million in long-term
    financing for West Africa’s rapidly growing housing sector, opening
    new opportunities for U.S. investment in Africa’s emerging markets
    and providing an avenue for West Africans to gain greater access to
    homeownership.  This deal represents an innovative approach to
    mobilize transparent, market-oriented financing at scale and is
    expected to help about 6,000 households across West Africa gain
    access to homeownership.
5.  In April, the President’s Advisory Council on Doing Business in
    Africa (PAC-DBIA) adopted 18 new recommendations for the U.S.
    Government to strengthen U.S.-Africa commercial collaboration in
    priority sectors.
6.  President Biden announced MCC Board selection of four countries as
    eligible for MCC investment – The Gambia, Togo, Senegal, and
    Mauritania – which are advancing development of programs to unlock
    key constraints to economic growth. In September 2023, MCC signed a
    $500 million compact program with Mozambique to promote climate and
    coastal resilience and improve public services and transportation
    infrastructure. In September 2023, MCC signed a $60 million
    threshold program with Kenya to strengthen urban connectivity in
    Nairobi.

Throughout 2023, the Office of the United States Trade Representative
(USTR) has advanced trade initiatives including the U.S.-AfCFTA
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and the negotiation of the U.S.-Kenya
Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP).  In November, prior
to the United States and South Africa co-hosting the 20th African Growth
and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum in Johannesburg, President Biden
announced his strong support for timely reauthorization and
modernization of AGOA to deepen trade relations between the U.S. and
Africa, support regional integration, and realize Africa’s immense
economic potential.  
  
**Infrastructure**  
  
In May 2023, President Biden chose Africa for the first and flagship
economic corridor under his signature $600 billion Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) initiative to address the
global infrastructure gap.  Since December, PGI announced U.S.
investments totaling more than $1.5 billion in the Lobito Corridor for
transportation, digital access, agricultural and clean energy
infrastructure projects, including:

1.  DFC announced launching due diligence for a $250M financing package
    to the Lobito Atlantic Railway consortium to upgrade and operate the
    existing Benguela rail line and minerals terminal from the Lobito
    Port in Angola to the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
    (DRC).
2.  Between May and October, PGI mobilized an additional $1 billion
    between the United States, the European Union, African Development
    Bank and Africa Finance Corporation to launch feasibility studies
    and commercially develop a greenfield rail line to expand the
    corridor from eastern Angola through northwest Zambia, enhancing
    trade between all three countries—Angola, DRC and Zambia—and
    connecting them to global markets.
3.  Over the last year, EXIM authorized $1.6 billion of transactions
    supporting U.S. exports to Africa, including over $1.2 billion
    supporting PGI.  These authorizations included supporting U.S.
    exports towards solar projects and bridge infrastructure in Angola,
    and commercial aircraft to Ethiopia.  With these authorizations,
    EXIM’s exposure for sub-Saharan Africa has reached a historic high
    of approximately $8 billion.

**Digital Transformation with Africa**

Over the last year, the United States has advanced the Digital
Transformation with Africa (DTA) initiative to enhance efforts to expand
digital access in Africa and increase commercial engagement between U.S.
and African companies in the digital sector, support increased digital
literacy and strengthen digital enabling environments across Africa, in
alignment with the priorities outlined in the African Union’s Digital
Transformation Strategy.  

1.  DTA coordinates and channels the collective efforts of 17 U.S.
    government departments, agencies, and initiatives and is partnering
    with African governments and other stakeholders – such as the
    private and philanthropic sectors and civil society – to advance the
    initiative’s objectives across three pillars: (1) Digital Economy
    and Infrastructure, (2) Human Capital Development, and (3) Digital
    Enabling Environment.
2.  In 2023, the United States has established the institutional
    structures to operationalize this whole-of-government effort. This
    includes inaugurating a senior-level Africa Digital Policy Council
    launching interagency Pillar Working Groups, and securing budget to
    hire dedicated DTA staff in the initiative’s four lead agencies. 
    Further, in April, Vice President Harris launched a “Call to Action”
    to the private sector for investment in African digital inclusion in
    line with the aims of DTA.

In 2023, the United States invested $82 million in new digital
infrastructure, projects, and technical programming for DTA, including:

1.  *Digital Economy and Infrastructure:  *DFC helped launch Africa Data
    Centres’ (ADC’s) newest data center in Ghana and the groundbreaking
    of a new data center in Kenya, financed under DFC’s $300 million
    loan facility with ADC.  USTDA has funded 12 digital infrastructure
    development activities across Africa, which have the potential to
    help mobilize over $1 billion in project financing.  In April,
    Prosper Africa launched the Africa Tech for Trade Alliance to
    stimulate the growth potential of Africa’s technology sector and
    address the regulatory environment. 
2.  *Human Capital Development: *In March, Vice President Harris
    launched the Women in the Digital Economy Fund to accelerate closing
    the gender digital divide.  MCC, USAID, Microsoft, and the
    Government of Côte d’Ivoire have also partnered to support over
    3,500 women-led or women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises.
    The U.S. Department of Commerce, through a $289,000 grant to the
    U.S. Telecommunications Training Institute, held the first of two
    Africa Youth Summits to provide young African tech entrepreneurs
    with training, networking, and mentorship opportunities. 
    Furthermore, USAID partnered with the Mozilla Foundation to
    distribute grants on computing-related curricula in Kenya, Ghana,
    and South Africa.
3.  *Digital Enabling Environment: *MCC is working with the Government
    of Togo on policy and institutional reforms through a $20.5 million
    project to encourage competition which will create affordable
    digital connectivity for its citizens.  The U.S. Department of State
    held the third U.S.-Kenya Cyber and Digital Dialogue and launched a
    dialogue with South Africa, promoting policies and regulations that
    ensure secure, open, interoperable, and trusted digital ecosystems.

**Food Security**  
  
The United States has provided over $17.2 billion in food security
assistance since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, more
than half of which has been provided to African partners in response to
the ongoing food security crisis.  During the U.S.-Africa Leaders
Summit, President Biden with the African Union (AU) launched a new
strategic partnership on food security to drive our work with the
African Union and our African countries to accelerate progress in
tackling food insecurity, building stronger food systems and more
diversified supply chains, and expanding African countries’ access to
agricultural markets. 

1.  Over the last year, we have worked together to develop of a
    long-term plan to: (1) build diversified and resilient food
    systems, (2) increase investment in agriculture-related
    infrastructure, and (3) tackle policy and regulatory reforms.
2.  In 2023, as part of the Feed the Future initiative to help end
    hunger, the United States launched the Vision for Adapted Crops and
    Soils (VACS), in partnership with the UN Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) and the African Union.  VACS seeks to boost
    agricultural productivity and nutrition by developing of diverse,
    climate-adapted crops and increasing soil health. 
3.  The United States has also contributed $155 million to the Global
    Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP).  In 2023, GAFSP
    funded more than $300 million in proposals to support food systems
    and smallholder farmers, largely benefitting Africa.  In 2024, the
    Department of Treasury will partner with the World Bank, the African
    Development Bank (AfDB), and other donors to strengthen GAFSP’s
    capacity to mobilize private sector investment in rural communities
    and value chains in Africa.
4.  The United States remains the world’s largest donor to the World
    Food Program, with funding that has helped more than 790,000 metric
    tons of lifesaving grain reach Africa’s most vulnerable through the
    Black Sea Grain Initiative.

**Diaspora Engagement**  
  
In recognition of the African Diaspora as a source of strength and
foundational to our 21st century partnership with Africa, the United
States has strengthened cultural, social, political, and economic ties
among African communities, the global African Diaspora, and the United
States.

1.  In September, President Biden announced the 12 inaugural members of
    the President’s Advisory Council on Engaging African Diaspora in the
    United States (PAC-ADE) and in October, Vice President Harris
    presided over the swearing-in ceremony of the Council.
2.  This inaugural Council advises the Biden-Harris Administration on
    strategies to advance equity and opportunity for African Diaspora
    communities and to increase cultural, social, political and economic
    ties among African communities, the global African Diaspora, and the
    United States, including public- and private-sector collaboration,
    trade, investment, development, and educational links and exchanges.
3.  In November, the Small Business Administrator visited Cote d’Ivoire
    and Togo to explore how the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
    can expand efforts to leverage the African Diaspora in the United
    States to connect small businesses on both continents to resources
    and opportunities in international trade.
4.  The Department of Commerce, through the Minority Business
    Development Agency and the Global Diversity Export Initiative,
    launched a trade promotion program to connect U.S. companies,
    especially African Diaspora-owned and women-owned, in the personal
    care and cosmetics sector with new opportunities and partners in
    South Africa.

**Good Governance and Security**

At the Summit, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to engage
with and support complex political transitions in Africa and work to
assist governments and civil society at critical moments in the
democratic transition through the African Democratic and Political
Transitions (ADAPT) initiative.  The President also launched the 21st
Century Partnership for African Security (21PAS), which identified $100
million to target and increase support to African partners committed to
investing in defense governance, readiness and sustainment.  21PAS is a
“down payment” to increase partner ability to use and sustain future
assistance.   

1.  In November, the Department of State announced ADAPT resources would
    be directed to support the people of Guinea in their transition to
    democratic governance by January 1, 2025, as agreed to with the
    Economic Community of West African States.  These resources will
    provide technical assistance for ongoing efforts to draft a new
    constitution and prepare for free and fair elections while laying
    the groundwork for more effective and inclusive democratic
    institutions.
2.  The United States is committed to surging support to regional
    bodies, transition governments, democratic and inclusive political
    movements, and civil society to advance shared democratic goals. 
    The ADAPT initiative will be expanded to other countries as
    transition governments take concrete and timely steps to transition
    to democratic governance.
3.  21PAS identified $100 million over three years to target and expand
    support to African partners who are committed to investing in
    defense governance, readiness, and sustainment.  From bolstering
    defense logistics systems to strengthening border security, 21PAS
    programs focus on promoting effective, responsible, and accountable
    defense institutions able to meet the emerging threats of our time. 
    The United States plans to expand 21PAS in 2024.  The Department of
    Defense will announce new program countries upon successful
    consultation with partners.

**Health**  
  
The United States has leveraged its status as the world’s largest donor
for global health to achieve shared goals for continued improvements in
global health and global health security.  We work with African
countries alongside regional and global partners, including the World
Health Organization (WHO) and Africa Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention (Africa CDC), as well as with a diverse range of private
sector and civil society partners to realize our objectives.

1.  In support of the African
    Union’s [commitment](https://africacdc.org/news-item/communique-reimagining-health-workforce-development-in-africa-for-africas-health-security/) to
    strengthen support for health  workers across Africa, the U.S.
    President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is directly
    supporting hundreds of thousands of health workers in the region,
    who enable the delivery of essential HIV/AIDS services and other
    health services.  PEPFAR’s direct support for health workers will
    not only protect and scale HIV gains but can also be leveraged to
    fight outbreaks and other disease threats.  On World AIDS Day 2023,
    PEPFAR announced it directly supported 327,000 health workers
    worldwide in the past year.
2.  In 2023, USAID supported multiple efforts to increase coordinated
    investment in health workers across the continent.  These efforts
    include the ‘Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter’, led by the
    WHO Regional Health Office in Africa, the ‘Monrovia Call to Action’
    launched by the Liberia Ministry of Health at the 3rd International
    Community Health Worker Symposium, and the Reaching the Last Mile
    Forum statement, led by Africa CDC and Africa Frontline First, which
    renewed and strengthened joint support for community health workers,
    including a commitment to collective and coordinated investments and
    affirming governments’ leadership role in setting health priorities.
    Africa CDC is a central partner and leader driving this
    announcement.
3.  Since the United States announced $215 million in new funding to
    address the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, 85 percent of the funding
    has been obligated across 24 African countries, helping contribute
    to the 128 million COVID-19 doses administered on the continent in
    2023.  The United States, in partnership with COVAX, AVAT, and
    others, has delivered over 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses across
    Africa since 2021. 
4.  The United States is working closely with the Global Fund to Fight
    AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global Fund), WHO, AU and other stakeholders
    to support Africa-based diagnostics manufacturers.  PEPFAR is
    working with partner countries to begin introducing multiple
    African-made professional use rapid diagnostics into HIV programs
    starting in 2024. This includes partnering with the WHO and Global
    Fund to launch an expert review panel for African-made diagnostics
    to streamline regulatory decision-making. 
5.  The United States is strengthening global, regional, and national
    capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease
    threats.  In 2023, the U.S. government supported the expansion of
    directly supported global health security partners from 17 to 22
    partners in sub-Saharan Africa and to one new partner in North
    Africa, with a total of 47 partners worldwide.  This expansion
    directly supports the National Biodefense Strategy’s goal for the
    U.S. government to assist 50 countries in building technical
    capacity in areas such as disease surveillance, national laboratory
    systems, human resources and antimicrobial resistance.
6.  On the sidelines of the Third International Conference on Public
    Health in Africa in Lusaka, Zambia, the U.S. government and the
    Africa CDC announced a Joint Action Plan to advance a shared vision
    to strengthen public health systems and deliver improved health
    outcomes in Africa.
