title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Shootings in Texas and\_Nevada"
---
 
Yesterday, in Austin and San Antonio, at least six people were killed
and several more injured by a gunman—leaving families devastated, and
communities forever changed. And just hours ago, the University of
Nevada at Las Vegas became the latest college campus to be terrorized by
a horrific act of gun violence, and the community is still awaiting
information on casualties.    
   
Jill and I join citizens across our nation in praying for the families
of our fallen, and for those who were injured during these latest acts
of senseless violence. We are also grateful for the courageous work of
law enforcement—who risked their own safety to bring an end to these
deadly shooting sprees. Federal law enforcement officials are on the
ground working with State and local law enforcement in both states and I
have directed that all necessary support be provided to assist in the
investigations and support these communities.  
   
This year alone, our nation has experienced more than 600 mass
shootings, and approximately 40,000 deaths due to gun violence. This is
not normal, and we can never let it become normal.  
   
For all the action we have taken since I’ve been President, the epidemic
of gun violence we face demands that we do even more. But we cannot do
more without Congress. Republican lawmakers must join with Democrats in
Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, pass a
national red flag law, enact universal background checks, require the
safe storage of guns, and advance other commonsense measures that will
help stem the tide of gun violence. And together, we must do more to
prevent more families, and more communities like Austin, San Antonio,
and Las Vegas, from being ripped apart by gun violence.
