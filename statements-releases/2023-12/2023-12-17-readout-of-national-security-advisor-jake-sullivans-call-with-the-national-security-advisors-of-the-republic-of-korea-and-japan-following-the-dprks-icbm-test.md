National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke this evening with National
Security Office Director Cho Taeyong of the Republic of Korea (ROK) and
National Security Secretariat Secretary General Akiba Takeo of Japan
following the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK)
Intercontinental ballistic missile test. The national security advisors
condemned the test, which is a flagrant violation of multiple UN
Security Council resolutions. Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the United States’
unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan and the ROK, and the
national security advisors agreed that their engagement was an important
exercise of the Commitment to Consult made at the historic Camp David
Trilateral Summit in August. They noted that their December 9 National
Security Advisors trilateral meeting in Seoul — the fourth such meeting
of the Biden Administration — had allowed them to strengthen their
coordination and resolve against continued DPRK provocations. They also
underscored the importance of their work to share missile warning data
and to coordinate responses to growing cooperation between Russia and
the DPRK.
