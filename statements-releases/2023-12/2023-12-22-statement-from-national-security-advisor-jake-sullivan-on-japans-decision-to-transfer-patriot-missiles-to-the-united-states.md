  \ to Transfer Patriot Missiles to the United\_States"
---
 
We welcome the Government of Japan’s announcement today that it will
transfer Patriot interceptor missiles to the United States to replenish
U.S. inventories.  This decision will contribute to the security of
Japan and to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region by ensuring
that U.S. forces, in close cooperation with the Japan Self-Defense
Forces, will continue to maintain a credible deterrence and response
capability.  President Biden strongly appreciates and supports the
leadership role played by Japan under Prime Minister Kishida, and we
will continue to work closely with our Japanese Allies to promote peace
and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.
