title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the November Jobs\_Report"
---
 
The economy created 199,000 jobs in November, for a total of over 14
million jobs since I took office. That’s more than 14 million additional
Americans who know the dignity and peace of mind that comes with a
paycheck. The unemployment rate has remained below 4% for 22 months in a
row, and inflation has fallen by two-thirds. Workers’ paychecks and
household wealth are higher now than they were before the pandemic,
after adjusting for inflation. On my watch we have achieved better
growth and lower inflation than any other advanced country. A year ago,
forecasters said it couldn’t be done.   
   
But I know prices are still too high for too many Americans.  So my top
economic priority is to lower costs for hardworking Americans. I’m doing
everything in my power to bring down prescription drug costs, health
insurance premiums, and utility bills. I’m fighting to eliminate junk
fees that some banks, airlines, and other companies use to rip off
consumers. And now that our actions have rebuilt supply chains and
brought down costs, I’m calling on large corporations to pass along the
savings to consumers.   
   
Instead of fighting to lower costs for middle-class families,
Republicans in Congress are fighting to raise prescription drug costs
and increase profits for Big Pharma. They’re fighting to lower taxes for
the wealthiest Americans and large corporations that have earned record
profits in recent years. Congressional Republicans are fighting to cut
Medicare and Social Security. That’s just wrong.
