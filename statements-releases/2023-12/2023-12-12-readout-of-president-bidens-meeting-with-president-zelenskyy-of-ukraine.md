President Joseph R. Biden met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of
Ukraine today to underscore the strong and abiding U.S. support for
Ukraine’s fight for freedom.  The leaders discussed Ukraine’s
self-defense against Russian aggression, including plans for the coming
year.  President Biden announced a new package of security assistance
for Ukraine and reiterated the critical need for immediate Congressional
action to ensure we can continue to support Ukraine’s defense.  He also
stressed the growing cooperation between U.S. and Ukrainian defense
industries, enhanced by the successful U.S.-Ukraine Defense Industrial
Base Conference last week.  President Zelenskyy briefed President Biden
on Ukraine’s use of the corridor in the Black Sea to export its grain
and other products, alleviating global food security concerns and
contributing to Ukraine’s tax base.  President Biden stressed that
Russia will not outlast the collective support for Ukraine by a
coalition of over fifty countries brought together by U.S. leadership in
defense of a rules-based international order based on a respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states.
