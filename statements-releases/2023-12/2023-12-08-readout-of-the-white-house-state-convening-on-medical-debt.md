title: "Readout of the White\_House State Convening on Medical\_Debt"
---
 
Today, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, National
Economic Council, and Domestic Policy Council convened over 80 federal
and state officials to discuss the importance of reducing medical debt
as part of the President’s Bidenomics agenda to lower costs for American
families. [One in three

– nearly 100 million Americans – struggle with unpaid medical bills.
Medical debt keeps [everyday Americans from securing loans, seeking
medical
services,](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/)
and affording the essentials they need to get by. President Biden and
Vice President Harris believe that access to health care should be a
right, and that no one should need to go into debt to get the health
care that they need.

During today’s event, Administration officials stressed the importance
of tackling medical debt in order to reduce costs for and improve the
health and well-being of Americans, and thanked state leaders for their
partnership on this issue. State leader participants detailed their own
efforts to tackle medical debt, including legislative successes in
California, Colorado, and Washington. These states have taken on medical
debt by addressing medical payment products, unfair debt collection
practices, surprise billing and facility fees, and charity care.

This roundtable builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
