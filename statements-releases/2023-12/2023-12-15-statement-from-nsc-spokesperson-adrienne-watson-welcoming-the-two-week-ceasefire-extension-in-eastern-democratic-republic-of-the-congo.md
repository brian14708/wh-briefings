title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson Welcoming the Two-Week Ceasefire\
  \ Extension in Eastern Democratic Republic of the\_Congo"
---
 
The United States welcomes the two-week extension of the ceasefire in
eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This additional step
toward peace is a testament to the commitment by the parties to the
conflict, as well as regional neighbors, to lower tensions. Further, it
builds on the broad adherence to the previous 72-hour ceasefire brokered
by the United States and the recent engagement by Director of National
Intelligence Avril Haines with President Felix Tshisekedi of DRC and
President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and her earlier travel to both capitals
on 19-20 November.  
   
The two-week ceasefire extension, which started on December 14 and will
continue through December 28, commits the parties to the conflict to
advance the implementation of the previous confidence-building measures,
including ensuring enforcement of the DRC Government’s November 21
directive against any form of support to the Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebels as well as the continued withdrawal
of forces occupying the locality of Mushaki, positions along the RP1030
road, and locations west of the N2 road.  
   
The Governments of DRC and Rwanda affirmed the importance of the
temporary deployment of inter-positional forces to help facilitate the
safe return of displaced civilians to their communities.  In addition,
the Government of Rwanda will coordinate with regional partners to
secure M23’s commitment to cease its offensive operations.   
   
The United States commends the parties to the conflict, as well as
regional governments, for their support for the ceasefire’s extension
and will continue to use U.S. intelligence and diplomatic resources to
monitor compliance to the ceasefire by armed forces and non-state armed
groups. In addition, the United States reiterates its support for the
resumption of the Nairobi and Luanda processes, which seek to address
the current and historic factors perpetuating this longstanding
conflict.
