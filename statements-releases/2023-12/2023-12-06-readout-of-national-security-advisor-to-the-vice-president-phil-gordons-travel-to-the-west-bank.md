Following the Vice President’s meetings in Dubai with Arab leaders, she
directed her National Security Advisor, Dr. Phil Gordon, to travel to
Ramallah, the West Bank, following his visit to Israel, to update
Palestinian officials on her meetings and continue our consultations
with Palestinian officials on the conflict between Israel and Hamas and
the situation in the West Bank. Dr. Gordon to traveled to Ramallah on
December 6 and met with President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian
Authority, Secretary General of the Executive Committee of the PLO
Hussein AlSheikh, Head of Palestinian General Intelligence Services
Majid Faraj, and Palestinian business leaders.  
   
Throughout his meetings in Ramallah, Dr. Gordon emphasized the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to support the Palestinian
people and their right to security**,** dignity, and self-determination.
He underscored our commitment to the future establishment of a
Palestinian state and made clear that the Palestinian people must have a
hopeful political horizon. To that end, Dr. Gordon discussed the
revitalization of the Palestinian Authority.  
   
Dr. Gordon and Palestinian officials discussed the situation in Gaza,
and Dr. Gordon underscored the imperative of increased efforts to
deliver humanitarian assistance to those in need and to protect
civilians, and he provided an update on his recent meetings with Israeli
officials. Dr. Gordon emphasized that Hamas does not represent the
Palestinian people, that Hamas poses an unacceptable terrorist threat to
the Israeli people, and that Hamas cannot control Gaza when the fighting
ends.  
   
Dr. Gordon and Palestinian officials discussed the situation in the West
Bank, and Dr. Gordon emphasized the importance of preserving stability.
He expressed our concern with steps that could escalate tensions,
including extremist settler violence.  He discussed the new visa
restriction policy targeting individuals – both Israeli and Palestinian
–  believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security, or
stability in the West Bank.  
  
On day-after planning, Dr. Gordon outlined the principles that the Vice
President and the Biden-Harris Administration have publicly laid out and
discussed efforts on reconstruction, security, and governance in Gaza
after the phase of intensive fighting ends. Dr. Gordon emphasized that
the Vice President and the Biden-Harris Administration are committed to
accelerate planning on the day-after, so that when the phase of
intensive fighting ends, we can begin to implement these plans, with
significant support from the international community.  He reiterated
that a revitalized Palestinian Authority must have the capacity to
govern both Gaza and the West Bank, and that Palestinian Authority
Security Forces must be strengthened to eventually assume security
responsibilities in Gaza.
