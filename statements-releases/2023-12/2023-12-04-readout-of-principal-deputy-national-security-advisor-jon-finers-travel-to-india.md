Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer led a U.S.
delegation to New Delhi on December 4 for an intersessional review of
the U.S-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) with
Indian Deputy National Security Advisor Vikram Misri.  The iCET is a
major milestone in the U.S.-India partnership, which is increasingly
defined by strategic security and technology cooperation.

In addition, Mr. Finer conducted bilateral and regional consultations
with Ambassador Misri, Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar,
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, and Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra
for in-depth discussions aimed at strengthening coordination and policy
alignment across the Indo-Pacific, including the wider Indian Ocean
region.  They discussed the Middle East, including the recent attacks on
commercial vessels in the Red Sea and the importance of safeguarding
freedom of commercial navigation, as well as plans for a post-conflict
Gaza and a pathway toward a two-state solution. Mr. Finer acknowledged
India’s establishment of a Committee of Enquiry to investigate lethal
plotting in the United States and the importance of holding accountable
anyone found responsible.
