  Israel"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke this morning with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.  The leaders discussed developments in
Gaza.  The President expressed his deep concern for the hostages that
remain in Gaza.  He reiterated that the ICRC must be permitted to access
remaining hostages held by Hamas terrorists.  He noted that it was
Hamas’s refusal to release young women civilian hostages that led to a
breakdown in the humanitarian pause.  The leaders agreed to remain
deeply engaged to pursue every possible opportunity to free the
remaining hostages.    
   
The President underscored the importance of the continuous and sustained
flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He welcomed the recent Israeli
decision to ensure that fuel levels will meet requisite needs, but
stressed that much more assistance was urgently required across the
board. The President emphasized the critical need to protect civilians
and to separate the civilian population from Hamas including through
corridors that allow people to move safely from defined areas of
hostilities.    
   
President Biden reiterated his concern about extremist violence
committed against Palestinians and the need to increase stability in the
West Bank.    
   
The President and the Prime Minister agreed to remain in regular
consultation both directly and through their respective national
security teams.
