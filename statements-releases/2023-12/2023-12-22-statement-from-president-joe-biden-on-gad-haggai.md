title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Gad\_Haggai"
---
 
Jill and I are heartbroken by the news that American Gad Haggai is now
believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7. We continue to pray
for the well-being and safe return of his wife, Judy. Their daughter
joined by phone my meeting with the families of hostages last week.
Those families bravely shared with me the harrowing ordeal that they
have endured over the past months as they await news of their loved
ones. It’s intolerable. Today, we are praying for their four children,
seven grandchildren, and other loved ones and are grieving this tragic
news with them.  And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the
families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring
them home.
