title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Emergency Response Proposed\_Rule"
---
 
When others run away from danger, emergency responders run toward it. My
local fire company in Wilmington saved my life, and thousands of
Americans all across the country have stories like mine. Firefighters
and emergency responders always have our backs, and we should always
have theirs.

Today, my Department of Labor is proposing a rule that would strengthen
safety standards for emergency responder equipment, training, and
vehicle operations for the first time in more than 40 years. These new
standards would prevent thousands of injuries for more than one million
brave emergency responders across the country.

I have fought for emergency responders and firefighters my entire
career, and my Administration will continue doing everything it can to
make sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs safely.
