title: "Readout of White\_House Meeting with Leaders from Legacy Black Civil Rights\
  \ Organizations"
---
 
Last week, senior White House officials convened a meeting with leaders
from legacy Black civil rights organizations. During the meeting, the
officials highlighted the Biden-Harris administration’s continued
efforts to advance justice and equity for the Black community and all
Americans amid a groundswell of harmful attacks on the progress that has
been made. They discussed efforts to combat hate-fueled violence,
promote inclusion and their shared commitment to advancing legislation
to protect voting rights and address other critical issues facing our
democracy. Administration Officials provided a progress update on
equitable implementation of the President’s Investing in America
agenda.  
   
The civil rights leaders shared their recommendations to further advance
racial equity, provided an update on their work to protect voting
rights, and shared ideas to address the risks of artificial
intelligence, and strengthen diversity, equity, and inclusion programs
in the public and private sectors.
