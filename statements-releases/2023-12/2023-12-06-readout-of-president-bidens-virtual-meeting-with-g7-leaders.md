title: "Readout of President\_Biden\u2019s Virtual Meeting with G7\_Leaders"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met virtually with G7 Leaders to
discuss the G7’s unwavering support for Ukraine and ongoing efforts to
respond to the situation in the Middle East.  Leaders also discussed the
importance of continued and concrete progress to address a range of
global challenges, including sustainable development, climate change,
and AI.  
   
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined the beginning of the
virtual meeting, and President Biden and other G7 Leaders reiterated
their commitment to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. They also
outlined additional steps that they are taking together to support
Ukrainians in their fight for independence, sovereignty, and territorial
integrity.  
   
Leaders also discussed the situation in the Middle East and expressed
deep regret that Hamas refused to release all of its women hostages and
military operations resumed.  President Biden thanked Leaders for their
enduring support of Israel, work to stem the spread of regional
conflict, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and
collective efforts to advance a durable, lasting peace culminating in a
Palestinian state part of a two-state solution.    
   
The Leaders also discussed threats to freedom of navigation in the
Middle East region, condemning Houthi attacks against commercial vessels
in the Red Sea, and noted that we have reason to believe Iran enabled
these attacks.  
   
Building on the unprecedented unity that G7 Leaders displayed in May at
the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Leaders once again demonstrated their
commitment to close cooperation as they each respond in real time to
events around the world.  
   
President Biden thanked Prime Minister Kishida for his leadership of the
G7 over the past year, and welcomed Italy’s G7 Presidency next year
under Prime Minister Meloni.
