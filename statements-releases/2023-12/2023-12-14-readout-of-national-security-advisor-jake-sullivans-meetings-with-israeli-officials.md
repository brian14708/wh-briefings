  Officials"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and his War Cabinet, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav
Gallant, Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, and member of
the War Cabinet Benny Gantz today in Tel Aviv, Israel to discuss the
ongoing conflict in Gaza and our shared objective of defeating Hamas,
while minimizing harm to civilians and ensuring the increased and
sustained flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.  
   
Mr. Sullivan was briefed in detail on the State of Israel’s military
campaign in Gaza, including its objectives, phasing, and setting
conditions for shifts over time from high intensity clearing operations
to lower intensity surgical operations against Hamas remnants. Mr.
Sullivan confirmed U.S. support for Israel’s right to defend itself and
its citizens from Hamas, which has vowed to carry out the atrocities of
October 7 over and over again. He welcomed increased coordination with
the UN, Egypt, and other partners on the delivery and distribution of
humanitarian assistance and stressed the importance of expanding and
sustaining the flow of assistance into Gaza.   
   
During the meetings, Mr. Sullivan described U.S. efforts in coordination
with allies and partners to deter any attempt to expand the conflict
regionally, including in the Red Sea, and expressed President
Biden’s commitment to restoring calm along the Blue Line through a
combination of deterrence and diplomacy.
