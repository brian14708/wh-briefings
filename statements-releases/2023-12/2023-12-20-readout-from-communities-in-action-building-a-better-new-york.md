On December 14, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and
the Office of Public Engagement hosted 70 local elected officials and
community leaders from across the state of New York as part of its
“Communities in Action” event series.

During the half-day forum, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials
highlighted the impacts of the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act on communities across
New York. Participants included local elected officials, labor leaders,
businesses owners, community organizers, and health care professionals
who work to leverage the historic investments from the President’s
Investing in America vision to create and expand opportunities for
working families.

The forum was the twenty-fourth in a series of “Communities in Action”
events that the White House hosts with state and local leaders to
demonstrate how the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering critical
progress for the American people.

Administration officials included Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis
McDonough, Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg, Director
of Intergovernmental Affairs Tom Perez, Director of the Office of Public
Engagement Steve Benjamin, American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene
Sperling, Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu,
Deputy Director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention Greg Jackson,
and Senior Advisor to the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services Bitta Mostofi.
