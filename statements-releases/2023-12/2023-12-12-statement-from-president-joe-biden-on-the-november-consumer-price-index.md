Today’s report demonstrates continued progress bringing inflation down
and lowering costs for American families. Inflation is now at 3.1
percent — down by nearly two thirds from its peak. Inflation has come
down while unemployment has remained below 4 percent for the longest
stretch in 50 years, which means that workers’ wages and household
wealth are higher now than they were before the pandemic, adjusted for
inflation. Prices have declined for a number of products over the last
year from cars and gallons of gas to TVs, toys, and many appliances to
eggs and milk.  
   
Despite this progress, I know many Americans still find too many things
unaffordable. That’s why I’m fighting to bring down insulin and
prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, and utility bills.
I’m fighting to eliminate the hidden junk fees that can really add up
for hardworking Americans. And now that our actions have helped rebuild
supply chains and brought down input costs, I’m calling on large
corporations to pass along the savings to consumers.  
   
Republicans in Congress don’t have a plan to lower costs for families.
Their only plan is more giveaways for the wealthiest Americans and
biggest corporations. They’re siding with special interests to try to
block us from lowering the costs of insulin and prescription drugs.
They’re still trying to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
While Congressional Republicans fight for the wealthy and big
corporations, leaving hardworking families to pay the price, I’ll keep
fighting to bring down costs and grow our economy with a strong middle
class.
