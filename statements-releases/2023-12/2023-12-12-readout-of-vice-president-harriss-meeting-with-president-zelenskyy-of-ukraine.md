Vice President Kamala Harris met today with President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy of Ukraine at the White House ahead of President Zelenskyy’s
meeting with President Biden.  The Vice President underscored the United
States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s security and people. The
leaders discussed efforts to advance Ukraine’s economic recovery.  In
this regard, they noted the importance of secure export corridors for
Ukrainian agricultural products, which contribute to global food
security, as well as cooperation on Ukraine’s defense industrial base,
which can contribute both to Ukraine’s security and to its economic
recovery.  The Vice President welcomed Ukraine’s progress on rule of law
reforms and anti-corruption efforts, which are key to attracting private
investment and to Ukraine’s EU accession process, and she emphasized the
importance of efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s democratic institutions. 
The leaders agreed on the importance of continued international support
to sustain the morale of the Ukrainian people, who must know that they
are not alone as they defend their country against Russian aggression.
