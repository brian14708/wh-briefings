  \ for Over 80,000 Student Loan\_Borrowers"

*This brings total approved debt cancellation by the Biden-Harris
Administration to $132 billion for over 3.6 million Americans*

Today my Administration is approving another $4.8 billion in student
debt cancellation for 80,300 people. This relief is thanks to my
Administration’s efforts to fix Public Service Loan Forgiveness, so
teachers, members of the military, nurses, and other public service
workers get the relief they have earned. And it’s because of actions my
Administration took to make sure that borrowers who have been in
repayment for at least 20 years – but didn’t accurately get credit for
student loan payments – get the relief they are entitled to. This brings
the total debt cancellation my Administration has approved to $132
billion for over 3.6 million Americans through various actions.  
   
Today’s announcement comes on top of all we’ve been able to achieve for
students and student loan borrowers in the past few years.  This
includes: achieving the largest increases in Pell Grants in over a
decade to help families who earn less than roughly $60,000 a year;
fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that borrowers who
go into public service get the debt relief they’re entitled to under the
law; and creating the most generous Income-Driven Repayment plan in
history – the SAVE plan.  Borrowers can go to studentaid.gov to apply.
And, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision on our student debt
relief plan, we are continuing to pursue an alternative path to deliver
student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as
possible.  
   
From Day One of my Administration, I vowed to improve the student loan
system so that a higher education provides Americans with opportunity
and prosperity – not unmanageable burdens of student loan debt.  I won’t
back down from using every tool at our disposal to get student loan
borrowers the relief they need to reach their dreams.
