title: "President\_Biden Transmits Compacts of Free Association-Related Agreements\
  \ to U.S.\_Congress"

Today President Biden transmitted to the U.S. Congress five agreements
related to the Compacts of Free Association, signed by the Department of
State, with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of
the Marshall Islands (RMI).  The Biden Administration is working closely
with the U.S. Congress to enact legislation to allow for the
implementation of these five agreements, which will fulfill our
commitments and strengthen our enduring relationships with our Compact
of Free Association partner nations.  These five agreements are:

1.  The Agreement Concerning Procedures for the Implementation of
    United States Economic Assistance provided in the 2023 Amended
    Compact Between the Government of the United States of America and
    the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia;  
     
2.  The 2023 Federal Programs and Services Agreement Between the
    Government of the United States and the Government of the Federated
    States of Micronesia with Annexes;  
     
3.  The Agreement Concerning Procedures for the Implementation of United
    States Economic Assistance Provided in the 2023 Amended Compact
    Between the Government of the United States of America and the
    Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands;  
     
4.  The Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America
    and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands Regarding
    the Compact Trust Fund; and  
     
5.  The Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America
    and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to Amend
    the Compact of Free Association, as Amended.

The Biden Administration appreciates the bipartisan work in Congress to
advance legislation necessary to bring these agreements into force. The
Administration calls on Congress to pass Compacts-related legislation as
soon as possible.  
  
The Compacts of Free Association with the Federated States of
Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of
Palau demonstrate our long-term commitment to these three nations,
fostering economic prosperity and stability that form the foundation of
our strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region.  Under the Compacts,
the United States provides for defense of and has the authority to deny
third party military access to these countries.  
  
These Compact-related agreements include economic assistance to support
essential government services such as health, education, and
infrastructure, and U.S. contributions to Compact Trust Funds, which
will support the countries’ self-sufficiency in the future.  Extending
such assistance, including Federal programs and services, is a critical
component of the Biden-Harris’ Administration’s Indo-Pacific, Pacific
Partnership, and National Security Strategies.
