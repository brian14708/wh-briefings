  \ the ALTERRA\_Fund"

I welcome President Mohamed bin Zayed’s announcement of the ALTERRA
Fund—a $30 billion catalytic climate finance vehicle aimed
at mobilizing the capital and investment needed to fight the global
climate crisis. ALTERRA can play an important role in
supporting the clean energy transition and enhancing resilience,
particularly the $5 billion focused on making it easier to invest in
least developed countries and small island developing states. And, it
reflects the United States and UAE’s common commitment—solidified last
year through our [Partnership for Accelerating Clean
Energy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/01/fact-sheet-u-s-uae-partnership-to-accelerate-transition-to-clean-energy-pace/)—to
broaden clean energy investments and reduce emissions globally.
