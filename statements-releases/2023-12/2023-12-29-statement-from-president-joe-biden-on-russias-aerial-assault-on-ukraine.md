title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Russia\u2019s Aerial Assault on\_Ukraine"
---
 
Overnight, Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since
this war began. This massive bombardment used drones and missiles,
including missiles with hypersonic capability, to strike cities and
civilian infrastructure all across Ukraine. Strikes reportedly hit a
maternity hospital, a shopping mall, and residential areas—killing
innocent people and injuring dozens more. It is a stark reminder to the
world that, after nearly two years of this devastating war, Putin’s
objective remains unchanged. He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and
subjugate its people. He must be stopped.  
   
In the face of this brutal attack, Ukraine deployed the air defense
systems that the United States and our Allies and partners have
delivered to Ukraine over the past year to successfully intercept and
destroy many of the missiles and drones. The American people can be
proud of the lives we have helped to save and the support we have given
Ukraine as it defends its people, its freedom, and its independence. But
unless Congress takes urgent action in the new year, we will not be able
to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine
needs to protect its people. Congress must step up and act without any
further delay.  
   
The stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine. They affect the
entirety of the NATO Alliance, the security of Europe, and the future of
the Transatlantic relationship.  Putin has not just attempted to
destroy Ukraine; he has threatened some of our NATO Allies as well. When
dictators and autocrats are allowed to run roughshod in Europe, the risk
rises that the United States gets pulled in directly.  And the
consequences reverberate around the world.  That’s why the United States
has rallied a coalition of more than 50 countries to support the defense
of Ukraine.  We cannot let our allies and partners down.  We cannot let
Ukraine down.  History will judge harshly those who fail to answer
freedom’s call.
