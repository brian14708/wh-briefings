title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Passing of former Congresswoman\
  \ Eddie Bernice\_Johnson"
---
 
Eddie Bernice Johnson was a dedicated nurse, state legislator, and
longtime U.S. congresswoman with immense courage and a commitment to the
promise of America.  She had unwavering dedication to the people of
North Texas.  
   
She and I worked together throughout her 30 years in Congress, and I’ve
always been grateful for her friendship and partnership.  
   
Eddie Bernice turned a childhood dream to work in medicine into a
lifetime of service, fighting to get millions of Americans access to
healthcare, education, and opportunity.   
   
Early on, as the chief psychiatric nurse at the Veterans Administration
in Dallas, she helped our nation to fulfill its most sacred obligation,
to care for the troops we sent into harm’s way when they’re home. And in
the Texas statehouse and then over 30 years as the first Black American
elected to Congress from Dallas, she fought to expand civil rights, to
create jobs, to combat the climate crisis, and much more. Recently, her
leadership was crucial in passing our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, creating tens of thousands of good-paying
jobs and making sure America leads the industries of the future.  
   
Throughout her life, and as the former chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus, she was an icon and mentor to generations of public servants,
through whom her legacy of resilience and purpose will endure.  
   
Jill and I send our love to her family, including her son Kirk and her
grandchildren Kirk Jr, David, and James; to her many friends; and to the
people of Texas’ 30th Congressional District, who were so fortunate to
have her as their champion for so long.
