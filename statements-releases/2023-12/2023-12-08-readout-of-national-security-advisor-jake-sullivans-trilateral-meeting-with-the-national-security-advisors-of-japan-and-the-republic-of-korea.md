On Saturday, December 9, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met
with ROK National Security Advisor Cho Tae-Yong and Japanese National
Security Advisor Takeo Akiba for the fourth trilateral National Security
Advisors trilateral meeting of the Biden-Harris Administration. Their

in which President Biden, President Yoon, and Prime Minister Kishida
launched a new era of trilateral cooperation.  
   
The National Security Advisors reviewed progress on a wide range of
trilateral initiatives, including the Commitment to Consult on regional
crises, the sharing of ballistic missile defense data, and our
collective efforts to respond to the DPRK’s use of cryptocurrency to
generate revenue for its illicit WMD programs. They also discussed next
steps in trilateral cooperation on economic security, including our
supply chain early warning initiative, and on our efforts to align our
three countries respective Indo-Pacific Strategies and capacity efforts
throughout the region.  
   
National Security Advisors Sullivan, Cho, and Akiba also discussed the
deepening partnership between the DPRK and Russia and agreed to work in
close coordination to counter its destabilizing effects. They reaffirmed
the fundamental importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits
and underscored their commitment to freedom of navigation and to
international law, including in the South China Sea and East China
Sea.  
   
National Security Advisor Sullivan thanked National Security Advisor Cho
and National Security Advisor Akiba for the ROK and Japan’s unwavering
commitment to the people of Ukraine. He praised the courageous work
undertaken by the ROK and Japan to strengthen their bilateral ties,
noting that their efforts had allowed our three countries to commence
and institutionalize a new era of trilateral partnership that will be a
force for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific for years to come.
