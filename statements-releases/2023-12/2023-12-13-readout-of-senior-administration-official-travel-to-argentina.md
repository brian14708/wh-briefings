On Wednesday, December 13, 2023, Deputy National Security Advisor for
International Economics Mike Pyle visited Buenos Aires and met with
senior members of President Milei of Argentina’s administration,
including Chief of Cabinet Nicolas Posse, Economy Minister Luis Caputo,
and Central Bank President Santiago Bausili.  
   
Deputy National Security Advisor Pyle discussed President Milei’s plans
for Argentina’s economy, underscoring the importance of laying the
foundation for economic growth to create opportunities for working
families. They also discussed areas where the United States and
Argentina can strengthen their cooperation, including on advancing the
clean energy transition and spurring private sector investment in the
country.  
   
This visit continues the consistent engagement by the Biden
Administration with the Government of Argentina’s leadership since
President Milei’s election in November 2023.  President Biden called
President Milei to congratulate him on his election, National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan met with President Milei at the White House last
month, and Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm recently visited Buenos
Aires for President Milei’s inauguration.
