title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Actions and Historic\
  \ Progress Supporting Tribal Nations and Native Communities Ahead of Third Annual\
  \ White\_House Tribal Nations\_Summit"
---
 
This week, President Biden will host the third annual White House Tribal
Nations Summit of the Biden-Harris Administration. The Summit represents
the President’s commitment to strengthening the Nation-to-Nation
relationships the United States has with Tribal Nations by bringing
Tribal leaders and top administration officials together to discuss the
most important issues facing Tribal communities. Since taking office,
President Biden has prioritized strengthening Nation-to-Nation
relationships with Tribal Nations and advancing Tribal sovereignty and
self-determination. And through the President’s Investing in America
agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration has made record investments to
support Tribal Nations and Native communities.

As Tribal leaders gather in Washington at the Summit, the President,
Vice President, eleven Cabinet members, and additional senior
Administration officials will announce a number of new actions,
including a historic executive order, that build on the Administration’s
progress to promote Nation-to-Nation partnerships; strengthen the
understanding and respect for Tribal sovereignty and Native history;
protect the health, safety, and welfare of Native women, children and
families; and make it easier for Tribal Nations to access federal
funding.

During the Summit, the Biden-Harris Administration will also release a
comprehensive [2023 Progress Report for Tribal
Nations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023.12.04-TNS-Progress-Report.pdf),
which outlines historic progress the Administration has made over the
past year to deliver on the President’s commitment to supporting Indian
Country and address the top concerns of Tribal communities, including
executive action to address the crisis of missing and murdered
indigenous people, securing more stable advance funding for Indian
Health Service, and championing innovative new partnerships with Tribal
Nations to co-steward their ancestral lands and waters, such as some of
our newest National Monuments: Avi Kwa Ame in Nevada, and Baaj Nwaavjo
I’tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National
Monument in Arizona.

New Administration-wide actions include:

**<u>Promoting Nation-to Nation Partnerships with Tribal Nations</u>**

-   The Biden-Harris Administrationwill announce that in 2023, the
    Federal Government signed more than 190 co-stewardship or
    co-management agreements, which allow Tribal Nations to collaborate
    with the Federal Government to manage the federal lands, waters, and
    resources that are most important to them. The announcements include
    the first ever co-stewardship agreement with the Department of
    Commerce (DOC), more than 70 co-stewardship agreements with the
    Department of the Interior (DOI), and over 120 new co-stewardship
    and co-management agreements with the Department of Agriculture
    (USDA),which also tripled its investment in these agreements to over
    $68 million.
-   Department of Energy (DOE) and DOI will announce a Secretarial
    Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that establishes a collaborative
    framework to manage Rattlesnake Mountain or “Laliik,” located within
    the Hanford nuclear site in Washington.

<!-- -->

-   **MOUs to Support Clean Energy Transitions for the Hopi Tribe and
    Navajo Nation**. DOE will announce two new MOUs signed by DOE, DOI,
    USDA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal
    Permitting Improvement Steering Council, and the Departments of
    Education, Transportation, and Labor that create structured support
    for the Hopi Tribe and amends the existing Navajo Nation MOU with
    Federal agencies to help both Tribes and their communities
    transition to clean energy.

**<u>Strengthening the Understanding and Respect for Tribal Sovereignty
and Native History</u>**

-   **Tribal Consultation and Treaty Rights Training for All Federal
    Employees.** The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and DOI will
    [preview a
    trailer](https://360.articulate.com/review/content/162273a6-f70c-408a-8f66-42ab8acc3dd9/review)
    of the 2024 launch of training for all federal employees that will
    educate the federal workforce on the unique obligations and best
    practices for respecting Tribal treaty and reserved rights when
    engaging in Tribal consultation.
-   **Sacred Sites Best Practice Guide.** DOI will announce that the
    White House Council on Native American Affairs (WHCNAA) has
    completed a *Best Practices Guide for Tribal and Native Hawaiian
    Sacred Sites*,which provides best practices, procedures, and
    guidance for the management, treatment, and protection of sacred
    sites, identifies barriers to federal protection of sacred sites,
    and recommendations to remedy those barriers.
-   **National Park Service Study on Indian Reorganization Act Period**.
    DOI will announce that the National Park Service is initiating a new
    Theme Study that will help tell the story of the Indian
    Reorganization Period (1934–1950). This study will provide a
    national historic context and a list of properties for possible
    future National Historic Landmarks. This builds on the [Federal
    Indian Boarding School
    Initiative](https://www.doi.gov/priorities/strengthening-indian-country/federal-indian-boarding-school-initiative)
    and other efforts by DOI to ensure that Native American history is
    part of American History.
-   **New Work to Restore Tribal Bison Herds and Support Tribal Food
    Sovereignty.** USDA will announce that the World Wildlife Fund, The
    Nature Conservancy, and other buffalo focused non-profit
    organizations are joining its Public-Private Partnership with DOI,
    the InterTribal Buffalo Council, and Native Americans in
    Philanthropy to work on Tribal Bison expansion and conservation.
    USDA is also announcing its first Indigenous Animals Meat Processing
    Grant for processing indigenous animals, including Bison.

**<u>Reforming Critical Federal Processes for Tribal Nations</u>**

-   **Final Fee-to-Trust Land Acquisitions Rules.** DOI will announce
    the publication of its final rule amending the process that governs
    fee-to-trust land (or “land into trust”) process for Tribal Nations
    to expand their land bases by transferring land title to the United
    States to be held in trust for the benefit of an individual Indian
    or Tribe, including in Alaska. This process is crucial for Tribal
    economic development and Tribal sovereignty, and helps right the
    wrongs of past federal policies such as allotment, which removed
    millions of acres of land from Tribal ownership and federal
    protection. DOI’s final rule creates a more efficient, less
    cumbersome, and less expensive fee-to-trust process, including for
    conservation purposes.
-   **Final Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
    (NAGPRA) Rule.** DOI will announce final revisions of its NAGPRA
    regulations that provide a systematic process for returning human
    remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural
    patrimony to Tribal Nations and Native Hawaiian Organizations. The
    regulatory changes streamline the requirements for museums and
    federal agencies to inventory and identify human remains and
    cultural items in their collections.
-   **Plan to Update the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program Rules.** The
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will announce
    plans to publish in 2024 a final rule to strengthen the Section 184
    Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program—a Program synonymous with
    homeownership in Indian Country. HUD’s proposed rule aims to
    modernize the program and provide more homeownership opportunities
    in Indian Country by codifying program requirements, introducing
    greater certainty into the program to attract more lenders, and
    authorizing HUD to establish a minimum level of lending on trust
    land. 
-   **Federal Emergency Management Agency Debuts Improvements to Tribal
    Nations’ Access to Resources Before, During, and After Disasters.**
    The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) will announce it is working to update
    policies that will improve FEMA’s ability to assist Tribal Nations
    recovering from disasters and expand a culturally competent FEMA
    workforce by increasing Tribal participation in shaping the Public
    Assistance programs, hiring more staff from Indian Country, and
    developing FEMA staff trainings.

**<u>Increasing Accessibility of Federal Resources for Tribal
Nations</u>**

-   **Tribal** [**Access to Capital Clearinghouse
    Launch**](https://www.bia.gov/atc)**.** DOI and WHCNAA will launch a
    website that provides a searchable database of all federal funding
    opportunities, including grants and loans, available to Tribal
    Nations and Native businesses.
-   **Request for Information on Tribal Funding Needs.** DOI and WHCNAA
    will announce a draft [Request for
    Information](http://sba.gov/NativeCapitalRFI) that, once finalized,
    will—for the first time—help the Federal Government estimate the
    additional funding that Tribal Nations require to meet their
    communities’ needs. The Request for Information will also seek
    information on barriers that Tribal Nations currently face in
    accessing federal resources. WHCNAA will take the draft directly to
    Tribal consultation in January 2024.
-   **Buy Indian Act Implementation.** HHS and DOI will announce that
    significant percentages of their FY 2023 agency procurement spending
    on contracts and services went to Native-owned or controlled
    businesses under the Buy Indian Act. Indian Health Service (IHS)
    will announce it awarded $444 million (30.6%), HHS will announce
    that it awarded $1.5 billion (3.8%) overall, DOI’s Indian Affairs
    Bureaus will announce they awarded $626 million (74.6%), and DOI
    overall will announce it awarded over $1.4 billion (16.9%) to
    Native-owned and controlled businesses, with over $1.0 billion
    awarded to Native-owned and controlled small businesses (18.1% of
    eligible small business dollars).  

**<u>Protecting the Health, Education, Safety, and Welfare in Indian
Country – Particularly for Native Women, Children, and Families.</u>**

-   **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Initiative on Native
    Children and Families**. HHS will announce a series of actions and
    accomplishments that reflect a renewed focus on supporting Native
    Children and Families. This work includes streamlining Tribal
    applications for federal child care assistance; doubling the Tribal
    set aside funding for the Maternal Infant, and Early Childhood Home
    Visiting Program; a new training on cross-cultural understanding for
    early childhood researchers; progress on the National Maternal
    Mental Health Hotline partnership with IHS; a new obstetric
    readiness in emergencies manual developed by IHS; and progress
    piloting maternity care coordinators through IHS.
-   **Strategy for Tribes to Access Strategic National Stockpile.** HHS
    will announce a forthcoming strategy for best practices on how IHS,
    Tribal Nations, and Urban Indian Organizations can access the
    lifesaving Federal repository of drugs and medical supplies to
    support Native communities, prevent supply shortages, and reduce
    health disparities.
-   **Proposed Updates to Adoption and Foster Care Data (AFCARS)**
    **Collection Rules to Better Understand Indian Child Welfare Act
    (ICWA) Implementation. ** HHS will announce a proposed rule updating
    AFCARS data collection. AFCARS data is used in research and federal
    policy planning to reduce entry into and improve outcomes of
    children in foster care. The additional data HHS proposes collecting
    is relevant for understanding implementation of ICWA at the state
    level.
-   **Department of Justice (DOJ) Launches New VAWA Reimbursement
    Program.** DOJ’s Office of Violence Against Women will announce its
    Notice of Reimbursement Opportunity for Tribes to submit expenses to
    DOJ for reimbursement that they incurred exercising expanded
    criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians under the [*2022
    Reauthorization of The Violence Against Women Act
    (VAWA).*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-reauthorization-of-the-violence-against-women-act-vawa/)
