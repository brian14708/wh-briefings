President Biden has invited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to
the White House for a meeting on Tuesday, December 12 to underscore the
United States’ unshakeable commitment to supporting the people of
Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal invasion. As
Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, the
leaders will discuss Ukraine’s urgent needs and the vital importance of
the United States’ continued support at this critical moment.
