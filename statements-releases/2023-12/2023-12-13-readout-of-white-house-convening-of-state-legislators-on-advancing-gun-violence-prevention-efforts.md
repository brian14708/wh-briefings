title: "Readout of White\_House Convening of State Legislators on Advancing Gun Violence\
  \ Prevention\_Efforts"
---
 
Today, Vice President Harris, the Office of Gun Violence Prevention and
the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs convened 100 state legislators
to announce the Biden-Harris Administration’s [Safer States
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/13/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-launches-the-biden-harris-administration-safer-states-initiative-highlights-new-executive-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence/) to
reduce gun violence and save lives.  
   
This was the largest White House convening of state legislators to
discuss gun violence prevention, and falls right before state
legislative sessions kick off in 2024. During the convening, White House
officials and state legislators discussed the Safer States Agenda, which
highlights key actions states can take to end the epidemic of gun
violence, including the establishment of state offices focused on gun
violence prevention, strengthening support for survivors and victims,
and establishing industry accountability and standards.  
   
At today’s convening, the Justice Department announced the publication
of two pieces of [model
legislation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-publishes-model-legislation-help-states-reduce-gun-violence-and-improve) drawn
from common-sense gun-safety statutes already on the books in a broad
cross-section of states.  These model bills will assist additional
states in crafting appropriate requirements for safe gun storage and the
prompt reporting of lost and stolen firearms—both of which are proven,
evidence-informed solutions that will save lives.  
   
Georgia Congresswoman Lucy McBath emphasized the action required at the
federal, state and local level to protect communities from the threat of
gun violence, and White House officials thanked the state legislators
for their leadership and ongoing partnership.  
   
Senior Administration officials included:

-   Vice President Kamala Harris
-   Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco
-   Director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention Stef Feldman
-   Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of
    Intergovernmental Affairs Tom Perez
-   Deputy Director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention Gregory
    Jackson
