Vice President Kamala Harris met today with His Majesty King Abdullah II
of Jordan in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates on the sidelines of the
28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change (COP28). The Vice President thanked the King for his continued
leadership in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for
Jordan’s leadership in providing vital humanitarian assistance to
Gaza, including its three airdrops of medical supplies to the field
hospital that it has established in Gaza. 

The Vice President discussed the importance of the recent pause in the
fighting between Israel and Hamas — which saw the release of more
than 100 hostages out of Gaza and resulted in much-needed humanitarian
assistance entering Gaza, before it was violated by Hamas — and the
Biden-Harris administration‘s  commitment to supporting efforts to reach
a new deal. 

The Vice President discussed U.S. ideas for post-conflict planning in
Gaza, including efforts on reconstruction, security, and governance. 
She emphasized that these efforts can only succeed if they are pursued
in the context of a clear political horizon for the Palestinian people,
toward a state of their own led by a revitalized Palestinian Authority
and backed by significant support from the international community and
the countries of the region. The Vice President reiterated the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to a two-state solution, and
noted it is the best path to durable peace and security. She emphasized
the Palestinians’ right to dignity and self-determination and that
Israelis and Palestinians must enjoy equal measures of freedom,
security, and prosperity.
