Vice President Kamala Harris met today with President Abdel Fattah
Al-Sisi of Egypt in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates on the sidelines of
the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (COP28). The Vice President thanked President Sisi for
his efforts in securing a deal between Israel and Hamas that provided an
extended pause in the fighting and which resulted in the release of more
than 100 hostages, including Americans, while substantially increasing
the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, before the pause was
violated by Hamas.   
  
The Vice President also thanked President Sisi for his work to help
evacuate American citizens from Gaza. She emphasized that the United
States would remain committed to relentlessly pursuing the release of
all the hostages in close cooperation with regional partners and
expressed continued support for extended pauses in the fighting to get
hostages out and aid in.   
  
The Vice President reiterated that under no circumstances will the
United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or
the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders
of Gaza. The Vice President discussed U.S. ideas for post-conflict
planning in Gaza including efforts on reconstruction, security, and
governance.  She emphasized that these efforts can only succeed if they
are pursued in the context of a clear political horizon for the
Palestinian people towards a state of their own led by a revitalized
Palestinian Authority and have significant support from the
international community and the countries of the region.  The Vice
President made clear that Hamas cannot control Gaza, which is untenable
for Israel’s security, the well-being of the Palestinian people, and
regional security.
