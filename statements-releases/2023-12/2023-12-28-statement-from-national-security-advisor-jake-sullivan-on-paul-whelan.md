Today marks an appalling milestone: five years Paul Whelan has spent in
wrongful detention in Russia. We once again call on Russia to release
him immediately.   
   
We continue to work intensively to bring him home to his loved ones. Our
thoughts are with him and his remarkably strong family today.
