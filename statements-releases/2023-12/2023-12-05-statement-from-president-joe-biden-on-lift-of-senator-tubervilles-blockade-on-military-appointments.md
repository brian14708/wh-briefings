title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Lift of Senator Tuberville\u2019s Blockade\
  \ on Military\_Appointments"
---
 
After 10 months of undermining military readiness and the morale of our
troops, Senator Tuberville of Alabama has finally lifted his politically
motivated hold on hundreds of military nominations. 425
highly-qualified, patriotic military leaders have now been confirmed by
the Senate to perform their duties as they fulfill their sacred oath to
keep our country safe. These confirmations are long overdue, and should
never have been held up in the first place. Our service members are the
backbone of our country and deserve to receive the pay and promotions
they have earned. In the end, this was all pointless. Senator
Tuberville, and the Republicans who stood with him, needlessly hurt
hundreds of servicemembers and military families and threatened our
national security â€“ all to push a partisan agenda. I hope no one forgets
what he did.

Those who serve this nation deserve better. Thankfully, military leaders
will finally be able to take their next post. Military families who for
months have been in limbo will finally be able to make plans to move,
start new jobs, and enter new schools. Our servicemembers and military
families put everything on the line for our country. I thank the Senate
for quickly confirming these appointments and urge them to confirm the
remaining appointees swiftly.
