title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Judy\_Weinstein"
---
 
Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judy Weinstein is also
believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7. This tragic
development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week’s news that
Judy’s beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by
Hamas. We are holding Judy and Gad’s four children, seven grandchildren,
and other loved ones close to our hearts.  I will never forget what
their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage
in Gaza, have shared with me. They have been living through hell for
weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal. And I reaffirm
the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage:
we will not stop working to bring them home.
