title: "FACT SHEET: New Actions from the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration to Hold\
  \ Perpetrators of Sexual Violence\_Accountable"

As President Biden has said, it’s on all of us—government, international
organizations, civil society, and individual citizens—to forcefully
condemn sexual violence without equivocation and without exception.
Following the end of the 16 Days of Action Against Gender-Based Violence
on December 10, we are reminded that the human rights and safety of
women and girls remain under attack globally—including through the
persistent threat of sexual violence in conflict and crisis settings.  
  
The United States stands in solidarity with the women and girls bearing
the costs of conflict and instability across the globe—from Ukraine,
where Russian forces have committed rape and other atrocities against
Ukrainian women; to Sudan, where paramilitary forces terrorize women and
girls with sexual violence; to Ethiopia, where we have seen mass reports
of sexual violence; to Haiti, where gangs use sexual assault and rape to
coerce communities into submission. And in the weeks since October 7,
survivors and witnesses have bravely shared accounts of severe sexual
violence by Hamas terrorists against women and children in Israel.  
  
Although sexual violence in conflict is widespread, the United States
does not accept it as inevitable. Ending gender-based violence has been
a priority for President Biden throughout his time in public life: as
Senator, Vice President, and since day one of the Biden-Harris
Administration. Last year, President Biden signed a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/28/presidential-memorandum-to-promote-accountability-for-conflict-related-sexual-violence/)
directing the U.S. government to strengthen our exercise of financial,
diplomatic, and legal tools against sexual violence in conflict—leading
to the
[first-ever](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/20/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-new-steps-against-perpetrators-of-sexual-violence-in-conflict/)
imposition of sanctions driven by a focus on conflict-related sexual
violence in June of this year.   
  
Building on those efforts, to mark Human Rights week and the end of the
16 Days of Action Against Gender-Based Violence, the Department of
[Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1972) and the
[State](https://www.state.gov/promoting-accountability-in-support-of-the-75th-anniversary-of-the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-2/)
Department issued sanctions against thirteen targets from four countries
for their connection to acts of sexual violence—the largest set of
financial sanctions and visa restrictions the United States has issued
against individuals connected to this abhorrent abuse of human rights.

This includes designations against:

-   Two individuals from armed rebel groups in the Central African
    Republic, who forced girls into sexual slavery and perpetrated rape
    and sexual assault;  
-   Four leaders from the ISIS affiliate in the Democratic Republic of
    Congo, who killed, maimed, and committed sexual violence against
    women and girls;  
-   Four gang members from Haiti responsible for or complicit in sexual
    violence and abduction, one of whom survivors identified as directly
    responsible for more than 1,000 documented cases of sexual violence
    in 2022 alone; and,  
-   Three individuals from government-aligned forces and allied militias
    in South Sudan who oversaw, ordered, incentivized, or directly
    engaged in sexual assault, sexual slavery, and gang rape.

Sexual violence in conflict is an affront to our common humanity. When
it occurs, perpetrators must be held accountable, and survivors must
have access to services and support. The Biden-Harris Administration
will continue to prioritize efforts to combat and address gender-based
violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, and do all we can
to elevate the critical participation of women and girls in efforts to
advance justice, peace and stability.
