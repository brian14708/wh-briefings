title: "Readout of Latest White\_House Meeting with RSV Immunization Manufacturers"
---
 
On Wednesday, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials met again
with manufacturers of RSV immunizations including Sanofi and AstraZeneca
and their partners. They discussed the need for manufacturers to work
quickly to meet demand for dose availability through the commercial
market this viral season. At the urging of the Administration,
manufacturers confirmed that they will make available 230,000 additional
doses of RSV immunizations for infants in January. This announcement
comes on top of the [77,000 additional
doses](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p1116-rsv-doses.html) of
Beyfortus that were released last month following the Administration’s
continued efforts’ urging manufacturers to expedite availability.  
   
The meeting follows several in-person and virtual meetings, [including
last
week](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/07/readout-of-white-house-follow-up-meeting-with-rsv-immunization-manufacturers/),
to ensure manufacturers are identifying every opportunity to make more
RSV immunizations for infants available. Also in the meeting, senior
Administration officials and manufacturers continued conversations on
the importance of proactively planning to increase availability and meet
projected demand for the 2024-25 viral season.
