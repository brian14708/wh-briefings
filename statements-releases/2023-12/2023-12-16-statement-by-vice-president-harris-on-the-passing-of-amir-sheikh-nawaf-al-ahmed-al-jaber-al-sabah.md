Doug and I send our condolences on the passing of His Highness Amir
Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait. As the people of
Kuwait mourn this loss, our thoughts are with them. Throughout his life,
Sheikh Nawaf helped strengthen the friendship and strategic partnership
between the United States and Kuwait. Thanks to the leadership of Sheikh
Nawaf, our two nations continue to promoteÂ security, stability, and
prosperity in the region. As we honor his life and legacy, we know the
longstanding bonds between our governments and our people will endure.
