*$8.2 Billion from the President’s Investing in America Agenda to
Deliver Transformative Passenger Rail in America*

President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda – a key pillar of
Bidenomics – is delivering world class-infrastructure across the
country, expanding access to economic opportunity, and creating
good-paying jobs. By delivering $66 billion from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law – the largest investment in passenger rail since the
creation of Amtrak 50 years ago – President Biden is delivering on his
vision to rebuild America and win the global competition for the
21<sup>st</sup> century.     
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing **$8.2 billion** in
new funding for 10 major passenger rail projects across the country,
including **the first world-class high-speed rail projects in our
country’s history.** Key selected projects include: building a new
high-speed rail system between **California and Nevada,** which will
serve more than 11 million passengers annually; creating a high-speed
rail line through **California’s Central Valley** to ultimately link Los
Angeles and San Francisco, supporting travel with speeds up to 220 mph;
delivering significant upgrades to frequently-traveled rail corridors in
**Virginia, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia;** and
upgrading and expanding capacity at **Chicago Union Station in
Illinois**, one of the nation’s busiest rail hubs. These historic
projects will create tens of thousands of good-paying, union jobs,
unlock economic opportunity for communities across the country, and open
up safe, comfortable, and climate-friendly travel options to get people
to their destinations in a fraction of the time it takes to drive.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration is building out a pipeline of passenger
rail projects in every region of the country in order to achieve the
President’s vision of world-class passenger rail. Announced projects
will add new passenger rail service to cities that have historically
lacked access to America’s rail network, connecting residents to jobs,
healthcare, and educational opportunities. Investments will repair aging
rail infrastructure to increase train speeds, reduce delays, benefit
freight rail supply chains to boost America’s economy, significantly
reduce greenhouse emissions, and create good-paying union jobs.
Additionally, electric high-speed rail trains will take millions of cars
off the roads and reduce emissions, further cementing intercity rail as
an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying or driving and saving
time for millions of Americans. These investments will also create tens
of thousands of good-paying union jobs in construction and related
industries – adding to over 100,000 jobs that the President is creating
through historic investments in world-class rail.    
  
Today’s investment includes [$8.2 billion through the Federal Railroad
Administration’s Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail
Program](https://railroads.dot.gov/elibrary/fy22-23-FSP-National-rail-program-project-fact-sheets),
as well as [$34.5 million through the Corridor Identification and
Development
program](https://railroads.dot.gov/elibrary/fy22-CID-program-selections)
to guide passenger rail development on 69 rail corridors across 44
states, ensuring that intercity rail projects are ready for
implementation. President Biden will travel to Las Vegas, Nevada to make
this announcement.  
  
To date, President Biden has announced **$30 billion** for rail projects
across the country – including $16.4 billion on the Northeast Corridor,
$1.4 billion for passenger rail and freight rail safety projects, and
$570 million to upgrade or mitigate railroad crossings.  
  
**Fed-State National Project selections include:**

-   The **Brightline West High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail System
    Project** will receive up to $3 billion for a new 218-mile intercity
    passenger rail system between Las Vegas, Nevada, and Rancho
    Cucamonga, California. The project will create a new high-speed rail
    system, resulting in trip times of just over 2 hours – nearly twice
    as fast as driving. This route is expected to serve more than 11
    million passengers annually, taking millions of cars off the road
    and, thanks to all-electric train sets, removing an estimated
    400,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. This project will create
    35,000 jobs supporting construction and support 1,000 permanent jobs
    in operations and maintenance once in service. Brightline’s
    agreement with the California State and Southern Nevada Building
    Trades will ensure that this project is built with good-paying union
    labor, and the project has reached a separate agreement with Rail
    Labor to employ union workers for its ongoing operations and
    maintenance. The project will also allow for connections to the Los
    Angeles Metro area via the Metrolink commuter rail system.  
-   The **California Inaugural High-Speed Rail Service Project** will
    receive up to $3.07 billion to help deliver high-speed rail service
    in California’s Central Valley by designing and extending the rail
    line between Bakersfield and Merced, procuring new high-speed
    trainsets, and constructing the Fresno station, which will connect
    communities to urban centers in Northern and Southern California.
     This 171-mile rail corridor will support high-speed travel with
    speeds up to 220mph. The project will improve connectivity and
    increase travel options, along with providing more frequent
    passenger rail service, from the Central Valley to urban centers in
    northern and Southern California. New all-electric trainsets will
    produce zero emissions and be powered by 100% renewable energy. By
    separating passenger and freight lines, this project will benefit
    freight rail operations throughout California as well. This project
    has already created over 11,000 good-paying union construction jobs
    and has committed to using union labor for operations and
    maintenance.  
-   The **Raleigh to Richmond (R2R) Innovating Rail Program Phases IA
    and II** project will receive up to $1.1 billion to build
    approximately additional parts of the Southeast Corridor from
    Raleigh to Wake Forest, North Carolina, including new and upgraded
    track, eleven grade separations and closure of multiple at-grade
    crossings. The investment will improve system and service
    performance by developing a resilient and reliable passenger rail
    route that will also contribute to freight and supply chain
    resiliency in the southeastern U.S. The proposed project is part of
    a multi-phased effort to develop a new passenger rail route between
    Raleigh, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia, and better connect
    the southern states to DC and the Northeast Corridor. Once
    completed, this new route will save passengers an estimated 90
    minutes per trip.  
-   The **Long Bridge** project, part of the Transforming Rail in
    Virginia – Phase II program, will receive $729 million to construct
    a new two-track rail bridge over the Potomac River to expand
    passenger rail capacity between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, VA.
    Nearly 6 million passengers travel over the existing bridge every
    year on Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express lines. This upgrade will
    reduce congestion and delays on this heavily-traveled corridor to
    our nation’s capital.

Other significant projects receiving grants under this announcement
include: upgrades to **Chicago Union Station**; upgrades to the
**Pennsylvania Keystone Corridor**, extending the service west of
Philadelphia-Harrisburg to Pittsburgh and adding frequencies; improving
the Downeaster corridor in **Maine,** connecting
Boston, **Massachusetts**, to Brunswick, Maine; rail infrastructure
improvements in **Montana** along a route carrying Amtrak’s Empire
Builder long-distance rail service between Chicago and the Pacific
Northwest; and replacing a key rail bridge in **Alaska** used by freight
and intercity passenger trains.   
  
***Pipeline for Future Investments Through the Federal Railroad
Administration’s Corridor ID Program***  
  
As part of President Biden’s vision for world-class passenger rail, the
Administration is planning for future rail growth in new and
unprecedented ways through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-created
Corridor ID Program. The program establishes a new planning framework
for future investments, and corridor selections announced today stand to
upgrade 15 existing rail routes, establish 47 extensions to existing and
new conventional corridor routes, and advance 7 new high-speed rail
projects, creating a pipeline of intercity passenger rail projects ready
for future investment.    
  
Project selections include:

-   **Scranton to New York,** reviving a dormant rail corridor between
    Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, to provide up to three daily
    trips for commuters and other passengers;  
-   **Colorado Front Range,** a new rail corridor connecting Fort
    Collins, CO, and Pueblo, CO, to serve an area that currently has no
    passenger rail options;  
-   The **Northern Lights Express**, connecting Minneapolis, MN and
    Duluth, MN, with several stops in Wisconsin, for greater regional
    connectivity;  
-   **Cascadia High-Speed Rail,** a proposed new high-speed rail
    corridor linking Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver, with entirely
    new service;  
-   **Charlotte to Atlanta,** a new high-speed rail corridor linking the
    Southeast and providing connection to Hartsfield-Jackson Airport,
    the busiest airport in the world;

Major regional hubs will benefit from multiple corridor selections, such
as **the Chicago Hub**, where a comprehensive plan for the Chicago
terminal and service chokepoints south of Lake Michigan will benefit all
corridors and long-distance trains south and east of Chicago.   
  
***Other Rail Investments Made Through President Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law***  
  
After waiting years for new federal funding, 2023 is the year in which
major rail and transit projects across the country are moving forward.
Today’s announcement builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s
historic commitment to our nation’s rail network. Major rail progress
that has already been made under President Biden includes the following:

-   Last month, [FRA announced **$16.4 billion** for 25 passenger rail
    projects along the Northeast Corridor
    (NEC)](https://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/communications/newsroom/president-biden-advances-vision-world-class-passenger-rail-16),
    the nation’s busiest rail corridor, running between Boston,
    Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. The Northeast Corridor supports
    800,000 trips per day in a region that represents 20% of U.S. Gross
    Domestic Product. The trains carry five times more passengers than
    all flights between Washington and New York. Funded through the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Federal-State Partnership for
    Intercity Passenger Rail Program, projects will rebuild tunnels and
    bridges that are over 100 years old; upgrade tracks, power systems,
    signals, stations, and other infrastructure; and advance future
    projects to significantly improve travel times by increasing
    operating speeds and reducing delays. These investments will also
    contribute to more than 100,000 good-paying union jobs in
    construction. You can read more about the 25 Fed-State NEC project
    selections and their benefits
    [here](https://railroads.dot.gov/elibrary/fy22-23-FSP-NEC-fact-sheets).

In addition to unprecedented passenger rail investment, the Biden-Harris
Administration is making major investments in rail safety through track
improvements, bridge rehabilitations, fewer grade crossings, upgrades on
routes carrying hazardous materials, and enhanced multi-modal
connections to increase safety for people who live near or travel along
America’s rail lines:

-   In September, [FRA announced more than **$1.4 billion** from
    President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 70 projects in
    35 states and Washington,
    D.C.](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-14-billion-infrastructure-funding-70-projects)
    This is the largest amount ever awarded for rail safety and rail
    supply chain upgrades through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure
    and Safety Improvements — or CRISI — program. CRISI projects will
    improve nearly 1,900 miles of track, upgrade or replace aging
    bridges, invest in locomotives with fewer emissions, and fund
    sustainable and resilient infrastructure that protects against
    threats of extreme weather. Overall, nearly two-thirds of CRISI
    funding announced this year is going to rural communities. While the
    majority of selected projects support freight rail safety and supply
    chains, CRISI investments are also laying the groundwork to expand
    world-class passenger rail to more communities nationwide in places
    like Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi as well as Virginia,
    Massachusetts, and California. Additionally, the CRISI program
    provides funding to develop the U.S. rail workforce and industry.
    Funding for this popular program has quadrupled since President
    Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
-   In June 2023, [FRA announced **$570 million** for 63 projects in 32
    states under the new Railroad Crossing Elimination
    Program](https://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/communications/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-funding-63-0),
    created by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This
    inaugural round of funding will address more than 400 at-grade
    crossings nationwide, improve safety, and make it easier to get
    around railroad tracks by adding grade separations, closing at-grade
    crossings, and improving existing at-grade crossings where train
    tracks and roads intersect. Over each of the next four years,
    additional program funding will be made available annually.  
-   In November 2022, FRA granted [**$4.3
    billion**](https://railroads.dot.gov/about-fra/communications/newsroom/press-releases/usdot-biden-administration-deliver-43-billion-0)
    to Amtrak, which represents the first year of the $22 billion in
    direct funding to Amtrak provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law. Amtrak is using these funds to modernize the intercity
    passenger rail network, modernize and increase accessibility at more
    than 280 Amtrak-served stations across the country, and replace
    Amtrak’s existing fleet with over 1,000 accessible, comfortable,
    state-of-the-art railcars and locomotives. In fiscal year 2023
    alone, Amtrak has invested nearly $3 billion in 750 projects across
    the country, including bringing 15 Amtrak stations to full ADA
    compliance. Through these investments, Amtrak has created nearly
    5,000 jobs, including employing over 4,000 union workers.  
-   In August 2022, the FRA announced [** $233 million in
    grants**](https://railroads.dot.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-administration-usdot-announce-over-233-million-grants-upgrade-0)
    to upgrade intercity passenger rail service across the country
    through the Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair
    Program. These investments will help replace bridges and tunnels
    along the Northeast Corridor, many of which are over 100 years old.
    Grants were also awarded to improve rail infrastructure in
    California, Michigan, and Chicago Union Station.
