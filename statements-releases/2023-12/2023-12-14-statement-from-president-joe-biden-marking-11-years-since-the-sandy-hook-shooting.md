title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden Marking 11 Years Since the Sandy Hook\_\
  Shooting"
---
 
Eleven years ago today the soul of Newtown, the soul of Connecticut, and
the soul of the nation were pierced forever when twenty-six souls were
stolen at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Within minutes, a shooter armed
with a weapon of war took the lives of twenty first grade students who
had their whole lives ahead of them and six educators who bravely
sacrificed their own safety to protect their students. Today, those
first grade students should be seniors in high school, dreaming big and
about to embark on their adult lives.    
   
We should not have to live like this. It is a national tragedy that over
a decade later our nation’s gun violence epidemic is still not solved.
My Administration is implementing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
to the fullest extent under the law, we have taken dozens of executive
actions, and this fall I established the first-ever White House Office
of Gun Violence Prevention to take every action available to save lives.
But it’s not enough. We will not be able to protect Americans from the
threat of gun violence until Congress does its part and takes
commonsense and proven measures like passing universal background
checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and more.  
   
Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to the courageous survivors,
families, first responders, and Connecticut officials who turned their
deep grief into action. Their years of advocacy made the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act possible. We must continue to follow their lead
and honor the innocent lives who were stolen that horrible day by
turning our pain into purpose, our loss into determination, and our
collective and justifiable anger into a deep-seated commitment for
change.  
   
Today, Jill and I are praying for the families and survivors in the
Newtown community, and every single community that has been ripped apart
by this senseless violence. May God bless them.
