title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on FDA Approval of Gene Therapies to Treat\
  \ Sickle Cell\_Disease"

As we’ve seen throughout our history, when the U.S. government invests
in innovation, we can achieve breakthroughs that would otherwise be
impossible, and save and improve lives on a vast scale. Today, FDA
announced a major breakthrough for the 100,000 Americans who live with
sickle cell disease. Living with sickle cell often has meant putting the
goals and plans of everyday life on hold because of the chronic pain and
serious health complications associated with it. And although this
disease impacts people of all backgrounds, it disproportionally affects
Black and Hispanic Americans. My Administration has worked tirelessly to
close these health disparities and help deliver care for sickle cell
disease patients and their families, and we will continue to do so.  
   
This announcement also represents the power of medical innovation to
improve Americans’ lives. This significant medical advancement holds
tremendous promise for developing additional life-saving treatments and
it gives hope to the millions of Americans who live with other rare
diseases. My Administration will continue our efforts to accelerate the
development of cures for rare diseases and support the medical research
and innovation that achieved this breakthrough.
