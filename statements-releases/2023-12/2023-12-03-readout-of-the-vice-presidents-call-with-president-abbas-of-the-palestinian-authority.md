Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with President Mahmoud Abbas of
the Palestinian Authority on her flight to Washington, D.C., from Dubai,
United Arab Emirates, where the Vice President had several conversations
with Arab leaders on the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The Vice
President reiterated U.S. support for the Palestinian people and their
right to security, dignity and self-determination. She underscored our
commitment to a two-state solution and said that the Palestinian people
must have a clear political horizon. They spoke about the situation in
the West Bank and the Vice President reiterated our concerns with steps
that could escalate tensions, including extremist settler violence.

Building on her meetings in Dubai, the Vice President discussed U.S.
ideas for planning for the day after the fighting ends in Gaza, and the
Vice President reiterated U.S. support for a unified West Bank and Gaza
under a revitalized Palestinian Authority. The Vice President told
President Abbas that, to follow-up on this conversation and her meetings
in Dubai on day-after planning, her National Security Advisor, Dr. Phil
Gordon, would travel to Israel and the West Bank this week for
additional discussions.
