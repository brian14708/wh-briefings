---
 
America was founded on the principle of equal justice under law. Elected
officials on both sides of the aisle, faith leaders, civil rights
advocates, and law enforcement leaders agree that our criminal justice
system can and should reflect this core value that makes our communities
safer and stronger. That is why today I am announcing additional steps I
am taking to make the promise of equal justice a reality.  
   
First, I am commuting the sentences of 11 people who are serving
disproportionately long sentences for non-violent drug offenses. All of
them would have been eligible to receive significantly lower sentences
if they were charged with the same offense today.  
   
Second, following my pardon of prior federal and D.C. offenses of simple
possession of marijuana, I am issuing a Proclamation that will pardon
additional offenses of simple possession and use of marijuana under
federal and D.C. law. Criminal records for marijuana use and possession
have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational
opportunities. Too many lives have been upended because of our failed
approach to marijuana.  It’s time that we right these wrongs.    
   
Just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the use or
possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state
prison for that reason, either. That’s why I continue to urge Governors
to do the same with regard to state offenses and applaud those who have
since taken action.  
   
I have exercised my clemency power more than any recent predecessor has
at this point in their presidency. And while today’s announcement marks
important progress, my Administration will continue to review clemency
petitions and deliver reforms that advance equal justice, address racial
disparities, strengthen public safety, and enhance the wellbeing of all
Americans.
