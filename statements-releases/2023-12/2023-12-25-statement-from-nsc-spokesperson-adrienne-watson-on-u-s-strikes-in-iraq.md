title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on U.S. Strikes in\_Iraq"
---
 
Early this morning in northern Iraq, U.S. military personnel
were targeted by a one-way attack drone. The attack wounded three U.S.
service-members, one critically. The Iranian-backed militia Kataib
Hezbollah and affiliated groups, under an umbrella of Iranian-backed
militants, claimed credit for the attack.   
   
President Biden was immediately briefed on the attack this morning, and
he ordered the Department of Defense to prepare response options against
those responsible. Those options were then presented to the President
during a call this afternoon with Secretary of Defense Austin and
members of the President’s national security team. During that call, the
President directed strikes against three locations utilized by Kataib
Hezbollah and affiliated groups focused specifically on unmanned aerial
drone activities.  
   
The President places no higher priority than the protection of American
personnel serving in harm’s way. The United States will act at a time
and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue.
