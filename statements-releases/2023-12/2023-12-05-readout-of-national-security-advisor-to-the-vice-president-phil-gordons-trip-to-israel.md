Following the Vice President’s meetings with Arab leaders in Dubai on
December 2, she directed her National Security Advisor, Dr. Phil Gordon,
to travel to Israel December 4-5 to update Israeli officials on her
meetings and continue our intensive consultations with Israel on the
conflict with Hamas. Dr. Gordon will visit Ramallah, the West Bank on
December 6 for meetings with senior Palestinian Authority officials. In
Israel, Dr. Gordon met with President Isaac Herzog, War Cabinet Member
Benny Gantz, National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, Minister for
Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, observer in the War Cabinet Gadi Eisenkot,
and opposition leader Yair Lapid.    
  
Throughout his meetings, Dr. Gordon reiterated the Biden-Harris
Administration’s resolute support for Israel’s right to defend itself in
the face of the Hamas terrorist threat. He discussed Israeli military
objectives and operations in Gaza and underscored the importance of
adherence to international humanitarian law and the imperative of
increased efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and protect
civilians. Dr. Gordon emphasized that Hamas is a barbaric terrorist
organization and that no nation could accept the threat Hamas poses, and
that we support Israel’s legitimate military objectives. Dr. Gordon
underscored that the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to pursue
every effort to secure the release of all hostages held by Hamas
terrorists, including Americans. Dr. Gordon discussed the situation in
the West Bank and expressed our concern with steps that could escalate
tensions, including extremist settler violence.  
  
On day-after planning, Dr. Gordon outlined the principles that the Vice
President and the Biden-Harris Administration have publicly laid out and
discussed efforts on reconstruction, security, and governance in Gaza
after the phase of intensive fighting ends. Dr. Gordon made clear that
the Palestinian people must have a meaningful political horizon and
reiterated our commitment to a two-state solution. Dr. Gordon also
discussed broader dynamics in the region and U.S. efforts to deter
aggression and help prevent regional escalation.
