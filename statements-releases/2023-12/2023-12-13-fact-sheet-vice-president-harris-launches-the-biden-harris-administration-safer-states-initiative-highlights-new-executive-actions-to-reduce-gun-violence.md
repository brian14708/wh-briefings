title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Launches the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration\
  \ Safer States Initiative, Highlights New Executive Actions to Reduce Gun\_Violence"
---
 
In September 2023, President Biden established the first-ever White
House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President
Kamala Harris. President Biden tasked the office with four key
responsibilities, including enhancing the federal government’s
partnerships with cities and states to help them advance their own
efforts to reduce gun violence.

Today, Vice President Harris is launching [the Biden-Harris
Administration’s Safer States
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OGVP-Safer-States-Policy-Agenda.pdf) to
provide states with additional tools and the support they need to reduce
gun violence and save lives. To kick off the initiative, the White House
is releasing the Biden-Harris Safer States Agenda, outlining key actions
states should take, including:

-   Establishing a State Office of Gun Violence Prevention;
-   Investing in evidence-informed solutions to prevent and respond to
    gun violence, including community violence interventions, Crime Gun
    Intelligence Centers, and implementation of Extreme Risk Protection
    Orders;
-   Strengthening support for survivors and victims of gun violence;
-   Reinforcing responsible gun ownership, including by requiring safe
    storage of firearms and reporting of lost and stolen firearms;
-   Strengthening gun background checks, including by enacting universal
    background checks legislation and removing barriers to completing
    enhanced background checks; and
-   Holding the gun industry accountable, including by banning assault
    weapons and high-capacity magazines and enacting firearm-specific
    liability laws to ensure that victims of gun violence have their day
    in court.

To help states advance this agenda, the Justice Department is announcing
two new executive actions to reduce gun violence.  

-   **Safe Storage Model Legislation.** Safe storage saves lives. It is
    one tool in the toolkit to reduce school shootings, because we know
    that most often those students who carry out K-12 school shootings
    are using firearms they obtain from the home of a friend or family
    member. It is also a critical strategy to reduce suicide by
    firearms, accidental shootings, and the theft of firearms. The
    Department of Justice’s model legislation details how states can
    require the safe storage of firearms, including in vehicles, and
    hold individuals liable for harm caused by unsecured firearms.

<!-- -->

-   **Lost and Stolen Firearms Reporting Model Legislation.** Reporting
    of lost and stolen firearms allows law enforcement to investigate
    and prosecute firearms trafficking. The Department of Justice’s
    model legislation provides states with a framework for requiring
    that a person promptly report the loss or theft to law enforcement. 
     

In the months ahead, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention
will continue to proactively work with states to make sure they have
additional resources and support needed to advance these agenda items.
