title: "Statement by Vice President Kamala\_Harris on the Launch of the National Law\
  \ Enforcement Accountability\_Database"

Every person in our nation has a right to be safe. And trust between law
enforcement and the communities they serve is essential for public
safety. Police misconduct undermines that trust—and threatens the right
to equal justice under law.       
  
Today, President Joe Biden and I are establishing the first ever federal
database to track official records of law enforcement officer
misconduct. The National Law Enforcement Accountability Database will
ensure that federal agencies have ready access to records of serious
misconduct when hiring federal law enforcement officers.  
  
As a United States Senator, with Senator Cory Booker and Representative
Karen Bass, I authored the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And
last year, President Biden and I issued an Executive Order banning
chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and strengthening
use-of-force policies for federal law enforcement, in addition to other
critical reforms.  
  
President Biden and I will continue to do all we can to advance police
accountability and strengthen the bonds of trust between law enforcement
and the communities they serve. And we renew our call for the United
States Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
