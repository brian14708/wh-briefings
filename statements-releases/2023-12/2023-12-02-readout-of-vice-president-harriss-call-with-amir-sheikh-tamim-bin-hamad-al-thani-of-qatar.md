Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin
Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar. The Vice President thanked the Amir for his
efforts in securing a deal between Israel and Hamas that provided an
extended pause in the fighting which resulted in the release of more
than 100 hostages, including Americans, while substantially increasing
the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, before the pause was
violated by Hamas. The Vice President emphasized that the United States
would remain committed to relentlessly pursuing the release of all the
hostages in close cooperation with Qatar and other regional partners and
expressed continued support for extended pauses in the fighting to get
hostages out and aid in.  They discussed the importance of planning for
the day after the fighting ends in Gaza.
