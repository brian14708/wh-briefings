Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of His Highness Amir
Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait.  Sheikh
Nawaf was a valued partner and true friend of the United States
throughout his decades of service. I offer my condolences to Sheikh
Nawaf’s family and the people of Kuwait on behalf of the United States
of America and the American people. Today, we mourn his passing and we
honor his life and the vision we shared for greater peace and stability
across the Middle East. We will continue to strengthen the longstanding
ties between the governments and people of the United States and Kuwait
as we pursue that future together.
