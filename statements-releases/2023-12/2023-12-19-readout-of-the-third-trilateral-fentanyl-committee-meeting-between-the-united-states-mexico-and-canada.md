title: "Readout of the Third Trilateral Fentanyl Committee Meeting between the United\_\
  States, Mexico, and\_Canada"
---
 
Today, Homeland Security Advisor to the President of the United States
Liz Sherwood-Randall hosted her Mexican and Canadian counterparts for a
virtual meeting of the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee (TFC).  President
Joe Biden, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau established this trilateral Committee with their
high-level representatives during the North American Leaders’ Summit on
January 9-10, 2023 to guide priority actions to address the illicit
fentanyl threat facing North America.  The TFC builds on the existing
work of the North American Drug Dialogue, the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial
Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities, and the
U.S.-Canada Opioid Action Plan. During this third meeting of the
Committee, the co-chairs discussed progress made by the expert working
group on identifying opportunities to enhance regulatory and statutory
frameworks associated with precursor chemicals and related equipment
used for the production of illicit fentanyl. They also shared
information about illicit drug trends and recent diplomatic engagements
focused on reducing the flow of illicit synthetic drugs and their
precursor chemicals.  To drive further progress in the fight to counter
fentanyl’s scourge, they agreed to meet again in person in Mexico in
early 2024.
