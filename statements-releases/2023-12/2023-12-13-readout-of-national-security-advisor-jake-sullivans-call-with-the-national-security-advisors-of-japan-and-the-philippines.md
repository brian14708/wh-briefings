National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor Akiba
Takeo of Japan, and National Security Advisor Eduardo Año of the
Philippines held a trilateral phone call on December 13, 2023, to
reaffirm their commitment to freedom of navigation and international law
in the South China Sea and East China Sea and the fundamental importance
of maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.   
   
They expressed concerns about the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC)
recent dangerous and unlawful conduct near Second Thomas Shoal and
Scarborough Reef, and called on the PRC to abide by the legally binding
July 2016 Arbitral Tribunal ruling and desist from further provocative
behavior. NSA Sullivan reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad alliance
commitments to both Japan and the Philippines.  
   
The three NSAs underscored the importance of enhancing trilateral
cooperation and committed to continue implementing the initiatives they
discussed at their June meeting, including trilateral efforts to:
enhance defense and security capabilities, particularly on cyber
security; maintain a free and open maritime order; enhance cooperation
on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; and maintain a free and
equitable economic order.  
   
The three NSAs reaffirmed their decision to conduct close trilateral
coordination over the coming months to advance their shared interests in
a free and open Indo-Pacific.
