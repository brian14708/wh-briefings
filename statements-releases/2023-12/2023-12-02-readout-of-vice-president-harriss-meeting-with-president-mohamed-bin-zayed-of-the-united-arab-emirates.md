Vice President Kamala Harris met today with President Mohammed bin Zayed
of the United Arab Emirates in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates on the
sidelines of the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (COP28). The Vice President congratulated
Sheikh Mohammed on the success of COP28 and welcomed the creation of the
UAE’s $30 billion ALTERRA Fund.   
   
The leaders discussed the latest developments in the conflict between
Israel and Hamas.  The Vice President emphasized the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to secure the release of all hostages who
are being held in Gaza, and to ensure there is a sustained flow of
humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The Vice President emphasized the
importance of the recent deal that led to an extended pause in the
fighting, noting that it, before it was violated by Hamas, successfully
got more than 100 hostages out while substantially increasing vital
humanitarian assistance.   
   
The Vice President discussed U.S. ideas for post-conflict planning in
Gaza including efforts on reconstruction, security, and governance, and
accelerated U.S.-UAE coordination on day-after planning.  She emphasized
that these efforts can only succeed if they are pursued in the context
of a clear political horizon for the Palestinian people towards a state
of their own led by a revitalized Palestinian Authority and have
significant support from the international community and the countries
of the region. The Vice President made clear that Hamas cannot control
Gaza, which is untenable for Israel’s security, the well-being of the
Palestinian people, and regional security.    
   
The leaders also discussed the importance of deterring any state or
non-state actors from seeking to expand the conflict. The Vice President
also raised other regional issues, including her concerns about the
deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Sudan.  The Vice
President reaffirmed the enduring U.S. commitment to UAE’s security and
the importance of the robust and growing economic relationship.
