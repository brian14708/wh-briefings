---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris will convene the third meeting of
the National Space Council during the Biden-Harris Administration in
Washington, D.C., where she is announcing that, alongside American
astronauts, the United States will land an international astronaut on
the surface of the Moon by the end of the decade.  
  
The meeting will highlight the United States’ extraordinary progress in
broadening and deepening international space partnerships across a range
of areas, including supporting American leadership and strength,
providing societal benefits here on Earth, and helping the United States
lead a return of humans to the Moon with an unprecedented network of
allies and partners.  
  
***International Partnerships as a Source of American Leadership and
Strength***  
  
Our allies and partners remain a source of enduring U.S. strength and
competitive advantage, including in outer space.   
  
President Biden approved classified Space Security Guidance in June
2023, which directs the United States to increase integration with
allies and partners on space activities, operations, plans,
capabilities, and information sharing for mutual benefit in response to
growing space and counterspace threats and to protect U.S. forces from
hostile uses of space.  
  
More broadly, under the Vice President’s leadership of the National
Space Council, the United States is leading efforts in the responsible,
peaceful, and sustainable use of space, to include promoting
international rules and norms of responsible behavior.  A key element of
that effort is the U.S. [commitment not to conduct destructive
direct-ascent anti-satellite missile
testing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/04/18/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-ongoing-work-to-establish-norms-in-space/). 
As of today, 36 other countries have made their own national
commitments.   
  
During today’s meeting, the Biden-Harris Administration will make clear
the United States is leading the world in the peaceful exploration and
use of outer space.  
  
The Vice President is announcing the following initiatives:
