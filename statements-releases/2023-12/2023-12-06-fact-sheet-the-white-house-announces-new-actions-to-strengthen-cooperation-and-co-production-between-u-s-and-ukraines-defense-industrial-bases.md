  \ and Co-Production between U.S. and Ukraine\u2019s Defense Industrial\_Bases"
---
 
Today, on Ukrainian Armed Forces Day, the United States government
hosted the first day of the U.S.-Ukraine Defense Industrial Base
Conference at the Department of Commerce in Washington, D.C. The
conference convened around 350 U.S., Ukrainian, and European industry
and government representatives to focus on significantly increasing
weapons production to support Ukraine’s fight for freedom against
Russian aggression, and strengthen Ukraine’s long term self-defense.  
  
The U.S. and Ukrainian governments together seek to advance a robust and
self-reliant Ukrainian defense industrial base that captures Ukraine’s
innovative culture, provides materiel for urgent military needs, and
contributes to Ukraine’s long-term security and economic success.
Initial conference deliverables focused on first steps:
institutionalizing relationships, processes, and dialogue between
industry and government partners.

-   MSI Embedded Advisor: Working with Congress, the Department of State
    plans to send an advisor to the Ministry of Strategic Industries of
    Ukraine to support and accelerate Ukraine’s transition to an
    interoperable military force, combat corruption, and attract foreign
    investment in critical industries.  
     
-   Interagency “Ukraine Deal Team”: The U.S. has established an
    interagency team, consisting of representatives from the Departments
    of State, Defense, and Commerce, that will support industry,
    Ukrainian, and other partners who seek guidance on potential deals,
    and export requirements for Ukraine’s defense industry.  The
    interagency team will respond to case-specific questions
    via:<UkraineDealTeam@state.gov>  
     
-   Co-production and Technical Data Exchange: The Department of
    Defense, Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, and Ministry for Strategic
    Industries of Ukraine signed a Statement of Intent on Co-production
    and Technical Data Exchange, which will work to address the urgent
    operational needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including in the
    areas of air defense systems, repair and sustainment, and production
    of critical munitions. The Statement of Intent increases cooperation
    between the United States and Ukraine and will facilitate the
    quicker movement of investment deals more quickly through systems.  
     
-   Technical Data Package. The Department of Defense and industry
    partners provided Ukraine with technical data to start local
    production of some of the FrankenSAM projects that seek to enable
    Ukraine’s legacy air defense systems by integrating certain Western
    munitions. Parallel production of these systems in Ukraine and the
    United States will allow for faster fielding and enable Ukraine to
    contribute significantly to the sustainment of its air defense
    systems.

These initial deliverables will not only expand U.S.-Ukraine cooperation
and provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs to be successful on
the battlefield in the short-term, but will support Ukraine’s long-term
economic recovery and defense.
