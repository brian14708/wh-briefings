title: "Background Press Call on OSHA and CMS Rules for Vaccination in the\_Workplace"
---
 
(November 3, 2021)

6:12 P.M. EDT  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Good evening.  Thank you, everybody, for
joining.  Thanks for joining us tonight for an embargoed press call on
the forthcoming OSHA and CMS vaccination policies.   
   
As a reminder, this call is embargoed until tomorrow, November 4th at
8:45 a.m., and the entire call will be attributable to “senior
administration officials.”  
   
On this call you will hear remarks from \[senior administration
officials\].  
   
At the end, we’ll have time for some questions.  I kindly ask you in
advance to keep those questions to one question.   
   
And with that, I’ll pass it to \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\], and thank you all for joining us tonight.  
   
Before we get into tonight’s announcements, let me start with why we’re
here.  
   
Today, 70 percent of adult Americans are now fully vaccinated — up from
less than 1 percent when the President took office.  This is tremendous
progress, but we know that we need more vaccinations to save lives,
strengthen the economy, and accelerate our path out of this pandemic.  
   
That’s why the President has been leading on requiring vaccinations,
including for federal employees and federal contractors, and has called
on employers to do the same.  Thousands of employers have answered the
President’s call and stepped up to implement vaccination requirements
covering tens of millions of Americans.  
   
These requirements have already reduced the number of eligible
unvaccinated Americans by 40 percent — down from about 100 million to
just over 60 million now.  
   
Tomorrow morning, the administration is announcing a series of new
policies that will protect workers and drive additional progress in
getting millions of Americans vaccinated.  
   
First, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, is
issuing a rule to require employers with 100 or more employees to ensure
each of their workers is fully vaccinated or tests negative for COVID at
least once a week.  This rule covers 84 million employees.  
   
Second, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, is issuing a
rule to require that healthcare workers at facilities participating in
Medicare and Medicaid are fully vaccinated.  This rule covers more than
17 million workers at approximately 76,000 healthcare facilities around
the country.  
   
And third, to make it easy for businesses and workers to comply, we will
be aligning the deadline for the previously announced requirement for
employees of federal contractors to be fully vaccinated with these new
OSHA and CMS rules.  This single, consistent deadline across all three
requirements is January 4th, 2022.  
   
So, any employee covered by the CMS or federal contractor requirement
must have their final vaccination dose by January 4th.  And employers
covered by the OSHA rule will need to ensure their employees have
received their final vaccination dose by January 4th, with at least
weekly testing required for unvaccinated employees after that.  
   
Before I turn to my colleagues to walk through the OSHA and CMS rules in
detail, I want to underscore the impact these policies will have on our
fight against the virus.  
   
Together, the OSHA and CMS rules, along with the other policies the
administration has previously implemented, means that over two thirds of
all workers in the United States are now covered by vaccination
policies.   
   
Many organizations that have adopted vaccination requirements have
increased vaccination rates by more than 20 percentage points to well
over 90 percent, and compliance is very high.  
   
Higher vaccination rates protect our workers, reduce hospitalizations
and deaths.  This is good for workers and, importantly, this is good for
the economy.  
   
For example, analysts at Goldman Sachs projected these kinds of
vaccination requirements could lead to up to 5 million Americans
reentering the workforce, as they feel safer going back to work and
experience fewer disruptions to things like childcare.  
   
The bottom line is: Vaccination requirements work.  And the actions
we’re taking tomorrow will lead to millions of Americans getting
vaccinated, protecting workers, saving lives, strengthening our economy,
and helping it to accelerate our path out of this pandemic.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you very much.  The Occupational
Safety and Health Administration is dedicated to ensuring every working
person in the country has a safe and healthy workplace.   
   
The unmitigated spread of the coronavirus in the workplace presents a
grave danger of illness or death to unvaccinated workers.  OSHA has
determined that in order to protect workers from this continued hazard,
we must issue an Emergency Temporary Standard to protect workers from
the spread of coronavirus in the workplace.  
   
The rule we are announcing covers employers with 100 or more employees,
firm or company wide, and provides options for compliance to protect
their workers.  
   
The standard requires employers to develop, implement, and enforce a
mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy, unless they adopt a policy
requiring employees to choose either to get vaccinated or to undergo
weekly COVID-19 testing and wear a face covering at work.  
   
In addition, the ETS requires employers to provide paid time to workers
to get vaccinated and paid leave to recover from any side effects that
keep employees from being able to work.  
   
While we are encouraged to know that vaccination requirements have
already helped cut the number of unvaccinated Americans by nearly 40
percent, it’s important to understand that there are still so many
workers who are not protected and remain at risk from being seriously
ill or dying from COVID-19.  
   
This rule will protect more than 84 million workers from the spread of
the coronavirus on the job.  OSHA estimates that this rule will save
thousands of lives and prevent over 250,000 hospitalizations during the
six months after implementation.   
   
OSHA will help employers develop a vaccine or testing requirement
program by offering robust compliance assistance to businesses
implementing the standard, including sample plans,
factsheets, frequently asked questions, and other materials.   
   
OSHA will begin outreach to the regulated community and will continue
working to provide businesses the information that they need to
comply.   
   
OSHA is committed to ensuring the health and safety of workers in this
country, and I want to thank each of you for taking part in this
important conversation about how we’re doing it.   
   
And now I’ll turn over the computer to \[senior administration
official\].   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you very much. 
Good evening, everyone.   
   
Now that you have had an overview of the standard, I’d like to talk
briefly about OSHA’s legal authority to issue this standard.    
   
The Occupational Safety and Health Act was adopted to ensure working
people in this country have safe and healthy working conditions.   
   
In particular, the OSH Act gives OSHA the authority to act quickly in an
emergency where the agency finds that workers are subjected to a grave
danger and a new standard is necessary to protect them.   
   
A virus that has killed more than 745,000 Americans, with more than
70,000 new cases per day currently, is clearly a health hazard that
poses a grave danger to workers.   
   
The new Emergency Temporary Standard is well within OSHA’s authority
under the law and consistent with OSHA’s requirements to protect
workers from health and safety hazards, including infectious
diseases.    
   
There is well-established legal precedent for OSHA’s authority
to evaluate existing scientific evidence and apply data to develop
safety and health standards.   
   
OSHA has broad authority to issue and enforce health and safety
standards to protect workers in staying safe and healthy on the job —
like precautions against bloodborne diseases, excessive noise, and falls
from dangerous heights — and now, getting vaccinated against a virus
that has taken more American lives than World War One, World War Two,
the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined.   
   
The OSH Act provides that OSHA standards preempt any state occupational
safety or health standard “relating to \[the same\] occupational safety
or health issue” as the federal standard OSHA.    
   
This ETS preempts the occupational safety and health issues
of vaccination, wearing face coverings, and testing for COVID-19. 
Thus the standard preempts states, and political subdivisions of states,
from adopting and enforcing workplace requirements relating to these
issues, except under the authority of a federally approved state
plan.   
   
Our mission to make sure workers come home at the end of their shift —
our mission is to make sure that workers come home safe at the end of
their shift, and OSHA will never hesitate to use its authority to keep
workers safe on the job.  
   
Thanks very much.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Excellent.  \[Senior administration
official\].   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  Good evening.  This is
\[senior administration official\].   
   
At CMS, we know that everyone working in healthcare wants to keep their
patients safe.  That is why CMS is acting to require healthcare workers
to get vaccinated now.  
   
Thursday morning, at 8:45 a.m. Eastern Time, CMS will publish an
emergency regulation requiring staff vaccinations for COVID-19 across
Medicare- and Medicaid-certified healthcare providers including, but not
limited to, nursing homes, hospitals, dialysis facilities, ambulatory
surgical settings, and home health agencies.  This requirement will
cover approximately 17 million healthcare workers across 76,000
healthcare facilities across the country.   
   
When the pandemic first began, CMS focused heavily on infection control
measures to address the spread of COVID-19.  Today we are focused on
getting staff vaccinated as quickly as possible.  Including in the
regulation and consistent with the other requirements are critical
deadlines for healthcare workers across the country to meet.  
   
By January 4, 2022, facilities must ensure that all staff have received
the necessary shots to be fully vaccinated — either two doses of Pfizer,
two doses of Moderna, or one dose of Johnson & Johnson.  
   
For Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers, these vaccination
regulations supersede all others, including state regulations and those
issued by OSHA.  
   
We will ensure compliance with these requirements through our
established survey and enforcement processes.  If a facility does not
meet the requirements, they will be cited by a surveyor and have an
opportunity to return to compliance before additional actions occur.  
   
CMS’s goal is to bring healthcare providers into compliance; it is not
to punish workers or healthcare facilities.  However, we will not
hesitate to use our full enforcement authority to protect the health and
safety of patients.    
   
As more and more businesses, organizations, and states across the
country implement vaccine requirements, it’s becoming clearer every day:
Vaccination requirements are effective.  
   
At Houston Methodist, the first organization to implement a vaccine
requirement, 98 percent of their 25,000-person staff got vaccinated. 
Trinity Health, one of the largest Catholic healthcare systems in the
nation, increased its vaccination rate of its 120,000 employees from 75
percent to 96 percent vaccinated and in compliance.  Rush University
Medical Center in Chicago recently hit 99 percent compliance in
vaccination.  
    
Today, more than 2,500 hospitals, or 40 percent of all U.S. hospitals,
have announced COVID vaccination requirements, or are in states that
have such requirements, for the healthcare workforce.  They span all 50
states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  
   
Leading healthcare organizations like the American Medical Association,
the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, and
the American Academy of Pediatricians, which together represent millions
of healthcare professionals, called for “mandatory COVID-19 vaccination
for healthcare workers to protect the safety of patients and residents
of long-term care facilities and make the healthcare sector a leader in
COVID-19 vaccinations.”  
   
 Where requirements have been implemented, we have not seen widespread
resignations in the healthcare workforce.  In fact, we know that the
requirements are an essential tool to protect patients and healthcare
personnel.  
   
We’re on the right track, but the fight is not over.  That’s why we’re
acting to get more Americans to get vaccinated.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it back over to \[senior administration
official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Kevin, over to you.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  As a reminder, keep your question to one
question so we can get as many in as possible.  
   
First, let’s go to Spencer Kimball at CNBC.  
   
Q    Hi, can you hear me?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yep, we can.  
   
Q    Okay, great.  Yeah, my question is about the OSHA mandate, and it’s
on enforcement and compliance.   
   
So, after January 4th, what should businesses expect in terms of
enforcement?  Will there be a robust inspection regime on site?  And
connected to that, how high will the penalties be for noncompliance?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Again, this is \[senior administration
official\].  And we at OSHA will be enforcing this rule, just like OSHA
enforces any of the other rules that are in place at the agency, where
we recognize that the vast majority of employers and workplaces comply
with the requirements of an OSHA standard.  
   
And so where we target our focus and our effort are on those workplaces
where workers need assistance to have a safe and healthful workplace. 
That typically comes through in the form of a complaint.  
   
We also will be having some programmed or planned inspections where we
do go to workplaces to check to make certain that the workplace is in
compliance with the rule.  
   
And again, we’ll be doing that just as we do with other rules that are
in place.  And the penalties that would be issued as a result of those
inspections, if we find some deficiencies in the program, are
commensurate with any other penalties that we have in place for other
standards.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Dee-Ann Durbin at the AP.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Can you clarify, when you were saying they’re commensurate
with other — I mean, let’s get a — can we get a number here?  Can we get
something more specific?  When  
you’re saying what’s commensurate, what are you talking about?  What
kind of fine can they expect?  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, so — and again, depending upon
the number of violations that would be identified would have some — you
know, a significant impact on the scope and scale of the amount of a
penalty, that would be cited and put into the citation.  
   
We also have a scale that is increasing with more severe violations. 
So, for example, if we identify that an employer is willfully violating
a standard, then that penalty is significantly higher than a workplace
that is not willfully doing so.  
   
And so —  
   
Q    Is there a maximum amount?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, so for a standard penalty of
$14,000, if there was a single citation, a single violation, a single
issue that was wrong, $14,000 would be the approximate penalty.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, let’s go to the next question.  Dave Shepardson
at Reuters.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks for doing this.  Just briefly, to follow up on
Dee-Ann’s question, is — the maximum would be $14,000 per employer per —
I’m sorry, $14,000 per employee per location.  Is that right?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sorry — again, this is \[senior
administration official\].  We were muted there for just a second.  
   
So $14,000 per item that would be cited.  So if there were multiple
items out of the standard that we cited, there would be, you know,
multiple penalties that could be issued along with that.  
   
We also would assess whether or not there were multiple violations
depending on the number of instances of the violation that we were
looking at.  So, you know, potentially there could be multiples of
that.  But it would depend upon the situation during the inspection and
the evidence that was presented.  
   
Q    Okay.  Just to — so my question was, broadly: Obviously, this is a
big — it will give some relief to federal contractors and others as it
pushes the deadline, you know, past the holiday season.  Can you talk a
bit about what your thoughts were; why you opted to make everything
effective on January 4, as opposed to holding to that December 8th
deadline?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Dave.  I can take that one. 
Look, I think, for us, we wanted to do this because we’re really
aligning it to make it easier — to make it as easy as possible for
businesses to implement these requirements and for workers to comply.   
   
That said, there’s no reason to wait, and we hope that — and we know
that many employers are not waiting.  And we hope that employers and
workers will get vaccinated as quickly as possible, because that’s
obviously our path out of this pandemic.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Great.  Next question.  Let’s go to Rachel Roubein at the
Washington Post.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks.  I have a question for \[senior administration
official\].  Can you also detail what the enforcement mechanism is for
health facilities?  Essentially, like, would they be kicked out of
participating in the Medicare and the Medicaid program, or is that
further down the line?  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  So this is \[senior
administration official\].  So there are a series of remedies that we
would take to make sure that facilities are in compliance with our
vaccine requirement.  So, first, we want to work with facilities.  And
tomorrow, we will be having a listening session and really walk through
all of the requirements and details to answer any questions.  So, we
really want to work with them.   
   
If a facility were not making steps to come into compliance, we have a
range of remedies.  That could be civil monetary penalties.  We could
also deny payment, and as a — certainly, as a last resort, terminate
them from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.   
   
But I would just want to emphasize that our goal is to bring healthcare
facilities into compliance.  And termination would really only occur if,
after providing a facility with an opportunity to make corrections and
come into compliance, they chose not to do so.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Next question.  Let’s go to Maureen Groppe at
USA Today.  
   
Q    Hi.  I want to ask about the 21 states that run their own workplace
safety programs.  How much time are they going to have to adopt either
this standard or one equally as strong?  And are you prepared to take
over their programs if they don’t meet that deadline?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  \[Senior administration
official\], can I turn to you?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, thanks, \[senior administration
official\].  And so, this is \[senior administration official\] again. 
And to also back up to the prior question — one clarification: The
questions talked about an OSHA mandate.  And just keep in mind that the
OSHA rule coming out is not a mandate for a vaccine; there’s a —
employers can put in a mandatory vaccination program, or there’s the
other route of vaccination for those who choose to, and testing and
masks for those other employees that don’t.  So, just wanted to make
sure that was clear.   
   
And also, you know, we use the $14,000 for a serious OSHA citation
violation amount.  The real, actual amount is $13,653, just to be clear
with that.  
   
And for — we referred to the willful penalties.  That amount is
$136,532.  So, you know, again, just to make certain we’re providing you
with the clear information.  
   
As far as the state OSHA programs in the 21 states that operate those
programs, we’ll have a 30-day window for them to implement this rule
once the Federal Register is published later this week.  And they will
need to put in place this rule or a rule that is at least as effective
as this rule.   
   
And then, you know, we certainly — at OSHA, we have a long history of
working with state plans to make certain that they are providing at
least as effective as safety and health provisions.  And we’ll continue
to do that.   
   
But it’s also, you know, OSHA’s responsibility to ensure that state
plans are at least as effective as.  And so, we certainly will do
everything that is necessary to ensure that that’s the case in this
instance for this standard.  
   
Q    So that would include potentially taking over the state
programs?   
   
And one of the reasons I ask is because three states have already missed
the deadline for complying with your earlier standard in June.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Correct.  Three states.  And we are
working with those three states.  And they’re — within the last couple
of weeks, we’ve provided them with the preliminary notification that
we’re going to be assessing the program to make certain that it is at
least as effective as.  
   
And as we walk through that process, one option at the end of that, for
the OSHA Assistant Secretary to determine, would be to move that state
from being a full state program to having less of the authority and code
enforcement in some cases with federal OSHA.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Next question.  Let’s go to Anne Flaherty at
ABC.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  This is probably for \[senior
administration official\].  How much of the holiday season and the
current worker shortage factored into your decision to push the
deadlines until January 4th?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Thanks very much, Anne.  I
think, you know, we know that some employers have — may have workplaces
subject to requirements for the federal contractors and other workplaces
subject to the ETS rule.  And so, as I said, in order to make it easier
for businesses to comply and workers to comply, we’ve decided to align
the contractor deadline with the deadline for both CMS and OSHA.   
   
So, this is not a reason to wait, of course.  You know, we know that
vaccines help reduce absenteeism.  We know they protect workers.  We
know they create a safer and healthier workplace, which workers want. 
But that’s the reason we decided to align the three policies.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  And last question, let’s go to Courtney Rozen at
Bloomberg.   
   
I’m not seeing Courtney unmute.  So, we have time for one more
question.  Let’s go to Nate Weixel at The Hill.  
   
Q    Can you hear me?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  Oh, who —  
   
Q    Hi, it’s Courtney.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, Courtney.    
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Two more questions.  Hi, Courtney.  Let’s go.   
   
Q    Hi.  Sorry.  I haven’t heard anyone mention, for the CMS rule,
religious and medical exemptions.  Can you talk about how you’ll handle
those?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are exemptions.  This is \[senior
administration official\] speaking.  There are exemptions for people
with medical conditions that do not permit them to be vaccinated or for
religious exemptions.   
   
Q    And how will you handle processing those?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It is the responsibility of the
facility to have a plan in place to make sure they comply with the
exemptions that we outline in the rule.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Nate, you’re up last.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Just to piggyback on that: For the CMS rule, is there a
testing option, or is it only for exemptions?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There is not a testing option.  We have
a higher bar for healthcare workers, given their critical role in
ensuring the health and safety of their patients.  And so, it’s either
vaccination or an exemption under the rules outlined.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\].  All right,
thank you, everybody, for joining tonight’s call.   
   
As a reminder, this is attributable to “senior administration officials”
and it’s embargoed — as well as the factsheet that I sent out — until
8:45 a.m. tomorrow.   
   
Thank you, everybody.
