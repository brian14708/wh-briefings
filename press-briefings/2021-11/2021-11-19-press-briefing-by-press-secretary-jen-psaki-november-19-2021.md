James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:38 P.M. EST

MS. PSAKI:  Good afternoon.  Okay, a couple of items for you today.  Not
much going on around here, obviously.  You’ve all seen the President’s
statement we issued this morning on the House passing his Build Back
Better Agenda for the middle class, which came just three weeks after
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal also passed.  
   
And since this came through today, I wanted to just highlight and note
for the American people a couple of the big benefits that are in this
package that we’re looking forward to moving through the Senate.  
   
Today, families pay an average of $8,600 per year on pre-K. Under the
President’s plan, many of them — most of them — will pay $0.  
   
The average family pays 13 percent of their income on childcare.  Under
the President’s plan, no middle-income family will pay more than 7
percent of their income.  Two parents with one toddler earning $100,000
per year will save more than $5,000 per year.  
   
Under the President’s plan, a family of four earning $80,000 per year
will save nearly $3,000 per year — or $246 per month — on health
insurance premiums.  
   
With this plan, countless Americans will save countless Americans
thousands of dollars by negotiating prescription drug prices — for
example, limiting cost-sharing for insulin products to make sure they’re
no higher than $35, starting in 2023.  Insulin is essential for many
people around the country.  It will cap it at $35.  That is a big
deal.  
   
And one of the biggest financial burdens on families is housing costs,
as we’re seeing around the country.  Build Back Better will take
historic steps to reduces those costs by helping to build, rehabilitate,
or preserve 1 million homes.  
   
Finally, it also reduces the deficit by $112 billion over 10 years.  And
several economists and analysts from leading rating agencies like Fitch
Moo- — Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Analytics have made clear the
President’s agenda will not contribute to higher prices.  Their findings
echo 17 Nobel prizewinners in economics who have already stated they
believe the Build Back Better Act will “ease longer-term inflationary
pressures.”  
   
Also wanted to provide a brief update on COVID.  Obviously, a lot going
on in our efforts to take on the pandemic.  
   
This morning, as we all saw, the FDA authorized boosters for all
American adults six months after primary vaccination.  
   
The CDC will make the final clinical recommendation, we expect, this
afternoon.  This is a very encouraging step to further protect
Americans, especially as we enter the winter months.  
   
If you’re one of the approximately 100 million people in this country
already eligible for a booster, our recommendation is that you get the
extra protection afforded by a booster as soon as possible.  They are
widely available across the country and accessible.  
   
Thanks to the President’s operational planning since August, over 32
million Americans already have their booster, and boosters are available
at over 80,000 locations.  
   
Second, we’re making strong progress protecting kids, with already 10
percent of 5- to 11-year-olds getting their first shot.  
   
Kids that have gotten vaccinated this week will be fully vaccinated by
Christmas.  And we’re continuing to make a big push to reach parents and
kids through visits to one of our 30,000 sites for kids by the First
Lady, innovative partnerships with DC Comics, and a White House visit
from Ciara earlier this week.  
   
Third, we’ve shipped over 250 million vaccines to the world — more than
all countries combined — and made an announcement of a historic
opportunity for mRNA manufacturers to receive funding and resources from
the U.S. government to produce an additional 1 billion doses next
year.  
   
Last, over 80 percent of 12-and-older Americans have gotten one shot. 
This is a huge number.  We’re continuing to push for more
vaccinations.  
   
And finally, our view — the recent polling will show you — that vax
requirements work.  And recent polling indicates 60 percent of companies
are moving forward with a vaccine requirement, which is a big step
forward.  
   
Just another little update of something happening here today.  Today,
first week in the job, our Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator
Mitch Landrieu and the seven Cabinet members and other agencies
responsible for implementation as outlined in the executive order —
Departments of Commerce, Energy, Transportation, Labor, Interior,
Agriculture, EPA, and OPM — held their first meeting.  
   
Also attending was Brian Deese, who is co-chairing the Task Force,
senior staff from across the White House — Gina McCarthy, Susan Rice,
Louisa Terrell, Evan Ryan, and Jason Miller.  
   
I have certainly invited him to speak to all of you, and he has conveyed
to me he is putting his head down and getting to work, as the President
has asked him to do, but will eager — be eager to speak to you probably
sometime after Thanksgiving.  
   
Finally, one note.  We gave a lengthy update — don’t worry, I will not
do that again — on supply chains yesterday.  Today, we have new data
from Freightos, a leading freight indicator, that I just wanted to
highlight that shows shipping prices have declined by almost 25 percent
over the past two weeks — specifically the price for shipping — of
shipping a container between China and the West Coast, which has
declined for two straight weeks.  
   
And, of course, this reduction in prices and shipping costs helps ensure
that we are cutting costs for consumers as well.  
   
I guess last thing here is the Week Ahead.  We did announce earlier this
week that the President and First Lady will travel to Fort Bragg, North
Carolina, to celebrate Thanksgiving — or “Friendsgiving,” as some people
call it — with service members and military families — thank them for
their service — as part of the Joining Forces initiative.  That is on
Monday.  
   
On Tuesday, the friend — the President, the First Lady, the Vice
President, and the Second Gentleman will participate in a service
project in Washington, D.C.  
   
And later that day, the President and the First Lady will travel to
Nantucket, Massachusetts, where they will remain for the Thanksgiving
holiday.  
   
Aamer, why don’t you kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks.  Now that the bill has passed the House, can you talk a
little bit about the game plan in the days and weeks ahead to get it
through the Senate?  
   
And, I guess, in the media, does the President have plans of talking
today or over the weekend to Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema?  
   
And just, if you could basically let us know what’s the plan going
forward to get this through to the endzone.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President is absolutely committed, of course, to
getting this through the Senate, signing it into law, and ensuring these
impacts, these cost-cutting measures are put in place into law as soon
as possible.  
   
A number of these steps, including cutting childcare costs, could have
an impact early next year if — once we get this through the Senate.   
   
We have been — we have remained in touch, even as we’ve been working to
get it through the House, at a high senior staff level — senior White
House officials — with Senator Sinema, Senator Manchin, other members of
the Senate, as we know that is the next important step here.  And that
will continue.  And I’m sure the President will engage when that is —
when it is the right moment to do that with them as well.  But I don’t
have anything to predict for you over the next couple of days.   
   
Q    The President announced today his intention to nominate two new
members to the Postal Service Board of Governors.  Is he looking to
remove Postmaster Dejoy?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say we are, of course, deeply troubled —
continue to be deeply troubled, as many Americans are, by the early
reporting on Postmaster General DeJoy’s potential financial conflicts of
interest and take serious issues with the job he’s doing running the
Postal Service.   
   
As you know, the President does not have the authority to fire the
Postmaster General; it’s ultimately up to the Board of Governors by
majority.  
   
So what was announced today is the President’s intention to nominate two
leaders to the bipartisan United States Postal Service Board of
Governors to replace outgoing Governors Ron Bloom and John Barger.  Both
Derek Kan and Dan Tangherlini are experienced public servants.   
   
And certainly, again — just to reiterate — it’s up to the board to make
a determination about leadership, but we have continued concerns about —
about the Postmaster General’s leadership.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yes, I wanted to ask a few questions about oil.  Has the U.S. heard
back from China, Japan, South Korea, and India on a coordinated release
of emergency stockpiles?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any update to provide to you today.  I would
reiterate for those who weren’t following this as closely: We have been
in touch with a range of officials and leaders from countries —
including China, including other countries around the world — that are
oil producers about ensuring there is adequate supply out there, but I
don’t have any update for today.  
   
Q    Okay.  Is Biden considering using authority under a 2015 budget
bill to declare an emergency and to limit or stop exports of oil for up
to a year?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have a range of options at our disposal, but I don’t have
any new ones to introduce to all of you today.   
   
Q    And finally — I’m sorry — any message for OPEC ahead of its
December 2nd meeting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our message continues to be — privately as well as
publicly, of course; it’s always good when it’s consistent and important
— that we want to ensure that the OPEC member countries and OPEC as an
organization meets the demand needs that are out there with the adequate
supply.  That is something we’ve pressed them on in the past.   
   
And I don’t have any new conversations privately to convey, but I’ll see
if there’s more we can report to all of you about the meeting.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    We know that the President was at Walter Reed earlier today.  Can
you provide an update on how the physical went and the colonoscopy as
well?  And what information will you be releasing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will have a comprehensive written summary that will be
released to all of you later today as soon as it’s finalized.  I’m not
going to get ahead of that.  It’s, of course, done by medical experts,
which — as is appropriate.  But we will release that out to all of you
later this afternoon.   
   
As I noted in a tweet — I hate to reference that, but here we are:
Earlier this morning, the President had a conversation with Vice
President Harris as well as Chief of Staff Ron Klain at around 11:35
this morning.  He was in good spirits.  He resumed his duties as
President at that point in time.   
   
There was also two sets of letters that we released publicly around —
one was at 10:10 a.m., the other was at 11:35 a.m. — about the transfer
of power under the 25th Amendment and the resumption of power.  So — but
that’s a reflection of how he is and how he is feeling.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then if I could, the vaccine mandate for the civilian
federal workforce is set to take effect on Monday.  Can you provide us
an update on what the implementation is going to be like?  And are there
any concerns about possibly having staffing shortages because of that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are not.  Let me give you just an update on this
overall — again, for people who haven’t been paying as close attention. 
So, November 22nd is the deadline — not 12:01 a.m. that morning, but by
the end of the day.  But we don’t see it as a cliff.  We’ll be providing
more guidance in days to come.   
   
We are the largest employer in the country.  So it is — the U.S.
government that is, of course — so it’s going to take some time to
collect the data, even as it comes in that day.  And once we have gone
through the data and have that, we will share that with all of you
publicly.  
   
But especially as we know, we will — what we have seen is there is a
surge in attestations and vaccination as we get closer to the deadline,
which is certainly encouraging.  But we want to have the final data
Monday, through the day, before we release that publicly.  It’s going to
take a little bit of time to process.  
   
But, no, we do not anticipate facing any governmental operational
disruptions due to this requirement.  And, in fact, the requirement will
avoid disruptions, in our view, in our labor force because vaccinations
help avoid COVID.  
   
Q    And how will the boosters for Moderna and Pfizer, which are pretty
close to being approved — how will that factor into these vaccine
requirements for federal workers?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we abide by the CDC guidance — which we follow it and
will continue to — which is two shots of an mRNA vaccine or one J&J
shot; that has not changed.  And so we’re not going to get ahead of any
changes they could make in the future.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  A couple of questions on the Build Back Better plan
and also how things went last night in the House.  Does the White House
have any response to Representative McCarthy’s eight-hour speech last
night that delayed the vote?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Kevin McCarthy said a lot of words — a lot of words; I
just want to emphasize that — over the course of eight and a half
hours.   
   
For those of you who didn’t watch all of it: He mused about — he shared
his wish that he could have been in Tiananmen Square.  He mused about
whether or not Abraham Lincoln was actually assassinated.  He shared his
whole his hope or his thought or dream — I’m not sure — about picturing
America in a swim meet after World War Two against every other
country.   
   
But in eight and a half hours, what he did not talk about was cutting
the cost of childcare, cutting the cost of eldercare, what we were going
to do around the country to bring more women into the workforce, to
protect our climate, and that — for generations to come.  That, in our
view, tells you all you need to know about Kevin McCarthy’s agenda and
what he supports.  
   
Q    Okay.  And Senator Manchin — on the topic of Senator Manchin: He
says he’s still not decided on this bill.  Is there anything that the
White House is doing to get him to come around on the bill?  I know you
mentioned this a few moments ago, but is there anything specific that
you guys are doing to kind of convince him?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve been in close touch, as you all know, with
Senator Manchin for several months now.  That will continue.  That can
include answering questions he may have, hearing concerns he may have. 
We are in touch with him, with his staff through senior White House
officials at this point in time.  And we believe he’s been operating and
negotiating in good faith.  That has been our experience to date.   
   
So now, as everyone knows, the next step is getting it through the
Senate.  That’s what our focus will be on.  And I expect we’ll continue
the discussions and negotiations as they have occurred to date.  
   
Q    Could you tell us when was the last time the President spoke with
him?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any update on that.  But I would note that a
lot of this work happens — and I think members of Congress and their
staff will tell you this — at a staff level.  It’s answering questions. 
It’s following up.  The President has had him here a number of times, as
you certainly all know well, but I don’t have an update on the last
call.  
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Following up on that, the President has made it clear how important
paid leave is to him in this bill.  Would the President sign the Build
Back Better Act if paid leave got dropped from the bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, you’re right that the President absolutely wants to
see paid leave in a final package.  That’s why he proposed it in his
initial proposal when he laid out his speech back in May, outlining his
Build Back Better Agenda.  He thinks it’s long overdue.  He thinks it
will help bring more women into the workforce.  It will ensure that more
women have seats at the table.  And it’s something he would like to see
in the package.   
   
He also knows and recognizes that you need the majority of members in
the Senate — all — every single Democrat — to support something to get
it across the finish line.  And what he looks at — and I’m not going to
prejudge what the outcome is here — is the totality of — and this is how
the American people look at things — the totality of packages of what is
included.   
   
This bill, no matter what — everybody supports universal pre-K, cutting
the cost of childcare, historic investment in addressing the climate
crisis, making sure there’s more housing units available, investing and
making sure eldercare is less expensive.   
   
There are disagreements — everybody knows that — publicly, but he knows
he’s not going to get everything he wants in this package.  If it’s not
in there, he’ll continue to fight for it.   
   
Q    So what is the backup plan if paid leave does get dropped from the
Build Back Better Bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’ll continue to fight to make it law.   
   
Q    And just a logistical question.  Will we get all the results of the
President’s physical this afternoon, or are there some lab results or
test results that we won’t see until a later date, like next week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect it will be a comprehensive summary of everything
today and don’t anticipate, at this point, that there would be lagging
results later.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    So, first, following up on the physical.  If this was a routine
physical, why wasn’t it on the schedule that you gave us last night? 
Why the secrecy there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, just to peel the curtain back for the American people
on how this works and how it typically works — if you look back at
history here: This morning, we notified the pool — the press pool — many
of you are part of that and rotate through that.  We called the
President of the White House Correspondents Association —  
   
Q    Very early.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — very early this morning — who was awake.  We called the
network bureau chief — chair — that’s rotating, as you know, and
indicated that the President — not only would the pool be gathering, but
the President would be going to get a routine physical.   
   
I then sent out a tweet to many, many people out there at around 6:15
a.m.  And we have put out many, many updates since then, and we will put
out a comprehensive written summary later this afternoon.   
   
That’s pretty standard for how it’s approached — sharing this
information.  It’s — it follows protocols that have been followed in the
past.  
   
And, again, you all will receive a comprehensive summary later this
afternoon.   
   
Q    Okay.  Moving on to the Build Back Better plan: Is the President
going to stop saying that the Build Back Better plan does not increase
the deficit “one single cent” if we now know that that is not true?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is true.  And I would note that several economists and
experts out there — I would note — I think you’re probably talking about
the CBO score.  
   
Q    Which Joe Biden himself, in 2010, called the “gold standard” for
Democrats and Republicans.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Peter, since we’re all here to communicate with the
public about accurate information, what I would just note is that one of
the components that experts — Democrats and Republicans, including
former heads of the CBO — have pointed to is that IRS — IRS enforcement
is not something that there’s a lot of experience in the CBO scoring.   
   
They still scored it, but it is undervalued by the assessment of many
economists and experts, including people who have been critical of us in
the past, who estimate — including former Treasury Secretaries of both
parties — who estimate there will be significant savings, significantly
higher than what is estimated currently.   
   
So, our assessment and the assessment by many economists out there is
that there will be savings.  Over 10 years, it will actually reduce the
deficit.   
   
Q    The CBO’s projection is that it’s going to — that there’s going to
be at least a $160 billion increase to the deficit over 10 years.  That
is 16 trillion cents.  So the President was not telling the truth.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Peter — just to go back to the content facts here — so
CB- — so the IRS enforcement component, something recommended by former
Secretary Hank Paulson, former Secretary Larry Summers — Democrats and
Republicans of both parties — who feel there could be significant
savings over the course of time.   
   
I’m just going to note something that form- — Trump-appointed IRS
Commissioner Charles Rettig said: ” The administration estimates $400
billion in additional revenue can be generated over the next decade from
enforcement efforts focused on higher-end incomes, shrinking the tax
gap.  This figure is no surprise”.  
   
Republican former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson cowrote an op-ed with
other former Treasury Secretaries, saying that there could be
considerably more revenue than we projected, from the White House, from
this.   
   
So, again, this is an area where experts — economic experts — neither of
us are one; I think we can confirm that —  
   
Q    Confirmed.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — have confirmed that there are significant savings that
will come from this.  That is why moderate members of the House, I think
they would tell you — and many of them have spoken to this, including
Congressman Kurt Schrader, who was one of the moderates who was on the
borderline, given deficit impacts — have said they felt comfortable with
it because of the expertise out there about the impact of IRS
enforcement.  
   
Q    When the last administration tried to say that the CBO was
incorrect, you tweeted, “Watching \[Mulvaney\] try to walk away from
\[a\] CBO score and explain \[the\] budget outline is awkward and
uncomfortable to watch.”  So what is the difference between the Trump
administration saying, “Don’t listen to the CBO” and the Biden
administration saying, “Don’t listen to the CBO”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Actually, we’ve praised the overall work of the CBO on the
Build Back Better Act repeatedly.  And that’s what we believe.   
   
But again, I would point to the fact that there isn’t a great deal of
history or experience in scoring IRS enforcement.  That’s something that
economists across the board have noted.  That’s something that leaders
on the Hill — Democrats and Republicans — have been briefed on for
several months now.  And that’s why it wasn’t really a surprise to them
and why the vote, in part, moved forward.   
   
Go ahead, Kristen.   
   
Q    Jen, thank you.  Can you explain the timing of the physical today? 
What was behind it?  Did the fact that the President is turning 79 years
old tomorrow have anything to do with the timing?  Did he want to have
that before his birthday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President is well aware that his birthday is a matter of
public record, as the President of the United States.  I can confirm
that.   
   
I will say, Kristen, we knew that we were going to do — he wanted to do
and committed to do a physical before the end of the year, so this is
obviously — meets that timeline.  And obviously, we work through
scheduling availability and requirements in order to do that because any
President is typically at Walter Reed for a couple of hours.  
   
Q    And not to harp on this point — but, you know, I think there was an
expectation there would be a press conference tomorrow.  He obviously
had a very —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Tomorrow?   
   
Q    I’m sorry.  Yesterday.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh.  
   
Q    He obviously — it was a late night for all of us here in
Washington.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, it’s okay.   
   
Q    He obviously had a very full day yesterday.  Was there any last
minuteness to the decision of his going in today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In — I’m sorry, I don’t really understand your question.  
   
Q    For the physical.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  To do it or not — I’m not —  
   
Q    To do it.  To do the physical.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not sure I’m understanding your question.  Did we
schedule it yesterday?  
   
Q    Was this planned in the — days in advance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We had planned to do the physical, yes.  But I would —  
   
Q    Days in advance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Right.  But what’s the root of your question, just to make
sure I answer it?  
   
Q    Just when was it planned?  When did he first schedule the
physical?  We — just because he had such a full day yesterday.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    And he had a colonoscopy today.  A lot of people that know —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That is — that is the nature of being President.  And as you
— and as I would note, in the pool report — and this may be why you’re
asking — the co- — the meetings yesterday didn’t end until after eight
o’clock last night.  Obviously, the President was closely watching the
vote last night, as we all were — maybe not through the totality of the
eight-and-a-half-hour missives, but he was watching closely last night
as well.  
   
Q    Is there any discussion about having a doctor brief us, given that
he is the oldest sitting Commander-in-Chief?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will be releasing a comprehensive summary — a written
summary — that will have details from the doctor and other experts who
were consulted — medical experts who were consulted — that you’ll
receive later today.  So that, I think, is what our intention is.  
   
Q    I also just want to ask you on a different topic, broadly
speaking.  The country is sort of waiting for, anticipating a jury
verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse case.  What is the President’s direct
message to people who want to protest, express their opinions after the
verdict?  And might we hear from the President after there is a
verdict?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I certainly — I just want to preface: I’m not going to
prejudge a verdict on an ongoing deliberation over a case.  And clearly,
once it’s concluded, I’m sure there will be something we have to say
from the White House.   
   
But — and we have been in close touch with officials on the ground
through law enforcement channels to ensure we are supporting any effort
toward peaceful protests.  That’s certainly what we will continue to
encourage as anyone looks to have their voice heard, regardless of the
outcome.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    There was one conspicuous thing missing from the week ahead that
Bloomberg is particularly interested in, which is the Fed chair, of
course.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  “What’s the President’s favorite Thanksgiving meal?”  No,
okay.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Yeah.  On what — is it accurate to say that it’ll happen on Monday
or Tuesday, since that’s the time that the President is going to be
in?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President intends to make a decision.  And I expect
we’ll have more to share in advance of his departure.  So, by process of
elimination, expect they’ll more — there’ll be more to report early next
week.  
   
Q    Okay.  Government funding runs out December 3rd.  I’m wondering if
the White House right now is looking for a CR to get, you know, towards
New Year’s or if you’d like a longer government funding.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question.  I — just given the pure volume of
legislative work this week, I have not had a conversation with the
legislative team about this.   
   
Obviously, we would typically work closely with leadership on
determining what that might look like.  Let me see if there’s more we
can report on that to you.   
   
Q    And then, yesterday, you got a bunch of questions about the EV tax
credit in Build Back Better.  The Canadians are obviously upset about
it.  It would make sense that because Senator Manchin has said that he
doesn’t support it, that the President’s message to the Prime Minister
is that it’s probably going to drop out of the final version of the
bill.  Is that sort of an accurate representation of what their
conversation was?  Or how would you characterize what his message for
the Canadians was yesterday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think his message was exactly what I conveyed publicly,
which is that there’s a long history of using tax credits here to
incentivize choices.  That’s true.  They’ll lower the cost here of
electric vehicles by twenty- — $12,500 for a middle-class family. 
That’s something we want to incentivize in the United States.  And we
feel it’s an industry that will help move towards a more clean energy
future — something that will help address the climate crisis that we
share an interest with with the Canadians.   
   
Certainly, as the Canadian leaders read out, this was an issue they
raised.  I’ll leave that to them to characterize further.   
   
And the President said, of course, we’re happy to continue having a
conversation.  However, this is something the President is deeply
committed to because he believes good-paying union jobs that will help
us move toward a clean energy indus- — help us support clean energy
industries is in our economic and national security and national
interest.  
   
Q    One last one to just — on the conversation you had with Peter.  The
CBO estimated that this — the tax enforcement would bring in a little
over $200 billion.  You guys are obviously saying $400 billion.  I’m
wondering if you can — I don’t think they’re just throwing darts.  I
also take the point that you guys think that they’re not experienced at,
sort of, figuring out how much this enforcement will bring in.  But
“twice as much” is a big discrepancy.  And so, I’m wondering why you
disagree so, so dramatically with the CBO on this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I wouldn’t characterize it exactly in that — those
terms.  I would, again, point to — and just another person I haven’t
introduced here — but Doug Elmendorf, who you all are familiar with, who
directed the CBO from 2009 to 2015, said estimating the returns on
additional IRS enforcement was challenging because large funding
infusions to the agency had little precedent and it was difficult to
quantify the “indirect effects” of more auditors.   
   
So, I would note that we also technically, I guess, have disagreements
with economic experts who are projecting it would have even larger
savings.  I mean not — not bad disagreements, but our projections are
not exactly the same as Larry Summers, who said that the proposal could
result in almost $800 billion in revenue and has a Washington Post op-ed
about it where he talks about that; and others who have projected it
would have even larger savings.   
   
So, I think it’s just an indication of the difficulty, but what we’re
pointing to and what we think is an important indication for the
American people and for many members of Congress who are concerned, as
the President is, about deficit reduction — and this bill will save
money in the deficit over the course of 10 years — is that this is
something where it will have that impact.  It has a larger impact than
even we are projecting.  And that’s what we felt was important to point
to.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    In an effort to flesh out the historical record of the day, is
there anything you can tell us about the 85 minutes that Kamala Harris
served as Acting President?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will leave that to the Vice President and her team to
characterize.  You know, I would note that — and you didn’t ask me
exactly this, but I know other people have been talking about this and,
as a woman myself, I will note that, you know, the President, when he
selected her to be his running mate, obviously he knew he was making
history — was making history that was long overdue, in our view.  And
part of that was selecting someone who could serve by your side, as your
partner, but also step in if you were — if there was a reason to.  And
that includes the application of the 25th Amendment, as was done this
morning.   
   
He also, of course — we also know we make history every time they’re
working together, every time she’s out there speaking on behalf of the
government as the Vice President of the United States.  But certainly,
today was another chapter in that history, I think, that will be noted
for many women, young girls across the country.   
   
Q    You have disclosed that the President received a colonoscopy
today.  Are you in a position right now to talk about any other
procedures or tests he might be undergoing as we speak?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will disclose all of that, but I’m going to leave it to
the medical experts to do that, and they will do that later this
afternoon in a written summary.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks, Jen.  In his statement yesterday, when he talked
about the U.S. purchasing Pfizer’s COVID-19 pill, the President
mentioned that he wanted to make that pill free for the public.  Can you
lay just, sort of, how that would work, ensuring that that pill might be
free?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you know, vaccines around the country are largely
free, so that is — there is a precedent for that, you know, across the
country and something he wants to ensure it’s available and accessible
to people to protect them from COVID.  
   
And I think this falls into the category — falls into the — falls into
our expansive effort to fight the pandemic, get it under control, and
get on the other side of it.  So, in terms of how it would work like
with contracts?  Or —  
   
Q    Yeah.  Does it require negotiations with insurance companies or
pharmacies or —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question.  Let me talk to our COVID team and
see what else it would require.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then, on Ethiopia, the situation there seems to continue
to be deteriorating.  What advice does the White House have for
Americans that are still in the country, especially given that the FAA
sort of warned there could be inadvertent risks to commercial flights in
the area?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as things have deteriorated there, we have taken
strong measures to encourage Americans to leave Ethiopia as soon as
possible while they can do so safely via commercial travel, which is
still ongoing, because things can change in an instant and flight
options could disappear.  
   
And the State Department goes to great lengths to assist U.S. citizens
in crisis.  We want to ensure Americans who may be in Ethiopia should
not expect the United States will be able to facilitate a military
evacuation in a dangerous environment.   
   
There are no plans — and people should understand this who are on the
ground — to fly the U.S. military into Ethiopia to facilitate
evacuation.   
   
So, the State Department is using every measure they have to communicate
directly and broadly with Americans there about the fact that it is time
to depart.  
   
Q    And just really quick: You were asked yesterday about the Chinese
tennis star, Peng Shuai, and you didn’t have anything to say then.  I
wonder if you have any sort of update from the White House on whether
the U.S. or the President is following that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  We are deeply concerned by reports that Peng Shuai
appears to be missing after accusing a former PRC senior official of
sexual assault.   
   
We join in the calls for PRC authorities to provide independent and
verifiable proof of her whereabouts and that she is safe.   
   
I can’t speak, of course — I know you’re not asking this — but to the
details of the case or any more details of where she might be,
obviously.  But I want to be clear where the United States stands,
generally speaking.   
   
First, any report of sexual assault should be investigated, and we
support a woman’s ability to speak out and seek accountability, whether
here or around the world.   
   
Second, we’ll continue to stand up for the freedom of speech.  And we
know the PRC has zero tolerance for criticism and a record of silencing
those that speak out, and we continue to condemn those practices.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Can I go back to some news from yesterday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    You were asked about this idea of a “diplomatic boycott.”  I’m
wondering if you can offer any additional details or define for us what
a “diplomatic boycott” means.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I just don’t have any more updates from here today, and it’s
just an indication that there hasn’t been a final decision.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then also, at the outset, you mentioned today that the
infrastructure czar and seven Cabinet Secretaries were meeting.  Can you
provide any additional details about what they were discussing, sort of
what their priorities are, any additional info on that meeting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can tell you that going back to last Friday when the
Cabinet — when the President had a meeting with his Cabinet, the focus
of that was on infrastructure implementation.  And he basically went
around to each Cabinet member who had purview, or was going to oversee a
key part of the implementation, to get an update from them on what their
approach would be.   
   
Some departments, as you know, will be creating entirely new programs. 
Some will have a level of funding, including the Department of
Transportation — some will have a level of funding, like the Department
of Commerce, they’ve never had for some of these programs before.  So,
it was different project to project.   
   
So what I would anticipate is that they will — that our implementation
coordinator will receive an update on the work that is happening by each
of these members and that these will be regular meetings that will
continue to ensure that there is implementation that is effective and
efficient, and that we are reducing waste, fraud, and abuse.  
   
Q    Okay.  Can I ask you one quick question — sorry, last one — on the
turkeys, if you don’t mind.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, the — those turkeys.  Yes.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Can you confirm where they are going after they may pardoned?  I’ve
heard Purdue University.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, wow.  There’s a —  
   
Q    This is a really random question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  This is an important question.  (Laughter.)  
   
I — we will get you that after the briefing.  I can confirm that part of
it is staying in a hotel, which — my daughter did not believe me, but
that is accurate.  
   
Q    On the turkeys who are pardoned —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They stay in advance — the turkeys do —  
   
Q    I see.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — in a hotel.  But we will get you the det- — I think there
have been details put out by the — I’m not sure if it’s the “Turkey
Bureau,” but we will get you all of the details after the briefing.  
   
Q    On the turkeys, are any humans going to be pardoned by President
Biden?  There are people who are serving life in prison for marijiuana
who want him to honor his commitment to release everyone in prison for
pot.  Are people going to get pardoned as well by President Biden?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will just reiterate that the President is, of course — I
have nothing new to update you on.  But the President is, of course —
will look to the use of his clemency powers.  He’s talked about his
approach — or his view on nonviolent drug offenders, but I don’t have
anything to update you on, on that, today.   
   
Q    Jen, in the wake of the President’s physical and on the topic of
his health, a new Politico/Morning Consult poll found that 50 percent of
voters surveyed did not agree with the statement that “President Biden
is in good health,” and that voters are almost evenly split on the
question of if he is in “good mental health.”   
   
I understand that the President disagrees with this assessment, the
White House disagrees with this assessment.  But I’m curious: Where do
you think these voters concerns are coming from?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can’t speak to the assessments of voters. There are
certainly quite a bit of conspiracy theory pushing out there on a range
of social media platforms and even through the mouths of elected
officials.  So, that could certainly be a root cause, as you know.  
   
But I would say that we are not only following past precedent of what
has been done, if you look back — and I know this was noted in the
statement we put out this morning of the times where there was a
transfer of power under the Bush administration.  We’re looking at past
precedent there and making sure we’re following that but also going
beyond in many cases.   
   
And the comprehensive summary that we put out this afternoon will have,
certainly, an overview of the — the President’s routine physical and
their assessments.  And that is something we will make widely
available.  
   
Q    And just one more on Build Back Better: How confident is the
President that he will be able to keep all 50 senators on board with
minimal changes?  And on the topic of changes, is there anyone sort of
engaged on paid family leave, but is there any red line for him on
something that absolutely has to stay in the bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President would have loved to have seen — seen his
entire original proposal passed.  But he also knows from having served
36 years in the Senate, that’s not how it goes.   
   
He’s somebody who governs from the position of “compromise” not being a
dirty word.  He sees consensus as the way you get things done, and
that’s certainly how we’re going to approach the next few weeks as
well.   
   
So, his bottom lines have not changed.  He wants to lower costs for the
American people, give them more breathing room, ease the burden on — of
areas like childcare, eldercare, healthcare.  Those are all components
that are solidly in this package.  And he won’t raise taxes on people
making less than $400,000 a year.  So those are his continued bottom
lines.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Following up on Build Back Better, Jen —  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Katie.   
   
Q    Kyle Rittenhouse has been declared not guilty by a jury on one
count of first-degree reckless homicide.  On the second count,
first-degree reckless endangerment, he has also been found not guilty. 
What is the White House’s response to that?  
   
Q    Not guilty on all counts, correct?  
   
Q    All counts.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — obviously this happened while I was out here.  So, let
me talk to the President and talk to our team, and we will get you a
statement as soon as we can.  
   
Q    Does the President think the judge in the Rittenhouse trial saying
that the victims in Kenosha should not be referred to as “victims” but
rather “looters” or “protesters” is appropriate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I’m not going to give an assessment of this from
here.  Let us get you a comp- — a statement as soon as we can.  
   
Q    And last question on the physical: Will you be offering a full list
of the people who treated the President and their assorted
specialties?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will be offering — we will be referencing additional
medical experts who the President spoke with, but I don’t think — I am
not going to prejudge what the final comprehensive summary will look
like.  
   
Q    Build Back Better, Jen.  Catholic bishops —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  It’s in the news —   
   
Q    — fear faith-based preschools could be excluded from receiving
Build Back Better money —  
   
Q    — that the booster shots —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — because they would —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is the administration —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think you need to talk over her.  She’s just asking
a question.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay.  I’ll go after her then.  I’ll go after her.  
   
Q    Is the administration considering changing the definition of what
it means to “fully vaccinated”?  And is there any concern, at a state
level, that there could be some confusion about what it means to be
“fully vaccinated,” given that some governors have started to change
that definition?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, some governors, I know, have offered booster shots in
advance of — or have expanded that.  Right? I’m not sure if they’ve
changed the definition, which is typically done by the CDC.  We follow
CDC guidance.  CDC guidance continues to be: two mRNA shots and one
Johnson & Johnson.   
   
We don’t prejudge and I can’t preview for you if they’re going to change
that at any point in time.  But that’s what we will continue to follow
and that’s what we would advise others to follow around the country.    
   
Go ahead, in the back.   
   
Q    Okay, Jen, on Build Back Better, Catholic bishops — Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.    
   
Q    Okay, here we go: Catholic bishops fear —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know what?  I’m moving on over here.  
   
Q    — faith-based preschools —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.    
   
Q    — I’ll go next.  I’ll go next, please.  Thank you.   
   
Q    Do you have — do you have any reaction to the report that the U.S.
is considering deporting a group of Afghans who did not meet the vetting
requirements back to Afghanistan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would have to look into the specific details, but I would
note that our — our thorough vetting processes are in place for a reason
— and we follow those to the letter of the law — and ensure that we are
not only welcoming people who served by our side for many years during a
challenging, long war but also that we are making sure the American
people know they’re safe.  But I have to look into these specific
examples.  
   
Q    And then one on Russia if I may.  According to Kremlin spokesman —
spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, some certain preparations are underway for
the virtual meeting between President Biden and Russian President
Vladimir Putin.  Can you confirm that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any meeting to preview or call to preview for
you at this point in time.  If something like that is confirmed or
finalized, we’re happy to share that information.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Ahead of Thanksgiving, I wanted to ask you about
hunger in the country, specifically hunger among military families. 
We’ve seen some of these recent reports that as many as 15 percent of
enlisted military families were dealing with food insecurity even before
the pandemic.  Secretary Austin, as you know, talked about this as an
issue just this week.    
   
I know that Chairman McGovern has been pushing the White House to hold a
summit on hunger.  Is that something the White House is really
considering?  And is there anything new the White House is doing on
this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, because of the American Rescue Plan, we’ve cut
childhood hunger in half over the last year.   
   
And I would tell you that when we look to getting the Build Back Better
agenda passed, to the impact it’s going to have on lowering childcare,
lowering eldercare — the cost of eldercare, lowering the cost of
healthcare — these are all costs on families that impact what they’re
able to afford in their daily lives.   
   
And, certainly, the impact on military families — as a military family
himself — or, I should say, the President and Dr. Biden — that is
heartbreaking.  And they’re going to continue to fight to do more to
make sure there are not hungry families, whether they’re military or
not, in this country.  
   
In terms of a summit, I don’t have any plans to preview for you on that
front.  
   
Q    Can I just follow up, because there’s two — in both the House and
the Senate version of the NDAA, it called for a basic needs allowance to
help military families that are low income and having a hard time.  But
there’s a difference — this is wonky, but the Senate —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s okay.  We’re a safe place.  Wonky.  
   
Q    — the Senate version would basically count the housing allowance as
income, which a lot of activists say would mean that a lot of low-income
families would no longer qualify for that basic needs allowance, so
thousands of military families could suddenly not qualify for that extra
money and that extra help.   
   
OMB said that they just need more, you know, comprehensive data and
analysis to determine if they support the inclusion or exclusion.  Is
there any update on where the White House stands on that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to check and see if there’s any update on it. 
Obviously, our objective — overarching objective is not to make it more
challenging for anyone, including — especially military families — to
put food on the table.   
   
That — making sure that’s not the case is central to the President’s
agenda.  But I will see if there’s more to report on that.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Again, Jen, Catholic bishops fear —  
   
     MS. PSAKI:  Chris, did you have a question?   
   
Q    — faith-based preschools could be excluded from —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We don’t need to scream or shout over other people in here
—  
   
Q    — receiving Build Back Better money.  I’m raising —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — so we’re going to keep moving on.   
   
Q    — I’m rais- — I’ve got a legitimate question here.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay.  Legitimate question.  
   
Q    I had a question about Section 230.  Yesterday, the Justice
Department announced that they were going to defend Section 230 in a
lawsuit filed by the former president, but as a candidate, President
Biden repeatedly called for the repeal of Section 230.  So, does the
Justice Department’s actions yesterday represent a change in President —
the President or the administration’s attitude?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He called for reforms of Section 230; that continues to be
his position.   
   
Q    I have a question that concerns religious liberty —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead in the middle.   
   
Q    — religious freedom.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go — wait — go ahead in the middle, Brett.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Appreciate it.  
   
Q    Hoping you can respond that.  
   
Q    Does the White House have any reaction to Senator Rubio this
morning calling the President’s pick to lead the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency a “communist” or any of the criticism that
she faced at her hearing yesterday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I did see some of that commentary.  I also enjoyed the
pushback from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who maybe we should just point
to as our response.  But I would say the President nominated her to
serve in this job because she is eminently qualified, and she’s somebody
who would represent the role and the United States effectively in the
position.  And certainly we’re hopeful she’s confirmed.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, thank you.  I’m not an economist either —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    — but I can divide by 10 years.  And even if you take — would you
be willing to go so far as to say that even if you take the lower CBO
expectation of what the IRS would bring in in a Build Back Better Act,
that the deficits on an annual basis will be so low that it might — it
would be palatable to the American people and palatable to Senator
Manchin in particular?  Would you go so far as to say?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t want to speak for Senator Manchin or all of the
American people; I can only speak for the President and the White
House.  But what I think it’s important for the American people to
understand, and certainly Senator Manchin too, is what I’ve noted a
little bit already to date: The former head of the CBO conveyed how
difficult it is to score IRS enforcement.  We have former Treasury
Secretaries who don’t always agree with us — former Secretary Paulson,
former Secretary Larry Summers — conveying that there could be much
greater savings.   
   
So, what I’m conveying to you is that our calculations and assessments,
and those of outside economists, are that it will actually be — this
bill will actually reduce the deficit, and it will also lower costs and
reduce inflationary pressures.  
   
Q    Can I follow up there for a second?  Seventeen billion dollars, or
whatever, a year is a drop in the bucket compared to the natural
deficits the country is actually running up right now.  Is that — do you
think that’s palatable, then, to Senator Manchin, to the American
people?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can’t speak for Senator Manchin or the American people. 
What I can speak for is what we believe our assessment is based on
outside economists and experts of what the actual savings will be over
the course of time.  And it will reduce the deficit over the course of
10 years.  And that’s what we’re communicating to the American people
and to Senator Manchin.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  A couple questions on Ukraine and Russia
(inaudible).  Yesterday, the Ukrainian government pleaded for more
military aid to defend itself against Russia.  At the same time, Putin
is complaining that Western countries don’t take his “red lines,” as he
called them, seriously, and blamed Western countries for the tension in
Ukraine, particularly with these weapons supplies to Ukraine.   
   
So, given those two conflicting things, what is the President’s — you
know, what’s the way forward for him?  Does he go with Putin’s red
lines, or does he go with United States wants to help Ukraine defend
itself, as it says?  
   
     MS. PSAKI:  Well, we go with what is in the interests of the United
States and what is in our own national security interests.  You know,
the President’s — Putin’s speech — which is what I think what we’re
referring to here — touched on a range of topics, including U.S.-Russian
relations and the need to maintain dialogue to address many
disagreements.  We agree.  That’s a part of an important discussion,
even as I don’t have anything to preview about what that will look like
or what’s next.   
   
We welcomed President Putin’s statement about resolving the Donbas
conflict peacefully using the Minsk Agreements.  We support reenergized
efforts to reach a settlement under the Minsk framework and call for
immediate steps to restore the July 20 ceasefire.  We also continue to
have serious concerns about Russian military activities and harsh
rhetoric toward Ukraine, and call on Moscow to deescalate tensions.  
   
We have been — have had extensive interactions with our European allies
and partners in recent weeks, including with Ukraine.  And we’ve
discussed our concerns about Russian military activities and harsh
record — harsh rhetoric toward Ukraine with the Russians over the course
of time as well.  
   
So, I wouldn’t say we’re reacting to any component of President Putin’s
speech.  We are going to continue to proceed and welcome steps or
comments where we feel they are encouraging or positive, and convey
concern where we see action or rhetoric that is — that is not in line
with what we feel should be happening.  
   
Q    How about Ukraine’s request for — they’re saying, “We need more
weapons.”  It’s pretty clear — their message.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have thing to preview or predict for you in terms of
additional assistance.  We’ve provided, as you know, a range of
assistance — military and non-military assistance to Ukraine, and strong
supporters of Ukraine over the course of time.  
   
Q    And then a follow-up on Ukraine.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just going to keep going around.  Chris, go ahead.   
   
Q    So, it’s been several months since the — people were hopeful that
the pandemic was ending, that the mask-wearing guidance went away.  Now
numbers are ticking back up, we’re going into a second winter that could
be deadly, and we’re still having, you know, more than a thousand deaths
a day.   
   
What is the White House’s message to the American people who are, you
know, frustrated over this turn of events and now potentially need to
get a third shot and continue to get shots into the future to protect
themselves from the virus?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we would say: We understand.  We are tired and
exhausted by the pandemic as well.  And what we can do is encourage
action; we’re encouraging every eligible American to get the extra
protection a booster offers.  They’re readily available across the
country.  It doesn’t take a lot of time.  It should be easy for people
to do.  And that is what our focus is on.  
   
We’re encouraging all children — all parents of children who are
eligible for the vaccine to get vaccinated.  We’ve already seen 10
percent of 5- to 11-year-olds vaccinated.  Getting kids protected is a
key part of moving forward in fighting the pandemic.  
   
We also have taken actions like securing 10 million Pfizer and 3 million
Merck antiviral pills.  So, the American people should know that we are
continuing to look for any way available and possible to get the
pandemic under control, to make sure people know we’re moving in a
continued, better direction on this.  
   
And we believe that moving forward with requirements and other measures
that will boost vaccinations is also a positive step.   
   
We know we’re heading into the winter.  We are — that’s one of the
reasons we’ve been encouraging people who are eligible to get the
boosters.  We’ve been encouraging parents of kids to get their kid — who
are eligible — to get their kids vaccinated.  Again, they could be fully
vaccinated by Chris- — by Christmas, or the holiday season, at this
point in time.  
   
So, that’s what our focus is on now.  We believe we have strong measures
to keep people safe, and we just need to continue to press forward in
communities across the country.  
   
Q    Is there nothing else that the administration can do?  Is it
basically up to the American people at this point?  Or is there — you
know, what powers — other powers do you have to take more steps?  Or is
it really just on Americans now to do what they can?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, you know, under the President’s
leadership, we not only purchased enough supply to ensure the entire
American population is vaccinated, we’ve made it readily available
across the country.  We’ve made it accessible.  We have also secured 10
million doses of — as I noted — of the antiviral pills.  We’ve ensured
we’ve run mass-vaccination communications campaigns across the
country.  
   
So, I would say the American — the federal government and the President
— this has been his number one priority, and we’ve done everything
humanly possible.  
   
At a certain point, it is true that people have to go get shots, get
themselves vaccinated, and protect themselves.  But we want to do
everything we can to make it as easy as humanly possible.  
   
Let me go all the way to the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I really appreciate it.  Nominees to serve in
senior State Department positions and as U.S. ambassadors have been told
by handlers that the backlog for confirmations is, quote,
“unprecedented” and to expect to wait months longer even than they
already had expected with a really delayed process.  
   
Is President Biden considering the possibility of recess appointments,
at least for postings of high operational and strategic importance?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to preview on that front, but I will
note it is unprecedented.  And I would also note that there have been
statements, including from former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates just
a few days ago, emphasizing the — how concerning the historic nature of
this is.   
   
Whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican or nonpolitical at all, I
think most people recognize we should have ambassadors serving in posts
around the world.  We should have an ambassador to China serving in that
country right now, an eminently qualified one, who the President has
nominated.   
   
We should have ambassadors at posts around Europe — all around Europe —
at a time where ensuring we are supporting NATO is a pivotal message to
send to Russia and other countries around the world.   
   
And these are not only being blocked by some but also delayed.  A lot of
these — and I talked about this a little bit yesterday — but the fact is
that many of these ambassadors will move forward with bipartisan support
once there’s a vote.  And what’s happening now is there’s an insistence
on a lengthy debate process instead of moving forward through unanimous
consent, which would mean just basically allowing for a vote without
going through a lengthy floor process that would use a lot of time on
the floor.  That can happen.   
   
So, there’s a lot of ways that this can move forward.  I don’t have
anything to preview for you in terms of recess appointments, but it is
frustrating, it is unprecedented, and it does certainly hurt our
national security.   
   
Go ahead, all the way in the back.  John, what do you have for me
today?  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Does the administration still recognize the
government of Prime Minister Ahmed Ali as the legitimate government of
Ethiopia?  And are they standing by it firmly?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t know if the State Department has spoken to this, and
I don’t want to speak out of turn here.  So let me check with them and
see if there’s any update on this front.  Obviously, we have expressed
significant concern.  We’ve put in place sanctions.  I will see if
there’s anything more official I can convey to all of you from here.  
   
Q    And just as a follow-up to the previous question on
ambassadorships: The President has not named anyone to the key
ambassadorships in Ukraine and in Hungary right now.  Are any of those
pending?  Because this is not anything tied up in Congress; it’s from
the administration.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Fair.  And obviously, as is true of other personnel
appointments, the President certainly wants to ensure we have the right
person to nominate for each of those vital and important positions.  But
there are dozens of qualified nominees who are waiting to be confirmed,
and we’re certainly eager to see that move forward.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, everyone.  Happy Friday.
