title: Press Gaggle by Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates En Route Woodstock, NH
---
 
12:46 P.M. EST  
   
MR. BATES:  I have a little bit at the top for you.  I appreciate you
joining us for the President’s trip to Woodstock, New Hampshire, where
he will visit the NH 175 bridge over the Pemigewasset, or just “Pemi”
River, which has been the state’s — on the state’s “red list” of bridges
in poor condition since 2013.   
   
He will deliver remarks on how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law repairs
and rebuilds the nation’s roads and bridges while strengthening
resilience to climate change and creating good-paying union jobs.  
   
The bridge that has been structurally deficient for years and forced the
state to spend money on Band-Aid repairs.  The President will talk about
how repairing bridges like this is not just important for public safety,
but upgrades that are going to save commuters time and money and boost
local economic competitiveness.   
   
The President will underscore how the infrastructure law is a
game-changer for communities desperately in need, offering a blue-collar
blueprint to rebuild and repair our country while making American
competitiveness against China and the rest of the world an even bigger
priority for decades to come.  
   
And the President will also highlight how he is following through on his
campaign promises to forge bipartisan consensus and demonstrate how
democracies can work and deliver for our people.  
   
He’ll also stress that when we invest in ourselves, both in our physical
infrastructure and human infrastructure, as we will in the Build Back
Better Act, that there is nothing that can stop the American middle
class.  
   
As you all know, this is a continuation of the administration-wide
effort including the President and Vice President, the Cabinet, senior
staff to go to red states, blue states, big cities, small towns, rural
areas, Tribal communities, and more to translate what this law means for
people across the country.  
   
And I also want to congratulate the North Carolina State men’s
basketball team on their win against Colgate Saturday, and our football
team for putting up a hell of a fight against Wake Forest.  Go
Wolfpack!  
   
Do you want to start us off, Colleen?  
   
Q    Sure.  Thanks.  I wondered if you had any more information on the
meeting with Xi.  What’s next for the relationship between China and the
President?  
   
MR. BATES:  So, I don’t have a great deal to add on top of Jake’s
outline that he gave at Brookings today.   
   
But you heard him earlier emphasize the upsides of a virtual but
face-to-face meeting that allows for a more personal kind of engagement
between the leaders and how we spent 10 months shaping the environment
in a way that advantages American interests and values ahead of this
discussion.   
   
The bottom line for us is that intense competition requires intense
diplomacy.  That’s why President Biden initiated this meeting.  It was
part of our ongoing efforts to responsibly manage that competition.  The
recurring theme throughout the discussion was on the long-term work
needed to manage this competition and establish guardrails on the
relationship.   
   
And as you heard the President say himself, it is their responsibility
as leaders to ensure that competition between the two countries does not
veer into conflict.  
   
Q    Should there be a boycott of the Winter Olympics?  
   
MR. BATES:  I don’t have anything to add on that subject, but I can tell
you that that was not part of their conversation.  
   
Q    And would the President like to send American athletes to Beijing
for the Winter Olympics?  
   
MR. BATES:  I just don’t have anything to add on that subject right
now.  But again, it was not a part of their discussion.  
   
Q    President Biden said over the summer that he doesn’t think of
President Xi as his, quote, “old friend” or good friend.  And Jen said
the same at the presser yesterday, that they — that President Biden did
not consider Xi to be his “old friend.”  
   
But then we heard President Xi use exactly that phrase during the brief
time that the press was in the room.  Do you think that President Xi was
trying to in some way undermine the U.S. with what he was saying there?
 Do you think — what — how do you interpret what happened in that
moment?  
   
MR. BATES:  I’m not going to speak for President Xi.  But like you just
mentioned, you’ve heard explicitly from the President himself that he
has a longstanding relationship with President Xi.  They’ve spent a
great deal of time together.  They are able to have candid discussions,
be direct with each other, which helps them be productive.  But he does
not consider President Xi an “old friend.”  
   
Q    And Sullivan said today at Brookings Institute that the American
and Chinese officials will intensify their engagement on Taiwan after
President Biden’s summit last night.  
   
What deliverables do U.S. officials want to get — want to achieve — or
are hoping to achieve out of that intensified engagement?  
   
MR. BATES:  I can tell you that there was an extended discussion on
Taiwan, and the President underscored the United States remains
committed to the “One China” policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act,
the Three Joint Communiqués, and the Six Assurances.  And he highlighted
the U.S. strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or
undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.  And this is
something on which we will continue to engage.  
   
 Q    And a second question on the debt ceiling: Has President Biden
been talking to Leader Schumer or McConnell on a path forward on the
debt ceiling?  
   
MR. BATES:  We are always in close touch with leadership about ensuring
that we do not default on our obligations, which virtually every
Republican leader has acknowledged would be catastrophic for our
economy, would cause millions of working people to lose their jobs in
short order, would cut seniors off from Social Security and Medicare
benefits, generate an unneeded recession.   
   
And I would note, on that score, that multiple times throughout the
Trump administration, despite having very large and substantive
disagreements with President Trump’s economic agenda, Democrats always
crossed the aisle in large numbers to ensure that we did not default
because of the pain that would mean for American families and because of
the damage it would do to our standing in the world.  
   
So, we remain in close touch with leadership, and we believe that it is
an absolute must that we raise the debt limit.  
   
Q    Has he talked to McConnell about this recently?  
   
MR. BATES:  I don’t have any specific conversations on — to read out to
you right now.   
   
Q    Just to go back to China briefly, did the U.S. and China reach an
agreement to allow journalists to come and go from the countries and for
potentially a one-year, multiple-entry visa for Chinese journalists? 
Those are things that the Chinese state media is saying were agreed to
in the leadup to the meeting, but, so far, we have not yet been able to
get confirmation from the U.S. side.  
   
MR. BATES:  Well, I obviously can’t speak for Chinese state media, but
on this subject, I would refer you to the State Department.  
   
Q    On infrastructure, Jen was asked yesterday how soon we might see
the first new projects started.  She didn’t quite have an answer.  I’m
wondering if you have anything more on that.  Are we talking weeks,
months, days, potentially, when we might see these sort of new projects
get started that are a result of the bill — or the law?   
   
MR. BATES:  Well, some programs will move very quickly, while others
will take time to stand up and get right.  There is a spectrum here.  As
you heard us throughout the process make clear: This is not a stimulus
bill.  The American Rescue Plan was our stimulus bill, and its results
speak for themselves in the sense that we are now growing — we are now
seeing historic job growth — over 600,000 new jobs on average a month. 
We are growing economically at the fastest rate in almost 40 years.   
   
But some of these you will see impacts in short order.  I believe
Governor Hochul yesterday pointed to some projects in New York that they
are going to channel these new resources to soon.  And then some are
going to take a number of years.   
   
I would keep in mind the Department of Transportation is preparing to
move formula dollars to states as soon as congressional rules allow
for.  The EPA is ready to announce the first Superfund sites prioritized
for funding.  And DOE has identified the first sites for their Advanced
Reactor Demonstration Program.   
   
I would also remind you that last Monday, the President released his
Ports Action Plan outlining specific steps and deadlines that we will
take to rapidly deploy available funding.  We know that communities need
help now, and there is a backlog of good projects out there.   
   
An enormous priority for the President and for his new implementation
coordinator, Mitch Landrieu, who is traveling with us today, is to move
swift — as swiftly as possible to get money out the door, shovels in the
ground, and start creating jobs for the American people.  
   
Q    Today’s the deadline for a lot of acting positions who weren’t
confirmed.  What’s the administration doing about that? I believe it’s
about 200 people fall into this category.  How big of a problem is
this?  
   
MR. BATES:  We are working around the clock to try and ensure timely
confirmations of the qualified people who we have put forward.  We are
grateful to the members in both parties in the Senate who have worked
with us in good faith to ensure that we are staffed in all of these
vital areas.   
   
And we also are engaged with members who have been standing in the way
of our very qualified nominees, and that is going to continue.  
   
Q    Do you know what happens with these “Acting” people then, once that
time limit gets hit, where they can’t act in those positions anymore?   
   
MR. BATES:  I don’t have more I can provide now, but let me see if
there’s some we can provide later.  
   
Q    About Danny Fenster, the journalist who was freed from Myanmar, I
just wondered if the White House played any role at all.  I wondered how
you guys feel about, you know, the former governor doing his sort of
diplomacy to get him freed.  
   
MR. BATES:  So, the United States welcomes the release of Danny Fenster
from detention in Burma.  We are very pleased that he will be able to
reunite with his family soon.  We thank our many partners who joined us
in calling for his release.  And we appreciate efforts by all partners —
including Governor Richardson, who helped secure Danny’s release.  
   
Q    Beto O’Rourke announced his candidacy.  Does the President support
it — his candidacy for the Texas governor?

MR. BATES:  So, this is the first time I have gaggled; it will certainly
be the last if I break the Hatch Act.  (Laughter.)  But I will note for
you, just speaking generally, that it is abnormal for the President to
weigh in in primaries.  
   
Q    On the Rittenhouse trial, given that we might get a verdict soon,
is the President expected to address the — whatever the verdict is?  And
do you — is the White House preparing for the possibility of some kind
of unrest across the country as a result of what we might see there?   
   
MR. BATES:  So, as Jen was getting at yesterday, we are not going to
comment on ongoing court cases.   
   
Q    I’m just asking (inaudible) —  
   
MR. BATES:  That is something that —  
   
Q    — for when the verdict comes.  
   
Q    Because they’re deliberating right now.  
   
MR. BATES:  — that is something that we have to honor.   
   
And I do not have any announcements to make at the moment about his
schedule, but something that I can tell you — if the plane will
stabilize — (laughter) — is that, you know, the White House is in
contact with state officials at the request of community leaders.  The
Department of Justice’s Community Relations Service has provided
trainings on de-escalation and contingency planning to local community
organizations, and they are prepared to provide any further assistance
that is needed.  
   
Q    Andrew, should we expect a Fed nominee today or later this week?  
   
Q    Or right now.  
   
Q    Right now.  
   
Q    Do it.  
   
Q    Can you tell us?  
   
Q    You want to make some news?  
   
MR. BATES:  I am not going to make history right now.  (Laughter.)  I
just don’t have —  
   
Q    We’ve got a lot of financial press here —  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
Q    — right now.  
   
Q    It’d be the best gaggle ever.  
   
MR. BATES:  I just don’t have anything to offer right now.

Q    Do you plan to raise, with Russia, the case of this exploding —
blowing up a satellite and leaving debris in orbit?  
   
MR. BATES:  Sorry, just one second.   
   
As you may have seen from the Secretary of State, Russia conducted a
direct-ascent anti-missile test on November 15th that struck a Russian
satellite and created a debris field in low Earth orbit.   
   
Because of this, astronauts on board the International Space Station
were forced to take emergency precautions and sheltered in the Soyuz and
SpaceX Crew Dragon capsules in case the debris collided with the
International Space Station.   
   
This action demonstrates Russia’s complete disregard for the security,
safety, stability, and long-term sustainability of the space domain for
all nations.   
   
This debris will continue to pose a direct threat to activities in outer
space for years to come and puts at risk satellites all nations rely on
for national security, economic prosperity, and scientific discovery.   
   
The United States will work with our allies and partners as we seek to
respond to this irresponsible act.  We call upon all responsible
spacefaring nations to join us in efforts to develop norms of
responsible behavior and to refrain from conducting dangerous and
irresponsible destructive tests like those carried out by Russia.  
   
Q    On Build Back Better — a couple of things with the vote potentially
happening this week in the House.   
   
First, you know, we’re expecting the CBO score on tax revenue at some
point in next couple of days.  And that seems to be an area where the
administration is already anticipating that it may not be as favorable a
number as you all have projected.  How are you planning to deal with
some of the moderate Democrats who are waiting for the CBO score?  Do
you think that they will be persuaded that they should be — that they
should ignore what the CBO is saying when that was the hold-up for them
to even vote to begin with a couple weeks back?

And then, secondarily, are you confident that you actually have 50
senators on board for this or will have them — that you really will have
Manchin and Sinema and that nobody else has any concerns?  
   
MR. BATES:  So, on your second question first: Like the President said
when we released the framework, we are confident that we are going to
obtain 50 votes in the Senate for the Build Back Better Act.  But I’m
not going to speak to any specific kinds of interactions we’ve had with
members on that.   
   
And then, on your first one, I appreciate you raising that because there
was a flawed report about this yesterday.  As reporters who’ve been
closely tracking the negotiations for months pointed out last night
after some of that flawed reporting, there has been wide agreement on
the part of everyone involved — moderates, liberals, et cetera — that
CBO does not have experience analyzing revenue amounts gained from
cracking down on wealthy tax cheats who are taking advantage of every
honest taxpayer.   
   
Last night, reporters directly asked key Democratic House members whose
views run the gamut, including moderates, liberals, folks in between. 
They universally said this was not an issue at all.   
   
What’s more: There’s a huge body of work from economic experts —
including Republican former Treasury Secretaries; IRS commissioners who
have served under presidents of both parties; as well as Larry Summers,
with whom we have sometimes had important differences — affirming that,
if anything, our estimates lowball how much revenue can be brought in by
cracking down on rich tax cheats.   
   
Also, CBO’s fiscal data, so far, lines up with our estimates that we
released to all of you for costs, or they even come in below our
estimates.  What’s more, Moody’s has verified this is going to be paid
for.  And this will reduce the deficit is the bottom line for us.   
   
But there is there is no issue of that sort.  This is something that has
been known for months, and everybody is on the same page.   
   
Q    Can I just do one more, real quick?  Germany suspended
certification of Nord Stream Two — it looks like it could be
temporarily, but — temporary, but there are concerns that there could be
low fuel in Europe this winter.  Does the White House have any response
to that?  
   
MR. BATES:  Not immediately, but I will see if there’s something we
would add.  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
Q    Does the President have any specific thoughts on returning to New
Hampshire, given the — given the way things went last time he was here
and everything that’s happened since then?  
   
MR. BATES:  Well, he — he’s very glad to be visiting today, along with
members of the Congressional delegation, especially because the win —
the bipartisan win from yesterday is such a validation of what he ran on
— that Democrats and Republicans can work together on enormous,
long-deferred priorities for the American people.   
   
Like he has said many times, infrastructure investment is long overdue,
and it became a punchline during the previous administration.   
   
And so, he is glad that we are now going to be able to point to this
action, which is going to strengthen supply chains; is going to be
counter-inflationary, like Rob Portman mentioned yesterday at the White
House; and is going to create millions of good-paying jobs, some of
which will be in New Hampshire.  
   
And we think it’s a good day for everyone.

  
Q    The President spoke during his campaign about using the
presidency’s power to grant clemency to begin to tackle inequality in
the criminal justice system.  Now he’s scheduled to pardon two turkeys
on Friday before he has granted a single pardon or commutation to a
person, a human being.  Does he have plans to do that soon?   
   
And is he — are you at all concerned about the optics of doing it for
these animals that are bred for food before you do it with human beings
who are clearly an important part of your overall policy perspective?  
   
MR. BATES:  Well, I think the American people very clearly understand
the distinction between what is a lighthearted tradition on the one hand
and then an extremely serious and core priority for the President on the
other.   
   
(Air Force One experiences turbulence.)  This is my first time landing
standing up.  (Laughs.)  
   
But we have announced some steps we are taking in the way of initial
reviews, exploring his use of clemency powers, which was a campaign
promise.  And we look forward to sharing more about that in the
future.  
   
And with that —  
   
Q    Do you have a timeline of that?  By the end of the year?  
   
MR. BATES:  I don’t have more to add on that.  
   
Q    Do you want to address this NRCC poll about Build Back Better?  
   
MR. BATES:  You know, I would like to speak to that and I’m glad you
raise it.  Give me just one second.  Because —  
   
Q    The NRCC’s poll of Build Back Better?  
   
MR. BATES:  Yeah.  So, the thing is about that, Steve — I don’t know if
maybe — maybe Fox Business has a poll on how they have better coverage
than Reuters, or maybe Little Caesars has a poll on how they’ve got the
best pizza in America.   
   
But in all seriousness, virtually all of your news organizations have
polled Build Back Better, joined by many other reputable pollsters. 
They all show the contents of Build Back Better resonate incredibly
strongly with a big majority of Americans.   
   
That is because, at a time when families are facing high prices, this
will aggressively cut some of their biggest costs — like prescription
drugs, capping the cost of insulin at $35, capping the amount of their
money seniors pay for prescription drugs, cutting the cost of childcare
in half for a majority of middle-class families, and fighting inflation
for the long haul.  
   
What’s really happening is that GOP leaders claim they care about
inflation.  But as Rick Scott shared this week, they’re actively rooting
for it and standing in the way of popular reductions to protect tax
giveaways for the wealthy and for big corporations.   
   
Also, if you look at that poll, they need to lie about what’s in the
policy, which, I think, says everything.  
   
And with that, we’d better go.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MR. BATES:  Thank you all.
