James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:15 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  Okay, a couple of items for you at the
top.   
   
On his first day in office, President Biden directed the Department of
Education to pause federal student loan repayments through September of
that year.  He has since extended it twice, today being the third
extension.  Millions of Americans were struggling, of course, at that
time to stay afloat.  Because of the pause in repayments, 41 million
Americans were able to breathe a little easier during some of the
toughest days of the COVID-19 pandemic.   
   
Today, as America — America is stronger than we were a year ago and we
will be stronger a year from now than we are today.  However, as our
administration recognized in recently extending the COVID-19 national
emergency, we are still recovering from the pandemic and the
unprecedented economic disruption it caused — which, of course, is the
root reason for this extension.  
   
In order to enable Americans to continue to get back on their feet after
two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced, we have announced,
earlier today, of course, the plan to — the extension of the pause on
federal student loan repayments through August 31st of this year.  That
additional time will assist borrowers in achieving greater financial
security and support the Department of Education’s efforts to continue
improving student loan programs.   
   
Also would note — one note on the COVID funding bill.  We have made
clear for months about our funding needs.  And at every step of the way,
we’ve provided the details that Republicans have asked for, even when
they’ve asked for — has changed in real time.   
   
I have a little prop here.  I’m just going to call him “Vanna” over
here.  Thank you.  This is Kevin Munoz.   
   
This is 385 pages of information we have given to Capitol Hill and
briefed them on how COVID funding has been spent, what we need, what the
needs are.  These are the kind of details we have provided and
constantly briefed members on the Hill to make clear to them what the
impact will be if we do not get this funding.  You can have access to
this for a prop if you would like it as well.  We’ll make copies for
you.   
   
Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
Okay.  But unfortunately, as we’ve gone through before, going back to
January — while we’ve worked, going back to January, with members of
Congress — Democrats and Republicans — on the funding needs, we’ve
hosted dozens of briefings, we’ve held more than three dozen conference
calls, we’ve shared more than a dozen funding tables — all available 385
pages.   
   
And we’ve also given Congress a full accounting of every dollar that’s
been spent on the COVID medical response and a full accounting of the
entire American Rescue Plan, which, as you all know, goes well beyond
the direct medical needs.   
   
We’ve also provided all the specifics of planned additional funding: how
it will be deployed against the additional purchase of monoclonals and
pills and vaccine — vaccines.   
   
And unfortunately, even after Senate leadership agreed upon a — on a
pared down bipartisan bill, Senate Republicans decided to move the
goalposts yet again and force amendment votes on something completely
independent of our COVID response needs.   
   
And at this point, we — the question we have is whether Republicans are
acting in good faith to provide the resources we need to save American
lives or if they are just playing politics.   
   
The virus is not waiting for Republicans in Congress to get their act
together.  We know BA.2 is here.  We know that it is more
transmissible.  We know that it is leading to increased cases, and we
know we’re already seeing an impact on our resources.   
   
The program that reimbursed doct- — doctors, pharmacists, and other
providers for vaccinating the uninsured had to end yesterday due to a
lack of funds.   
   
America’s supply of monoclonal antibodies that are effective at keeping
people out of the hospital will run out as soon as late May.   
   
And our test-manufacturing capacity will begin ramping down at the end
of June.   
   
So we’re going to continue to work closely with Congress to drive to a
solution, because the President knows that we can’t afford inaction in
this moment.  It’s going to require politicians stopping — to stop
skirting their responsibility to the American people.  COVID is not
over, and we have an obligation to protect our country, the American
people, and make sure we’re taking steps to prepare.   
   
Finally, last thing: Last night, as you may have all seen, we announced
the authorization of an additional $100 million in security assistance —
the Department of Defense announced — to Ukraine through presiden- —
through presidential drawdown authority.  This package will meet
Ukraine’s urgent need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems, which
we’ve been providing to Ukraine and they have been using effectively to
defend their country.   
   
The Javelins have been one of the most effective weapons the Ukrainians
have been — have deployed in combating Russian tanks and Russian armored
vehicles.  They were critical in the defense of Kyiv and other areas,
and we want to ensure we continue to get them in the Ukrainians’
hands.   
   
We also continue to work with our allies and partners to provide Ukraine
with additional capabilities and expect to have more to announce in the
coming days.   
   
Kevin has been out here before, so I have already embarrassed him in the
past, and I will keep it short.  But Kevin, as many of you know, is our
COVID spokesperson.  Kevin only recently turned 26, which means he can
barely rent a car.  (Laughter.)  But he is — he can now.   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  I can now.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But he — he has become an expert.  He is stalwart.  He works
20 hours a day.  And he is indispensable.  And so, I’m very grateful to
Kevin and happy he’s out here to provide the prop but also to provide
all of you with many, many answers on a daily basis.   
   
Okay, with that, Zeke.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You just mentioned that COVID isn’t over.  We just
saw the President give remarks to a very large crowd indoors.  I was
hoping you’d speak a little bit to how the President views, sort of,
what — when it is safer to be going to such large gatherings.  Is that
the sort of thing he’s trying to model for the rest of the American
public?  That the risks for most people from COVID now are lesser than
they were a year or two ago before vaccines and treatments?  Is that
sort of behavior now — it’s not something that should be stigmatized or
— and should be embraced?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  I think what the President is doing is he is
following CDC protocols and models, and that’s exactly what we would
recommend the rest of the country do.   
   
That includes getting vaccinated; getting boosted; getting an extra
booster if you are eligible, as the President did just last week; and
obviously taking any steps or precautions that the CDC recommends to
keep yourself safe.   
   
And obviously, in Washington, D.C., we remain in a yellow zone, and the
President follows those protocols as needed.   
   
Q    And just an update: He said — did he say when the last — the last
time the President tested for COVID?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I suspected you would ask this.  I’ve asked this question,
and I will get you an answer to that as quickly as possible.   
   
As you know, he is tested on — he has a regular testing cadence — is
usually tested a couple times a week.  We will venture to get to that as
soon as possible after the briefing.   
   
Q    Thank you.  And on a different topic, the U.S. today sanctioned a
number of Russians, including Vladimir Putin’s daughters, as well as
some other senior officials.  
   
I was hoping you’d might be able to speak a little bit about sort of the
— the administration’s thinking about when are family members of Russian
oligarchs and Russian government officials, sort of, fair game for
sanctions and how you’ve weighed and (inaudible) distinction between
minors and adults, in this case, with, sort of, you know, collective
punishment or trying to prevent them from harboring assets with, you
know, people who are not necessarily involved in the decision-making in
Ukraine but have, sort of, maybe benefited from that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve seen a pattern over time of President Putin and
Russian oligarchs stash assets and resources in the bank accounts and —
of their family members.  And so, this was an effort to get at those
assets, and that’s why these individuals were sanctioned.   
   
Q    And so there’s no — but why the distinction, then, between minors
and adults?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, we look at where assets may be stored and
stashed and make a decision and an assessment on what’s appropriate.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    The New York Times has a verified video that appears to show a
group of Ukrainian soldiers killing captured Russian troops outside a
village just west of Kyiv.  Has the White House seen these videos?  Do
you have a response?  Is this something you’re investigating?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have seen the video; I don’t have any confirmation or
validation of the video or the report.   
   
Q    And so far, the administration — or the U.S. has spent about $2
billion since the beginning of this invasion.  Obviously, you know,
you’ve said the U.S. is committed to doing everything it can to help
Ukraine in this fight.  But if General Milley is correct in what he said
yesterday — that this really could go on for several years — are these
numbers sustainable over the long term?  Can you keep up at this pace?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first — just to reiterate what General
Milley said and the President has also been clear — that there are tough
days ahead for the Ukrainian people.  There’s a likely scenario where
there — this could go on for some time.  And even as they have moved
their forces and they’ve retreated from Kyiv — they retreated from the
north and the west, and they’re consolidating forces in the east and in
the Donbas.   
   
And we’ve warned that we’re entering a new phase of the conflict that
could last for some time.  It doesn’t mean it will look exactly the same
or the needs or the resources will be exactly the same.  And that is
something we will continue to assess in our conversations with the
Ukrainians, as well as with our allies and partners around the world.   
   
And right now, just to note, obviously, our focus is on amping up and
providing a range of military assistance of — the $100 million for
Javelins is a good example of that — as they are in an active fight
every single day against the Russian military.  Also, humanitarian and
economic assistance.  And there will be different needs that will come
about over the course of time.   
   
And that’s something we are, of course, committed to continuing to
support: their recovery from this, their continued fight from this.  But
I can’t make an assessment about sustaining because, obviously, this war
and the needs will change over the course of time.   
   
Q    And if this is a really protracted, prolonged conflict, given what
the Treasury Secretary said today — sort of warning of the enormous
economic repercussions of this war for the whole world — what does this
mean for the economy in the U.S. for the next year or two?  Can you just
give us sort of a big picture of what Americans should be bracing for?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as we’ve made decisions about putting sanctions in
place, we’ve continued to do that through the prism of maximizing the
impact on Russia, on the Russian economy while minimizing the impact on
the West and the United States.   
   
Obviously, there are areas where there has been an impact, including on
the price of gas.  And you saw the Federal Reserve convey today the
impact of the Russian invasion on inflation.  And we know that to be the
case.   
   
But what we’re trying to do is mitigate those impacts.  And obviously,
not just the announcement of the Strate- — release from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, but the announcement by the IE — IEA today is the
largest release that they have ever done in history.   
   
And all of these are part of our collective effort to impact — to
mitigate the impacts on the American people over the course of time. 
Even the length of time of the release from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve — meant to be a stopgap measure or kind of a bridge measure, to
get to the point where oil companies could produce more — is intended to
have a mitigation impact over the course of time.  
   
So, I — what we’re doing is anticipating and trying to step — take steps
to reduce the impact on the American people over time.   
   
Q    Following up on that IEA question: Do you have a detail or figure
of how much oil has been released of the 180 million barrels to date?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to get that for you.  I’m sure that our team may
have that, but I don’t have that in front of me.  
   
Q    And can I ask — President Biden today told union members, “Amazon,
here we come.”  Was he endorsing the efforts of union — of workers to
unionize Amazon facilities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What he was not doing is sending a message that he or the
U.S. government would be directly involved in any of these efforts or
take any direct action.   
   
What he was conveying is that — is his longtime support for collective
bargaining, for the rights of workers to organize, and their decision to
do exactly that in this case — something that he has long supported
broadly over the course of his career.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just back to the issue of the sanctions that are being imposed on
Putin’s children and, obviously, sanctions against him as well.  Does
the U.S. have a rough estimate, at this moment in time, of how much of
his assets are tied up versus what he still might have access to?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an assessment to offer from here on that.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But we know that — we’ve seen attempts and efforts to stash
assets in the accounts and resources of his children.  
   
Q    A senior administration official, earlier today, was raising the
question of Putin’s endgame — that, at some point, he would presumably
recognize that this war has been a failure for him.   
   
Given some of the scenes that we’re seeing in places like Bucha and
Mariupol, does the U.S. believe that he is any closer to realizing that
reality today versus a week ago, a month ago?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, remember, the scenes we’re seeing in Bucha are from
events and atrocities that didn’t happen yesterday.  They happened some
time ago.  Right?  And there will be more of those — which our Secretary
of State and our National Security Advisor have also predicted,
unfortunately — because there are a lot of areas of the country where
Russia has invaded and committed atrocities — no doubt — which we have
not yet had visual access to.   
   
I would say that I can’t make an assessment for you from here on what is
in President Putin’s mind.   
   
What we do know is that because of the impact of the economic sanctions,
including the ones we have taken today, and steps we’ve taken over the
course of time, we have seen an unquestionable, significant impact on
Russia’s economy.   
   
And that has led to this question now, as a result of the decision
around whether or not they would be able to make a bond payment earlier
this week, that they will have to decide whether they are going to spend
down dollars and resources they have to avoid default or whether they’re
going to spend that money — continue to spend that money in funding the
war.  And that is a part of our objective — is to force them into a
place where they are making that decision.   
   
But we’ve seen Russia’s economy collapse by 15 percent, wiping out the
gains made in the last 15 years.  Inflation is spiking up to 15
percent.  Russia is set to lose its status as a major economy.  And our
objective is to implement those consequences to make it much more
difficult for President Putin to fund the war — and we’re seeing the
direct impacts of that already — and to make it clear that this was a
strategic blunder.  And we’re already seeing those impacts on the
economy.  
   
How that impacts him and — you know, that — that is not something I can
predict in terms of getting into his mind.  
   
Q    What is the administration’s current assessment of what Putin’s
endgame is?  And does the administration believe that that may have
shifted since the beginning of the invasion?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we — I would say that, one, while they have moved
their troops around and repositioned, we have not made — and they
haven’t made many airstrikes in the last 24 hours, according to
Department of Defense and their briefing, which you may have seen, or
their backgrounder — we also know that, you know, their goal remains
weakening Ukraine as much as possible.  And we should be under no
illusion that that objective hasn’t changed, even as their tactics have
changed.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  The President today, as he was talking about his vow
to stand by Ukrainians, added a line: “And, by the way, if I’ve got to
go to war, I’m going with you guys.”  Can you clarify what that meant? 
Is —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He has no intention of sending boot — troops to the ground
or fighting a war between — with the U.S. forces against Russia.   
   
That was a reflection of his long love for labor unions, and members of
labor unions, and the building and trades workers who were there, and
people that he would always love to be in the foxhole with — not an
indication of a change in U.S. policy.  
   
Q    Got it.   
   
He also referred to that heated exchange we saw that involved Secretary
Austin.  And he said, with regard to Ukrainian troops, “We’ve trained
them and we’ve given them the weapons.”  Can you clarify what he meant
by “We have trained them”?  What training was he talking about?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there was some, some time ago — training.  And we have
provided them, obviously, a range of weapons over time.   
   
What point he was making is one Secretary Austin made yesterday: Without
the extensive military assistance that we have been providing the
Ukrainians — the security assistance — over the course of the last
several weeks and even months before that — $1.6 billion worth, maybe a
little higher now after the $100 million last night — they would not
have been able to effectively fight back as they have.   
   
And how it has basically worked is: They have requested a range of
assistance.  We go through and see what we are able to provide.  We
often work with partners and allies to provide assistance we don’t have
access to here.  And then we expedite the delivery of that over the
course of time, whether that is Javelin, Stingers, or a range of
materials that are — the U.S. military has determined they’re not only
trained on but has been effective in fighting this war.  
   
Q    Aside from the physical resources, what training was he talking
about?  What was the latest training the U.S. troops have done?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s not new training to report out to you.  What he was
really emphasizing and the important part here is what Secretary Austin
was also talking about, is the military equipment that has been provided
that has allowed them to fight this war.  
   
Go —  
   
Q    All right.  And one more —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — on sanctions.  You said a couple times now that, you know, the
U.S. sanctioned Putin’s daughters because there’s reason to believe
Putin has stashed his wealth with them.  Does that mean that the U.S.
has some information about where the billionaire daughters are stashing
their wealth?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any more to provide to you from here.  We make
assessments about where to implement financial sanctions to get close to
not only the assets of President Putin, but those around him.  And we
have seen a long pattern of using relatives and family members to stash
wealth.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  First, on immigration: Our team in Texas is that
saying that you guys are starting to give smartphones to border
crossers, hoping that they’ll use the phones to check in or to be
tracked.  I — which part of that is supposed to deter people from
crossing illegally into the states?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think you of all people — since you’ve asked me a
range of questions on this topic over time — would recognize that we
need to take steps to ensure that we know where individuals are and we
can track — and we can check in with them.   
   
The alternatives to detention programs — is what we utilize — has three
unique forms of technology to monitor participants enrolled in the
program:  
   
Telephonic, which is one of them, which is uses a participant’s voice to
create a biometric voice print during the enrollment process.  And when
the participant has a check-in call, their voice is compared to the
voice print.   
   
SmartLink, which is another option, enables participant monitoring via
smartphone or tablet using facial-matching technology to establish
identity.  
   
And Global Positioning System monitoring is of a participant’s location
and movement history, using satellite technology through an ankle
bracelet.  This is all part of our effort, as individuals come into the
United States and individuals who are entering who will proceed to
immigration proceedings, to monitor and track where they are.  
   
Q    With the telephonic, though, any concern by folks around here that
these migrants will take the phones and just  
toss them?  And then —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Do you have a record of people throwing phones away?  
   
Q    I’m just asking if that’s a concern.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our concern is ensuring that individuals who irregularly
migrate to the United States proceed through our process of, you know,
of course, being monitored, but also participating in — in hearings to
determine whether or not they will be able to stay.   
   
I would note that nearly 80 percent of non-citizens released at the
border from DHS custody under prosecut- — prosecutorial discretion have
either received a notice to appear or are still within their window to
report.   
   
So, actually, the vast, vast majority of people are appearing.  In part,
we have these monitors and monitoring systems in order to do that
effectively.  
   
Q    Okay.  On another topic, was it common for President Biden to do
favors for Hunter Biden’s international business partners like writing
college recommendations for their kids?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have — I’ve seen the report.  I have no confirmation or
comments on a report about whether or not the President, when he was a
private citizen, wrote a college recommendation letter for an
individual.  
   
Q    A college recommendation letter, though, from, at the time, a
former Vice President would be a big deal.  So, do we know what the
President might have gotten in return for doing a favor like that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I have no confirmation of any recommendation letter
the President wrote when he was a private citizen — by the way, not
serving in public office.  That’s even in the report.  
   
Q    But he’s the President now, and you’re his spokesperson.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Correct.  And he was not the President at the time of this
report.  
   
Q    So, there’s evidence that the President, at one point, was
officemates with Hunter and his brother Jim here in D.C.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s not accurate.  
   
Q    That is not accurate?  So, when Hunter Biden is emailing a
landlord, “Please have keys made available for new officemates — Joe
Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden,” that — you’re disputing it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They were not officemates, no.  
   
Q    They were not officemates.  Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Great.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On student loans, briefly — and you were sort of
asked about this yesterday, but I just wanted to come back to it.  So,
as people plan for the future, should borrowers expect that after August
31st, they’ll have to repay their loans?  Or is there another — is there
a chance that it could be further extended after August 31st?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ll continue to assess.  And what we look at — while, of
course, the economy is in a better state than it is — than it was a year
ago, and it’s — we have a strong recovery, we also understand that there
are a range of impacts that are still longer lasting because of the
pandemic, including the impacts on costs and inflation.   
   
And this is part of the President’s effort to help alleviate that, as
was fix — as was the “family glitch” announcement of yesterday.   
   
So, we’ll make an evaluation.  The Department of Education will look at
that and a range of factors as we get closer to that timeline.  
   
Q    And has the President, at this point, ruled out a possible
executive-level cancellation on a widescale of student debt?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He has not ruled out, but I don’t have any update on that. 
And I would note that, again, he would encourage Congress to send him a
bill cancelling $10,000 in student debt, something that he talked about
looking forward to signing on the campaign trail.  
   
Q    And just really briefly, on the G20 —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — Secretary Yellen said today that they may not — that the U.S.
might not attend meetings if Russians are there.  Is that — is she
implying that these would just be individual meetings, or would it be a
kind of broader-scale boycott of the G20 in Bali?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  She — I think they have later clarified she was referencing
at the ministerial level and, more specific, meetings.  I would point
you to them of the more specifics.  
   
The President has also said — he said on the trip that he did not think
Russia should be a part of the G20, you know, meeting.  And I would note
it’s seven months away, which is a lifetime in our — in our lives.  But
it wasn’t an indication of plans for us to boycott or not attend.  It
was just, “It shouldn’t be business as usual,” which is something the
President has also said.  
   
Q    Jen, is it a priority of the President to try to identify the
Russian units that carried out the atrocities in Bucha?  Is that
something that the U.S. may be able to do?  And is it something the
President wants to have happen?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will continue to assist in every way possible with these
efforts to track down data, additional information, and contribute to
the international effort to do exactly that.  
   
Q    May I ask, if I can, a couple of other questions that made news
today?  A judge has just issued the first outright acquittal of a
defendant charged in the January 6th Capitol riot.  This was a New
Mexico man, Matthew Martin.  He was acquitted on some misdemeanor
charges by the judge.  This man had claimed that he thought police
allowed him into an entrance near the Capitol Rotunda.  Does the White
House have any view now that that case has been adjudicated?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any specific comment on that case.  We continue
to support the efforts of the January 6th commission and all of the
members in trying to get to the bottom of what happened that day to
prevent it from happening in the future.  
   
Q    Let me go back to one last question as it relates to what’s
happening in Russia.  The U.S. still doesn’t have an ambassador to
India, but it appears increasingly clear that Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti
doesn’t have the votes right now to be confirmed.  How does the lack of
an ambassador to India impact our ability — America’s ability to
pressure India not to work with Russia in providing any aid or
assistance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, while our preference is always to have a confirmed
ambassador on the ground — it’s an incredibly important diplomatic
position — we also engage with countries through a range of channels.   
   
And obviously, our Deputy National Security Advisor was just in India
recently in the last few weeks conveying clearly what the consequences
of violating sanctions would be and what the mechanisms are; and also
making clear that we do not think India should accelerate or increase
imports of Russian energy and other commodities, even as obviously those
decisions are made by individual countries; and also making clear that
we stand ready to support India as — in any efforts to diversify its
imports and serve as a reliable supplier, even as they’re only importing
about 1 to 2 percent of their oil from India.  
   
So, we have a range of ways to communicate and engage.  And obviously,
sending our Deputy National Security Advisor is an example of that.  But
clearly our preference would be to have a confirmed ambassador.  
   
Q    Does the President still support that nomination?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He does.  
   
Q    The Russian ruble has been on the rise.  Viktor Orbán in Hungary
said today that he’d be happy to pay for Russian gas in rubles and that
he’s happy to buy more Russian gas.  Is there anything the U.S. can do
about this?  Are you engaging Hungary on this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would — I would first say, in terms of the ruble,
the reason — it’s important to note that the Russian Central Bank is
making extreme policy decisions to artificially prop up the ruble.  So
it’s not actually on the rise.  It is being artificially propped up by
limitations that they are putting in place, including barring banks from
selling dollars to customers; Russian brokerages are not allowing
foreign clients to sell securities; exporters are being forced to sell
80 percent of their dollar revenues and buy rubles.  So, they are
essentially manipulating it on their end.  
   
As it relates to Hungary — I mean, slightly a different question, but
our — you know, obviously, there was the recent election, as you noted,
of Viktor Orbán.  I would note that our — Hungary is a NATO Ally,
continues to be.  We continue to cooperate on a range of bilateral and
shared global interests, including on NATO defense and on humanitarian
assistance.  They’re currently hosting forces from an Army Stryker
infantry troop as part of a NATO battle group.  We regularly conduct
joint training exercises with them, and we will continue to work to
strengthen our partnership with Hungary.  
   
Obviously, reliance on the ruble is a decision individual countries will
make, and we’ve obviously made our views clear on that front.  
   
Q    So you have engaged Hungary on this question?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That is not what I conveyed.  I just conveyed they’re a NATO
Ally.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Can we go back to the sanctions?  As they were announced this
morning, the Sberbank and the Alfa Bank sanctions, I believe, exclude
energy.  They’re full blocking sanctions excluding energy.  Similarly,
the SOE sanctions coming tomorrow also will not affect the energy
sector.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Can you speak to that balancing act?  Is that because you’re
worried about the domestic impact here in the U.S. on the price of
natural gas, price of gasoline?  Or is that because the Europeans asked
you to sort of carve that out?  Why — or why is that still sort of a
bridge too far for the U.S. on these sanctions?  They’re not really full
blocking sanctions if they’re excluding energy.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I mean, I would say they’re quite extensive, given
Sberbank is the largest bank in Russia and Alfa Bank is the largest
private bank in Russia.  So, in total, we’ve now fully blocked more than
two thirds of Russia’s banking sector.   
   
These conversations and discussions, obviously, are done in coordination
with our European allies and partners.  And we continue to assess how we
can maximize the impact while minimizing the impact on other economies,
including, of course, the gloi- — the global oil marketplace.  
   
And we’ve taken steps, of course, banning oil imports.  A number of
countries, including Poland, in Europe have announced their intention to
take steps, but that’s up to individual countries to make.  But it’s
part coordination, assessment with other countries and our allies about
the impacts.  But I would still say it’s quite a significant step, given
they’re the largest bank in Russia.  
   
Q    So is it accurate then to say that this was done because of the
Europeans saying, “Hey, you know, this would be too (inaudible)?”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, this is — but we do update them and brief them on the
steps we take and why.  And we look at the impacts on — on how things
will impact the United States, how they will impact a range of our
allies as we make decisions about sanctions.  
   
Q    And very quickly on the central bank actions propping up the ruble
— do you have any sense of how long they’re able to keep that up?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an assessment from here at this point in time
on that.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  On immigration: With the lifting of Section 42,
there are a lot of Democrats, particularly Democratic senators, up for
reelection who worry that you don’t have a plan to either stop the
spring surge of undocumented immigrants or handle it.  What do you say
to those Democrats?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first say that Title 42 is not an immigration
measure, it’s a public health measure and one that Congress has given
the CDC authority to make a decision about.  And we respect that and
think that’s — that’s absolutely right.  That’s why the President
proposed an immigration bill in his first day in office.  And we would
certainly welcome efforts of anybody to work with us on that.  
   
But as we’re implementing this over the course of the next five weeks,
if I’m doing my math correctly, we’ve also surged resources from the
Department of Homeland Security.  And we will continue to take
additional steps to implement and make clear that this is not the time
to come, that there are — there will still be significant measures put
in place for anyone who tries to irregularly migrate to the United
States.  
   
Q    Do you feel that you — I mean, what’s your goal, and what do you
expect — what impact do you expect to have on the spring surge with
those kinds of measures?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would really point you to the Department of Homeland
Security to make any projections of that, because we have not made any
projections of what it will mean in terms of the ending of Title 42
either.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I know that you’ve talked about the stringent measures
you’ve taken to keep the President safe from COVID that go beyond the
CDC guidelines, but that’s such a visual contrast between that and the
President showing up maskless in front of people at some of these
events.  So how do you make sure that you keep that protection bubble
around him?  I’m sure you feel like you’re asked to explain this ad
nauseum.  But —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, it’s okay.  
   
Q    — the bubble is looking pretty porous lately.  So how do you keep
that, sort of, enforced?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that we continue to  
take measures that go beyond what the CDC protocols are.  That includes
ensuring that everybody who’s going to see the President in a meeting is
tested in advance — or if you’re traveling with the President, you’re
tested in advance.  
   
When possible, we take steps to socially distance in circumstances,
which certainly the Oval Office and other meeting spaces in the White
House allow for.   
   
If an individual in the White House is a close contact, they are asked
to or required to, I guess you could say, wear a mask for 10 days after
that exposure.  And they are also tested regularly following.  
   
So, I would say we take additional measures that go beyond what the CDC
protocols and requirements are to ensure that we’re doing everything we
can to keep principals safe — the President, the Vice President, and
others, of course, in the building.  
   
Q    Was everyone tested before the East Room event tomorrow — everyone
who was there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s not at public events.  I’m talking about at meetings. 
But again, I can check on the protocols for public events.  Sure.  
   
Q    Have you changed any protocol surrounding him in recent days as
more people are — in the administration contract this virus?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ve continued to implement stringent and strict
protocols.   
   
I would note that even as we’re looking at, with BA.2 — a very
transmissible variant, as we all know, and our public health officials
have told us.  We’ve seen an increase in cases — right? — in the
country, in the region, among the press corps, and certainly in the
White House.  And — but it is not, at this point, what we saw during
Omicron.  
   
And what — the steps we have taken here, including policy put in place
to ensure that “return to work” was part of our policies in the federal
government, are meant to ensure that can continue to be the case.  And
even while we have individuals who are out with COVID, everyone here is
required to be tested, highly recommended to be boosted.  People who are
out because of that — the vast, vast majority have mild cases and are
continuing to work from home.  
   
And obviously, we are continuing to implement the “return to work”
policy and feel we have the measures necessary to do that.  
   
Q    So what’s the clearest version of the message that you’re trying to
send to Americans about living with this virus, even as infection rates
rise — I mean, that it’s not the end of the world if you get it if
you’re boosted?  I mean, is that the message you send through the
President, who’s maskless in front of hundreds of people — that this
isn’t the end, that we have to live this way?  Is that the clear version
of the message?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our recommend- — well, the message we’re sending is to
follow the CDC protocols and guidance for where you live.  The President
does that.  He did an event in Washington, D.C., today where it does not
require mask wearing.  There are other parts of the country, as you
know, where he’s traveled and he has worn a mask where that has been the
recommendation.  
   
Our protocols also here — and we would certainly project this to the
American people — are that getting vaccinated and getting boosted — and
if you are immunocompromised or you’re over certain age, getting your
next booster — is certainly a way to help protect yourself.  That’s
something the President has done and every member of the senior staff
and White House staff has done and will continue to do, although some of
us are teasing the people who are over 50 that were not old enough yet. 
But that’s a si- — that’s a sidebar.  When we are, we will be doing that
as well.  
   
So, it is — it is to follow the protocols and to recognize that the
statistics show you are significantly more likely to be hospitalized and
even to die if you are not vaccinated, if you are not boosted.  
   
And, yes, we are living with COVID-19.  We are continuing to fight it. 
And our biggest message right now is that we need the resources from
Congress to continue to have the — to ensure we have programs for the
uninsured, that we can provide treatments for immunocompromised, that we
can make sure that we have testing mechanisms and booster mechanisms. 
And we’re going to — we’re at serious risk of those programs not being
able to continue.  Some haven’t, obviously.  
   
Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Jen, just to follow up on something you said to Mara on the Title
42 question.  You said that the administration will be taking additional
steps to make clear this is not the time to come.  That was, of course,
a pretty explicit message from the President and others last year: “Do
not come.”  Is that still the message on May 24th?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, a follow-up to that: As the U.S. moves to end
Title 42 in May, are there discussions now or is there any update you
can give us on ending the testing requirement for reentry into the U.S.
for people traveling here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any update on that at this point in time. 
That’s something we will continue to evaluate.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  I have a follow-up on sanctions and energy.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    The European Union said yesterday that they are paying Russia,
every day, a little more than $1 billion for gas and oil.  How long can
this go on, in the President’s view, without undermining the collective
effort to punish Russia?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that we continue to believe that it’s up
to individual countries to make assessments about what additional
measures they will be put in place.  While we are focused on continuing
unity with our NATO Allies and partners and our European partners, it
does not mean that it is always identical, and different countries have
to make their own assessments.  
   
What we’ve also tried to do is take steps to ensure there are other
options to reduce dependence, even if it’s a small percentage.  And if
there’s a vari- — varying, as you all know, degree of reliance for these
countries you’re referencing on Russian oil.  And some of them have
taken steps to convey they want to reduce or end their dependence or
import of Russian oil, and that’s something certainly we’d support and
play any constructive role in helping — to helping expedite.  
   
Q    Jen, a follow-up —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ll come around to you in a second.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    To follow up on the question about Hungary, are there any plans to
engage with them about this particular topic of paying in rubles at any
level in the coming days or weeks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to check with the State Department to see if
there’s any plans for engagement about it.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay, Jen.  Again, an American Catho- —  
   
Q    Thank you.  You talked about the increasing picture of Russia’s
economy.  Over the years, public reporting has shown that white
supremacists and other domestic extremists have developed an affinity
for Russia.  Is there any concern that as the Russian economy continues
to degrade, that Russia might try and inspire domestic extremists,
domestic terrorists to commit acts of violence on American soil in
retaliation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s an interesting and scary question.  I don’t have any
prediction or assessment of that, nor have I heard a prediction or
assessment of that from our national security experts or the Department
of Homeland Security.  I’m happy to check with them and see if there’s
anything on that front.  
   
Q    Jen, again —  
   
Q    Yeah.  Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay.  All right, Jen.  So, an American Catholic nun has been
abducted — it happened Monday night — by gunmen in Burkina Faso, in
Western Africa.  Her name is Sister Suellen Tennyson.  She was doing
missionary work there.  Is the White House aware of that, by any chance
— her abduction?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to check with our national security team and the
State Department.  Obviously, they would have purview over any steps to
bring Sister — tell me her name again.  
   
Q    Sister Suellen Tennyson.  And she was working in Burkina Faso, in
Western Africa.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sister Tennyson back, who clearly was doing incredible work
— humanitarian work, it sounds like — on behalf of the people in Burkina
Faso.  
   
I will check with the State Department and see if there’s any updates on
this specific case.  
   
Q    Thank you very much.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, okay.  All right.  Okay, go ahead, Patsy.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you, Jen.  I want to follow up on what you said
yesterday about the lack of global COVID funding.  And you explained it
essentially means that the U.S. cannot turn the doses that you already
have into shots in arms.  And I believe that the U.S. has already
purchased 1.2 billion doses that it’s pledged.  And out of that, there
is about 680 million that haven’t been delivered.  
   
So, my question, then, is: What will happen to those doses?  I know,
like, possibly you already have funding for delivery — the cold chain
storage, training people, and so on.  But what happens to the rest of it
when you are unable to turn those vaccines into vaccinations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re not quite there yet.  And our hope is that we
will be able to turn them — vaccines into vaccinations.   
   
But as you know, it’s not just an issue of vaccine doses.  It’s the
know-how, it’s the capacity, it’s the tools and mechanisms to be able to
store, deliver, implement getting shots into arms in a number of these
countries, which is why a number of countries haven’t even been able to
accept the doses that we’ve been able to offer — because of that
know-how.  And that is part of the program that is so essential to fund
through USAID and other of our international bodies to do exactly
that.   
   
But we’re not quite at that point.  We’re going to continue to press for
international funding, just like we are going to continue to press for
domestic funding, because we feel it’s important and imperative that we
continue to be the arsenal of vaccines around the world.  
   
Q    Can you give us a sense on how you want to do that?  Is the goal to
push for a separate package on global COVID funding?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to get ahead of where we are.  Obviously, it
was disappointing, to say the least, that the package did not move
forward despite an agreement on that yesterday afternoon.   
   
But what I’m here to convey is that this funding, domestically and
internationally, is imperative, it’s urgent, and we’re going to continue
to press for all of it.  
   
Q    And I have one more question on Daleep Singh’s visit to India —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — which was also partly to go on a listening tour for the Build
Back Better World that was actually scheduled to be formally launched
early this year.   
   
So if you can give us an update on that.  Why has it not launched yet? 
And at this point, do you feel that it is — with the projects — with the
listening tours, with the pilot projects that are being planned, is it
robust enough to be introduced to the world as a viable alternative to
China’s Belt and Road Initiative?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As you know, the President has used his own time to talk
about Build Back Better World and how important it is to our efforts to
rebuild infrastructure without the strings attached around the world. 
And that speaks to our commitment to it.  And obviously, our Nat- —
Deputy National Security Advisor taking a trip himself, having a
discussion about it is a reflection of our commitment to that and our
efforts.  
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    Can I ask you a follow-up question on COVID-19?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    The WHO Director-General is in D.C. —  
   
Q    Earlier this morning at the Monitor Breakfast, NEC Director Brian
Deese mentioned a classified briefing that took place earlier today
between lawmakers, Jake Sullivan, and others about, quote, “escalating
vulnerabilities” around semiconductors.  Can you tell us more about this
meeting?  And was it an effort to get Congress to hurry up on the
reconciliation of the two related bills?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can’t speak to the specifics of a classified
briefing.  What I can tell you is that we can — remain committed to
supporting efforts to get you USICA passed, which includes significant
funding for chips manufacturing and production, which, as we know, is a
big hindrance to our ability to manufacture a range of — a range of
items in the United States, including cars and others, that rely on
chips.  And this bill has a great deal of funding for it.  
   
So, I think it was a reminder — and more details that I can’t get into
from here on — on how important addressing that shortage and being able
to produce them at home are, moving forward.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, as the administration sort of collects this evidence for
potential war crimes trials against Russian officials, does the U.S.,
does the administration have a preferred venue for where that type of
trial might take place?  That — there are obviously a few avenues
available to the international community.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are.  And there — there’s a lot of precedent and —
that has used different venues.  So at this point, that determination
has not been made.   
   
What we are doing — and I think I would point you first to our Attorney
General’s comments earlier today about the role of the Department of
Justice in this effort moving forward.  But we have supported a range of
efforts, including the efforts by the Ukrainian Special Prosecutor to
gather information and the work of the war crimes unit under the
Ukrainian Prosecutor General — sorry, Prosecutor General, not Special
Prosecutor — and a team of international prosecutors who are working
with them.   
   
We also — in the last few weeks, we helped establish investigations for
the U.N. Human Rights Council and the OSCE of possible violations by
Russia.  And we welcome the investigation opened by the ICC
Prosecutor.  
   
So there has been different ways that war crimes –unfortunately, there
are past instances and examples — have been investigated and tried in
the past.  And we’re going to support all of these efforts, but there
hasn’t been a determination yet about what mechanism it will take.  
   
Q    Has this effort changed at all the thinking of the administration
as it relates to the relationship between the U.S. and the ICC?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we are not a member of the ICC, as you know.  That
hasn’t changed.  We have supported and contributed data and information
to ICC investigations in the past.  There was — we supported the U.N.
Security Council’s referral of Libya to the ICC back in 2011.  And if
you look back to 2004, we also provided data and information to the ICC
investigation of Darfur.   
   
So, there is past precedent, even as we have not been members of the
ICC.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  A couple of follow ups.  When the President said
that the U.S. was training Ukrainians, was he talking about training
that had occurred during his administration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any other additional details.  What he was
really making a point about is what Secretary Austin said yesterday,
which is that without the extensive and robust military assistance we
have provided, the Ukrainians would not have been able to as effectively
fight and push back on the Russian invasion.  
   
Q    And then he said, “Amazon, here we come.”  You said that he was
generally expressing his support for the right to unionize.  Moments
later, though, news broke that the SEC was beginning an investigation of
Amazon.  Was that a coincidence?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No relation.  SEC is an independent agency.  
   
Q    Gotcha.  Was he aware that there was an investigation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not that I’m aware of.  
   
Q    And then, one final one.  This administration has sent everything
from medical supplies to laser-guided rockets to the Ukrainians right
now.  While this administration is making them more lethal, is the
thought that we are bolstering their defensive capabilities?  Or is the
administration confident that we are bolstering their offensive
capability to, in fact, you know, expel Russia from their borders?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, their country is being invaded, so it’s all
defensive.  They’re defending their sovereign country and the
territorial integrity of Ukraine using these weapons systems that the
Department of Defense has long categorized as defensive systems.  
   
You wouldn’t go invade another country with a lot of these systems — the
vast majority of these systems.  That’s not how you would go about it. 
And obviously, that is not what they’re doing.  They’re trying to
protect their own people, their own cities, their own innocent civilians
who are being invaded by a foreign power.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Let me do one more in the back because I never get to
the Huffington Post, and I — today is the day.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  There was a recent report that the President had
expressed some frustration that the former President had not been
charged.  Without getting into the details of that, there are lots of
people being charged with obstructing an official proceeding, meaning
the January 6th certification.  
   
Well, the former President was doing that openly and his administration
was doing it.  Why wouldn’t you charge him?  And why hasn’t the
President come out and said that if that’s the case?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I — first, I’ve never heard the President say those
words — or say that phrase that was reported.  And I know Ron Klain said
something similarly, so I don’t know — we each spend a lot of time with
him.   
   
But I would say that the President, from the beginning, has felt
strongly that the Justice Department and the Attorney General must
operate independently, and any decisions about prosecution need to be
made independently.  And that is the strength of our system, even as the
former guy ignored that and former-President Nixon ignored it as well.  
   
The President does not want to be in that category of how you approach
the separation of the White House and the Department of Justice.  And —
and he thinks that will even strengthen our systems as they’ve been
weakened over the last few years.   
   
Okay, thanks so much.  All right.   
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
All right, everybody.  See you tomorrow.  
   
4:02 P.M. EDT
