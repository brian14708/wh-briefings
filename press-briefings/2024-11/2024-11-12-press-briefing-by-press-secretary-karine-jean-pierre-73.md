James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:17 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everyone.  
  
Q    Good afternoon.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
  
So, this afternoon, President Biden welcomed the president of Indonesia
to the White House.  The two leaders commemorated 7- — 75 years of
diplomatic relations and discussed global challenges, including Gaza and
the South China Sea.  
  
As the world’s second- and third-largest democracies, the United States
and Indonesia share a commitment to addressing evolving challenges and
capitalizing on emerging opportunities.  
  
The leaders also discussed sustainable approaches to food security,
clean energy, democracy and pluralism, regional peace and stability, and
people-to-people ties, as well as advancing our cooperation in
humanitarian aid and disaster relief.  
  
And earlier today, President Biden also welcomed President Herzog of
Israel to the Oval Office.  You heard from the president himself: His
commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad, and our two countries share
a deep friendship.  
  
We will have a readout later today on their meeting.  
  
And with that, Will, you want to kick us off?  
  
Q    Terrific.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I have two questions.  Will President
Biden meet with President Xi during APEC or the G20?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have anything to share with you at this time. 
We certainly will have more to share on the details of his visit in — to
Peru and also Brazil.  As you all know, we’re leaving on Thursday. 
We’ll have more to share.  And as we normally do, we will have a press —
press calls for all of you to get some details on — on the trip — on the
— one of his final OCONUS trips, as you all know.  
  
But I don’t have anything to share on — on a phone call with President
Xi or a meeting with President Xi.  
  
Q    Okay.  On another topic, why does President Biden feel compelled to
— to invite President-elect Trump to the White House and continue a
tradition that —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
  
Q    — wasn’t followed four years ago?  Is it possible that the politics
in this country have sort of evolved past the norms?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, I — that’s an easy question to answer,
honestly, when it comes to why President Biden is doing this: because he
believes in the norms, he believes in our institution, he believes in
the peaceful transfer of power.   
   
You s- — you heard him speak to this directly just last week when he was
in the Rose Garden two days after the American people made the — their
decision on this election.  And it is important to him.   
  
It is important not just because it’s important to him, but it’s
important to the American people.  He said the American people deserve
this.  They deserve a peaceful transfer of power.  They deserve a smooth
trans- — transition.  And that’s what you’re going to see.  
  
He reached out to President-elect Trump and asked for a meeting for —
for them to meet in the Oval Office.  You’re going to see that
tomorrow.  That is what is the norm.  That is what is supposed to
happen.  And, also, that’s what the American people deserve.  
  
Go ahead, Karen.  
  
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thirty days ago, the administration put a timeline
on Israel to get more aid into Gaza.  Yesterday, Secretary Blinken met
with Israel’s minister of strategic affairs to talk about the steps that
Israel has taken to improve the situation inside Gaza.   
   
But today, there are multiple international aid agencies that say that
Israel has failed to address the concerns and that the situation is even
more dire than a month ago.  Does the administration think that Israel
has taken enough steps, or do you agree with these aid organizations and
their assessments?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  Let me just take a look back
at the last 30 days.  Israel has taken steps to address the measures
laid out in the — in that letter from the two secretaries — Secretaries
Bli- — Blinken and — and, also, Austin — and we are in a discussion with
the Israelis about both the important steps Israel has taken as a result
of the United States’ intervention, as well as additional steps that
needed — need to be taken.  
  
So, those conversations continue.  Those discussions continue.  And we —
the United States is indeed the largest provider of humanitarian
<s>assistant</s> \[assistance\] to the Palestinian people.  
  
And so, we wa- – – we are going to continue to do everything that we can
to surge humanitarian assis- — assistance in Gaza.  We understand how
important it is.  And to your — in your question, we understand how dire
that is.   
   
So, ultimately, the long-term solution here to alleviate the suffering
of the Palestinian people in Gaza is bringing an end to this war.  And
so, we’re going to try and work very hard to continuing — to achieving,
certainly, that goal.  
  
And so, that is certainly continuing to be a priority for us as we talk
about what’s happening in the region.  
  
Q    Is the administration, is the president satisfied with those steps,
though, that Israel has taken over these past 30 days?   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I —  
  
Q    Is it enough?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I did say that they have taken steps, and those
discussions continue, because we need more.  We certainly need more aid
to — to be surged into — into Gaza.  
  
So, there’s more work to be done.  But we have seen, certainly, some
improvement.  And, again, we are going to do everything that we can —
the United States.  We are, indeed, the largest provider of humanitarian
aid, humanitarian assistance into Gaza to relieve the pain of the
Palestinian people and what we’re seeing.  And you’re right, it is dire,
but those discussions continue.  And we’re going to be laser focused on
that.  
  
Q    And if I could just do one more on the meeting tomorrow.  Can you
just tell us: What are the top issues that the president is bringing to
the agenda tomorrow, how long you anticipate the meeting lasting?  Is he
having senior staff there?  Like, what — what’s this going to look like
tomorrow?  
      
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, President-elect Trump is coming to the White
House because the president invited him as part of this transfer —
peaceful transfer of power.  There’s going to be a pool spray at the top
in the Oval Office before the meeting commences.  And so, you all and
some of your colleagues will certainly have an opportunity to hear from
— or to — to see that, to — to see the two of them sitting down
together.  
  
I don’t have anything beyond that.  I don’t have an agenda to share. 
It’s a — you know, we try to keep these — certainly, these types of
priv- — conversations private.  And just don’t have anything beyond that
to share.  
  
This is part of the process.  When we talk about peaceful transfer of
power, this is what you’re seeing.  It’s kind of the beginning of that —
when you see the current president and the president who’s coming in
sitting down in the Oval Office and having a discussion.   
  
Don’t have any details to share at this time.  
  
Go ahead.  
  
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Can you confirm whether or not Mrs. Trump has
accepted Dr. Biden’s invitation to come to the White House as well?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have any updates — or we don’t have any
scheduling updates to give.  I would certainly reach out to the Trump
transition team to get more clarity on that — on that question.  
  
I just don’t have anything to share at this time.  
  
Q    Okay.  And can you say whether President Biden is pleased with how
the transition is going so far?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, what the president is committed to doing
is making sure that this transition is effective, efficient.  And he’s
doing that because it is the norm, yes, but also the right thing to do
for the American people.  That’s what they deserve.   
   
We’re going to have a meeting tomorrow — they’re going to have a meeting
tomorrow.  And certainly, that will continue.  As you know, Chief of
Staff Jeff Zients has been pretty — pretty open and available to the
Trump transition team and will continue to do so.   
   
We want this to go well.  We want this to — to be — to be a process that
gets the job done, if you will.  And so, look, it’s — it’s certainly —
we’re going to do everything that we can.  The president trusts his team
to get that done and — and do it the best way possible.  And that is our
commitment.   
   
Q    And then —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s what I can speak to.  
   
Q    — just lastly, are there areas that this White House or — or
President Biden’s administration are trying to shore up or protect from
a Trump administration perhaps trying to push back or — or pull back on
some of the legislative and other executive order and other gains that —
that the president is proud of?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, no, I — I appreciate the question.  Certainly
don’t have any policy announcements or anything like that to speak to.  
   
What I can say more broadly, if you — if you will, is say that, look,
more — more broadly, the president’s legislation is helping all
Americans across the country.  And what we would say is that we saw what
happened when Republicans in Congress tried to repeal, for example, the
ACA, Affordable Care Act.  They tried to do it more than 50 times.  It
was something that they were so laser-focused on.   
   
And meanwhile, the ACA — the Affordable Care Act — was incredibly
popular — became more and more popular. And under this administration,
we expanded the Affordable Care Act so that more — millions more
Americans could get that benefit, get that care that they so much — so
very much needed.  
   
And so — and we can’t forget that if you think about beating Big Pharma,
if you think about lowering costs, if you think about CHIPS and Science
Act, those policies are overwhelmingly popular.   
   
And so, I think if they were to try to do that — Republicans in Congress
would try to do that in the next Congress, the country would speak out. 
They would make themselves ver- — speak out really loud and clear about
taking away legislation, obviously, that are now laws that are helping
the American people.  
   
Whether it’s creating good-paying jobs; whether it is attacking climate
change in a way that is going to be effective — the most progressive
climate change legislation that the president was able to get done;
making sure that Medicare is able to negotiate to lower costs — all
these things matter to the American people — are incredibly popular.  
   
And they’ve tried to — to repeal that and go after that.  I think the
American people have something to say about it.   
   
Go ahead, M.J.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Just one more on tomorrow.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.  
   
Q    Do you know if President Biden has a message that he would like to
convey either to the former president or the American people, just given
the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — unique setting we’re talking about?   
   
And just in terms of the choreography tomorrow —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — do you know if the former president will go to the sticks?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Will he be free to roam?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  So, I would leave it to — (laughs) — “free
to roam.”  I would leave it, certainly, to Trump’s transition on
whatever engagement that he’ll have with all of you.  I — I — you know,
that’s up to — certainly up to — up to him.  
   
And — and I do appreciate the question, because he has a very clear
message to the American people.  And not to sound like a broken record,
but this is indeed true.  He wants to show the American people that the
system works — right? — to st- –to trust on the institution; to trust
that the norms are — do matter here; to trust that he is showing, by
leadership, what a transition — a peaceful transition looks like — an
efficient — hopefully an efficient, effective transition looks like, a
smooth transition looks like.  And that is the message.   
   
When you all — when — when you all come in, when the pool comes in
tomorrow and does a pool spray, that’s what they’re going to see,
right?  They’re going to see these two — one president-elect and the
current president sitting down and doing what is the norm.   
   
And that — if you know Joe Biden — right? — if you know Joe Biden from
following him in the Senate and — and as vice president, certainly the
last almost four years, he cares about that.  He cares about our
democracy.  And that’s the message that he hopes resonates with the
American people tomorrow.  
   
Q    And separately, the families of the American hostages are in
town.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Should they, at this point, have any reason to hope that their
loved ones will be released before the president’s term is up?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, the president is committed to continuing to do
the work to get families home, to get all of the — I’m sorry, “families”
— the hostages home, including American hostages, obviously — all of the
hostages.  And that is his commitment to the families.  
   
As — as you just stated, the families are here.  They met with National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan this afternoon.  They’ve had regular
engagement and meetings with Jake Sullivan but also many other members
of the team here.  And, you know, we’re going to continue to work — do
the work to get the deal done.  
   
And, if anything, there’s more to — there’s more of an imperative to get
that done, right?  We want to make sure that we get them — get their
fam- — their — get their loved ones home.  And so, that is our
commitment.  It doesn’t change at all.  If — we are continuing to be
eager to get that done and working around the clock, as we have for this
past more than a year now — more than 400 days.   
   
And so, it doesn’t stop our commitment.  It doesn’t stop us from trying
to get that done.  
   
Q    And y- — you said he’s committed to doing the work and, you know
—  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Continuing to do the work, yeah.  
   
Q    — and the White House is working around the clock.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    What does “doing the work” right now look like?  What is “working
around the clock”?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Trying to find ways that we can get to a deal, right? 
As you know, Qatar is very much involved.  Egypt is very much involved. 
They’re doing their part of the negotiations.  And we want to pursue —
and we believe there’s a number of ways, a numbers of init- —
initiatives to secure that hostage deal, to release those hostages.  And
we’re going to work through it.  We’re going to do that work.  
   
And that’s what we can say is our commitment and will continue — has
been our commitment and continue to do so.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Francesca.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I know you don’t want to get too far ahead of the
conversation, but I did want to point to something that Jake Sullivan
said over the weekend.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    He said that President Biden would “have the opportunity over the
next 70 days to make the case to Congress and the incoming
administration that the United States should not walk away from
Ukraine.”  So, is foreign policy going to be on the agenda for
tomorrow?  Ukraine, specifically?  Israel’s war with Hamas?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into the details of what’s going
to be discussed tomorrow.  That’s not something I’m going to get into
here.  But, look, you heard from the national security advisor, Jake
Sullivan, our commitment to Ukraine.  I mean, that is something that we
have showed for almost — what? — three years since the — Russia’s
aggression into Ukraine.  
   
And you saw the president’s leadership — global leadership on this, when
you think about making NATO stronger, when you think about the partners
and the alliances that he’s been able to bring together.  More than 50
countries have gotten behind Ukraine.  And continuing — we talked about
this on September 29th when we w- — talked about surging aid into a —
security assistance aid into — for Ukraine so that they are able to beat
back Russia’s aggression.  
  
So, you’ve seen our commitment.  We’ve been very clear.  We don’t even
need to say that privately because we’ve been very public about that.   
  
And getting to — just went back and forth about making sure that we get
a hostage deal and — so that we can get hostages home — all hostages
home who have been held by Hamas.  
  
And let’s not forget Lebanon.  We want to make sure that we get to a
deal there too.  And we’re negotiating there — that negotia- — those
negotiations continue.   
  
And so, our commitment has been very clear.  And our global leadership,
this president’s global leadership has also been very — very prominent,
if you will, on the global stage.  
  
Q    And does the White House have any concerns about the number of
foreign leaders who have been in conversation with the incoming
president, even as President Biden heads to the G20 in the next few
days, as well as Lima?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, here’s the thing, he’s the president-elect.  Every
president-elect receives calls from world leaders, takes calls from
world leaders, has calls from world leaders.  It is not unusual.  
  
I don’t have a comment beyond that.  Any specifics or details, that’s
something for the Trump — Trump transition  
to speak to.  
  
Go ahead, Will.  
  
Q    Just briefly, a follow-up.  Is the president — is he receptive of
what the Israelis are doing to push humanitarian aid, or is he happy
with what they’re doing now?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I mean, there’s no — I don’t have a different
answer for you to what I was asked by Karen.  We are having those
discussions.  We’ve seen some improvement over the last 30 days.  We
want to see more, because there are dire — there is a dire situation
happening in Gaza.  Also, the U.S. has been leading in getting
humanitarian aid.  
  
And so, those discussions continue.  We want to see more, and we’re
going to continue to have those discussions.  
  
Q    And just briefly, on Haiti.  With the situation there, do you have
any statement or reaction to what’s going on there with the violence and
those being — being targeted (inaudible)?   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, look, we’re certainly — as it relates to
the commercial flight very recently, the gun — the gun shots that were
reported — so, we’re certainly concerned about the increase of violence
in Haiti.   
  
And as it relates to commercial flights and what occurred there, the
airport, Toussaint Louverture Airport, is — operations are temporary
close until November 18th.  And so, certainly, the airlines could speak
more to that.  
  
But we are definitely certainly concerned by the increase of violence. 
And we’ll continue to work with — as you know, there’s a — a new prime
minister that was named and recognized by the — the TPC, the Trans- —
Transitional Presidential Council.  And so — and so, we’re going to
continue to — to work with them and — and, hopefully, we can get to a
better place.  
  
Q    Thank you.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Peter.  
  
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Did President Biden invite Vice President
Harris to this meeting with Donald Trump tomorrow?  
      
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This is a meeting with the — with the president and
the president-elect.  This is the norm — that the incoming president and
the current president sit down in the Oval Office and have a
discussion.  And that’s how — that’s what you’re going to see tomorrow —
is the norm — what we — what we normally would see when we are talking
about a peaceful transition of power.  
  
Q    President Biden says that he’s not going to pardon his son Hunter. 
Is he going to ask Donald Trump to do that?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything else to share about that.  I’m
not going to get — go down a rabbit hole on this.  
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ve been very clear, the president has been very
clear when we’ve been asked this question.  
  
Q    And we know that at some point during the last Trump transition,
then-President Obama warned Trump that the biggest threat to the U.S. at
the time was North Korea.  Is President Biden going to run through what
he sees the biggest threats to the country are with Donald Trump?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I am not going to get into a specific agenda of what
they’re going to discuss.  And this is very much, too, the question that
I got from M.J.: What does the president want to — what’s the message he
wants to send tomorrow?  And it is to the American people — the
importance — the importance of keeping the norms, the importance of
having a transition that is going to be efficient.  This is what the
American people deserve, and that’s the message.  
  
And I think when, you know, you all come into the Oval Office tomorrow,
you do the pool spray, you capture that moment, that is an important
message to send to the American people. That’s what the president cares
about.  
  
I’m not going to get into details about any conversation or agenda.  
  
Q    And we know that today, a week after the election, President Biden
and Vice President Harris had a private lunch.  How awkward was that?   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t even understand.  Why would it — why would it
be awkward?  
  
Q    Because the president got squeezed out —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Why would it be awk- — why would you —  
  
Q    — for her and then she kept him at arm’s length and then she lost,
and now she’s back.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But why would — why would you characterize it as
awkward?  They have regular lunches.  They meet and talk regularly.  Why
would you call it awkward?  
  
Q    So, there’s no weirdness about the way that things have unfolded
since July 21st?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Did you see them — did you see them together yesterday
as well, when they honored our veterans and were together during the
day, making sure that we didn’t forget the brave men and women that
fought for this country?  Did you see them together yesterday?  Did you
see the — the show of force together?  
  
This is — look, I’m not even going to take the premise of this — the
question.  What I will say is the president and the vice president had
lunch today.  They’ve had lunch many times.  They have — they
communicate with each other regularly.  They had an opportunity to
discuss the last 70 days or so of this administration, how important it
is to get things done for the American people, and that’s their focus. 
That is genuinely their focus.  
  
Go ahead, Patsy.  
  
Q    Thank you, Karine.  On his spray with President  
Prabowo, the president said that he would discuss the issue of South
China Sea —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
  
Q    — and advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Was he specifically
referring to a deal that Indonesia signed a few days ago in Beijing that
could be read as a de facto validation of China’s nine-dash line that
marks its extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea?  And how
concerned is the administration about this?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we continue to encourage Indonesia to work with
their legal experts to make sure any agreement they make with the PRC is
in a- — is in according with international law, especially the U.N.
Convention on the Law of — of the Sea.  
  
I don’t have anything beyond that.  I read out at the top, more broadly,
what — what they were hoping to accomplish, what they were going to talk
about.   
   
You just mentioned Indo-Pacific and China Sea.  As it relates to this
particular deal that was signed with Indonesia and Beijing, we are just
going to continue to encourage that — that they focu- — that they really
work with their legal experts.   
   
Q    So, is that a statement that the administration believes that
Indonesia is not complying, that the agreement —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything beyond that.  I don’t have any
beyond that.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then — and I know that you said on your topper that
there will be more briefing before the president leaves for APEC and
G20.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Yeah.  We’ll have our usual, like we normally do —  
   
Q    Right.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — ahead of an OCONUS trip.  We’ll have a — a press — a
press call so you all will have more details on what those few days will
look like abroad.  
   
Q    But just — just broadly, Karine, what would be his message,
obviously, to leaders concerned about U.S. positions on various global
issues?   
   
And is — is he expecting that his conversation with President-elect
Trump tomorrow to inform him on how he would speak to world leaders
about these various issues?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m not going to get into details.  I
understand the — the curiosity and the kind of excitement on what’s
going to happen tomorrow.   
   
I don’t want to get ahead of the fact that tomorrow is also part of the
process that the president wants to send out to the American people
having a peaceful transition of power.   
   
Not going to get into details or even an agenda of what they’re going to
speak to.  
   
As it relates to the president and the global stage, that’s what you’re
going to see when he is in Peru and Braz- — and Brazil: the president
again on that global stage.   
   
He’s going to continue to talk about and focus on the progress we’ve
made in the last three years — three years plus — on an array of
important issues that matter to the people who will be there, to all the
world leaders who will be there, whether that’s continuing to strengthen
our alliances and partnerships, standing with Ukraine and standing up
against Putin, and also, as you — as we were talking about, a range of
issues when it relates to the Indo- — from Indo-Pacific to also the
Middle East.   
   
That’s what the president is going to focus on.  And — and I’m going to
let the two leaders, the president and the president-elect, have their
private conversation.  Not going to get ahead of them.  They deserve
that.   
   
But certainly, we are — we are indeed sending a message to the American
people.  That’s what they deserve.  They deserve this process, and
that’s what you’re going to see tomorrow.  
   
Q    And just briefly on Francesca’s question, just to hone in.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    I know that you say that the president-elect can have these
conversations with these world leaders who call and congratulate him.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s — it’s not unusual.    
   
Q    But —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it’s not unusual.  
   
Q    But does the president have specific views on the president-elect
potentially conducting foreign policy on these calls?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into hypotheticals — I’m — I’m
just not — on what’s happening or being said on these calls.  I’m just
not.  
   
It is not unusual for a president-elect to have conversations with world
leaders.  That’s what’s happening.  I’m just not going to get
hypotheticals.   
   
Go ahead, Gabe.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  You mentioned a little bit ago that several
countries were still working together to secure a ceasefire deal, and
you mentioned Qatar and Egypt.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Didn’t Qatar pull out of mediation — its mediation role over the
weekend?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  And I will — I appreciate that.  I will let
Qatar speak to their own — their own decision.  I’m not going to — to
certainly speak to that, and I’m not going to get into any other private
conversation.   
   
What I said is that — what I’m trying to convey is that we’re going to
continue to pursue, certainly, a number of initiatives to get the
hostages home to their families.  That is an ongoing work in progress,
if you will.  And that’s going to be our focus.   
   
Q    But doesn’t that change that — Qatar pulling out of that mediation
role, doesn’t that signify that these hostage talks are very far off?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And so, look, Qatar is going to have to speak to
whatever decision that they’re made — they made.  I’m not going to speak
to that.  I’m not going to get into private conversation.   
   
What I’m trying to say is we’re going to continue to pursue a number of
initiatives, continue those conversations on how to make sure we secure
the release of hostages.  That is ongoing.  That is certainly ongoing.  
   
And so, not going to — you know, we’re very careful.  We don’t negotiate
from here.  Not going to negotiate from the podium.  But certainly, the
work is ongoing.   
   
Q    And back to the humanitarian aid in Gaza that you discussed
earlier.  That was a U.S. deadline that was a month ago.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    You said that Israel has taken some steps, but among those steps
are the U.S. had asked for 350 humanitarian aid trucks a day.  We’re
nowhere near that point.  Is the U.S. essentially giving Israel a pass
when it comes to humanitarian aid?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, absolutely not.  I mean, we’re — that’s why the
cont- — the conversations continue and the discussions continue.   
   
We have seen — we have seen Israel take some steps to address the
measures of — of getting the measures laid out that were in the letter. 
We have seen that.  
   
Q    But is that acceptable?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   We want to see more.  That — that’s what we want to
see.  That’s why those discussions continue.  The — just because we hit
the 30-day mark doesn’t mean that we go home and don’t finish what we
are trying to do here, which is getting and surging more aid to the
Pale- — Palestinian people.  We understand how important it is.  We
understand how dire the situation is, and that’s what we’re going to
continue to do.  
   
And at the same time — and you’ve heard us say this — the best way to
deal with this, the best way to — to alleviate the suffering that we’re
seeing of the Palestinian people in Gaza is to get to a deal here, and
we’re going to continue to be laser focused on that.   
   
Q    And finally, has J.D. Vance been issued an invitation to the White
House either tomorrow or in the future?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would have to refer you to the vice president’s
office, I think.  We don’t have anything for you at this time, but the
vice president’s office can speak to that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
AIDE:  Karine, we have time for one more.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You said shortly after the election that one of the
priorities for the president legislatively was going to be about judges
and judicial nominations.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Can you talk about how you’re preparing for Congress to return and
then these next couple weeks as you try and make your final imprint on
the courts?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, I will say that’s something that we’ve been
doing throughout the almost four years is push — is making sure that
these qualified judges get through.   
   
And so, there’s — there’s really nothing new to the process.  It’s just
a continued focus that we want to make sure — in the next 70 days or
less now, that we want to make sure that happens.   
   
And it’s important to the American people.  And this is not a partisan
issue.  This is bipartisan.  And we have seen this with — in other —
this type of period of time, in other transition period, if you will,
where — where the sitting president has been able to get some judicial
judges go through, and that’s what we want to see Congress.  We want to
see Republicans and Democrats come together, as they have, to get these
key judges through.   
   
Let’s not forget, we’re talking about what’s right for the American
people.  We don’t want to see, you know, backlogs, if you will, when it
comes to getting criminal cases through.  This is the norm.  This is
part of what we’ve seen in the past when we’re talking about a
transition period.   
  
So, we’re continuing to do that work.  There’s nothing new.  We just are
— we want to make sure that work continues.   
  
Q    Do you have a — a point when you expect to make your final
nominations?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have anything specific for you.  I’m sure
that we can talk to the Office of Leg Affairs on anything more specific
on a timeline.  But this is one of our priorities that we want to make
sure that we get done for the American people.   
  
Go ahead, Brian.  
  
Q    Thank you.  
  
Q    Thanks a lot.  President Trump has promised to launch the largest
deportation in American history when he — he becomes president.  Are
there steps that President Biden is taking in the next 70 days to try to
protect certain populations in the United States from deportation?  Does
he want to extend parole or take other steps that would protect people
from that deportation program?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, don’t have any — any new policies to — to announce
at this time.  And I want to be careful.  Like, I don’t want to get into
hypotheticals on what the next administration is going to do or not do. 
That’s not something that I’m going to try to address from here.  It is
not something that we will be addressing from here.   
  
What I can speak to is what the president has done over the past almost
four years in dealing with a broken system — a broken immigration system
that has been broken for decades now and trying to work with Congress on
doing that.   
  
And as you know, there was a — a bipartisan deal that came about from
the Senate that Republicans and Democrat — obviously, bipartisan, as I
just stated — worked on.  And, you know, we, of course, would love to
see that go through.  We would love to see that happen.   
  
The president was ready to go, and they — Republicans were told not to
move forward because it would help Joe Biden, which is really
unfortunate, because it would have dealt with this broken system that we
have.  It would have dealt with the challenges that the Border Patrol
agents were facing at the border.   
  
That is something that would be great to get done.  But I — beyond that,
I don’t have anything to share — beyond that.  
  
Go ahead, Skylar.   
  
Q    Thanks, Karine.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to start wrapping this up.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  President-elect Trump — there’s reports that Elon
Musk is having a lot of sway in terms of his decisions, in terms of who
President-elect Trump is, you know, having come into his administration,
sitting in on meetings with — with foreign leaders.   
  
And Elon Musk has said — you know, there’s reports that he wants to sort
of reshape, maybe, the government.  Is President Biden concerned at all
over Elon Musk’s influence —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
  
Q    — over President-elect Trump and potentially what that could look
like for the country?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That is — that is for the president-elect to ma- — to
decide on.  I’m not — I’m not going to comment on personnel decision or
personnel choices that the transition announces or is being reported or
what’s happening in that world.  It is not for us to speak to.  
  
The president is going to focus on the next 70 days and what’s at hand,
focus on the American people, focus on making sure that we have a
process — a transition process that’s orderly.  And that’s what we are —
want to make sure that we keep our promise — right? — that democratic —
those demo- — honoring our democratic principles.  
  
What the president-elect does and speaks — who he speaks to and how he
wants to think and envision his administration, that’s up to him.   
  
Q    And just one more.  Kind of quickly shifting gears here.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
  
Q    But President Biden — you know, is it still the plan to travel to
Africa at the top of December?   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
  
Q    Is that still on the agenda?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s still on the agenda.  As I mentioned, I think
from here at the podium, behind the lectern, when we had to pull that
trip down and reschedule it, obviously, because of what was happening
here domestically with a historic hurricane, we had said that the
president would go the — the first week of December.  That still is the
case.  The president is very much looking forward to visiting the
continent, visiting Angola.   
  
When we have more to share, we certainly will share that.  We have an
OCONUS coming up, so we got to do this — one OCONUS at a time, if you
will.  And we certainly will have more to share.   
  
Go ahead.  
  
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Could you talk about what are the key goals
this administration would like to achieve in terms of the U.S.-China
relations, as you have invested significantly into this relationship? 
So, what do you like to achieve before you’re handing over to the next
administration?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I appreciate the question.  If you indulge me a
little bit, because I think this is important — so, the president, as
you know, has prioritized investments in — in sources of U.S. strength
at home, strengthening our alliances abroad, and taking commonsense
measures to protect U.S. technology and also national security.   
  
So, when he came into the office nearly four years ago, this president
made it clear that the U.S. was going to advance and protect our
interests here at home and also, obviously, abroad.  And the framework
of this administration’s China policy — which is “invest, align,
compete” — has remained constant for over those almost four years.   
  
And so — but at the same time, the president has also been very honest
and has emphasized the importance of responsibil- — responsibly managing
the U.S.-China relationship.   
  
So, that’s also include opening lines of — of communications,
cooperations in areas of — of shared interest, hence the important bilat
— right? — that he had with the Indonesian leader.   
  
And so, he’s going to continue to advance the U.S. interests when it
comes to engagement with the PRC, just as he’s done for the last four
years.  So, that continues over the next several — several weeks, couple
of months.   
  
And so, I would say: Stay tuned.  See — see how it goes.   
  
Q    Does the president feel urgency or importance to meet President Xi
in person before his term is over?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any- — anything to share about a meeting
or a phone call.  I — I just laid out the importance of the U.S.-China
relationship.  What we’ve been able to do the last four years, that’s
certainly going to continue.  And — and if we have more to share on a
possible meeting or, certainly, a phone call, we would certainly do that
— share with that — with all of you.  
  
Q    So, quickly, why the phone call hasn’t happened since Jake Sullivan
previewed it two months ago?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, you know, things like this take some time.  I
just don’t have anything to share with all of you.  But I think we’ve —
we’ve been — we’ve been pretty — you’ve seen that relationship and how
that’s developed, how the president approached the U.S.-China
relationship.   
  
And that invest, that align, that compete — the three things that I
mentioned to you — is certainly going to continue.  You’ve seen that the
last four years.  And if we have more to share, we certainly will do
that.  
   
Thanks, everybody.  I’ll see you tomorrow.
