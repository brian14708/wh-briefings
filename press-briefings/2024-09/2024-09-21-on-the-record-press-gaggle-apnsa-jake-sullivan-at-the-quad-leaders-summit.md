8:50 A.M. EDT  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you, guys, for being here.  Today, we have the
fourth Quad Leaders Summit, fourth in-person Quad Leaders Summit, and
the first time that President Biden has actually hosted leaders in his
hometown and, literally, at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.   
   
You guys have heard the President say many times that all politics is
personal, all diplomacy is personal.  And developing personal
relationships has been core to his approach to foreign policy as
President.  
   
So, opening his home to the leaders of India, Japan, and Australia is a
way of him showing, not just saying, that these leaders matter to him,
that the Quad matters to him as a significant foreign policy priority. 
And institutionalizing and deepening and elevating the Quad has been one
of the things that he’s going to be very proud of when he leaves office
and passes the baton to the next President of the United States.  
   
When President Biden came in, within the early months, he held a Quad —
a virtual summit, and it was the first time the leaders of the Quad had
actually met in any format.  And what the President wanted to do was not
just have this be something where leaders convened occasionally, but
actually a vehicle for driving deepening cooperation and integration
across the region.   
   
And so, if you look at the last three and a half years, whether it’s on
the response to COVID-19 or humanitarian response across the region, or
issues like cyber and cyber capacity-building across the region, there’s
a range of significant achievements the Quad has already had.  And
today, the Quad leaders will announce a number of further steps
forward.   
   
There’ll be the announcement of the Quad Cancer Moonshot, which we’re
very excited about, with all four countries coming to the table with
resources and capacities to help drive towards the cures to deadly
cancers.  And there’ll be more to say on that later today.  
   
There’s the expansion of the Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness
Initiative, which is a mouthful, but is really about integrating new
technologies and new capabilities, not just for Quad members, but for
countries in Southeast Asia and the rest of the region, for them to
understand their maritime domains so they can better manage and regulate
them and ensure their security and also ensure that they are delivering
economic benefits to the people of the relevant countries.   
   
There will be — we’ll have an announcement of the expansion of the Quad
fellows, which will now not just be fellows from the four countries, but
fellows from Southeast Asia as well.  
   
We’ll announce the pre-positioning of relief supplies across the region
and the ability for Quad countries to react more rapidly in the case of
humanitarian crises and natural disasters.  
   
And the Quad will announce its first-ever coast guard mission together
as well, which will show the joint capabilities of the four countries in
terms of their ability — in terms of their coast guards.   
   
So, there’s a number of other things that you’ll see in the fact sheet
as well, but this just shows the breadth and range of ways in which the
Quad is becoming a feature of the architecture of the Indo-Pacific.  And
we hope and expect that that will deepen in the years ahead.   
   
And the reason I think we can have some confidence in that is there’s
genuine bipartisan support for the Quad.  It’s something that really
transcends party lines.  And, in fact, over the last 24 hours, we’ve had
the announcement of a bipartisan, bicameral Quad Caucus, something I
never quite thought I would see, but Republicans and Democrats in both
the House and the Senate actually standing up a caucus to support this,
this platform, because of the importance that Congress places on it and
what it can deliver.   
   
The last thing I would say is that when you look at the Quad and AUKUS
and the Camp David trilateral and our engagement with the Pacific
Islands in ASEAN, one thing that has been a hallmark of the President’s
foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific has been to move from the traditional
hub-and-spoke model, rooted largely in bilateral alliances and bilateral
partnerships, to a latticework approach with multiple institutions,
overlapping partnerships, different configurations that all add up to
genuinely new architecture for the Indo-Pacific, and the Quad is a
critical part of that.   
   
And I think it leaves the United States in a stronger position, with a
more dense and capable and dynamic set of partnerships, and with
relationships not just between us and our partners, but among our
partners, that allow us to deliver greater results and achieve more
stability and security and drive towards the ultimate objective, which
is a free and open Indo-Pacific.   
   
So let me stop there, and happy to take your questions.   
   
Q    Jake, just (inaudible), you didn’t mention China directly in the
joint leaders’ statement.  What sort of language should we expect
directed at the PRC?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The Quad isn’t really about any other country.  It’s not
directed at another country.  It’s directed at problem solving and
standing up for a set of common principles and a common vision for the
region.   
   
So, I don’t think you should expect to see a focus on any particular
country, including the PRC, in the Quad leaders’ statement.  That’s been
the pattern since the beginning, because the nature and purpose of this
institution is really about the kinds of things I just described.  It’s
about delivering vaccines, delivering cyber capacity, delivering coast
guard capacity, delivering humanitarian assistance, delivering science
and technology progress.  So that’s what we’re going to continue to
focus on, and that’s what you’ll see in the fact sheet — the joint
leaders’ statement.   
   
Q    But, Jake, as you add more security features to this partnership,
you know, is there a risk, a possibility that China, which has already
expressed concerns about encirclement related to the Quad, begins to
have objections to this cooperation?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, I’ll let the PRC speak for itself, and obviously it
does speak for itself about a number of different initiatives the United
States has taken in the Indo-Pacific.  We’re just going to prove year on
year everything that I just said, which is really that the thrust and
purpose of the institution writ large and the security features of it
are about a positive agenda to enhance security, not just for Quad
countries but for other regional partners.   
   
So, it’s hard for me to see how and why the PRC should object to the
four countries, for example, doing a coast guard mission together, or
doing cyber trainings for Southeast Asia together, or taking steps with
respect to maritime domain awareness.  These do not, to me, indicate any
form of aggression or assertive behavior.  They’re fundamentally
constructive and positive, and that’s where we’re going to continue to
position the Quad.   
   
Q    Can you speak a little bit to the President’s meeting with Prime
Minister Modi and what, if anything, he’ll say about what he wants to do
vis-à-vis China and Russia (inaudible)?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I won’t go too deep into the details of what he will say
on those issues, which are obviously sensitive and will obviously be
critical priorities in the bilateral meeting.   
   
I will just say this: that the United States has been clear about our
view that Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine flouted
every norm and principle of international law, that countries like India
should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and that every country everywhere should refrain from
supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine for it to be able to continue
to prosecute this brutal war.  So they will talk about that.   
   
The President will also hear from Prime Minister Modi about his trip to
Ukraine, which was an important and indeed historic trip, and it will be
the opportunity for the two of them to talk about their respective views
of the way forward.  
   
And then, with respect to China, you know, they will talk about how they
see China’s actions in the region, where China is headed.  And that’s
not just true in the security domain, but the economic and technology
domain as well.  And we’ll work to try to coordinate approaches to the
extent that that makes sense for both countries.  
   
Q    In the past month or so, there’s been a lot of (inaudible) China
(inaudible).  There’s been lots of (inaudible) still in the offing.  Can
you speak to, like, how the President himself is reviewing the
culmination, I guess, of the administration’s China strategy leading up
to this?  And should we consider this Quad sort of part of that puzzle,
(inaudible)?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think you should consider this Quad and all of our
other actions part of an effort to strengthen the capacity of the United
States to defend our interests, support our allies and partners, advance
problem solving on critical common challenges, and generally put ourself
in a more robust, competitive position writ large.  
   
But I don’t think you should see it again as being directed at China. 
And I think this is American foreign policy, in a way at its historic
best, which innovation partnerships designed to enhance stability,
designed to deliver results, and connected to other partnerships that
are going the same thing.  
   
And I think, kind of, over-cranking the emphasis on any one country is
missing what I think the central thrust and purpose of these kinds of
institutions, including the Quad, are all about.  
   
Q    You mentioned at the top the personal nature of this visit.  And
the White House is using the terminology “personal meeting” rather than
the usual “bilateral meeting.”  Can you give us a sense of how these
meetings are different, what we might expect?  For example, Prime
Minister Albanese yesterday, did he get a tour of the house?  See the
Corvette?  Were there family members present?  Can you can you give us a
flavor of that?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  He did get a bit of a tour of the house.  I don’t think
he saw the Corvette, though.  I can’t confirm that for sure, because the
two of them sort of went off by themselves for a bit, and I haven’t had
a chance to speak to the President about what exactly the Prime Minister
saw.   
   
There weren’t other family members there.  It was really a sort of
one-on-one opportunity for President Biden and the Prime Minister to sit
and talk.  And then, a few of us joined them, obviously, for part of the
meeting when it turned to substance.   
   
It was just — honestly, the vibe of it was sort of two guys, one at the
other guy’s home, talking in broad strokes about where they see the
state of the world, about — you know, swapping some stories from their
respective political careers, you know, talking about the history of the
U.S.-Australia alliance.   
   
It just kind of had a feeling like if you had someone come over for a
cup of coffee or a meal.  You know, that kind of feeling was much more
present than, like, a stiff bilateral.  And the President told
everybody, “Take off your jackets.  Get comfortable,” which we all
obliged.   
   
So, yeah, I’m very bad at answering questions like that, but that’s my
best shot at it.   
   
Q    Well, if I may, on Sudan, a United Nations panel of experts has
accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying arms to the RSF in breach
of the weapons embargo on Darfur.  MBZ, I guess, is coming to the White
House this week.  Will the President raise those allegations directly
with the leader of the United Arab Emirates?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ll let the President talk to Sheikh Mohamed privately
about Sudan.  I think it would be more effective to do that.   
   
What I will say is we are concerned about a number of countries and the
steps they are taking to perpetuate rather than resolve the conflict. 
And I will also say that Sudan will certainly be on the agenda, and the
President will be as direct and candid with Sheikh Mohamed as he is with
every leader.  And then, after the fact, we’ll share what we feel we
can.  
   
And the reason why I’m not, sort of, laying it out all in public right
now is: Our ultimate objective is to get the entire conflict in Sudan on
a different track than the tragic and horrific track it is on right
now.  And I think that requires some intense but sensitive diplomatic
conversations with a number of players.  That’s what the President is
intending to do writ large.  And as I said, Sudan will certainly be part
of the agenda with the UAE President on Monday.  
   
Q    Jake, so (inaudible) President will Japan Prime Minister Kishida. 
Do you expect him to talk about that deal between U.S. Steel and Japan
Nippon Steel?  And does (inaudible) oppose that deal and try to stop
it?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I cannot say yet whether that particular deal will come
up in the conversation today.  There are obviously huge priorities in
terms of current events and geopolitical trends and economic and
technology cooperation.  So, I’m not sure that it will come up.  And the
President has spoken to this issue before, but the matter really is, at
the moment, in a official process while the transaction is studied by
the relevant authorities and the relevant agencies, the U.S.
government.   
   
And so, you know, the President will obviously allow that process to run
its course because that’s what’s required under the law.  And then we
will see what happens.  
   
Q    Prime Minister Kishida will step down soon.  You going to talk
about his contribution, achievement, but what do you expect from the new
Japanese prime minister?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  One thing that I do expect, whoever the new Japanese
prime minister is, is continued investment in and support for the
U.S.-Japan alliance as the cornerstone peace of security in the
Indo-Pacific.  And I expect that because the overwhelming majority of
the Japanese people support that and because this alliance is bigger
than any one leader on either side, in Japan or the United States.   
   
So I have confidence that the strong bond and partnership between our
two countries will continue no matter who takes the helm, although I
will say Prime Minister Kishida should be saluted, and President Biden
will salute him, as a very significant contributor to the high-water
mark we’ve reached in the U.S.-Japan alliance at this point and in
Japan’s global leadership role.   
   
So, it will obviously be different because Prime Minister Kishida is a
unique individual, but one thing that we think will remain the same is
the strong alliance between the United States and Japan.  
   
Q    Just on the Nippon deal, very quickly: Some proponents of that deal
are interpreting last week’s extension as a sign that the President is
having second thoughts.  What would you say to them?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I can’t speak to that because I think nobody should
overread what happened last week as a substantive expression of views,
rather as a matter of process to ensure that the transaction gets the
full review that’s appropriate in a case like this, as I said, from the
relevant authorities and agencies.  And the President really does want
to let that play out.   
   
Q    You mentioned that it’s not about one country, but of course, China
comes to mind over time.  As just recently, they announced sanctions
against American companies.  They’re selling weapons to Taiwan.  Taiwan
is getting money from the United States to be able to defend
themselves.  And the incidents in the past few weeks in (inaudible) has
been escalating, not only with Taiwan with China, but also
Philippines.  
   
During this meeting, is that top of mind, or is this something that you
want to address?  Because, I mean, you mentioned the coast guard event
shouldn’t be questioned by the Chinese; it’s just an event that they’re
going to do as a group.  But from their point of view, they’re talking
about it and condemning these types of actions.  Should we worry about
China moving forward or being more aggressive as the world is focused on
Lebanon, the Middle East, Ukraine?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first of all, it’s true that the front pages of
newspapers are filled with stories about the Middle East rather than the
Indo-Pacific right now.  But the United States of America is focused in
both places.  And there’s probably no better proof point than the fact
that we’re sitting here right now, on a Quad Summit day, meeting with
leaders of the Indo-Pacific, even as we continue to closely monitor
events in the Middle East.  
   
So, if you look at the work that we have done over the last four years,
the intense engagement with allies and partners, the work on — this
latticework that I described, the efforts to strengthen our own
industrial and innovation base, the measures we’ve taken to protect our
sensitive technologies, we feel like we are in a very strong position to
stand up for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.  And obviously, we
are concerned about actions that China has taken, and we speak out about
those actions quite directly and candidly.   
   
But we are also putting the United States and our allies and partners in
a position to effectively defend our interests and to defend the rules
of the road that have kept the peace in the Indo-Pacific for a long
time.  We’re going to continue to do that.   
   
The other thing I would say is that each of the four members of the Quad
has their own approach to the PRC.  There’s not going to be some “Quad
approach” to the PRC.  But of course, in the course of the conversation
today, the four leaders will have the opportunity to talk about all of
the developments in the Indo-Pacific, and obviously the PRC is part of
that.   
   
So, it will be one of the issues or one of the topics that come up among
many.  
   
Q    If I may, on Venezuela — because Venezuela is close to China right
now, and it’s one of the allies, but also Russia and Iran.  So we know
four Americans are detained in the past few days.  The situation is
getting just harder and harder to get to an agreement.  We are expecting
a meeting at the United Nations to talk about Venezuela, led by Uruguay
and other countries.  Do you see any possibility of moving forward in
this subject?  We understand the U.S. have supported the talks.  Is it a
possibility to go back to Qatar?  Is Qatar in the table again?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We continue to talk to Qatar, who wants to play a
constructive role in engaging the Maduro regime, the opposition, the
United States, other players.  At the moment, there’s not much traction
on talks, and what we’re instead continuing to see are negative steps by
the Maduro regime in the aftermath of an election where we have been
very clear our judgment is that Edmundo Gonzalez received the most
votes.   
   
So, we’ll continue to work, particularly with countries in the region,
to try to develop a common approach forward to support democracy and a
democratic transition in Venezuela.  But I will say that at the moment
there is not a substantial diplomatic opportunity to make progress, and
we’re going to  
have to keep looking for one.  
   
Q    Jake, on the Middle East, the Lebanese are saying at least 31 were
killed in that bombing of a building that apparently targeted at least
one Hezbollah commander.  Has the U.S. figured out who exactly was
targeted and killed?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The Israelis have announced, and I believe Hezbollah
itself has confirmed, some of the people who were killed in that
strike.  And I will let Israel and Hezbollah speak to it, because
obviously we don’t have an independent capacity at this point to
confirm.  But I believe a fair amount of that is out in the public
domain at this point.  
   
Q    If at least one of those was one of those responsible for
organizing the barracks bombing back in the ‘80s, how significant would
that be that he’s now dead?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  That individual has American blood on his hands and has a
Rewards for Justice price on his head.  And he is somebody who the
United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see
brought to justice.   
   
And anytime a terrorist who has murdered Americans is brought to
justice, we believe that that is a good outcome.  But again, I’m not in
a position this morning, until I have the opportunity to talk again to
my Israeli counterparts today, to formally confirm anything; just to
say, you know, 1983 seems like a long time ago, but for a lot of
families, a lot of people, it was — they’re still living with it every
day.  
   
Q    One other.  Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich have been in
Washington in recent days, mostly to visit with lawmakers.  Is there any
plan for them to meet with the President?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I guess not.  The President met with both of them,
obviously, when they came back to the States.  So there wasn’t — we
didn’t have a plan for them to sit down this past week or this coming
week in Washington.  But, you know, I’m sure he would be happy to see
them again at some point.   
   
Q    There’s a report that I got (inaudible) disagree with about U.S.
officials conceding that there won’t be a deal during the President’s
term.  What is your assessment of that?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think that’s crazy.  I mean —  
   
Q    So, it was correct that you’d (inaudible).  (Laughter.) 
(Inaudible) disagree with it, that yes —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  This is not me sitting here saying, “Hey, there will be a
deal.”  One can’t know.  And I’ve — you’ve heard me repeatedly use this
George Mitchell line of “700 days of failure, one day of success.”  But
this is diplomacy.  Every day, you get up and you try to drive towards a
deal that brings about a ceasefire, the return of hostages, surge of
humanitarian assistance, and ultimately the end of the war.  We’re doing
that today.  We’re going to do that tomorrow.  We’re going to do that
every day.   
   
And I do still believe there is a path to get there.  It has been a
winding path, a frustrating path, but we are still on that path, and we
hope to reach the destination.  But we’re also mindful of the fact and
very clear-eyed about the fact that there’s still obstacles in the way;
we’re going to do our best to clear them.  And I can’t make any
predictions about what’s going to happen, but what I can certainly say
is we are not conceding that, period.  
   
Q    But we’ve been waiting a while in terms of a new bridging
proposal.  Is that right?  So when is — when do you expect to put that
on the table?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I can’t tell you that because we’re not at a point right
now where I can — where we’re prepared to put something on the table. 
We’re continuing to work with Qatar and Egypt.  They’re talking to
Hamas.  We’re talking to Israel.  The Qataris and Egyptians are talking
to Israel.  And when we feel ready to take another step, we’ll take
another step.   
   
Q    What’s the holdup?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, at the moment, we don’t feel like we’re in a
position, if we put something down today, to get both sides to say yes
to it.  Could that change over the course of the coming days?  It
could.  You know — yeah, I’ll leave it at that for now.  
   
Q    Jake, in terms of the events of last week in Lebanon, do you have
any assessments what that has done to the operational capabilities of
Hezbollah?  And what is your current level of concern that what you’ve
been trying to prevent the last, you know, 11-plus months could start
off as (inaudible)?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  It stands to reason that Lebanese Hezbollah’s
capabilities have taken a hit.  How significant a hit, how that
translates to their ability to represent a threat to Israel, I think we
still need some more assessment to reach more guidance on.  
   
The risk of escalation is real; it has been since October 7th.  There
are moments where it is more acute than others.  I think we are in one
of those moments where it is more acute.   
   
But I would take a step back and make an observation that I don’t think
gets sufficient attention in the reporting on this dynamic, which is
that Hezbollah started this whole thing.  Hamas attacks on October 7th,
this vicious massacre.  And then, as Nasrallah just said in his speech
this week, the way he put it, Nasrallah opened the Northern Front.   
   
Israel didn’t start just randomly attacking into Lebanon.  Hezbollah and
its allies in — its terrorist allies in Lebanon started attacking
Israel.  And tens of thousands of Israeli citizens had to leave their
homes.  That led to an exchange of fire, and then Lebanese citizens had
to leave their homes.  And we’ve been in that dynamic ever since.   
   
So, that’s an important structural factor that I think, kind of, gets
set aside in the commentary and the coverage of the current
circumstance.  
   
That being said, the United States’ position is we would like to see
calm on the northern border and a durable solution that allows the
people on both sides of that border to return to their homes.  We are
driving at that.  Amos Hochstein was recently back in the region to work
towards that.  I’ve spoken with my Israeli counterparts just in the last
couple of days to see how we find a way forward on that.   
   
And so, while the risk of escalation is real, we actually believe there
is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a
durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel
secure, and we’re going to do everything that we can to bring that
about.   
   
Q    And can I just (inaudible) — when you say the risk of escalation is
real, are you saying the IDF flattening tower blocks in Beirut is not an
escalation?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think the question he was asking — the heart of his
question was: could we get into a wider war that we have been trying to
avoid for the last 11 months.  I think that’s what the question was.  
   
Q    Then I’ll ask the question.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I was answering (inaudible).  
   
Q    I’ll ask the question then: Was the IDF strike an escalation, in
your view?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, when I talk about escalation, I mean where does
this take us from the point of view of, “Are we going to end up in a
wider war.”  We’re not there yet.  I hope we do not get there.   
   
When you pose a question, “Was this strike escalation?  Was that strike
escalation?” the United States is not going to score-keep like that. 
There’s a number of different ways to look at this strike.  The chief
way I personally look at it goes back to the discussion we were having
before, which is it was a strike against a senior terrorist who has both
Israeli and American lives on his hands.   
   
So we could pick any moment, any set of rockets launched by Hezbollah,
any set of strikes by Israel, and say, “Is this an escalation?  Is that
an escalation?” and so forth.  I think it’s not a particularly useful
exercise.  For us, the most useful exercise is to try to drive both
parties to a place where we get an agreed and durable outcome that can
end the cycle and keep us from ending up in the larger war that, as we
were just talking about, we’ve worked so hard to (inaudible).  
   
Q    Is there any announcement that we should expect next week about
Haiti?  (Inaudible) report that says that even though we have now the
Kenya team there and the security forces, 80 percent of Port-au-Prince
is run by gangs.  Things are not getting better for the people. 
Violence keep growing.  And of course, we don’t have elections or plan
of a government soon.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, things are not where we would like them to be in
Haiti, but I think it is not correct to say that things have not gotten
better from a low point when flights were shut down, the port was shut
down, it looked like the entire government was going to be run out of
the country.  
   
We have improved the situation from that low point, but the progress we
have made has been slower and more uneven than we’d like it to be.  Our
goal is to continue to enhance the Multilateral Security Support Mission
and ultimately work with the United Nations to make sure that it gets
institutionalized.   
   
But I don’t know that we have any particular announcements next week. 
Rather, our goal is to use the U.N. General Assembly to get more
resources, more contributions, and a common vision around building step
by step on what we’ve put in place so that we can improve the situation
beyond where it is right now.  
   
MODERATOR:  We have time for about two more questions.  
   
Q    Just a follow-up.  And how can that happen?  I know Colombia wanted
to help, but, like, it’s not an actual mission like (inaudible) it was
the U.N. (inaudible) — is this a security group, and the U.S. is leading
the efforts.  So how the countries will get involved, and how can they
operate?  Like, Mexico cannot (inaudible) officers —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, a number of countries have pledged contributions,
including police units, former police units.  And so, the first thing
that can happen is we can turn those pledges into reality, and then we
can work bilaterally with countries like Mexico and Colombia on their
legal requirements to try to satisfy them so that they could, in fact,
