12:25 P.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Hey, everyone.  Hope everyone enjoyed the long weekend. 
Kirby has a few words here at the top, and then we’ll get into as many
questions as we can.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Hey, everybody.  Thanks for joining.  
   
First, on the Middle East.  As you all know, on Saturday, in a tunnel in
Gaza, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages that were held by
Hamas, including an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin.  He and five
others were executed.  Hamas is responsible for their deaths.  And as
the President said, Hamas leaders will pay for their crimes.  
   
As you know, the President also had a chance to speak with Hersh’s
parents, Jon and Rachel, and — as did the Vice President — and they
grieve with them and with all the families of everyone killed.  
   
Yesterday, the President and Vice President had a chance to meet in the
White House Situation Room with the U.S. hostage deal negotiation team
to talk about next steps on our ongoing effort to secure the release of
the hostages and to hold Hamas leaders fully accountable.  
   
As for the status of those talks, over the past couple of days, we’ve
heard a lot from Israel, we’ve heard some from Hamas, and we continue to
consult with our co-mediators, Qatar and Egypt.  
   
Just, again, to restate it: We’re working on a proposal that will secure
the release of the remaining hostages and will include massive and
immediate relief for the people of Gaza, and also result in a stoppage
of the fighting.   
   
Now, I’ve seen some press reporting out there about “take it or leave
it” and “final proposal” and “text this” and “text that.”  All I’m
telling you is our team is still working on trying to get this to
closure, to try to conclude a deal that achieves all of those three
things.   
   
And I’m sure you’re all curious as to what that proposal says and what’s
in it, and I’m sure you’re also not going to be surprised by the fact
that I’m not going to get into that detail.   
   
What I can tell you is we are still actively working on this.  We are
still in constant consultations with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.  And of
course, Qatar and Egypt are in touch with Hamas.  And we’re going to do
what we can to get it done.   
   
I can’t tell you what the timeline looks like.  I can’t tell you, if we
get it done, exactly what every little — every little paragraph and
context of the final proposal would look like.  All I can tell you is
those are the three goals, and that’s what we’re still driving at, and
we’re still actively engaged in the effort.   
   
The President himself is personally involved in working with our team
and in working with leaders around the world to secure this deal, and
that’s what we’re focused on.  And the killing over the weekend just
underscores the sense of urgency that we have to have in order to get it
to closure.   
   
If I can switch to Venezuela.   
   
The United States joins several of our international partners in
condemning the unjustified arrest warrant of Edmundo Gonzalez in
Venezuela for allegedly inciting violence — which, of course, is not
accurate.   
   
This is just another example of Mr. Maduro’s efforts to maintain power
by force and to refuse to recognize that Mr.  Gonzalez won the most
votes on the 28th of July.   
   
So, in coordination with those partners, we’re considering a range of
options to demonstrate to Mr. Maduro and his representatives that their
actions in Venezuela will have consequences.   
   
Now, I don’t have anything to announce today, but as you’ve seen, we’ve
already enforced and calibrated our sanctions towards Venezuela in light
of overall U.S. interests and the actions and non-actions that are taken
by Maduro and his representatives.   
   
In fact, just yesterday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the
seizure of an aircraft used by Mr. Maduro and his representatives, based
on sanctions and export control violations that were already in place. 
This action taken by Justice was really done in the overall direction of
our broader bilateral engagement with Venezuela.  
   
And then, quickly on Ukraine.   
   
Sadly, we have to yet again offer our deepest condolences to the people
of Ukraine after another massive Russian strike, this time in a town
called Poltova \[sic\] — I’m sorry, Poltava — which killed more than 40
people and wounded at least 180 others.  Just another horrific reminder
of the extent of Mr.  Putin’s brutality towards the people of Ukraine
and the manner in which he’s trying to punish them for his own invasion
of that country, going after critical infrastructure and trying to make
it harder just for them to live and to pursue livelihoods.  
   
As President Biden has made clear, our support for Ukraine remains
unshakable, and we’re going to continue to be focused on strengthening
their military and their air defenses against these kinds of assaults
and attacks.   
   
As you saw just 10 days ago, we announced yet another drawdown of
military assistance.  That included ammunition for HIMARS systems,
counter-drone equipment, munitions, Javelin anti-tank and anti-armor
systems.  And there will be more coming in coming weeks.  So we’re going
to continue to stand by Ukraine as they try to defend themselves against
these sorts of attacks.   
   
With that, we can take some questions.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Zeke with the
AP.  
   
Q    Thanks, John, for doing this.  A couple weeks ago, you had said
that the U.S. was putting forward a new bridging proposal to close the
remaining gaps between the two sides.  Is the proposal that’s being
developed this week, the President is actively engaged in, is that a new
proposal or is that just a refinement of what has already been on the
table now for some weeks and, really, in essence, some months?   
   
And then, separately, do you have any specific reaction to the Israeli
Prime Minister’s comments yesterday, sort of drawing the line on holding
the Philadelphi Corridor?  
   
And then, can you offer a little bit more clarity on the President’s
comments that Netanyahu isn’t doing enough to get this deal?  Is a deal
possible while Netanyahu remains in power?  Thank you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The answer to your third question is: Yes, of course,
there’s a deal possible.  And the President wouldn’t be personally
engaged the way he is and he wouldn’t have taken the time over the
weekend to meet with his team if he didn’t believe that that was, in
fact, an outcome that we can achieve.   
   
I won’t get into the details of the proposal that we are working on, but
we continue to work on it.  And it won’t come as a surprise to anybody
that when you’re involved in negotiations, particularly at high stakes
like this, there’s a lot of back-and-forth, and there’s amendments
offered and there’s amendments rejected, and there’s text that changes
from time to time.  That work continues, and I’m just not going to get
into the details of what it looks like or what it may look like if we’re
successful.  But, yes, absolutely, it’s possible.   
   
And again, I think — not that we didn’t have a sense of urgency before;
we certainly did — but the killings over the weekend, the executions is
the only way to put it, just underscores for us how important it is to
keep that work alive and keep going.   
   
I’m not going to get into a debate with the Prime Minister of what he
said over the weekend about the Philadelphi Corridor.  The deal itself,
the proposal, including the bridging proposal that we started working
with — you guys know this; I’m not telling you anything that isn’t out
there publicly — included the removal of Israeli Defense Forces from all
densely populated areas, and that includes those areas along that
corridor.  That’s the proposal that Israel had agreed to.  And again,
we’re going to continue to work on this as hard as we can.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Steve Holland with
Reuters.  
   
Q    John, what’s the strategy behind referring to this as a “final
proposal”?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m just — I’m not using that phrase, Steve, so I can’t — I
can’t speak to what strategy might be in place.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I’m not using that phrase.  And there is a — there is
a proposal we’re working on.  It is still being negotiated, which means
that the sides are still talking about the text itself.  
   
But we believe — as I said to Zeke, we believe that we can get there. 
We believe we can close this.  And we absolutely have to do it with as
much speed as possible, especially given what happened over the
weekend.  
   
Q    And we’ve seen a number of protests in Israel in response to the
death of the hostages.  Are you hoping these protests will put pressure
on Netanyahu to do more to try to get a deal?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I’ll let the Israeli people speak for themselves,
Steve.  I’m not qualified nor would I get involved in domestic issues
there in Israel.   
   
I think what happened over the weekend should serve as a reminder to
everyone how evil Hamas is and how deadly, how lethal the situation is
for all those hostages.  And it should underscore for everybody, and I
think it does — I think it does in Israel; I think it does in the
region; it certainly does here, inside the administration and in the
United States — how important it is to get this deal in place and to get
those hostages released, get them out, get them back with their
families, where they belong.  
   
So, again, I won’t speak to domestic issues in Israel, and I certainly
wouldn’t speak for the Israeli people.  I can only tell you that,
speaking for President Biden, he’s going to stay 110 percent focused on
seeing if we can’t get this over the finish line and to do so as soon as
humanly possible.   
   
Q    Thank you, John.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, sir.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Selina with ABC.  
   
Q    Hi, John.  Thanks so much for doing this.  I know you don’t want to
talk about the specifics of this, quote, “final proposal,” but senior
administration officials are saying that there could be a possibility,
if that fell apart, that the U.S. could walk away from leading these
discussions.  Is that a feasible reality, of the U.S. walking away?  Is
there any world where that could happen — you know, just considering the
stakes that are at play here for the U.S., considering some of these
hostages are American?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We want to get them all released, Selina.  We want to get
them released as soon as possible.  Today would be a great day to do
that.  They should never have been taken in the first place by Hamas. 
And Hamas bears the responsibility for their taking and for the lives
that have already been lost and for the health and welfare of those who
are still alive.  We want to get them out.  We want to get them out
now.   
   
I am simply going to refuse to speculate about what might happen or what
might not happen as we are involved, as you and I are speaking, in
constant consultations to get this deal over the finish line.  The less
I say, the better on that.  And I’m certainly not going to speculate
about what might or might not happen.   
   
I’ll tell you what needs to happen.  What needs to happen is the deal to
get closed.  What needs to happen is the hostages to get home.  What
needs to happen is more humanitarian assistance in.  And this deal would
provide an extraordinary amount of additional humanitarian assistance to
the suffering people of Gaza, the people who are suffering in Gaza
because Mr. Sinwar decided to break a ceasefire, a deal that was in
existence on the 6th of October.  And what needs to happen is an end to
the fighting.  And that’s what we’re focused on.   
   
Q    So, just another follow-up.  You’ve said these similar remarks
before about how this needs to happen, it’s going to happen, we’re
close.  Why is this time different?  Is there a sense that there is a
greater sense of urgency that this could actually be achieved?  
   
And number two, the UK is suspending some arms exports to Israel.  What
is the official White House reaction to that?  And does the White House
have any plans to follow suit to increase pressure on Israel?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I never said it *will* happen.  I’ve said we believe
it *can* happen.  We believe that we’re close enough, that the gaps are
narrow enough that it could happen.  And that remains the case today.   
   
And we have always had a sense of urgency about getting this deal —
well, I shouldn’t say “always.”  Since it was — since the President laid
it out there publicly at the end of May, we have had a high sense of
urgency to get it over the finish line, and we’ve been working very,
very diligently over these last few months to do that.  That work will
continue.  It will continue with the same sense of importance and energy
that we’ve been applying to it.   
   
But, certainly, the work is — the importance of that work is now
underscored by the brutal execution of these innocent hostages over the
weekend, including an American.  Those lives were just recently taken. 
And I’d be lying to you if I said that the work going on yesterday,
today, tomorrow, and the days ahead are not going to be informed or
shaped or colored by our own grief and sorrow and shock and outrage
about what Hamas did.  I couldn’t — I couldn’t say that it wouldn’t
be.  
   
So, there has been a sense of urgency; there will continue to be.  And,
clearly, what happened over the weekend underscores how important it is
to get this done as quickly as possible.   
   
On the UK, every nation can speak for themselves on how and to what
degree that they support Israel.  I’m certainly not going to comment one
way or another on the decisions that our British counterparts made.   
   
I can just tell you that, number one, we’re going to continue to do we
have to do to support Israel’s defensive capabilities; that support
continues today.  Number two, we have, as I’ve said many times, reviewed
individual reports as best we can and talking to the Israelis about
individual reports about compliance with international humanitarian
law.  And as we speak, there’s been no determination by the United
States that they have violated international humanitarian law.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Felicia with the
Financial Times.  
   
Q    Hi, John.  Thanks.  Just to follow up on the UK decision, has there
been any conversations between the White House and Number 10 or any
other parts of the U.S. or American government about the decision, or
any calls to read out?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No calls to read out since they’ve announced their
decision.  They did give us a heads up that they were going to — that
they had arrived at that decision and were going to announce it.  So, we
were aware.  
   
Q    And are you worried that any other — I guess this is maybe the
first major Western ally of Israel’s to take this step.  Is the U.S.
worried that other countries might follow suit?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’ll tell you what we’re worried about.  We’re worried about
getting a deal to get the hostages home.  We’re worried about getting
more humanitarian assistance in.  And we’re worried about finding an end
to this conflict.  We’re also worried about making sure we can continue
to help Israel defend itself against what is clearly, and certainly
should be a reminder to everybody about what happened over the weekend,
a brutal, evil terrorist organization.  That’s what we’re worried
about.   
   
We’ll let other nations decide for themselves if they’re going to
support Israel and to what degree.  That’s their decision.  That’s what
sovereignty is all about.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Karen with the
Washington Post.  One second.  Our computer is malfunctioning.  
   
Karen, you should be able to talk now.  
   
Q    Yeah, you’ve said several times now that the brutal killings over
the weekend underscore the importance of getting this deal done.  Prime
Minister Netanyahu, in his remarks over the weekend, said sort of the
opposite, that — he said: What it underscores is that whenever you show
flexibility or give something to Hamas, this is what they do, and we’ve
shown flexibility thus far and we’re not anymore — basically, he said.  
   
Can you — how do you reconcile those two positions in terms of getting
the negotiations completed?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to reconcile those two positions, Karen. 
That’s not my job.  It’s not my place.  I speak for this administration
and for this President, and he has been rock-solid and consistent in
pushing for his team to do everything they can to get this deal in
place.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Tamara Keith with
NPR.  
   
Tam, you should be able to unmute yourself.  Okay, we will try to come
back to you later.   
   
Our next question will go to Barak with Axios.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you for doing this.  John, two questions.  First, if we
can go back to what the President said yesterday when he said that he
doesn’t think Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough to get a deal. 
What did he mean?  What do you need Netanyahu to do that he’s not
doing?  Or what is Netanyahu doing that you think is not constructive
for reaching a deal?  
   
And the second thing, to go back to what you said about the Philadelphi
Corridor.  You said that the proposal includes the removal of IDF from
all densely populated areas, including the Philadelphi Corridor.  So,
just to understand, do you mean during the first phase of the deal?  Do
you mean during the entire deal?  Because in the next phases, all IDF
forces need to be removed from the Philadelphi Corridor.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Right.  
   
Q    And Netanyahu said yesterday that he will not remove the IDF from
the Philadelphi Corridor ever.  So he did not speak only about the first
phase of the deal; he spoke about it indefinite.  So, I’m trying to
understand better what exactly is the U.S. position on the issue of the
Philadelphi Corridor on phase one of the deal, on phase two of the deal,
and going forward.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Look, it’s all in the proposal, Barak.  And you’ve read the
proposal, same as me.   
   
Q    Yeah, I know.  But, John, the proposal — the last proposal,
including the map that the U.S. approved, included the deployment of the
IDF along the Philadelphi Corridor.  That’s what I’m saying.  And not
only in densely populated areas.  And the U.S. signed off on this map. 
That’s why I’m asking what’s the exact U.S. position regarding the
Philadelphi Corridor.  Because I don’t think that the map that the U.S.
has agreed on is the same — reflects the same position you just said.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to get into negotiating this thing in public. 
You know I’m not going to do that.  The deal says that they have to
remove IDF from all densely populated areas in phase one, and that
includes densely populated areas around — or adjacent to the Philadelphi
Corridor, or where it intersects with those densely populated areas. 
That’s what the proposal says.  That’s the proposal that was put forth
at the end of May.   
   
I’m not going to get into amendments one way or another that have
subsequently been discussed.  I’m not going to negotiate this in public
one way or the other.   
   
And as for your first question, the President has in numerous
conversations with the Prime Minister, as well as our counterparts in
Qatar and Egypt, stressed the importance of doing everything we can to
actualize, to conclude the proposal that, again, was an Israeli proposal
agreed to at the end of May.  
   
And we — he charged his team on Saturday — I’m sorry, over the weekend
he charged his team to do everything that they could to see what we can
do to get this over the finish line.  
   
I understand it would be satisfying if I were to give a list of
everything everybody should do outside the United States to make that
happen, but I hope you can understand I’m not going to do that.  We’ve
got to find a way to come to closure on this thing.  We are close enough
that that is possible.  We believe that it’s an outcome that can be
achieved.  But as I’ve said many times: In order to do that, it requires
compromise and it requires leadership from everybody.  And I’ll leave it
at that.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Neria with Israel
Channel 13.  
   
Q    Hey, Kirby.  Thank you so much for doing that.  During Netanyahu’s
speech/press conference last night, he said he told Sinwar forget about
the Philadelphi Corridor.  I heard some officials saying that this could
be the end for a possibility for a hostages deal.  So where do you get
your optimism from?  
   
And do you think that it was (inaudible) for the Prime Minister to say
that?   
   
And another question.  I do hear that the American hostages’ families
are asking the U.S. administration to try and release their hostages in
case Israel doesn’t want a hostages deal.  Can you tell us where does
this stand?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t speculate about anything, not even the deal that
we’re working on, at this point.  We still believe that that is the best
way to get all the hostages back with their families, is to get this
deal in place.  And as I said earlier, we believe we’re close enough and
that the gaps are narrow enough to achieve that outcome.   
   
It’s not optimism, it’s pragmatism.  And it’s based on just looking at
where we are, how far we’ve been able to come, and an essential belief
that, practically speaking, these gaps can be narrowed.  
   
But, look, I can’t, nor would I ever, guarantee to you all that — a
certain outcome.  We just believe that it is an outcome that’s
possible.  
   
Q    But is the U.S. working on such an option of releasing the American
hostages?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We are working on a proposal that would release all the
hostages, including the American hostages, and that is the proposal that
we’ve been talking about in the region last week, and it was the same
proposal that the President met with his team over the weekend to
discuss.  That is what we’re working on.   
   
Q    Thank you so much, Kirby.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yep.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Jacob with the
Times of Israel.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks for doing this.  To just follow up on a previous
question: You said that the offer that Israel agreed to includes a
withdrawal of IDF forces from heavily populated areas, including those
areas along the Philadelphi Corridor.  Does that mean that in areas that
aren’t heavily populated along the corridor, the U.S. supports or is
okay with Israel staying there?  That’s one question.  
   
Next, just being — you said you’re not using the term “final” to talk
about the bridging proposal, but Brett had a briefing with us — it was
on background — but he said several times that they’re calling it a
final bridging proposal.  So is the White House now walking back from
that terminology?   
   
And then, you were asked about, lastly, reports that the U.S. could walk
away from the talks.  I know in the past you’ve said “we’ll never walk
away,” but that wasn’t your response this time.  So I just wanted to see
if you’re — if there’s anything we should be learning from that, how you
respond to that question.  Thank you.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  What I’m hoping you can take away from this discussion today
is how seriously we’re continuing to try to achieve a successful outcome
here.  That’s what I want you to take away from it.  
   
On the Philadelphi Corridor, I think I could point you to what the
Israelis have said publicly about their belief in the need to have some
security along that corridor.  The proposal says that they have to
remove themselves to the east from densely populated areas.  And that
core, essential element of the proposal has not changed.  But the
Israelis have said publicly that they believe that even in so doing,
that they would need some security along that corridor, and I’d point
you to what they’re saying about it.  
   
Q    And on the terminology about “final” and “not final” bridging
proposal?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’ve already answered — I’ve answered the question.   
   
Q    Okay, thank you.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nathan with KAN.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks.  I’d like to know if the President has any plans of
speaking to Netanyahu directly to clarify the issue of Philadelphi in
the agreement.  He said yesterday that that will happen eventually.  But
if this is such an urgent issue, can we expect any kind of direct
contact between them immediately?  
   
And also, is the U.S. in any kind of contact with the Israeli opposition
and with the protest movement in Israel?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything on the schedule in terms of another
call with the Prime Minister, but I think you can safely assume that
there will be additional conversations between these two leaders.  And
when that happens, we will do what we do every time, which is let you
know it’s happening and give you a readout when it’s happened.  I just
don’t have anything to speak to at this time.  
   
And we are not involving ourselves, nor would we, in Israeli domestic
issues.  So I’d leave it at that.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nadia.  
   
Q    Thank you, Sam.  John, the President said on seven different
occasions that we are very close to conclude this deal, we’re closer
than ever, we’re closer than three days ago.  I’m just wondering how —
what is your understanding of what went wrong?  And why do you believe
that a deal could be achieved, considering that both Sinwar and
Netanyahu are not willing to compromise on fundamental issues?   
   
And my second question is: Some of the families, the hostage families,
are actually blaming the administration.  They’re saying that you did
not exert enough pressure on Netanyahu, you didn’t use any leverage to
make sure that the deal could be concluded a long time ago, and that
could have spared the killing of the six hostages, despite the fact that
Hamas executed them, but there could have been a way to spare their
life.  How do you respond to this?  Thank you.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  We were looking for that way as hard as humanly possible. 
And we certainly understand the grief, the sorrow, the anger that they
feel, because we feel it too.  But that doesn’t take away the incredible
efforts that we expended to try to get this deal finished, and it
certainly doesn’t diminish the efforts going forward, which will remain
consistent, steadfast, and aggressive, to try to get this deal in
place.   
   
And when we said at the time, and I’ve said it many times myself, that
we’re as close as we’ve ever been, that the gaps are narrow, those were
accurate statements.  They were — they were true.  But we also never
said it was going to be easy.  You can be that close.  And as I’ve said
before, when you get to that close, when you get to that level of
detail, that’s when the horse trading gets incredibly difficult.  That’s
when the task of negotiators really intensifies.   
   
And we’re still, we believe, in that space right now, where we have gaps
that can be narrowed, but there’s no guarantee that they will be.  We
just have to keep working as hard as we have been, and we will.  There’s
not going to be any slackening of effort from the United States to try
to see if we can’t hammer this out.  
   
Q    And how do you respond to the fact that no leverage was used
against Netanyahu?  Could you have used any pressure, publicly or
publicly, to change his position?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’ve been working with Israel and Qatar and Egypt — the
latter two, of course, have direct communications with Hamas — to do
everything we can to find language that works for both sides to bring
this deal to a close.  And that work was not completely — it was not
completely fruitless.  We were able to narrow the gaps and get close. 
But obviously, nothing is negotiated until everything is negotiated, and
we haven’t concluded.   
   
So it’s not like — it’s not like we haven’t worked hard to move both
sides closer to a deal.  And as I said, it doesn’t diminish the fact
that we’re going to continue to work hard for that outcome.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And that is, unfortunately, all the time we have
today.  As always, if we weren’t able to get to you, please email the
NSC Press distro and we’ll try to get back to you as soon as we can. 
Thanks, everyone.
