title: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, September 1, 2021

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:46 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Good afternoon.  Okay, just a couple items for you all at
the top.   
   
Another update on the hurricane.  The continuing focus on the ground is
on power restoration, as nearly 1 million customers in Louisiana — more
than 40 percent of the state — remain without power in the middle of a
heat advisory.  
   
While progress has been made in Mississippi since yesterday, 30,000
customers there still do not have electricity and power restoration. 
And parts of Louisi- — and parts of Louisiana could take weeks as crews
assess the full extent of power system damage.  
   
To help accelerate these efforts, the President spoke with CEOs of the
largest energy companies in the Gulf Coast yesterday and committed the
full weight of the federal government to providing resources wherever
they are needed.   
   
As part of that, the federal government is sharing aerial and satellite
imagery to support damage assessments, helping with debris removal and
traffic control so restoration workers and equipment can get access to
downed wires and poles, and expediting permitting for rerunning of
transmission cable across the Mississippi River and for standing up
transmission towers.  
   
Federal personnel from DOE, the Army Corps of Engineers, and across
government are on the ground assisting efforts along with, as I’ve noted
previously, 25,000 linemen.  
   
Lack of power and damage to the health — healthcare facilities in
Louisiana remains a significant problem.  We are prioritizing the
deployment of generators to locations most in need, and about 1,800
patients, as of today, have been evacuated from healthcare facilities
with the help of additional ambulances that were pre-staged by FEMA.  
   
Cell service also remains an issue, as it has been over the course of
the last couple of days, and the FCC is working directly with wireless
carriers and has deployed staff to Louisiana to prioritize recovery
efforts.   
   
We know this has been incredibly difficult — continues to be — for many
people who had to evacuate because of the storm, and we continue to
encourage individuals from impacted areas in Louisiana to apply for
federal assistance.  More than 31,000 households in Louisiana have
already received a one-time $500 payment to support critical needs as a
result of the major disaster declaration that the President approved.  
   
I’d also note — this just went out, but in case you haven’t seen it: On
Friday, the President will travel to New Orleans, Louisiana, to survey
storm damage from Hurricane Ida and meet with state and local leaders
from impacted communities.  We’re just finalizing the details of this
trip, so as more become available, we’ll share them with all of you.  
   
Also wanted to note that today the federal ag- — the White House and
agencies across the federal government — including HUD, Treasury, and
the Federal Housing Finance Authority — are announcing steps that will
create, preserve, and sell approximately 100,000 additional affordable
homes over the next three years with an emphasis on lower and middle
ends of the market.   
   
These steps leverage existing authorities and dedicate additional
resources to affordable housing.  Specifically, they will boost the
supply of quality, affordable rental units by increasing the financing
available through HUD, Treasury, and FHFA programs for affordable and
targeted housing production, including a relaunch of the Federal
Financing Bank’s risk-sharing program, expanded support for low-income
housing tax credit, and increasing access to the Capital Magnet Fund. 
Boost — and this will boost the supply of manufactured housing and two-
to four-unit properties by expanding financing through Freddie Mac,
which, along with existing policies, will enable more Americans to
purchase homes.  
   
Last item — sorry, there’s a lot going on today: Today, the White House,
Treasury, and Code for America — a civic technology nonprofit —
announced the launch of a new mobile-friendly and bilingual Child Tax
Credit — CTC signup tool that is mobile-friendly and available in
Spanish to make it easi- — even easier for more Americans who do not
regularly file taxes to claim their Child Tax Credit.  
   
And as you know, this has been an ongoing effort of this White House and
the administration to reach every single person we can who’s eligible,
even if they are non-filers.   
   
We will link this new tool through ChildTaxCredit.gov.  While the Code
for America tool as an important and necessary resource to help more
families this tax season, Treasury remains committed to creating a
permanent, fully resourced, multilingual, and mobile-friendly government
signup tool.  That is a process that is underway.   
   
That is all I have to highlight for you this morning — or this
afternoon.   
   
Go ahead.  Kick us off.  
   
Q    Great.  Thanks, Jen.  Two subjects.  First, on COVID: In Louisiana,
state data suggests that about 10 percent of hospitalized patients are
vaccinated.  Is it still accurate to call COVID a “pandemic of the
unvaccinated”?  And could that phrase that’s been deployed frequently by
the White House possibly be counterproductive at this stage to
protecting some Americans?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, we continue to track data closely
through the CDC and all of our healthcare — health and medical experts
who do show that, across the country, the vast, vast majority of those
who are hospitalized — vast majority — are individuals who have not been
vaccinated.  That has not changed.  
   
And any health and medical expert — whether it’s Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins,
Dr. Walensky — will tell you that vaccination is very effective in
protecting from hospitalization and death and serious illness.  
   
That is our objective — is to save more lives.  So, that hasn’t changed
our messaging.   
   
Q    Secondly: Obviously, in Texas, with the law with regard to
abortion, the President said in a statement he will protect and defend
Roe vs. Wade.  How does the administration plan to do that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I — we put out a statement from the President this
morning, but let me just reiterate some of the key points.  And I will,
of course, answer your question.  
   
As the President said this morning, the ex- — “This extreme Texas law
blatantly violates the constitutional right established under Roe v.
Wade and upheld as precedent for nearly half a century.”  It will
“significantly impair women’s access to the health care they need,
particularly for communities of color and individuals with low
incomes.”   
   
It also “deputizes private citizens to bring lawsuits against anyone who
they believe has helped another person get an abortion, which might even
include family members, healthcare workers, front desk staff at a health
care clinic, or strangers with no connection to the individual\[s\].” 
This further isolates individuals who are facing this tough choice.   
   
And I would note for those of you who didn’t see: People who report who
— who — these private citizens could get up to $10,000 for reporting
somebody who is seeking an abortion.   
   
So, our focus and the President’s focus is to reiterate our deep
commitment to the constitutional right — of course, established by Roe
v. Wade nearly five decades ago — and to continue to call for the
codification of Roe, something that the President talked about on the
campaign trail, the Vice President talked about on the campaign trail. 
And this highlights even further the need to move forward on that
effort.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  One on COVID and Afghanistan — the second one on
Afghanistan.  Specifically, the boosters — President Biden has pledged
to follow the science in the fight against COVID, though some experts
have expressed some concern the decision to make boosters widely
available this September is a bit premature and that it was made before
health experts were able to fully weigh in.   
   
So here’s my question: What can — what can you tell people who are
concerned that the desire to get ahead of the virus has actually put us
out in front of the science instead?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first of all, we always lead with science.  And let me
just reiterate some things for anyone who’s expressing a concern.  This
was a decision made by and announced by the nation’s leading public
health officials — everyone from Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the head of the
CDC; Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA Administrator — Commissioner; Dr.
Francis Collins, NIC \[sic\] — NIH Director; and Dr. Fauci, Director of
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.   
   
They reviewed mountains and mountains of available data on vaccine
effectiveness and made a clinical judgment that boosters would be
needed, and announced a plan to begin them in September, subject, of
course, to the FDA and CDC processes to continue.   
   
We also know that there needs to be — there needs to be a plan in place
to implement these booster shots around the country.  
   
But I will tell you that this was a recommendation made by our nation’s
leading health experts based on mounds and mounds of data.  There will
still be a final piece of this process that will be seen through.  But
our responsibility and our objective is to save more lives, protect more
people.  And as soon as this data — the science made clear that boosters
would help do that, we wanted to put that information out to the
public.   
   
Q    The September 20 date to — is that firm?  That date to roll out
boosters, is that a firm date?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s based on and pending the final — subject to the
final FDA and CDC processes.  Yes.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then one on Afghanistan.  There’s some reporting that
we’d like to confirm regarding a call in June — in July, rather —
between President Biden and former Afghanistan President Ghani: one,
that both leaders appeared completely unaware that the Taliban would
take over; and, secondly, that they discussed plans to project that
Afghan forces were still in control.  Is that accurate?  Can you tell us
a little bit more about that call?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to get into private diplomatic
conversations or leaked transcripts of phone calls.   
   
But what I can reiterate for you is that we have stated many times that
no one anticipated — the vast majority, I should say — there may have
been individuals and agencies, so I don’t want to eliminate that option
— but our national security team and no one in Congress or, I would say,
most people out in the public anticipated that the Taliban would be able
to take over the country as quickly as they did or that the Afghan
National Security Forces would fold as quickly as they did.   
   
So, even the content of the reporting is consistent with what we’ve said
many times publicly.   
   
I’ll also note something that the President said in his press conference
around the same time of this reported phone call: “The Afghan government
and leadership has to come together.  They clearly have the capacity to
sustain the government in place.  The question is: Will they generate
the kind of cohesion to do it?”  
   
And what the President conveyed publicly, and certainly privately as
well, repeatedly, to Afghan leaders — as did our national security
officials — is that it’s important that the leaders in Afghanistan do
exactly that: lead and show the country that they are ready to continue
to — the fight against the Taliban; that they have the will for the
Afghan National Security Forces to continue that fight even as our U.S.
forces leave.  
   
Q    But did the President, at that point in time, have some sort of
perception that even the former president of Afghanistan didn’t have
that confidence in the Afghan forces?  Is that why maybe he was pushing
Ghani to be more stern and to be more confident?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President has consistently conveyed — and I just noted
an example — publicly that the Afghan leadership, at the time, needed to
do exactly that: lead.  They needed to come together in a cohesive
manner.  They needed to be united.  They need to just show the country
and the Afghan people they were going to fight and they are going to
lead through this transition, even as U.S. forces left.  That is
entirely consistent with what he has said publicly throughout.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  One on Afghanistan and one on COVID as well.  We —
a few colleagues of mine have determined that there’s roughly 17,000
Afghan refugees at military installations in five states here, as of
Tues- — as of Tuesday, while another 40,000 remain at bases overseas. 
Curious, how many of those Afghan evacuees have other countries
committed to resettling or what is the status of those ongoing
conversations.  And will the U.S. resettle — or otherwise, will the U.S.
resettle all of those 40,000 here in the United States?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, not to refute the reporting of your colleagues, but
just to note: The Secretary of Defense just confirmed it’s about 20,000
who have come into the United States — at a briefing earlier this
afternoon.   
   
There is capacity — and we’re working towards capacity at our military
bases for up to 50,000.  And again, this is not a place where people
would live.  This is a place where people would go, they would receive
medical care and assistance and get connected with refugee resettlement
organizations that are — play a vital role as refugees come to our
country from wherever they come around the world.   
   
We are also working with third countries on what their capacities are. 
I can’t give you an exact breakdown now.  It’s a very important
question.  But that’s exactly what our Department of Homeland Security,
what our diplomatic team will be working through in the coming days. 
And I’m certain they will be providing updates as we have that
established.  
   
Q    You’ve talked about this a little bit — others have as well — but
there are, of course, concerns among lawmakers, experts who have tracked
this who say previous arrivals of large numbers of refugees from
different parts of the world, inevitably there may be a handful — a
small handful who are eventually deemed a security risk of some kind. 
What reassurances can you make about the screening process and the
attempts to make sure that somebody like that doesn’t make his or her
way here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can absolutely assure you that no one is coming into the
United States of America who has not been through a thorough screening
and background check process.  And there are many individuals, as you
noted, who have not been through that process and they have gone to lily
pad countries, as that process has been completed.  It doesn’t mean that
that’s because there is a flag.  It means they have not completed their
paperwork and we were working to save tens of thousands of people, hence
we evacuated them to these third countries.  
   
Q    And then on COVID, is there any update on the U.S. decision to keep
Europeans and Canadians from visiting the United States?  There were a
few public messages from ambassadors here in Washington — the EU
Ambassador, the Polish Ambassador among others — saying, “The time has
come for vaccinated Europeans to be allowed entry into the United
States.  Our people deserve to be reunited with loved ones and to have
the opportunity to visit this great nation.”  I know this is something a
lot of people worry about.  I’m just curious if there’s a status
report.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we certainly understand that and relate to that and
know that people are eager to be reunited with loved ones.  And that is
something that’s impacting many people around the world.   
   
I would note that we are right now working across federal agencies to
develop a consistent and safe international travel policy — that has
obviously been ongoing for some period of time — that includes travel
from Europe and other countries around the world, and it is one that we
want to be equitable.  We want it to have standard requirements so
there’s clarity and so there’s equity across how we approach it.  
   
This will involve, of course, efforts to step up protecting the American
people.  It may also involve ensuring that over time, foreign nationals
coming to the United States are fully vaccinated with limited
exceptions.  No decisions have been made yet, but that is a process
that’s ongoing.  We certainly understand the interest in it being
resolved and completed.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  It’s been now a couple of days since U.S. troops left
Afghanistan.  I understand you have continued to say the mission will
continue to bring people home through diplomatic and other ways. 
Yesterday, you guys at the White House didn’t have an answer on whether
any Americans or refugees had made it out.  Is there an answer today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, this is an operation that’s being overseen by
our State Department from a diplomatic front.  They have a briefing
today.  If there are updates to provide, they will provide them.   
   
But what we are working through — and what we knew would not necessarily
be operational the day after our departure — are a couple of steps.  One
is how we can get the airports operational again.  We’re working with
the Qataris, the Turks, and others who are being partners in this
effort.  The civilian side of the airport had a lot of destruction to
it, and we need to make repairs in partnership with them so we can get
airports — and airplanes, I should say, up and running.  That will have
a huge impact once that is up and operational.   
   
The other piece is overland efforts.  Now, some of this is there are —
there are steps, as we have seen over the course of the last few weeks,
where individual American citizens are able to depart without conveying
that they have departed yet.  So what we are doing is we are tracking
and staying in contact with all of the American citizens we are aware of
on what our plans are, what the progress is, and what the — as we have
updates on the timeline for when they can be able to depart.  
   
Q    Is there a sort of a timeframe where if there isn’t an update from
the State Department, there might be a course correction?  I asked them
today if they had any updated numbers and nobody has gotten back to me. 
I understand the briefing is coming up.  But is there a timeframe where
you guys will readjust?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A course correction in what way?  
   
Q    In terms of: If we cannot say, for whatever reason, how many people
have been able to leave since the U.S. forces withdrew, and we’re not
able to measure that or we’re not able to publicly release that, is
there a plan to do something else so that that movement can happen?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, today is September 1st.  We ended our presence in
Afghanistan yesterday — or on the 31st in Afghanistan.  What we said at
the time, and it remains the case, is that we are focused on
operationally moving forward on a number of fronts: There’s the
diplomatic front.  We have more than half of the countries in the world
who have agreed that the expectation we are going to press upon the
Taliban is that people will be able to freely move — depart the
country.  There was a U.N. Security Council resolution signed — or
passed, I should say, just two days ago.   
   
And now we are operationally working on both airplanes, so that can
depart — or getting the airport up and operational, and overland
departures.   
   
At the same time, we are in touch with every American citizen we have
contact with about our efforts and our commitment to get them out of the
country.  I’m not sure what a course correction would look like.  That
is what our efforts are at this point in time, 36 hours after our last —
or just about two days after our last planes depart.  
   
Q    And we’re hearing about some journalists who were left behind.  Fox
confirmed that a number of journalists working for U.S. Agency for
Global Media, a federally funded agency from Congress, including Radio
Free Europe and Radio Liberty journalists, were left behind.   
   
And we’re now also hearing from some senior State Department officials
that there were constraints getting people through the gates at HKIA;
that some of the communication methods to contact people were available
to so many that they were instantly ubiquitous that those priority
groups could not get through.  Was that a contingency that was planned
for?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Jacqui, I think it’s important to remember, again,
120,000 people made it out of the airport and out of the country.  And
our commitment to people who want to evacuate, want to leave — American
citizens, journalists, Afghan partners who have stood by our side — is
enduring and remains.   
   
Let me — I know there’s been some reporting on this, so let me give you
just a couple of examples — because now we can talk about this — of some
of the ways that we worked to get American citizens out.   
   
One, the most used method was the muster point — or what we called the
“muster point.”  The State Department would blast notifications through
a variety of channels to American citizens telling them to meet at a
specific location from which we would either bus them into the airport
in convoys or escort people on foot.  We offered multiple opportunities
for each of these muster points at various times, each with multiple
transits to the airport.  The majority of American citizens who got out
were evacuated exactly this way.   
   
We also talked people through — one on one — walking into the airport
with State Department officials on the phone — on the other end of the
phone the whole time, facilitating safe passage past checkpoints.  This
was incredibly labor intensive, but effective at resolving problems on
the ground, one by one, in challenging environments.  
   
In limited cases — and some of this was reported — where people were
trapped or in immediate danger, U.S. security forces went beyond the
wire, sometimes even a helicopter, to pick people up safely.  We didn’t
talk about these much — these helo hops — at times — at the time,
because they were dangerous missions.  We didn’t want to create the
expectation that we’d be sending a helicopter for everyone who wanted to
leave Afghanistan.  
   
So, I note those because I think it’s important to understand the steps
and the roles that our U.S. military on the ground took, far beyond just
checking people off on a list at the gate, to ensure we could get
American citizens, our Afghan partners and others out.  And we will
continue those efforts through the means I just —  
   
Q    Can I ask one on Ghani?  I just want to put a pin in that report. 
Was the President in any way pushing a false narrative in that call with
the Afghan President?

MS. PSAKI:  I think it’s pretty clear — again, I’m not going to go into
details of a private conversation.  But what we saw over the course of
the last few months is a collapse in leadership, and that was happening
even before Ghani left the country.   
   
What the President has conveyed repeatedly, privately and publicly, is
you need to stand up and lead your country.  And that’s something he
said at a press conference in July in public forum, as well.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  By my math, we’re just shy of 48 hours since the last
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you for your math.  It’s all running together.  
   
Q    — military aircraft leaving Afghanistan.  And we’ve talked — we’ve
learned a lot more just in the last few hours about the nature of the
cooperation we saw over the last two and a half weeks between the
Taliban and the American forces on the ground.  
   
I’m wondering if you could speak to whether, since — in the last 48
hours — there has been any continued form of interactions between the
U.S. and the Taliban, obviously now much more in a diplomatic
capacity.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, this would be an effort that would be overseen
underneath the leadership of the Secretary of State and the State
Department.  It will be necessary to have some form of communication and
coordination with the Taliban to continue to evacuate people from the
country.  They oversee Afghanistan — the majority of large swaths of the
country.   
   
I will note that we had prior conversations or methods of engagement,
even before the last couple of weeks.  So, it’s obviously a different
form at this point in time; that will continue.  That’s part of what the
President asked the Secretary of State and the State Department to
pursue.   
   
Q    Ron Klain, obviously the Chief of Staff, last night said, “I don’t
know if we will ever recognize their government,” as the legitimate
government of Afghanistan.  
   
You’ve talked a lot about the pieces — or points of leverage that the
U.S. holds over the Taliban.  Is that one of the points of leverage —
recognizing the Taliban?  Is that something that’s even under
consideration?    
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s no rush to recognition from the United States or any
country we’ve spoken with around the world.  It will be very dependent
on their behavior and whether they deliver on what the expectations are
of the global community.  
   
Q    And then, quickly, on abortion: We’ve seen in a number of states —
Republican-led states — an effort on voting rights, for instance, to
pass similar legislation throughout the country on voting rights. 
What’s the level of concern at the White House that the decision on
Texas, specifically, will lead to a similar raft of laws across the
country?  And what is the recourse for the White House, at a federal
level, to help prevent this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the step that can be taken is for the — is the
codification of Roe, something the President and the Vice President have
called for and would require Congress to act on.   
   
I will note that, certainly, we’ve seen — this is not the first threat
to Roe we’ve seen in a state across the country.  It’s an extreme
threat.   
   
And again, I would just note: This is offering up to $10,000 to
individuals who report someone who is going to get an abortion.  I mean,
that is what we’re talking about here.  So — and beyond that, as I’ve
already outlined.   
   
So, yes, of course, it’s of great concern.  And — but — and, of course,
it’s of great concern because this is not the first time that there have
been efforts by some in the country to prevent a woman from having the
right to choose.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Quick follow-up on the discussion about leverage.  Is there no
concern here at the White House that China could actively try to
undermine the U.S. leverage that it has with the Taliban, particularly
providing the kind of access to the global marketplace you talked about
yesterday?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that China doesn’t have that
capacity on their own, and that there is — there are more than 100
countries — a U.N. Security Council resolution — China did abstain from,
but they didn’t vote against — that calls on — presses the Taliban to
allow for safe passage of people in the country and those who want to
leave Afghanistan.  So, you know, China is going to have to think about
what role they want to be seen as in the world in this moment as
well.   
   
Q    Let me ask you this: The President said yesterday, “We are not done
with ISIS-K.”   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Senator Kaine, before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, was
talking about working toward a new sort of superseding AUMF.  Is this
something the White House is interested in working with him on so that
ISIS-K is specifically mentioned in a congressional authorization for
the use of force?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ve said in the past that we’re interested in working with
Senator Kaine on that, and that continues.  I will note that, in this
case, ISIS-K attacked and killed 13 members of our armed forces.  We
have every right — self-defense — to continue to go after ISIS-K, and
the President has made clear that’s what he wants the military to
continue to do.  
   
Q    So, future strikes on ISIS-K will be in the vein of
self-defense?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, these are authorities that the military already has,
but we also are open to and look forward to working with Senator Kaine
and others in Congress who look forward to — who are looking to update
the 20-year-old AUMF.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just two questions, Jen.  There’s a bill in Congress called the
Women’s Health Protection Act that would protect abortion access from
state laws like the one in Texas.  Does President Biden support that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to look more closely at the specifics of the law. 
Obviously protecting — codifying Roe, protecting a woman’s right to
choose is something the President is committed to, but I don’t have the
specifics of that law — or that bill, I should say.  
   
Q    And then, just secondly, has the President met with either Federal
Chair Jerome Powell or Lael Brainard one-on-one in recent weeks?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have no meetings to report to you or read out for you.   
   
Q    Broad question about the Zelenskyy meeting that’s underway.  Just
the events, demands, phone calls that led up to the 2019 impeachment —
I’m just wondering, did they factor in any way into the way the White
House prepared for this meeting, specifically the fact that Hunter Biden
was a key part of those conversations with the last administration and
Zelenskyy?   
   
And did President Biden expect in any way shape or form to address that
dynamic in today’s meeting?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  
   
Jeff.   
   
Q    Jen, does the White House — is the White House satisfied with
OPEC’s decision today to continue gradual increases in output?  And can
you give us a sense of what communication or contact the U.S. has had
with OPEC members about that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question, Jeff.  I will have to talk to Brian
Deese and our economic team about our exact reaction — I want to get
that right — and also whether we’re satisfied with the actions they
announced.  I will get that to you, and anyone else interested, after
the briefing.   
   
Did you have another question?  
   
Q    I did.  One on Zelenskyy.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    President Zelenskyy said in the Oval Office today that he was eager
to hear President Biden’s vision for Ukraine’s chances of joining NATO,
and he also said he’d like a timeframe for that.  What is President
Biden’s vision right now?  And does he have a timeframe?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s important for people to understand — not
you, necessarily, but everyone out there — that this is not a decision
that the United States makes, right?  We continue to support and we
continue to call for ensuring that NATO’s door remains open to aspirants
when they’re ready and able to meet the commitments and obligations of
membership and contribute to security in the Euro-Atlantic area.   
   
This is NATO membership, right?  And we reaffirmed and our Allies
reaffirmed in the June 2021 NATO Summit communiqué that we support
Ukraine’s right to decide its own future foreign policy, of course free
from outside interference, including with respect to Ukraine’s
aspirations to join NATO.   
   
There are steps that Ukraine needs to take; they’re very familiar with
these: efforts to advance rule of law reforms, modernize its defense
sector, and expand economic growth.  Those are steps that aspirant
countries like Ukraine need to take in order to meet NATO standards for
memberships.  And we certainly support their efforts to continue to do
that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Today is the first day in very many — and they’re all blending
together at this point — that the President did not have a meeting in
the Situation Room with his national security team.  I know there’s
stuff not on the schedule — the public schedule — but does the President
view this moment as a time where he can kind of shift at least some of
his focus to the myriad of other issues that are on his plate that he
wants to focus on or has wanted to focus on before the withdrawal became
such a huge issue?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he did receive a PDB this morning, as is, of course,
standard for most presidents, and those will certainly continue.   
   
Look, I think the President knows that he has responsibilities, and the
multiple crises he will continue to have to face as president are part
of his job description.  And if there is a meeting warranted in the
Situation Room with his military leaders, national security team about
Afghanistan or any other issue, of course he’s going to be there for
that.  
   
But he also knows that part of his commitment to the American people is
getting the pandemic under control, is addressing the hurricane and
making sure that people in Louisiana and Mississippi and other states in
the Gulf Coast know he’s doing absolutely everything in his power to
make sure they have power.   
   
I didn’t even mean to say it like that.  
   
But they — and so, he knows that he has to do multiple things as
president in order to govern the country.   
   
So, yes, of course, he will continue to work with his national security
team on a range of issues, whether it’s follow-ups, diplomatic efforts
in Afghanistan, or, of course, he’s right now meeting — having a meeting
with the leadership of Ukraine.  But he also knows he has a commitment
to address a range of issues to the public, and he’ll continue to do
that.  
   
Q    And just one more quick one.  One of your colleagues over at the
State Department briefed reporters earlier today, saying that,
anecdotally, they thought a majority of SIV folks in the SIV pipeline
did not get out.  I’m not minimizing the hundred-plus-thousand Afghans
that did get out, but is there any particular specific frustration,
given the President’s commitment to those who helped American personnel
on the ground, if a majority were not able to get out of country?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that of the numbers — and I know
they’re — Ed asked a question of this, and you all have been asking
understandable questions about the breakdown of numbers of people coming
out, and that is information we hope to have for you very soon.  
   
But 77 percent of the people who were evacuated were Afghans at risk —
SIV applicants, P1/P2 applicants.  Obviously, there’s a range of
programs, and the different names of them mean virtually nothing to most
people in the American public, but that is a number that stuck out to me
from the largest airlift in U.S. history.  
   
Are there more people who want to leave Afghanistan?  Absolutely.  Are
there more people who will be eligible for our programs?  Absolutely. 
And that’s why we are so focused on the diplomatic efforts that are
being led by the State Department, including a presence in Doha,
including efforts to engage with the Taliban, including efforts to work
with the international community to make clear what we expect.  
   
What is also true is that every person who wants to leave Afghanistan
and come to the United States is not going to be able to do that.  And
that is a sad truth, but it is — it is something that it’s important for
people to also understand.  
   
But I will say, we still want freedom of evacuation and movement for
people who want to depart.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  As FEMA continues to roll out aid in the Southeast —
and we’ve just looked at the historic nature of Hurricane Ida — is the
administration or FEMA at all looking at ways to proactively identify
people who may be eligible for disaster assistance, just given the
process of applying, how byzantine it may be for someone going through
these circumstances?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What we’re trying to do is make it as easy as humanly
possible — providing phone numbers, providing websites.  
   
I — as I noted, there are about 31,000 people who have already received
checks from — or 30,000 — sorry, 31,000, I think I said — from one of
these programs.   
   
So, what we have done — and I’ve been giving quite extensive toppers on
this each day to make sure you have all the information you need — is we
set up a quite a bit of preemptive resources in the region.  
   
I know you’re asking about economic assistance, and obviously we’ve —
we’ve worked to get that out the door as quickly as we can, but also to
set up generators, food, water, FEMA resources, using all of the
resources of government even before the storm hits.  That is something
that we tried to do to reduce the impact, save lives, make sure we’re
helping people as quickly as possible.  
   
Q    And then, just given President Biden’s trip on Friday, that 90 —
around 90 percent of New Orleans is still basically without power, what
precautions are you all taking to make sure that his trip to the city is
not going to take away from relief efforts?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  First of all, we absolutely would not go if it would take
away from relief efforts.  And this is a trip that will be — that is
being planned in close coordination with leaders on the ground to ensure
it’s the right time to go.  But we are not going to go to any part of
the state or visit any community where we would take away from relief
and restoration efforts.  
   
I’d also note, as I said in the — at the beginning of this briefing, the
President also spoke at the CEOs of the largest energy companies in the
Gulf Coast yesterday and committed the full weight of the federal
government.   
   
We know — he knows how important it is for people to get power back on. 
That is air conditioning at a time where it’s 90 degrees, right?  That
is people being able to be in their homes.  Maybe they’re in hotel rooms
right now, and they can go back.    
   
There’s a range of reasons why, of course, turning the power back on is
vital to the people of the state.  We’ve seen some success in
Mississippi, but he is pressing on that with every lever of the federal
government.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    A quick question on the rebuilding of the Gulf and also the
administration’s infrastructure bill.  Steel prices have doubled in the
United States in the last six months.  Is the administration ready to
remove tariffs on steel in order to bring down the cost for the
rebuilding efforts?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t — I know there’s obviously an ongoing review of a
range of tariffs.  I have nothing to report on that at this point in
time.   
   
We’re, right now, in the stage of recovery.  There will be an extensive
rebuilding stage, and we will continue to look for a range of ways we
can provide resources from the federal government to play a role in
that, but I don’t have anything to preview at this point in time.  
   
Q    And speaking of the tariff review, when can we expect the results
of the China tariff review?  And are you worried about customers paying
higher prices for imported products at a time when the supply chains are
crimped around the world?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you know, we have a very aggressive and ambitious
supply chain effort to address the challenges we’re seeing in the supply
chains.  We also were impacted — our supply chains around the world were
impacted a great deal by Delta, and we’re working in part to address and
help many countries recover from COVID so that we can get supply chains
up and running.  But I don’t have any timeline for you on when that
review will be completed.  
   
I will note that we look at our relationship with China and all the
components through a comprehensive package.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  One on Ukraine and one on abortion.  
   
On Ukraine, when the President was in Brussels, he was asked about
Ukraine getting into the NATO Membership Action Plan and, at the time,
he said, “school is out on that question.”  
   
I know the meeting is ongoing, but was that expected to come up in the
meeting, and is the President’s position still the same?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, as I noted a little bit earlier, there’s specific
steps the Ukrainians need to take in order to meet the requirements of
NATO membership.  We support the efforts of the Ukrainian leadership to
work exactly toward that.  And ther- — we support the efforts of any
aspirant who wants to join NATO who is working to meet those
objectives.  
   
Certainly, we expect — and I think they’ve said publicly they were
planning to raise it.  We’ll see.  But — but that has not changed.  
   
Q    On abortion, some activists today noted that the statement you put
out — put out on behalf of the President did not offer any specific
agenda of what’s next, or, again, specifically how the administration
plans to push back against the Texas law.  So, I just wanted to give you
a chance, if there are any specifics or internal planning, to share that
now.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as the President committed on the campaign trail and
remains committed to now, codifying Roe v. Wade as the law of the land
is something that Congress can do, he will continue to push them to do. 
And that is a specific course of action that can be taken to help
protect from these type of lawsuits in the future.  
   
Q    Is there anything else beyond that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can’t speak to any actions at the Department of Justice. 
They’re independent.  I don’t have anything to preview on that front.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Has the administration explored whether to grant Afghans living in
the United States, including refugees, Temporary Protected Status?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  TPS status?   
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, many of them are here through — because they were
eligible for SIV programs or eligible for refugee programs or a range of
programs that were in existence specific to Afghanistan.  So, I’m not a
— I don’t have anything to preview on that front, or I’m not aware of a
consideration of that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  President Biden will be 79 years old on November 20th. 
During the campaign, there was a lot of talk about how old he is and how
he would not be able to survive at the White House, especially in a time
of crisis.  But we’ve seen him during these crises — the COVID crisis,
the hurricane crisis, the Afghanistan crisis.  Do you think that people
should — those who called him “Sleepy Joe” should apologize to him?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t think we’re looking for an apology.  I think we’re
looking for allowing the President to continue to add- — address
multiple crises at a time, which is exactly what he has been doing over
the past few weeks.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Second — I have a second question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we’ve got to keep going here.  
   
Q    To come back to Texas again: So, on one of those specifics,
advocates are calling for the administration to lift restrictions on the
abortion pill as more states, as was mentioned, are expected to follow
Texas’s lead.  Is the administration going to do that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think that’s a decision that would be made by FDA, no?  So
that would be a decision made by FDA.  
   
Q    So that’s still working through the process?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  FDA is an independent — is an agency that makes their own
decisions.  
   
Q    One more on —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, go ahead.  
   
Q    Also, this has prompted many Democrats to look back at whether the
Supreme Court should be reshaped.  Has the President’s position changed
on that — on expanding the Court?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As you know, there’s an ongoing Court reform committee that
has been meeting.  It’s a diverse group.  They’re considering a range of
issues and topics, including what the future of the Court looks like.  I
think the President will wait for that process to complete before making
any evaluations.  
   
Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    And to follow on some of these: Are there steps that the
administration is taking right now to work with Congress to advance
legislation?  You’re saying the President will continue to call for the
codification of Roe, but is there something that this White House is
actually doing right now on the Hill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it requires members of Congress themselves to voting
to codify it, right?  But, of course, in the range of conversations we
have from senior leaders in the White House, there’s no question that
this is a topic and will be a topic, given the ruling — or given the
news this morning, in these conversations with members and their
staff.  
   
Q    And just one on COVID vaccine rates.  The White House COVID team
has been touting some pretty good numbers on vaccination rates.  Jeff
Zients said the other day that there were 4 million more shots in August
compared to July — more first shots.  What does the White House think is
driving that right now?  And is there something specific that the
federal government is doing to see that difference from July to
August?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ve — there’s a bunch of different data, and some of it is
in your polling, frankly, from some of your news organizations.  So I
can’t break it down for you, but what we’ve seen consistently as the
three factors are: mandates that have been put in place by companies,
private sector institutions, and others; fear of Delta, which is
understandable.  People are seeing horrifying stories on local news, on
national news of young people — in some cases, children — being
hospitalized, and that is scaring people, which is — we hate for that to
be the scenario, but that has certainly, we believe, prompted more
people to get vaccinated.  It is also possible that the FDA final
approval has prompted more people to get vaccinated.   
   
But I don’t have an exact breakdown.  But certainly, we’ve seen those as
the three biggest factors recently.  
   
Go ahead, in the middle.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  How does the manner in which the evacuation was
managed affect our relationship with the EU, considering some of the
concerns on the pullout weren’t listened to and the U.S. hasn’t removed
certain sanctions added under the Trump administration?  That’s my first
question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not sure I totally understand your question.  The last
part was which sanctions?   
   
Q    That the U.S. hasn’t removed certain sanctions that were added
under the Trump admini- —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  On the Taliban?  Or under who?  
   
Q    Well, in Iran — like, sanctions on Iran.  So that was — that was an
issue within the EU.  So some of those things sanctions that —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But you’re asking about Afghanistan or something else?  
   
Q    I’m asking you about how does the manner in which the evacuation
was managed — how does that affect our relationship with the EU?  And
then those are some other concerns as well.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say first that one of the biggest group — one
of the big groups we helped evacuate were some of the staff and partners
from our Allied countries — and many of them in Europe — over the course
of the last two weeks.  That was done by the U.S. military in
coordination with many of these countries.  
   
Two, we just signed a — got a U.N. Security Council resolution passed in
coordination with a number of these countries to make clear to the
Taliban what our expectations are.  
   
Three, these are many of the countries that worked with us to help build
a list of 100 countries — more than half the countries in the world —
making clear we are united in what we expect from the Taliban.   
   
So, I would say that is evidence of us working closely together.  
   
Q    Also, what are we to make of the fact that, you know, as soon as we
pull out, you see Republicans discussing adding $25 billion to the
Defense Authorization Act, but here, unemployment expires on Labor Day,
forbearance on some loans are about to expire, and we’re always talking
about how we don’t have money for human infrastructure, but we see this
being put forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You’re absolutely right.  I mean, I would say, first, it was
not the number one factor, but it did strike the President that we had
been spending, on average, $300 million a day in Afghanistan — $300
million a day.  We don’t think that’s something that most people in the
public are tracking, but it’s a war we fought for 20 years, spending
$300 million a day.  I’ll let you all do the math on that.  
   
So that is certainly a concern.  And certainly, as you noted, there are
a range of areas — domestically, internationally — to — where we feel
that money could be better spent  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Two foreign questions for you.  First of all, on these muster
points that were used in Kabul to evacuate people: Were those used only
for American citizens and permanent residents, or were they available
to, you know, SIVs and vulnerable Afghans?   
   
And also, did the Taliban give any assurances or assist in guaranteeing
those people safe passage?  And did they make any stipulations about who
could be evacuated under that specific (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, first, yes, we did use meeting at locations to get
others evacuated as well.  I’ll let the State Department and Defense
Department go into any further details should they choose to.   
   
I would also note that while that was the — a way that a great deal — a
number of American citizens were evacuated, there were also numbers who
came, of course, through the gates, including Afghans and vulnerable
Afghans who also came through the gates of the airport, especially in
the earlier days of the evacuation.   
   
And clearly, as I noted, of the more than 120,000 people who were
evacuated, 77 percent of them were — are at risk — were people at risk. 
And maybe that was the number that — of people coming to the United — I
got to check on that number.   
   
But that makes clear that the Taliban — yes, they did allow more than
120,000 people, including the vast majority of them vulnerable Afghans,
to get through.  Whether we met them at a checkpoint, whether we got
them through the gates — that is true.   
   
That does not mean we think the Taliban are good actors; we don’t.  But
we needed to work with them in coordination to get this done, and as a
result, it was the largest airlift in U.S. history.  
   
Q    On Russia and Saudi Arabia, just quickly.  On these reports that
they’ve inked some military deals: Has the administration reached out to
Saudi about what appears to be Riyadh’s concern that they can no longer
rely on Washington?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are in touch with a range of partners, including leaders
in Saudi Arabia.  I’d point you to the State Department for any updated
conversations with them.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Thank you, everyone.  Have a good day.  We’ll see you
tomorrow.   
   
Q    What about Americans left behind in Afghanistan, Jen?  The
President said the buck stopped with him.  Can you care to elaborate on
that?  What does the President plan to do to get Americans back home?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He also said yesterday he’s getting them home, and we’re
going to do exactly that.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.
