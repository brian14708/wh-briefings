title: Remarks by President Biden and Prime Minister Morrison of Australia Before
  Bilateral Meeting

12:09 P.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Scott, Mr. Prime Minister, it’s great to have
you here.  It’s good to see my friend, Prime Minister Morrison, and —
today in New York.  And I look forward to welcoming him to the White
House on Friday, I guess, when the Quad meets, which will be a good
in-person meeting.  
   
The United States has no closer or more reliable ally than Australia. 
Our nations have stood together for a long, long time.  And you can — we
can rely on one another, and that’s really a reassuring thing.   
   
We’re grateful that our partnership has accomplished what we’ve
accomplished together over 70 years.   
   
And we have a big agenda to discuss today, starting with our partnership
to advance our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.  
   
And this — this conversation that we’re going to continue with Japan,
India — and India, on Friday, and — in the first in-person Quad leaders
meeting is a historic event.  And we’re — I think we’re all looking
forward to it.  
   
The United States and Australia are working in lockstep on the
challenges that I laid out today in my speech to the United Nations:
ending COVID, addressing the climate crisis, defending democracy,
shaping the rules of the road for the 21st century. Because I meant what
I said: We are at an inflection point; things are changing.  We either
grasp the change and deal with it, or we’re going to be left behind —
all of us.  
   
And so, I want to thank you again, Scott, for — it’s great to see you. 
I look forward to working with you and all your team.  And — and the
floor is yours.  
   
PRIME MINISTER MORRISON:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you for
your warm welcome and to the entire delegation.   
   
I think it’s very important we’re meeting here in New York.  This month,
we mark the 70th anniversary of the ANZUS alliance.  There have been 14
Australian prime ministers since Sir Robert Menzies and 14 U.S.
presidents that have stewarded this great partnership.  
   
The one time the ANZUS alliance was invoked was when the towers came
down here in New York and were attacked.  And that invoked the ANZUS
alliance for the first and only time.  
   
And so, to both mark that event and remember all of those who were lost
on that day, we reflect on, frankly, more than 100 years of our
partnership where we have stood together through the most difficult of
times and the most prosperous of times.  
   
And the United States and Australia have always shared a partnership
that is about a world order that favors freedom, and that’s why we’ve
always stood together.  
   
And in pursuing that freedom, it, of course, goes to our security
interests.  But more than that, it goes to global prosperity.  It goes
to global freedom, the freedom of our seas, the freedom of our region. 
It goes to addressing the global challenges of climate change, a new
energy economy, and a very — very challenging future, but one that our
partnership, I have no doubt, will be able to address.  
   
But it’s not just about our partnership, because our partnership reaches
out to so many others, whether it be our friends in the ASEAN nations or
in Europe or elsewhere, where we share so many like-minded interests.   
   
And so, the issues we discuss in our partnership today really do reach
out to so many others in terms of how we address the global
challenges.  
   
So, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership and your
focus on the Indo-Pacific region.  There’s no doubt you get it.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I think the last point you made is important.  It goes
well beyond just our partnership.  Our partnership is in line with all
the other democracies in the world.   
   
And we got a lot of work to do.  So, thank you all very much.
