  \ Vilsack, and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, September 8,\_2021"

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:16 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  So, today we have two special guests. 
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and National Economic Council
Director Brian Deese are here to talk to you about what we’re seeing
behind increases in grocery food prices and what the Biden-Harris
administration is doing to lower prices for families.  
   
Brian will discuss the details of the data, namely that beef, pork, and
poultry are the real drivers of increased grocery store bills, and that
there’s an underlying corporate consolidation problem with
meat-processing giants that we need to address so that families can pay
lower prices at the grocery store and farmers and ranchers can earn
more.  
   
And Secretary Vilsack will discuss the actions our administration is
taking to build back a better food system, which includes: stepping up
antitrust enforcement; investing in small businesses, workers, and a
more competitive supply chain; our efforts to get ahead of
climate-related disruptions; and the need for legislation to make cattle
markets more transparent and fair.  
   
And they’ll take a few questions.  With that, I will turn it over to
Brian.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Great.  Thanks, Jen.  And it’s good to see all of you.  I
will be — I’ll be brief and just provide a little bit of market context
and then let Secretary Vilsack really get into the steps we’re taking as
an administration.  
   
But as Jen said, the context here is the focus — the appropriate focus
on the question of grocery prices and the increase in grocery prices
that we have seen recently over the last couple of months.  
   
And if we — if we unpack that, one of the interesting findings of the
report that we put out today is that about half of the overall increase
in grocery prices can be attributed to a significant increase in prices
in three products: in beef, in pork, and in poultry.  And in beef and in
pork, we’ve seen double-digit increases in prices over the last couple
of months.   
   
In fact, if you look at the category that is grocery prices, what
economists call “food at home” — so food that is being purchased to eat
at home — in a number of areas, we’ve seen — if you take out those three
categories, we’ve actually seen price increases that are more in line
with historical norms.  And we’ve seen, in some categories — for
example, fresh fruits and vegetables — prices have actually declined
since the end of last year.   
   
And if you look at a category of prices like eggs — obviously a similar
supply chain, similar input and feed costs to poultry — the price of
eggs has actually come down over the last couple of months.  The real
drivers in these three areas — these three proteins.   
   
If you look at that market, the thing that is striking is — across beef,
poultry, and pork — significant consolidation in those industries.  So
anywhere from 55 to 85 percent of the market is controlled by the top
four producers in those industries.   
   
And so when you see that level of consolidation and the increase in
prices, it raises a concern about pandemic profiteering — about
companies that are driving price increases in a way that hurts consumers
who are going to the grocery store, and also isn’t benefitting the
actual producers — the farmers and the ranchers — that are growing — are
growing the product.   
   
And the report that we’ve outlined today details that, in these
industries, the four top companies in these industries have seen record
or near-record profits in the first and second quarter of this year and
seen near or approaching record gross margins as well.   
   
So we have a story of consolidated industries with companies that are
generating record profits and then driving price increases for consumers
without price — without passing on those benefits to the underlying
producers.   
   
So this raises for us one of the issues that was core to the President’s
direction to all of us and his entire Cabinet: to focus on ways that
promoting more competitive practices and more competition across
industries could actually lower prices for consumers and benefit
middle-class families.   
   
And so, with Secretary Vilsack in the lead, we have been focused on
steps that we can take as a federal government to try to drive more
price transparency, encourage greater competition in this sector in an
effort to help ranchers, help farmers, and help consumers at the grocery
store as well.   
   
This is part of the President’s competition executive order that he
signed a few months back.  We’ll be holding the inaugural meeting of the
President’s Competition Council on Friday at which this will be one of
several issues that we will discuss — about promoting greater
competition across the economy.   
   
But these steps are important and this effort is important because we’re
trying to also shine a light on the fact that these price increases that
are affecting consumers are not happening in isolation and that
companies are making decisions to drive these price increases.  
   
At the end of the day, what we want to do is work with industry to try
to generate better outcomes for end consumers, better outcomes for
farmers, and we think the steps that we’re taking today can help move us
in that direction.  
   
So without further ado on that, I want to pass it over to Secretary
Vilsack who will talk about those steps that he is leading on behalf of
the administration.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Brian, thanks very much.  It’s good to be with
everyone today.  
   
You know, basically, the Department of Agriculture sees this in — as
basically two functions, two responsibilities.  Goal number one is to
make sure that farmers get a fair return for their efforts in their
capital investment.  And the second goal is to make sure that when
consumers go to the grocery store and they’re at the checkout counter,
they get fairer prices.  
   
And the reality is today that farmers are losing money on cattle, on
hogs, and poultry that they’re selling, at a time when consumers are
seeing higher prices at the grocery store and, as Brian alluded to, the
fact that there are now record profits or near-record profits for those
in the middle.   
   
So part of this is a function of consolidation and concentration, and
we’ve learned during the pandemic that this is also a resiliency issue. 
When there was a major disruption in processing capacity because there
are so few processors, we saw significant disruption at the marketplace
as well.   
   
So this administration is focused on four major steps to try to take
action in this area.  First, strengthening the current regulatory system
that we have — our Packers and Stockyards Act — to make sure that we are
identifying and holding people accountable for unfair and discriminatory
practices and that regulatory changes are now being undertaken as we
speak.   
   
Secondly is to make sure that there’s adequate price discovery in the
market.  Because there is such consolidation, there is very little cash
transaction that takes place in this market, and so it’s very difficult
to determine whether or not the prices that are being paid to farmers
are fair.  And so we are producing studies — recently a couple of
studies — to provide more price discovery.  Certainly, we want to work
with Congress in their efforts legislatively to pass legislation that
will expand the capacity for us to have information.   
   
Third, we want to make sure that when people go into the grocery store
and they see things that are labeled “a product of the U.S.,” we want to
make sure that consumers fully understand and appreciate precisely what
that means or what it doesn’t mean, and whether people are taking
advantage of whatever value-added opportunity that might present to
increase price.  
   
And finally, expanding processing capacity and maintaining the small and
— and very small processing facilities that are dotting the landscape
today.  We provided additional resources to keep those small processing
companies in business recently by announcing about $150- to $160 million
of assistance and help.  And we have put together a $500 million effort
to work with states and local governments, as well as nonprofit
organizations and the livestock industry, to look for ways in which we
can finance expanded processing capacity.  
   
We’re doing this at the same time that agriculture is confronted not
just with the issue of concentration and consolidation, but also the
impacts and effects of severe weather, which are linked in part to
climate — whether it’s forest fires or drought or hurricanes. 
Obviously, that’s also causing a disruption.  And as we build this
broader processing capacity, we also want to build a more resilient food
system.  
   
And right now, we’re deeply concerned about the impacts and effects of
drought on these beef prices and pork prices and poultry prices because
it could lead, potentially, to people having to sell their herds because
they can’t simply afford the cost of maintaining them, particularly in
the western part of the U.S.   
   
For that reason, we’ve looked at a number of different steps to try to
provide help and assistance to deal with the drought.  And today, we
identified yet another way in which we can provide help and
assistance.   
   
Historically, we’ve always provided resources to farmers to be able to
pay for the cost of hauling water to their facilities.  If they had a
situation with a drought and they needed to access additional water,
there’s a cost associated with that, and we helped to defer some of that
expense.   
   
We’re now changing that program.  The Emergency Livestock Assistance
Program, called ELAP — we’re now changing that to include also
assistance and help for transportation expense for feed.   
   
We know that these farmers, particularly in the western U.S., are going
to be confronted with having to truck or rail feed from far distances,
and that’s going to be an incredibly increased cost to them.   
   
So we’re going to use this emergency program to provide up to 60 percent
of the additional cost that they’re incurring above and beyond what they
would normally incur for transportation expense.  And for limited
resource farmers, it could be as high — as much as 90 percent of
assistance in help. And the goal here is to focus on those areas that
have been designated serious drought areas — D2 for eight consecutive
weeks, or D3 or greater.  
   
The hope is that by providing this resource, we’ll be able to make it
easier for farmers to stay in business and, therefore, not basically
create more disruption in the market.   
   
So, a combination of focusing on concentration and consolidation, as
well as making sure that we continue to look for ways to make the system
more resilient are steps that we’re taking pursuant to the President’s
directive.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Mr. Secretary, Brian, could you guys please go back
to this pandemic profiteering that you mentioned?  You said there are —
up to 85 percent of the market is controlled by the top four industry
big names.  So, are these the companies that are — that you suspect of
profiteering right now?  Forgive me if this is an ignorant question:
What are these companies?  Who are they?  What are the top four?  And
what specifically are you seeing as it relates to this profiteering?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Sure, let me —  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Yeah, go ahead.  
   
MR. DEESE:  — let me just start, and then the Secretary should jump
in.  
   
I think — so, with respect — with respect to — with respect to the data,
if you look at the beef industry, for example, the top four — the top
four meat processors control 85 percent of the market.  That’s in
contrast to — I mentioned the issue of eggs earlier, where a far less
concentrated — the top four processors there are in control of about 30
percent of the market.   
   
And what we’ve seen is that those — those four companies — those four —
those four companies — we can get you the details — it includes JBS,
Tyson.  We — it’s in the report that we put out.  Those companies have
seen record or near-record profits in the first half of this year.  And
that has coincided with a period where we’ve seen a disproportionate
increase in prices in those segments, and that that actually is driving
about half of the increase in overall grocery prices, in overall food —
food away from — food-at-home prices.   
   
And so, it raises this question of: In this consolidated industry, are
those price increases being driven by, you know — or being passed on to
the — the growers?  And what we see — the real concern we have is that
consumers are facing higher prices, and the growers are not getting paid
higher.  And that raises real concern and a real question, which is,
what’s motivating this focus and the actions that we’re taking.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  And I would just simply say, you know, there’s
reason for concern here.  The Department of Justice recently had a
price-fixing case involving Tyson, where clearly there was some
wrongdoing that took place.  And so it’s not something that we are — you
know, it’s not something we’re dreaming up here.  The profits are
real.   
   
The fact that producers are not making a profit — I mean, I remember
talking to a producer the other day in Council Bluffs, and he said, “I
don’t get this, Mr. Secretary.”  He said, “I just sold my cattle and I
lost $150 a head, but the processor made $1,800 a head.  How can that
be?”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  April?

Q    Yes.  Secretary Vilsack, two questions.  One, you’re  
saying “profiteering.”  Would you go as far as price gouging, as well as
saying that word, “price gouging” — those words, “price gouging”?  
   
And then, also, as you talk about farmers right now, in this moment — in
this season of COVID, in this season of hurt, I want to go to the Black
farmer.  There is an effort by this administration to help the Black
farmer — that Lindsey Graham has said is “reparations.”  Could you give
us the state of the Black farmer as you’re talking about average farmers
right now?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Sure.  Let me answer that question — last question
first.   
   
There are now 13 separate lawsuits that are directed at the debt relief
efforts that were passed in the American Rescue Plan.  We’re obviously
going through the process of litigation, building the record — and we’ll
proceed.   
   
In the meantime, you know, we’re really focused on those farmers who are
distressed, those farmers who are low-income farmers.  And just to give
you a sense of this: 89.6 percent of American farmers today — today — do
not make a majority of their income from farming.  And so that is a call
to action.   
   
And that’s why, in the American Rescue Plan, the President and Congress
included a provision that is encouraging us to take a look at ways in
which we can expand market access and land access for those financially
stressed farmers.   
   
So one of the things we did with — again, with the American Rescue Plan,
is we identified procurement.  We purchased a lot of emergency food for
food banks.  In the past, we have purchased that food from large-scale
distributors, probably some of whom are doing business with JBS and
Tyson and Smithfield and so forth.   
   
But we think maybe it would be a good idea for us to also use a few of
those procurement dollars to help local and regional distributors, and
to focus and direct some of those resources, as well, on low-income,
distressed farmers, producers.   
   
So we are now using our — what we refer to as our flexible TEFAP
program, or temporary assistance program, to use resources to basically
create market opportunities to create better balance and greater
resiliency in the system.  We just can’t have this concentration on just
— you know, focusing on just a few.  We need to have greater diversity
across the — across the board here.   
   
So we’re looking for ways to increase market, increase land access, make
it easier, obviously, on the debt side.  And that’s — that’s going on.  
   
Q    But what about the “profiteering” versus “price gouging,” I asked
you (inaudible)?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, look, again, if I’m losing $150 a head on my
cattle, and the guy who’s buying it from me — who’s forcing me to take
that price — is charging and making $1,800 a head, I don’t know what you
call it, but what I do know is that our job is to make sure that that
farmer gets a fair price and that the producer — that the — when I go to
the grocery store and I’m in the checkout line, I’m paying a fair price;
I’m not paying more than I should.   
   
And right now, because of the concentration, we have two issues here:
One, we have the issue of fairness; and two, we have the issue of
resiliency.  Any one of these facilities, whether it’s a cyberattack in
JBS or whether it’s COVID basically shutting down some of Tyson’s
facilities, it causes disruption in the market.  We need a much more
resilient system.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Trevor.  
   
Q    One for each of you.  Brian, for you: How did you integrate climate
into this decision?  I think meat production and consumption is one of
the leading greenhouse gas-emitting areas of the economy.  And don’t
higher prices, kind of, disincentivize that kind of behavior?   
   
And then for you, Secretary Vilsack — we asked you this in May: But
where are you on the Twin Metals copper mine decision?  Are you going to
allow that, or are you going to block that?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Sure.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, so on the — on the — on the first, the goal — and just
to pick up on something that the Secretary just said — our goal here is
to work with industry to get to a better outcome that is — ends up with
a fairer outcome for consumers and a fairer outcome for American
farmers.  
   
And when the lack of competition doesn’t benefit — you know, that we
want to work with industry because, actually, the lack of competition
also leads to resiliency issues.  And one of the things that we’ve seen
— I mean, we all have experienced in this pandemic — is that a serial
underinvestment in the resilience of supply chains, coupled with
consolidation in particular industries, left our economy extraordinarily
vulnerable.  And we continue to live with the consequences of that.   
   
And so, in that context, we — you know, we think it’s pretty — we think
it’s pretty important not only to address the very practical issue that
Secretary Vilsack is describing about the market dynamics, but also to
remind everybody that we just lived through an extraordinary period of
time where demand for these products was sustained by extraordinary
government action.   
   
Incredibly appropriate to make sure that food insecurity and other basic
human needs didn’t fall off during this pandemic, but at the same time,
going back, and to — you know, to borrow a phrase the President drills
into us every day: without building back better to a more resilient
system puts all of us at risk.   
   
On the question — and resilience is also important with respect to the
realities of the climate-affected world and a climate-affected country
and those involved — the kind of investments that Secretary Vilsack was
talking about — in having more resilience against the reality of more
frequent and severe extreme weather events, but also transitioning our
agricultural system to be part of an effort to actually reduce emissions
across the board.   
   
I think, you know, we have, with the Secretary’s leadership, the most
ambitious strategy of any — of any administration in history that the
agricultural sector will actually be part of moving us and creating new
markets in — as we — as we address climate change.   
   
But we can do that in a way that actually doesn’t end up in a situation
where American consumers are left paying higher prices and American
farmers are left with less income.  That’s sort of 0 for 2.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mara.  
   
Q    Yeah.  You mentioned the —  
   
Q   Sorry, there was —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, sorry.  I’m sorry —    
   
Q    Sorry.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mr. Secretary, go ahead.   
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Yeah, I just want to underscore that point, and then
I’ll answer you Twin Metals point.  
   
The fact that we can create new revenue streams for these farmers by
conversion of agricultural waste into a variety of products basically
will mean that that farmer gets a fair — fairer return, a broader
return, more return on his or her investment, and that consumer gets a
decent price at the counter.  That’s not an — that is a possibility —
it’s a real possibility in this administration with the passage of the
reconciliation bill and the Build Back — the infrastructure bill will
have the resources to be able to create that kind of new opportunity.

On Twin Metals, we continue to wait for the Department of Interior. 
They have to issue a legal opinion before we know what direction we need
to take at USDA.  It’s conditioned upon the DOI.  We’re waiting for the
DOI.

MS. PSAKI:  Mara.

Q    You mentioned that DOJ has a price-fixing case against Tyson.  How
much of the profiteering and the lack of competition do you think is
illegal?  And what are you going to do about it? 

MR. DEESE:  Well, so I — we — I want to be very clear that the
President’s executive order directs the Department of Justice and the
FTC to train their enforcement on potential illegal activities,
including price fixing and price gouging.   
   
We’re going to leave that to the enforcement agencies — that’s their
appropriate role — and not for the White House to interfere with.  What
we are focused on here is policy issues that can actually help to get at
the underlying issue of concentration. 

So, for example, the investment that Secretary Vilsack was talking about
in encouraging more entrants — more small and new entrants into this
market.  That’s the kind of step that we can take to help encourage more
competition and help reduce the likelihood that concentration leads to
the opportunity for those type of illegal activities.   
   
But with respect to the enforcement — the specific enforcement issues,
both as they’ve resolved or as they may be ongoing, we would leave that
to the FTC.  
   
Q    Do you have a sense of how much of this problem is illegal? 
Regardless of the enforcement and what DOJ is going to do about it, I’m
just asking you: Is it like 10 percent, 50 percent?  How much of this
consolidation and profiteering is illegal, in your mind?

MR. DEESE:  Right.  Precisely because I’m going to leave those
investigations to those agencies, I’m not going to speculate on —  
   
Q    So, you don’t know.

MR. DEESE:  — I’m not going to speculate on the work that they have
undergoing.  What I can tell you is that our — you know, we believe this
is a problem.  We believe that this is a problem that’s affecting
consumers and farmers alike.  And we believe that there are concrete
steps that we need to take and that we can take to try to help improve. 

MS. PSAKI:  Weijia.

Q    Thank you.  Mr. Secretary, farmers want you to reverse the Trump
administration’s decision to dissolve GIPSA so there is an independent
agency that can focus on promoting competition and fair trade practices
instead of being buried into AMS.  Are you going to reestablish GIPSA? 

SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, that’s a slightly different area.  GIPSA
basically takes a look at grading grain and things of that nature,
okay?  It’s not really into the Packers and Stockyards area.

What farmers really want us to do is what we are doing, which is to
enforce the Packers and Stockyards and strengthen that.  That’s the
vehicle by which you can determine whether the poultry tournament
system, for example, is fairly compensating poultry farmers, or whether
there is a circumstance where packers are discriminating or unfairly
treating producers.  So, that’s our focus right now, is making sure that
the Packers and Stockyards Act is strengthened. 

You know, we’re going to continue to do the grading necessary to make
sure that people understand what, you know, grade 2 corn is and that it
meets a certain standard.  I don’t think you necessarily have to
reinstitute GIPSA to do that, but you do have to focus on the Packers
and Stockyards Act.

Q    But when GIPSA was disbanded, you know a lot of farmers were very
concerned.  Are you saying you think that they can operate stronger the
way it is structured under AMS than it was before — before Trump?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  They can operate stronger when you have the
enforcement tools and mechanisms with the Packers and Stockyards.
 That’s what’s been missing.  It isn’t so much the structure or where
within AMS this would — this would still be within AMS; it would just be
a missionary within AMS.  
   
It isn’t that; that’s not the issue.  The issue is what tools do we
have, if there is an unfair practice taking place, if there’s a
discriminatory practice.  If the poultry system is not treating poultry
producers fairly, what tools do we have?  Right now, we don’t have very
strong tools.  We are strengthening those tools so we can call out bad
behavior. 

MS. PSAKI:  Phil.

Q    Brian, just to broaden it out a little bit: Between the EO, public
comments, some letters you’ve sent, you guys have made clear you want —
on the enforcement side of things — to be more aggressive than they have
been in the past.  Are you and the President comfortable that the
enforcement arms of these agencies have been as aggressive as you want
them to be?  
And, I guess, secondly, there’s some sense inside the White House that
just taking this posture may preemptively cause companies to lower
prices or be more willing.  Have you seen any tangible results tied to
that?   
   
MR. DEESE:  So, on the first — on the first question, the answer is,
“Yes and.”  The President’s executive order directed the creation of a
Competition Council precisely so that we can get the appropriate federal
agencies, both the Cabinet agencies and the independent agencies,
together to make sure that we are all working as effectively as possible
toward the goal of that executive order.  
   
So, on Friday, we will be convening with Attorney General Garland and a
number of the other relevant agencies to discuss steps that each agency
is independently taking but then how these all work together.  And the
truth is that, you know, just that information sharing is incredibly
important because, you know, some of these issues that we’re talking
about here are intimately related to logistics and transportation
issues.   
So, the steps that, you know, Secretary Buttigieg is taking at the
Department of Transportation with respect to our ports and our trucking
and logistics, you can’t — you know, you can’t effectively solve these
issues without having that cross-functional approach.   
   
So, we’ll continue to do that and continue to stay focused, at the
President’s direction, on making sure that we’re living up to the
commitments on the executive order.  
   
With respect to your second question, certainly we believe that it’s
long overdue to have a clear public focus on competition and enforcing
anti-trust statutes.  It’s probably — it’s probably been some time, I
don’t know if ever — it may be the first time ever that GIPSA was issued
from the — from the podium at the Whi- — (laughter) — but, you know,
some time to have the Secretary of Agriculture stating a priority — the
enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act.  And we believe that that
does send an important signal to the market and that these steps in the
aggregate send signals.   
   
Certainly we’ve seen some — you know, we’ve seen some instances —
there’s been some mergers that you and others have covered recently. 
So, I think that we are — you know, we are hopeful that by making clear
that this is a priority, that we can bring industry together to more
constructively try to solve these issues, and including, you know,
ultimately, the decisions that, you know, private companies will make.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  We can do about two more.  Alex.  
   
Q    Maybe the Secretary can speak to this: Do you have a sense of when
these moves will be felt by consumers and sort of trickle down into
lower prices?  Because these are problems that are pretty systemic and
have been going on for a while.   
   
And then I have a question for Brian about the economy overall.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, there’s no question that our intent is to try
to get these processing plants and projects going very quickly.  We’ve
already been able to identify a couple of projects that would be helped
by our resources.  And so, I think you will expect to see, at the end of
this year and early next year, some progress there.   
   
That’s going to send a strong message, to Brian’s point, to the industry
that there’s going to be competition, and they’re going to have to
respond and react to it.   
   
So, the hope would be that they do — that they respond accordingly and,
again, farmers get fair prices and that consumers are getting fair
prices at the grocery store.  
   
Q  And then, Brian, on the economy, the White House has long been
promoting these very strong projections for the growth of the economy.
 This week, though, Goldman Sachs downgraded its projections for the
economy.  So, has the White House overpromised?  Are you at all
concerned that you’ve set expectations too high at this point?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, it’s a — it’s a good question, and I think it’s also one
in which, you know, the private forecaster that you mentioned downgraded
its forecast, but even with a downgraded forecast, growth in 2021 would
be the strongest that we’ve seen in decades.   
   
So, what we are seeing, I think, is the record and historic strength of
this recovery, not just historically compared to other recoveries from
crises and recessions in the United States, but record globally right
now.   
   
The United States is the only developed country where GDP has already
recovered to its pre-pandemic level.  That hasn’t — that’s happened
nowhere else in the world.  The strength of the — of our — of economic
growth and of growth in the labor market is sufficient that we can
continue to see strong growth, even as we deal with unanticipated
circumstances, even as we work through the COVID — the Delta challenges
that the President will speak to tomorrow.  
   
So, we continue to be focused on the fact of trying — to how can we
continue to build momentum into that recovery.  But even as we see these
step-downs, I think the thing that is most notable about that is that
even with these headwinds, we’re seeing the United States continue to
outpace our international peers and continue to outpace our historic
progress for, you know, recoveries — at similar points in recoveries.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right, Josh.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Last one.  
   
Q    Sir, can you just circle back to the what the DOJ active file is? 
Your blog mentioned it was a poultry investigation, but a year ago there
was a civil one launched into beef.  Is there one on pork, and are you
adding or expanding these investigations?  Because this seems where the
real teeth would be — right? —  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well —  
   
Q    — if you gave DOJ, you know, more firepower of some kind to pursue
this.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  The one — the case I mentioned was a poultry
case.   
   
Q    Right.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  So that’s — I’m not —  
   
Q    So we have poultry and beef going on now but not pork?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  I’m not aware of a pork case.  There could be, but
I’m not aware of it.  Okay?  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  That’s sort of outside of our jurisdiction.  The
only time we ever get engaged in this is if the Department of Justice
contacts us and says, “Hey, we need some information or data.”  We —
it’s not that we precipitate those investigations.  It’s a Department of
Justice function, appropriately so.   
   
What we are doing — in terms of the tools, the Department of Justice has
the capacity and the ability — and they exercise it — under their
current statutory framework.   
   
What we don’t have — what we’re now going to get — are tools that will
allow us to take more definitive action, more aggressive action when we
see unfair and discriminatory practices.  We don’t have that power now. 
We tried to get it during the Obama administration; Congress blocked
it.  We now think we’re in a position to move forward on this, and we’re
going to aggressively move forward on it.  
   
Q    Anti-trust cases, obviously, raise a question of whether you’re
interested in looking at breaking up these companies somehow.  Is that
what the administration is —  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, I think the fact —  
   
Q    — open to at all?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  No.  I think the fact that we have put $500 million
on the table and, basically, have begun a process of reaching out to
states, to farm organizations, to philanthropic organizations, and
asking the question: “What could you do with this resource that would
allow us to significantly increase the processing capacity in this
country in places where we know there is a need for this, where there
are not competitive markets?”  And the reaction to this has been quite
favorable.   
   
I would anticipate and expect that this $500 million is going to
leverage additional resources from those sources.  And I think — I think
we’re going to find out that maybe we’re onto something here, and we may
end up looking at numbers north of $500 million.  
   
Q    So you’re more interested in, I guess, incentivizing or building
production outside these big four, rather than breaking up the big
four?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  I’m looking at what I have power to do.  
   
Q    Right.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  And I have power to basically put the $500 million
on the table.  I have power to do Packers and Stockyards.  I have power
to do more price discovery.  I have power to take a look at product
labels to make sure that they’re not misrepresenting or confusing
customers and consumers.  And that’s what we’re doing.  We’re doing
everything we have the power to do, and we’re strengthening the tools to
be able to do it.  
   
Q    Brian, can you quickly address the debt limit question?  Secretary
Yellen wrote Speaker Pelosi today warning about that.  What is your read
of that?  How much time do you have left until the debt limit becomes a
problem?  (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, on the time question, I would just refer you exactly
to Secretary Yellen.  I don’t have anything to add to Secretary Yellen’s
letter, which outlined her current — the Treasury’s current projection
of exhaustion.  
   
And more generally, I would just underscore that this is a
responsibility — a sacred responsibility that Congress has to operate in
a bipartisan way to raise or suspend the debt limit to address the fact
that these are — this is a reflection of actions and legislation that
Congress has already passed.  And so, there’s often, you know, a
confusion or conflation when it talks to the debt limits.   
   
But just to clarify and resolve: The debt limit is a function of bills
that Congress has already — has already passed and already racked up. 
In fact, 97 percent of the debt under question is associated with
actions that happened before this President — he was even taken into
office.   
   
In fact, even if — even if Congress took no future action ever, did
nothing else in the future, Congress would have to raise or suspend the
debt limit because it’s a reflection of actions already taken.   
   
And so, our expectation is that Congress will do so and will do so as it
has done historically, as it did three times under President Trump, and
operate in a bipartisan way to address this issue.  So that’s our
expectation.  
   
Q    If it doesn’t happen — a decade ago, one of the fallbacks was
something called “prioritization,” where you sort of decide who gets
paid and who doesn’t.  Is the — are you — is the administration going
down this road at all?  Is that the fallback plan if the limit isn’t
raised or suspended?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Our — our expectation is that Congress is going to act, and
act responsibly and consistent with its responsibility.  So that’s our —
that’s our expectation and our focus.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Thank you, Secretary Vilsack.  Thank you to our NEC
Director.   
   
MR. DEESE:  Thanks.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Okay, I don’t know that I have anything else at the
top.  I know we’ve covered a lot of bit — ground there.  I’m happy that
the GIPSA question was answered by my colleagues — (laughter) — there,
Weijia.  Relieved.  
   
Q    Thank you very much.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Alex, why don’t you kick us off.   
   
Q    Sure.  So the President’s remarks on the pandemic tomorrow — can
you preview any of what we should expect from him?  
   
And then also, I wanted to ask you — you know, he’s talked a lot about
defeating the pandemic in the past.  You, yesterday, said that his
remarks tomorrow will address how you’ll get the pandemic under
control.  So are we shifting to a point at which this pandemic can no
longer be defeated and we need to sort of live with it and figure out
how to get it under control?  Is that where the White House is now?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say, on your first question: So the
President, right now, is meeting with members of his COVID team to talk
about a range of steps, including his plan he’ll announce tomorrow — six
steps to stop the spread of Delta and increase vaccinations.   
   
And to kind of get to your second question, and then I’ll go through
some of the preview: We want to be specific about what we’re trying to
accomplish in this moment and what these six steps will do.  We know
that increasing vaccinations will stop the spread of the pandemic, will
get the pandemic under control, will return people to normal life. 
That’s what our objective is.  So we want to be specific about what
we’re trying to achieve.   
   
But I would just note that what you’re going to hear from the President
tomorrow is going to build on some of the steps that the President
announced over the course of the last few months.  We’ve been at war
with the virus for a long time, several months — more than a year, year
and a half.  We have been working — we’ve been at war with the Delta
variant over the course of the last couple of months.   
   
And just to remind you of some of the steps that we’ve announced: We’ve
announced new government mandates on DOD, our military forces; NIH;
other co- — the VA — the Veterans Affairs — Department of Veterans
Affairs — folks who are serving on the frontlines on the health — on
health — in health roles in that department.  We’ve also incentivized
additional mandates, whether it is in home — in healthcare facilities,
nursing homes, and others.  And we’ve also lifted up and incentivized
private sector — set private sector mandates because we’ve seen that
they have been effective.  We’ve also deployed over 700 surge response
teams across the country.  And work closely, again, with the private
sector to institute more requirements on vaccinations.   
   
And we’ve seen some impact from those steps.  Tens of millions of
Americans are now covered by vaccination requirements; 14 million
Americans got their first shot in August, which was an increase from
what we’d seen in the months prior — 4 million more than in July.  And
the increase in vaccinations has been a consistent trend.  
   
But he’s going to lay out these six steps tomorrow because we have more
work to do, and we are still at war with the virus and with the Delta
variant.  So we’re going to build on that work.  
   
And he’s speaking to it now because this issue, of course, is on — front
of mind, top of mind to Americans across the country.  People are
returning to schools.  Workplaces are either reopening — some brick and
mortar.  Or some people are just returning to work after spending some
time with family or loved ones over the summer.  
   
So he’s going to outline the next phase in the — in the fight against
the virus and what that looks like, including measures to work with the
public and private sector, building on the steps that we’ve already
announced — the steps we’ve taken over the last few months: requiring
more vaccinations, boosting important testing measures, and more —
making it safer for kids to go to school, all at a time when the
American people are listening.   
   
Again, this will be six steps that we’ll work to be implementing over
the months ahead.  
   
Q    And then one more on boosters.  The WHO — the head of the WHO is
calling on basically rich countries with vaccine surpluses to hold off
on booster shots until the end of the year.  What’s the White House
response to that?  And is it ethical to start moving forward with
booster shots at a time when so many countries are barely starting with
their first shots?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our view is that this is a false choice.  And the
United States has donated and shared about 140 million doses with over
90 countries, more than all other countries combined.  We’re donating
half a billion doses to 100 countries in need.  Last week, we announced
a plan to invest $2.7 billion in manufacturing critical vaccine inputs
and expanded fill-finish lines at factories.  From Senegal to South
Africa to India, we’ve made significant investments in boosting global
productions of COVID vaccines.  
   
At the same time, the President and this administration has a
responsibility to do everything we can to protect people in the United
States, in this country.  And as our health advisors have recommended
additional booster shots, we are working to implement that.  Our view is
we can do both.   
   
I’d also note that there are — in addition to access to vaccine doses,
one of the reasons that we have invested in areas like manufacturing
critical vaccine inputs, expanded fill-finish is because sometimes the
issues are also about distribution channels, about having enough
personnel who are trained to distribute these shots, manufacturing
capacity, certain — access to certain components that go into vaccines. 
We’re working through those as well.   
   
But we are doing both.  We think we can do both.  And we will continue
to do both from the United States.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  A couple questions on Texas.  The governor there was
asked about the lack of an exception for rape or incest in the abortion
law.  And I don’t know if you heard those comments, but he said — his
answer to that question was that “Texas will work tirelessly to make
sure that we eliminate…rapists off the street.”  I’m just wondering if
the White House has a response to that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, if Governor Abbott has a means of eliminating all
rapists or all rape from the United States, then there’ll be bipartisan
support for that.  But given there has never in the history of the
country, in the world, been any leader who’s ever been able to eliminate
rape, eliminate rapists from our streets, it’s even more imperative —
it’s one of the many reasons, I should say, not the only reason — why
women in Texas should have access to healthcare.   
   
So, it does not change our objectives; it does not change our
commitment.  The Department of Justice — the Attorney General announced
a step on Monday.  Our Department of Justice is continuing to look at
legal options.  Our Department of Health and Human Services is also
continuing to look at all options.  And the President has made clear
that it’s a priority to do everything we can to ensure women in Texas
have access to healthcare.  
   
Q    And I want to push a little bit on that front.  Just looking at
options, you know, for women who are in Texas right now who might be in
need of having an abortion, who perhaps are looking at this White House
for a Hail Mary intervention —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — the clock is ticking for them.  The clock is literally ticking
for them today.  So, in terms of their decision making, can this
administration offer any help to them now?  What would you tell these
women who are looking to this White House to help them?  Is help on the
way?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we would tell them first that this law is a violation
of your rights, and we are going to do everything we can to provide
assistance as quickly as we can.  One of the reasons why the Department
of Health and Human Services is a key component here is obviously
because they oversee the nation’s healthcare systems, but they are going
to look for ways to make sure we are providing access to healthcare to
women in Texas.   
   
I noted that the Department of Justice announced a step that they were
taking on Monday.  Clearly, this law is — or this bill that was signed
into law is something we strongly oppose, and there’s an urgency to
looking for and announcing actions to help women now.  And certainly, we
understand that women are looking at their choices right now — today,
tomorrow, last week — and we are hopeful we will have more to convey to
them directly.  
   
Q    But in terms of tangible help that’s on the way, would the White
House support the FDA lifting restrictions on mifepristone, the abortion
— so-called abortion pill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  This is a decision that the FDA has to make on their own
based on science.  And certainly we believe in the independence of the
FDA to make these decisions, and we know that there are a number of
advocates who have called for that, but we’ll leave that decision to the
FDA.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    The January 6 commission has asked for a number of documents from
executive agencies pertaining to actions by the prior administration.  I
believe the deadline for complying with that is tomorrow.  Is the
administration going to assist in that investigation in the way that
they have asked, or are you going to assert executive privilege?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  For documents from the prior administration?  
   
Q    Yes —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would have to check —  
   
Q    — that are in your custody.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, a number of these — though I know we’ve had
conversations about this before, and I’d have to check with the
Counsel’s Office — are not in the White House.  They are documents that
often go to the Archives or other localities that are not overseen by
the White House.  So I’d have to check and see what documents we would
actually have access to here or if there are other places, parts of
government that would be the ones who would have control of these
documents.  
   
Q    And just want to check if the White House Counsel is going to weigh
in on that decision.  Would your recommendation to those agencies be to
comply or to assert executive privilege?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, if they are — if we’re talking about documents in the
National Archives, that wouldn’t be our purview here.  Those would be
documents — and I think we’ve had discussions along these lines before,
so I’d have to check on whether there is any applicability to anything
we’ve had over- — we would have oversight of from this White House
currently.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then one economic question.  There was Labor Department
data this morning that showed a record number of job openings — 10.9
million job openings.  But we also still have millions of people who are
unemployed and been sitting on the sidelines for a very long time.  Just
curious if there’s any new approach that the administration is going to
take to helping employers get their jobs filled.  It’s curtailing
economic growth.  So —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think you’re talking about the JOLTS data —  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — which is rele- — which is — pertains to July data, so it
is a little bit old at this point in time, given we’re into September. 
And we’ve seen jobs numbers come out in that period of time where we’ve
seen that, still, an average of 700,000 jobs per month are being created
— or people are being matched with jobs in that period of time.   
   
Look, I think what we look at is the data across the period of ti- —
across a broad period of time.  We know employers are continuing to look
for workers to hire, and worker power is rising as workers have more
choices available to them, and that continues to be the case.  And we
believe that having workers empowered is a good sign.   
   
We are also seeing that we are continuing — we’ve created now, to date,
4 million new jobs — more jobs than any other administration in this
period of time in American history.  That’s also a good sign.  
   
So I would say that, as we look at our efforts here, we look at whether
employers — and we recommend, of course — whether employers are offering
a livable wage, whether they’re offering benefits to attract workers. 
And we’re also seeing continued positive signs in month-over-month
trends as it relates to the economy and job creation.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is there any sense — you know, when you at the uptick in
vaccinations, mandates and requirements I think are broadly popular when
you look at polling around the country right now — given the scale of
the Delta surge that’s continued over months, that perhaps you should
have been more aggressive earlier when it came to pursuing policies like
that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we have seen — yes, they’re not only popular, but they
are also effective.  We’ve also known as, say, the federal government —
as one of the biggest employers in the country — that we knew we would
take a — an approach over time to implement any mandates, or mandates
that would require vaccination by employees.   
   
There are some companies out there that were waiting for final approval
by the FDA.  There also were some companies that wanted a period of time
to implement mandates.  That’s all understandable.   
   
So our view is: This is certainly one of the ways that we’ve seen more
people get vaccinated.  We’ve seen it be effective, and we’ve seen it
rise in approval and support across the country as people who are
vaccinated are increasingly popular.   
   
But all we can do at this point is look forward and determine how we can
take steps now to continue to get more people vaccinated and get the
pandemic under control.   
   
Q    And then one on the flights that have been stuck in Afghanistan.  I
understand State is leading on this, but you guys have made clear you’re
paying very close attention to the American citizens still in the
country.  I’m trying to square where things actually stand.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    The Secretary of State said a couple of times it was a
documentation issue.  A U.S. senator, Richard Blumenthal, pushed back
vociferously on that.  Today, the Secretary of State said the Taliban
are not permitting the charter flights to leave, kind of putting it
precisely on them.  What’s your understanding of the holdup?  And if the
Taliban is preventing them, what levers do you have right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there — a couple pieces are true here.  So, one is: We
are continuing to press the Taliban — the Secretary of State is — to do
more to abide by — allowing American citizens, individuals with — who
are legal permanent residents, and individuals with proper documentation
to depart the country.   
   
It is also true that we don’t have a role in preventing flights from
taking off.  We are not on the ground.  So that is not something the
U.S. government is doing.  But at the same time, some of these planes
and some of the issues is where are they going to land.   
   
So, a number of these planes, they may have a handful of American
citizens, but they may have several hundred individuals where we don’t
have manifests for them, we don’t know what the security protocols are
for them, we don’t know what their documentation is.  And there is a
fundamental question — and this is one of the hard choices you face in
government: Are we going to allow a plane with hundreds of people, where
we don’t know who they are, we don’t know what security protocols have
been put in place, to land on a U.S. military base?   
   
And there are reasonable questions — justified questions, I think — as
to why we wouldn’t do that.  And so, right now, there are some charter
planes that are taking off.  We do have to make evaluations about the
safety and security and protocols in place as planes are landing on
military bases.  And there are some challenges, as it relates to
documentation, where a number of people may not have documentation, some
for good reason — because they’re trying to depart Afghanistan.  But
that is something we’re working through.  
   
These indivi- — these handful of American citizens, we are also in touch
with.  They are not the majority of these flights; far from it.  It is a
small number of American citizens who are — we’re talking about on these
charter flights.   
   
Q    Can I follow up on that please, Jen?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    So are you essentially saying that — is the administration
essentially saying — picking up from what Secretary Blinken has said
today about documentation — is the administration essentially saying
that the Taliban is the only one who has access and who’s able to check
passenger documentation against these flight manifests?   
   
And if so, what is stopping the U.S., for example, from sending
personnel over there to do this job and to allow these passengers to
leave on the flights?  I understand they’re not all Americans, but many
of them are Afghan allies.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, none of that is what I said or what the Secretary of
State said, so let me try again.   
   
So the air — the flights — we obviously don’t have personnel on the
ground.  That’s correct; we don’t.   
   
What our objective is — and we have a presence in Qatar, right?  As you
know, our Secretary of State has been on the ground in Qatar, is
negotiating and having discussions as we speak with international
partners.  And also, members of our State Department are in discussions
with the Taliban because we do want to work through and ensure that we
can allow additional flights to land at military bases.   
   
But it is also true that we are not going to allow flights to land where
we don’t know what security protocols have been taken, whether people
have been vetted, who is on these — who are on these planes.  And I
don’t think the vast majority of American citizens want us to do that
either.  
   
So, right now, we are working through this process.  And we are also in
touch with the American citizens who were on these flights or who are in
the vicinity, which are a very small number, to work through getting
them out of Afghanistan.  We are committed to that.  We absolutely want
to do that.  We have already evacuated a handful of people, and we’re
continuing to work through.   
   
Now, things that will make it much easier, for certain, are if Qatari
airlines — we’re working with them to see if they can get flights up and
operational, more efforts to get individuals evacuated overland.  We’re
working through all of these components, and it’s the reason why the
Secretary of State is on the ground, in the region, discussing and
negotiating as we speak.   
   
Q    Is the aim to get U.S. —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.   
   
Q    — personnel on the ground —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re going to keep going.  Weijia.   
   
Q    — to do this, Jen?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Weijia.   
   
Q    I mean —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Weijia. 

Q    — is that aim?

MS. PSAKI:  I think I answered your question.  Go ahead, Weijia.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to follow up on the President’s speech
tomorrow.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    You mentioned schools and private sectors as two areas of focus —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    — but you’ve also been very, you know, firm in maintaining
independence between the federal government and what schools and the
private sector does.  So, tomorrow, should we just anticipate the
President to say much of what he’s already said to urge those entities
to take action?  Or will there be something new that’s actionable?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There will be new steps the President announces tomorrow. 
Absolutely.   
   
Q    And will any of those new steps influence the average American’s
day-to-day life?  Should we expect any new mitigation recommendations,
as an example? 

MS. PSAKI:  It depends on if you’re vaccinated or not.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    So, it’s possible that there’s —  
   
Q    Jen —  
   
Q    — something new? 

MS. PSAKI:  There are — there are six new — there are six steps the
President is announcing.  There will be new components, as I noted and
you noted.  Some of that will be related to access to testing.  Some
will be related to mandates.  Some will be related to how we ensure kids
are protected in schools.  And we’ll have more — we’ll preview more
tomorrow as all the pieces are finalized.   
   
But there will be new components that, sure, will of course impact
people across the country.  But we’re also all working together to get
the virus under control, to return to our normal lives.  And I know many
people, I’m sure, are looking forward to hearing what the President has
to say.   
   
Q    And then just one follow — quick follow-up on timing.  We’re just a
few days away from September 11th.  Do you have any update on when the
DOJ might release those FBI documents related to the investigation?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t.  It’s their process they’re obviously overseeing. 
I think we said a couple of weeks ago we didn’t anticipate that process
would necessarily be done in advance of September 11th.  It’s really
based on their timing; it’s not a deadline, I don’t think, that they’ve
set for that.   
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you, Jen.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Following up on these charter flights that the
Taliban is holding up in Afghanistan: The Secretary of State said there
are limits to what we can do without personnel on the ground.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    You just said we are not on the ground.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  You’re right.  
   
Q    Whose fault is that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think this is about fault here.   
   
Q    Well —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m conveying —  
   
Q    — (inaudible) Americans —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think what people want to understand is what we’re doing
to help address it.  There’s a handful of Americans — and I’m sure
you’re not suggesting we should have flights with hundreds of people we
don’t know who they are —  
   
Q    Okay, how many Americans —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — and there’s no security protocols —  
   
Q    — is too few to go in?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Too few?  I just am conveying to you —  
   
Q    You said it’s just a handful.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — there’s a handful of Americans who we are also in touch
with and we are working to help get evacuated from Afghanistan.  But
decisions you have to make in the federal government are not “yes and
no” decisions or as simple as what you’re laying out here.  
   
What we’re evaluating and looking at is how to keep people on our
military bases safe while also getting these U.S. citizens, dual
citizens, people who are prepared to leave Afghanistan, able to
leave.   
   
At the same time, we don’t think it ha- — we’re not going to allow
flights that have hundreds of people who we don’t know who they are, who
haven’t been security protocol — through security protocols, where we
haven’t seen the manifest, to land on U.S. military bases. 

Q    Okay.  There are now more terrorists wanted by the FBI in the new
Afghan government than there are women.  Does the President think that
is a foreign policy success?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first of all, no one in this administration — not the
President nor anyone on the national security team — would suggest that
the Taliban are respected and valued members of the global community. 
They have not earned that in any way, and we’re not — we have never
assessed that.   
   
This is a caretaker cabinet that does include four former imprisoned
Taliban fighters.  We have not validated that.  We have not conveyed
we’re going to recognize it.  What we’re working to do — and nor are we
rushing to recognition; there’s a lot they have to do before that.  What
we are working to do is to engage with them, because they oversee and
control Afghanistan right now, to get American citizens, legal permanent
residents, SIV applicants out of Afghanistan.   
   
Q    But you’re —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have to engage with them.  
   
Q    But to engage with them — their new acting interior minister is a
Haqqani Network terrorist.  He’s wanted for a bombing that killed six
people, including an American.  He’s believed to have participated in
cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.  There’s a $10 million bounty
on his head.  Why are we engaging with the government —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Should we not — should we not talk to the people who are
overseeing Afghanistan and just leave it and not get the rest of the
American citizens out?  
   
Q    What are you waiting for them to do?  They just formed their
government.  What — are you waiting for something — some —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Waiting for what?  
   
Q    — specif — you’re saying that we’re not going to rush to
recognition; that means that there could be recognition.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As we’ve said many times —  
   
Q    Yes —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — the international community is watching, the United States
is watching.  It’s whether they let people depart the country who want
to depart; whether they treat women across the country as they have
committed to treat them —  
   
Q    And we’ve seen they’re not doing that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — and how they behave and operate.  And therefore, we’re not
moving toward recognition.   
   
At the same time, we’re dealing with a reality world here where we have
to engage in order to get American citizens and others out of the
country.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, you mentioned that there will be news tomorrow in the
President’s speech as it relates to mandates.  Should Americans expect
more similar government mandates like what we’ve seen with agencies and
the federal workforce?  Or would this be in a different category?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve always said we would build on what’s been
announced to date — right? — with the Department of Defense, Veterans
Affairs, NIH, and others.  And I expect you’ll hear more from the
President on that tomorrow.   
   
We also believe that the private sector has a role here, and you’ll hear
more from the President on that as well.   
   
Q    Will he set any new goals or benchmarks tomorrow?  Or is that not
viewed as a very useful tool anymore, given vaccinations are lower than
they were compared to earlier this year when those were what was maybe
driving some of that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President is still working through his speech, and
our objective and our goal is to vaccinate more people so we can reduce
the spread of the virus.   
   
But I’d also note — before we compare now to six months ago — six months
ago, or when the President came into office, there were about a tiny
percentage of people who were vaccinated.  Then, we had much wider
access thanks to the operational preparations of this administration to
the vaccine.   
   
So, naturally, we knew that there would be a — an uptick in
vaccinations, and then it would be harder and harder because there — we
would get to the point where people didn’t want to get the vaccine who
had access to the vaccine.  That was a period that we knew and
anticipated would happen.  
   
What we did see was a promising trend about the numbers in August, which
were significantly higher than July.  
   
Q    And just lastly, following up on the trip yesterday —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — will any more New Jersey counties be added to that disaster
declaration, or is the damage assessment still ongoing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The damage assessment is still ongoing.  It’s a process, of
course, that has to move through not just county officials, but FEMA, to
assess the damage.  But certainly, we are amenable to that, and the
President has been very clear with every elected official in New Jersey
and other states that whatever they need, we will work to get them what
they need.  But there’s, of course, a process that needs to be
completed, which is still ongoing.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    One follow-up on Texas and abortion, and another on
reconciliation.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Can you say if the White House supports the Women’s Health
Protection Act?  And if not, why not, since this is a bill that would
codify Roe v. Wade, which you’ve said is a priority for the White
House?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there are many ways to codify Roe v. Wade, and that is
something the President remains committed to.  I don’t have a new
assessment of our support for the piece of legislation.  We are still
reviewing what our options are.  
   
Q    Are there specific reservations about that bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re still looking at whether that’s a vehicle we’re going
to support, but we still support codifying Roe v. Wade.  
   
Q    And there are reports that Senator Manchin will only support as
much as $1.5 trillion in a reconciliation package.  Has the President
spoken to Senator Manchin, or does he have plans to?  And would the
White House accept a $1.5 trillion plan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, Senator Manchin, of course, continues to be a
very important partner to the President and the President’s agenda.  And
we fully expected that there would be a range of negotiations in
private; sometimes they spill out into the public, and that is what is
happening as we speak around components of the package.  
   
But we also know that this is a process that’s ongoing, one that we just
lived through over the summer, where there were many times where the
agenda was called “dead” and it turned out it wasn’t.  
   
So I’m not going to read out any calls or engagements the President has
with Senator Manchin.  We engage with him on a regular basis from a
senior level, including with the President, and we are looking ahead to
getting this bill passed and moving it forward.  
   
Q    But would you entertain $1.5 trillion?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I’m not going to negotiate from here. What the
President is encouraged by is agreements about the need to lower costs
for working families — from prescription drugs to childcare, to the cost
of college, to eldercare, on the need to tackle the climate crisis, and
on the need for corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay their
fair share in taxes.  
   
I would also note that whatever the size is, it’s not actually accurate
to call it any of these sizes — 1, 1.5, 2, 3.5.  This is going to be
paid for.  That is something the President is committed to, something
Senator Manchin has called for as well.   
   
And the real choice right now is whether you’re going to lower costs for
people in this country on eldercare, childcare, cost of college, or
whether you’re going to prevent — or allow the wealthiest Americans and
corporations to continue to pay the tax rates that are hardly fair,
moving forward.  
   
Q    I’ve been told you have to wrap.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    In an attempt to clarify the White House’s position on the debt
limit that — following up on my friend Josh’s question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  Sure.  
   
Q    So, in her letter today, the Secretary said that the extraordinary
measures would run out sometime in October.  Is it the White House’s
wish — well, is it the White House’s expectation that Congress will act
by the end of September — by September 30th?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our expectation and hope is that they act in advance
of the money running out.  Yes.  
   
Q    So, you expect then that the line is wrong, that September 30th is
the deadline that this White House is setting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would be clear that in the Secretary’s letter, she
made — she also conveyed that because of the fact that we don’t have all
of the information at this point on inflows from taxes that come in
mid-September, they didn’t give an exact date.   
   
But yes, of course, our objective is to raise the debt limit before it
becomes a crisis.  
   
Q    Quick thing.  Yesterday, the President said that he intended to see
wildfire damage when he heads West.  Do you have any more information
you can share on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He will see wildfire damage.  I know we are eager — you’re
all eager; I’m eager — to get it announced — to announce the details of
his trip that will be early next week.  We hope to have those in the
next 24 hours.  
   
Q    Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  I think I have to wrap up, but let me do one more. 
Okay.  
   
Q    A couple questions —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — on the reconciliation legislation, on healthcare.  Does the White
House believe President Biden and Democratic lawmakers will ultimately
have to make a choice between expanding Medicare benefits and shoring up
the Affordable Care Act, particularly to stay under the overall price
tag?  And if there is a choice, what would President Biden choose?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly understand your question.  I think you probably
can predict what I’m going to convey to you is that there are a range of
discussions and negotiations between a broad swath of the Democratic
caucus right now, and I’m just not going to negotiate or weigh in from
here on this particular question.  
   
Q    Quick question: Can the White House confirm that it has asked
appointees from the last administration to resign from various boards,
including the West Point Advisory Board and the Naval Academy Board, and
why?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, we have.  And the President’s objective is what any
president’s objective is: is — was to ensure you have nominees and
people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and
who are aligned with your values.  And so, yes, that was an ask that was
made.  
   
Q    Is there any concern that because a lot of these appointees do go
across administrations, that there is a risk of politicizing these non-
— traditionally non-controversial positions?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I will let others evaluate whether they think
Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified or not
political to serve on these boards.   
   
But the President’s qualification requirements are not your party
registration; they are whether you’re qualified to serve and whether
you’re aligned with the values of this administration.  
   
Thanks, everyone.
