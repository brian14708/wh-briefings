11:20 A.M. EDT  
   
MR. BATES:  So I have one thing at the top for you.  President Biden
promised that he would be a president for all Americans, regardless of
where they live and regardless of whether they voted for him or not.  He
also promised to rebuild the middle class.   
   
The fact that Bidenomics has now galvanized over $500 billion in
job-creating private sector investment is the newest testament to how
seriously he takes fulfilling those promises.   
   
The President inherited an economy that was down more than 9 million
jobs since the pandemic began, with the pace of job growth slowing.  He
took bold action to turn things around, delivering the strongest
economic recovery in the world — when it comes to similar countries —
from COVID and creating more jobs in two years than any previous
president did in four: 13.2 million new jobs.   
   
During that time, President Biden passed historic, breakthrough laws to
realize his Bidenomics agenda, which means turning the page on failed
trickle-down tax welfare for the super-rich and big corporations, and
instead squarely focusing our economic policy on growing the middle
class.   
   
The major laws that make up his Bidenomics agenda have achieved the
biggest manufacturing surge in modern American history, like the 1,800
jobs Enphase is announcing today.   
   
Under President Biden, manufacturing plant construction has doubled,
whereas under Donald Trump’s administration, it barely grew at all — by
2 percent.  
   
Today’s announcements by Enphase is especially significant because,
previously, their solo \[sic\] micro — their solar micro inverters were
only made in China, in India, and in Mexico.   
   
Now, for the first time, they’re going to build them in the United
States, including in South Carolina, which is going to net up to 600
jobs for the community we’re visiting today.   
   
Bidenomics is also rebuilding our infrastructure, cutting costs for
families, and ensuring we outcompete the world when it comes to
industries of the future, like clean energy, like manufacturing.   
   
There’s a long list of numbers that demonstrate how the President is
rebuilding the middle class.  Jobs are up, incomes are up, economic
growth is up, energy costs are down, healthcare costs are down, and the
inflation that has impacted every country around the world due to COVID
and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is down.   
   
But the most powerful endorsement of Bidenomics is this: Every signature
economic law this President has signed, congressional Republicans who
voted “no” and attacked it on Fox News then went home to their district
and hailed its benefits.  
   
The President is excited that they have seen the light, because what
could speak to the effectiveness of Bidenomics more than these
conversions?  
   
There’s no shortage of examples of this among South Carolina’s
delegation.  For example, Senator Lindsey Graham called the Inflation
Reduction Act “a nightmare for South Carolina.”  Just two months later,
he called BMW’s electric vehicles announcement “one of the most
consequential announcements in the history of the state of South
Carolina.”  
   
Representative Joe Wilson blasted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law but
later announced, “I welcome Scout Motors’ plans to invest $2 billion and
create up to 4,000 jobs in South Carolina.”   
   
Nancy Mace called Bidenomics legislation a, quote, “disaster,” then
welcomed a RAISE grant to Charleston.   
   
Again, those are just a few of many examples.   
   
It is impossible to argue that a policy is not getting results for the
middle class while simultaneously rushing to associate yourself with
it.  Like the President said when this happened with the Rescue Plan,
he’s not even mad because it proves they know it’s working.   
   
And then lastly, on a personal note, let’s please keep today aboveboard
and steer clear of regional differences between North Carolina barbecue
and South Carolina barbecue.  (Laughter.)  
   
I’m happy to field questions on more appropriate subjects like national
politics, religion.  I’m happy to be a theological resource if that is
helpful.  But we’ll ste- — steer clear of barbecue.  
   
I’m happy to take questions.   
   
Q    Thanks.  One quick one and then a little bit longer one.  On
cluster munitions, has the President made a decision on whether to send
cluster munitions to Ukraine?

MR. BATES:  As Chairman Milley indicated, that is under active
consideration.  I do not have an announcement to make at this time.   
   
Our focus is on continuing to equip Ukraine with a wide range of
munitions that they are using effectively as they bravely defend their
country and their sovereignty against Russia’s illegal onslaught, which
has included war crimes and atrocities.  That is our main focus.   
   
We have executed over 40 drawdowns to ensure that they can be as strong
as possible, continue to defend their territory as effectively as
possible.   
   
Q    And if I could just ask on yesterday’s meeting with the Prime
Minister of Sweden: Did they engage on the Quran-burning situation?  And
then, more broadly, coming out of that, does the President believe that
Sweden’s accession can be completed, that an agreement could come to
terms before the NATO Summit next week?  
   
MR. BATES:  When it comes to the Quran burning, we found this action
offensive, and we agree with the government of Sweden, which called it
inappropriate.  Demonstrations such as this one could create an
environment of fear that impacts the ability of Muslims and members of
other religious minority groups to freely exercise their right to
freedom of religion or belief.  
   
The United States also supports freedom of expression and the right to
peaceful assembly, which are elements of any democracy.   
   
As the Swedish Justice Minister said, Sweden has strong protections for
freedom of expression.  At the same time, quote, “The fact that it is
allowed does not in any way mean that we have to support what is said.” 
That is something the President identifies with as a proud member of
faith himself.  He respects other faiths.  He respects everyone’s right
to exercise their faith.  He wants people to respect his faith.  
   
And when it comes to Sweden and NATO, the President continues to
strongly support Sweden joining the security alliance.  I’m going to
underline that they have met all of the commitments they made on the
margins of the Madrid NATO Summit last year, including when it comes to
counterterrorism policy.  He hopes that Turkey and Hungary will support
them joining the security alliance because their values are aligned with
NATO’s values.  They will contribute to the security of every member and
to the security environment in Europe.  
   
I am not going to put a timeframe on it, but he wants that to take place
as soon as possible for our mutual benefit.  
   
Q    Andrew, can you —  
   
Q    Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Is the United States tracking the location of Wagner
leader Prigozhin after the Belarusian leader said that he was not there
and had returned to either St. Petersburg or Moscow?  
   
MR. BATES:  I am not going to address his whereabouts.  You will need to
consult other sources for that.  
   
We continue to monitor the Wagner Group, as we’ve disclosed to all of
y’all.  We have — we have applied biting sanctions to them.  They commit
a wide range of crimes in the countries in which they are active.  But I
do not have new details to provide about whereabouts or anything else
concerning Prigozhin or the Wagner Group.  
   
Q    On a separate topic, do you have any new details on the
investigation into the cocaine found at the White House?  Can you
confirm that it was a “small baggie” and that DNA testing is taking
place?  
   
MR. BATES:  I respect there is interest in this.  To be transparent with
you, I do not have additional information to provide beyond what Karine
laid out in the briefing room yesterday, which is: This is something we
take seriously.  The law enforcement professionals in the Secret Service
are investigating after this substance was discovered in a highly
traveled area.  We’re willing to assist in any way needed.  Beyond that,
I’m going to respect their process.  
   
Q    On — another one on Russia.  There was a report from NBC News that
said senior U.S. off- — former senior U.S. officials at the Council of
Foreign Relations had made outreach to Russian nationals, including
Foreign Minister Lavrov, about laying the groundwork for peace talks
with Ukraine.  Was the administration read in on those talks?  And do
you support them?  
   
MR. BATES:  I’m not going to speak for any private citizens who are not
members of the administration.  I would suggest you contact those
individuals who the reporting concerns.   
   
Our focus is on continuing to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield so
they can negotiate from a position of maximum strength on their terms
and on no one else’s.   
   
Q    One more.  You know, President — former President Trump has made
some pretty wild posts recently on social media.  One of them was that
the cocaine found in the White House was — had belonged to either the
President or his son.  Are you willing to say that that’s not the case,
that they don’t belong to them?  
   
MR. BATES:  I don’t have a response to that because we have to be
careful about the Hatch Act.   
   
What I will say is that I have noticed there does seem to be some
increasing frustration coming from that corner in general.  And I think
it is probably rooted in the contrast between their substantive policy
records.   
   
As you have all covered, there is a long list of areas where this
administration succeeded for the middle class where our predecessor did
not.  For example, infrastructure is no longer a punchline.  And now the
biggest infrastructure investments in 70 years are rebuilding America.  
   
President Biden is bringing manufacturing jobs back at the fastest rate
in modern history.  And like I mentioned, we have doubled the
construction of manufacturing facilities in just two and a half years. 
Whereas during the previous administration, it only grew at an anemic 2
percent. 

Medicare is now negotiating lower drug costs.  I’m old enough to
remember when that was someone else’s campaign promise.

The economy we inherited was in freefall.  We turned it around by
creating more jobs in two years than any other president in four. 

So it would be unsurprising if there’s a little bit of frustration on
the part of people who worked in the last administration. 

And, of course, this dovetails with today’s announcement from Enphase. 
It comes at a moment when we have crossed the threshold of $500 billion
in private sector investment due to Bidenomics, which is about growing
our economy by growing the middle class.  There is no better way to do
that than giving people good jobs coming to America, thanks to policies
like the Inflation Reduction Act.

Q    Do you have any comment on pretty downbeat statements coming from
Zelenskyy and other high-ranking Ukrainian officials, where they seem to
be linking, you know, the rather slow, difficult progress of their
offensive to — specifically to, you know, what — what they — what
they’re kind of characterizing as foot-dragging on important weapons
systems, i.e. F-16s, ATACMS, and other stuff. 

You know, they’re — they’re basically saying, “It’s not all our fault
that it’s going slowly.” 

MR. BATES:  I am not going to speak for President Zelenskyy.  Tomorrow,
Jake Sullivan will be in the briefing room, and he can provide more
details about next week’s travel.

I’m going to highlight that under President Biden, we have rallied the
world to support Ukraine, making NATO the strongest in its history for
that purpose. 

Like the President often says, we are seeing the NATOization of Finland,
not the Finlandization of NATO.

We have executed over 40 drawdowns of military equipment to Ukraine,
giving them a huge range of capabilities that they are bravely using to
defend their sovereignty.   
   
And I will say that we understand where they are coming from.  They are
on the frontlines.  They are on the receiving end of an illegal war that
has been characterized by atrocities, by the targeting of civilians, by
war crimes; one that is a war of ego and of choice, and that could end
at any moment, that is — that is senseless, and that we are going to
continue to make sure they have what they need to continue competently
defending their country. 

Q    Andrew, just to follow on Jordan’s question, NBC is also reporting
that the NSC has been briefed by these private individuals who have been
taking place in these Track Two talks with people, including Lavrov. 
Has the President himself been briefed?  And does this go in counter to
the White House policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”?

And then, I have one more.

MR. BATES:  I don’t have private conversations to read out one way or
the other.  As you mentioned, our North Star is “nothing about Ukraine
without Ukraine.”  And our top focus is to continue equipping them so
that they can keep successfully defending their country so that they can
negotiate from a position of maximum strength. 

Q    And then, my next one is: Does the White House plan to use
Threads?  (Laughter.)

MR. BATES:  So, I do not have an announcement to make about Threads
today.  We can keep you all posted if we do. 

Q    Yeah, please do.

Q    Andrew, we reported yesterday that — that China’s spy facility in
Cuba dates back decades.  Is this something that the United States, at
this point, accepts: that China has a permanent intelligence capability
in Cuba?

MR. BATES:  I don’t have new information to provide on that subject
right now.  I appreciate the interest, but I don’t have any new details
to give.

Q    A question, here.  Some members of Congress — bipartisan delegation
of members of Congress are proposing a bill to audit the Pentagon.  And
if, in fact, the Pentagon fails a certain audit, they’d have to give
that money back to the Treasury to go towards deficit reduction.  And
they cite this because the Pentagon has failed multiple audits over the
years.  Is that something the administration is open to or have they not
looked at it yet?

MR. BATES:  This is the first that I have heard of that legislation, so
I’ll need to take the question.  But since you raised deficit reduction,
this President has already achieved record deficit reduction since he
took office — $1.7 trillion. 

He also passed the Inflation Reduction Act to further reduce the deficit
by having the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.   
   
And building on that progress continues to be a top economic objective
of ours, like we laid out in the budget.  That is central to Bidenomics:
that we can invest in our country, bring the deficit down by having rich
special interests pay their fair share, and make the kinds of
investments that you’re seeing bring job-creating expansions to places
like West Columbia, South Carolina, where folks are going to get up to
600 new jobs thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, something that
Republicans in Congress keep trying to repeal. 

They keep trying to send those jobs overseas, and they keep trying to
repeal the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that reduced the
deficit, like Medicare’s new capacity to negotiate lower drug costs.   
   
Q    Now, on the Inflation Reduction Act, obviously one thing that we
hear a lot of criticism about when it comes to the IRS is the fact that
some of the most audited places in the country are some of the poorest
states, like Mississippi.  Is the administration pursuing any reforms to
the IRS so that those resources are, you know, focused on actual people
of wealth and not poor and lower-class citizens?  
   
MR. BATES:  I’m glad you raised that, because as soon as the Inflation
Reduction Act was even on the cusp of passing, Secretary Yellen and
other authorities within Treasury gave directives to their staff that
these new resources would be used exclusively to crack down on wealthy
individuals who are gaming the tax code to the — at the expense of
everyone else who tends to pay their taxes as they are owed.  That is
another effective way to reduce the deficit.   
   
But as — as you mentioned, I want to make sure everyone is aware. 
Before the Inflation Reduction Act even became law, we were giving very
clear instructions: Those funds are to be used for one reason, and that
is cracking down on wealthy people cheating on their taxes.  And that is
what they’re for.  
   
Q    Can I just ask one more?  Were any Republican lawmakers invited to
the event today?  
   
MR. BATES:  We made Congressman Wilson aware of today’s events.  And if
— if he would like to join the ranks of other congressional Republicans
who’ve had a “road to Damascus” experience about the benefits that are
being yielded by Bidenomics, we would welcome that.  We made him
aware.  
   
Q    Have you talked to the governor at all?  
   
MR. BATES:  I can check.  I don’t have conversations to read out.  He
has also noted some of the benefits that have resulted from Bidenomics
investments in South Carolina.   
   
Q    To go back to your Sweden comment, you noted that the President was
offended by what happened.  Is the President going to convey that
directly to President Erdoğan?   
   
MR. BATES:  I don’t have any conversations to preview one way or the
other.  When it comes to next week’s travel, Jake will join us in the
briefing room tomorrow.  But I don’t have anything to preview right
now.   
   
Q    Andrew, one more on the cocaine.  I understand the Secret Service
is conducting an investigation.  If the Secret Service is able to
determine the individual responsible, will the Secret Service and the —
and — will the White House commit to transparency in this, in making
that information public?  
   
MR. BATES:  I’m going to defer to the Secret Service professionals who
are carrying this out.  I’m just not going to engage on hypotheticals
about it.  I would — I would suggest you contact them for anything
more.   
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MR. BATES:  Thank you all.
