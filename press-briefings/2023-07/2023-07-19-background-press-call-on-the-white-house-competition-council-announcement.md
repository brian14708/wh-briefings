title: "Background Press Call on the White\_House Competition Council\_Announcement"
---
 
Via Teleconference

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Promoting competition to lower
costs and support small businesses and entrepreneurs is a central part
of Bidenomics.  
   
When the President took office, concentration had increased in over
three quarters of U.S. industries.  In the President’s view, that
reflected that, quote, “Forty years ago, we \[had chosen\] the wrong
path…following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and
pulled back on enforcing law to promote competition.”  That harmed our
economy.  
   
One estimate found that higher prices and lower wages caused by lack of
competition was costing the median American household as much as $5,000
annually.   
   
So to turn the tide, almost exactly two years ago, President Biden
signed a landmark executive order establishing the White House
Competition Council and directing a whole-of-government approach to
promoting competition.  
   
Tomorrow, the President will convene the fifth meeting of his White
House Competition Council, which will be marking both two years of
progress since the competition executive order was signed and announcing
new progress in this space.  
   
In just those first two years, we’ve already delivered concrete results
for American consumers.  For example, the President signed into law the
bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which lowers costs for American
retailers, farmers, and consumers.  Ocean shipping prices are now down
more than 80 percent from their peak.   
   
Today, hearing aids are now available on shelves in stores without a
prescription, saving the estimated 30 million Americans with hearing
loss thousands of dollars to repair.  
   
Thanks to the CFPB cracking down on banking overdraft and bounced check
fees, those fees are going down an estimated five and a half billion
dollars annually.  
   
To give another example, DOT called out airlines’ bad service and got
results.  Previously, none of the 10 largest U.S. airlines guaranteed
meals or hotels when they caused a cancellation or significant delay,
and no airline guaranteed that parents could sit with their kids for
free.  Now, thanks to DOT’s use of the bully pulpit, 9 of the 10 largest
airlines guarantee hotels, 10 airlines guarantee meals, and 3 airlines
guarantee free — fee-free family seating.   
   
So that’s just some of the concrete results we’ve already delivered.  
   
Tomorrow, with the White House Competition Council meeting, you’ll also
see new progress, new initiatives breaking new ground on promoting
competition.  
   
My colleagues from the agencies are going to speak to these initiatives
in a moment, so I’ll be brief.  
   
First of all, when President Biden signed his executive order, he said,
quote, “No more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices,
fewer options for workers and consumers alike.”  He called for the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to consider
revising their merger guidelines.  Tomorrow, the agencies will be
publishing their revised guidelines for public comment.  
   
Second, the Department of Agriculture is announcing a new partnership
with a group of 32 bipartisan state attorneys general that’s going to
ramp up enforcement of antitrust and consumer protection laws that will
help stop conduct like price fixing or price gouging in grocery retail
markets, meat and poultry processing, and other agricultural markets.  
   
Third, you’ll see us launch a new front in the war on junk fees, housing
rental fees.  These are fees like rental application fees that can
really add up.  So, for example, it can cost $100 or more for each
rental application, which is more than the cost of running a background
check.  My colleagues from the White House and HUD are going to talk
about new actions the private sector and the administration are taking
to expose these hidden and unfair fees.  
   
So with that summary, I’ll turn it over to \[senior administration
official\] and \[senior administration official\] to explain the merger
guidelines announcement.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much, \[senior administration
official\].  Hi, everybody.  Good afternoon.  As we heard from \[senior
administration official\] and as noted in the executive order, markets
across the economy have undergone significant consolidation in recent
decades in ways that is now costing consumers, costing workers, costing
entrepreneurs, and costing communities.  And we really need a
whole-of-government approach to combat these competition problems. 

One key plank of this effort is robust and reinvigorated merger
enforcement.  Congress, back in 1914, prohibited mergers that may
substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.  And in
the decades since then, Congress has continued its commitment to
competition over consolidation, and the FTC and antitrust division are
charged with effectuating that mandate. 

Back since 1968, the DOJ and FTC have issued an enforcement manual,
known as the Merger Guidelines, that lay out for the public how we go
about assessing whether mergers may be unlawful. 

As we undertook this revision, there were a few key pillars that really
animated this effort.  One was making sure that we’re updating our
framework to match today’s market realities. 

I think we’ve seen, all too often, various blind spots that have led to
missed opportunities and unfortunately contributed to some of this
consolidation.  And one of the things that we really prioritized was
hearing from the public. 

We got over 5,000 comments — spanning from farmers, from healthcare
workers, from pharmacists, from musicians — sharing with us their
firsthand experience with consolidation.  And so we took all of that
information and experience, and it’s reflected in our update to the
guidelines that we want to make sure is reflecting the reality of how
businesses are operating today and how they’re competing. 

A second key pillar is deep fidelity to the laws passed by Congress and
the interpretation of those laws by courts.  Our teams really did a deep
dive to make sure that these guidelines are fully faithful to that case
law and to the statutes that Congress passed. 

And lastly, our revised guidelines really seek to provide clear
administrable guidance to the public and to market participants.  Want
to make sure that this document is providing clarity and certainty, and
making very clear how it is that the agencies are going to go about
doing their merger enforcement.

I will turn it now over to \[senior administration official\].  I’ll
just say, we are — at the FTC, are really, really grateful for the very
strong partnership that we’ve had with the DOJ as we’ve put together
these revised guidelines.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  And let me also reiterate the incredible partnership with
the Federal Trade Commission at all levels, including \[senior
administration official\], but at the fed- — among career staff, as
well, and also acknowledge the important, essential contributions that
have (inaudible) from our career staff at both agencies, who have played
an essential role in drafting these guidelines, which we’re very proud
of.

As \[senior administration official\] indicated, there are — this is an
important milestone for our agencies.

Since 1968, both agencies have issued guidelines to help explain agency
practice and reflect the legal principles that have been set forth by
Congress and interpreted by courts, including the Supreme Court.   
   
And so we are really thrilled that we can mark this important
achievement to issue draft guidelines in accordance with the President’s
executive order on competition. 

As \[senior administration official\] indicated, there are a number of
(inaudible) principles that I’d like to build on. 

First is: Since the guidelines were first written in 1968, we’ve seen so
many changes in our economy.  Just think about your — your daily
experiences.  Certainly, we don’t have phones with rotors, and we keep
our documents in the cloud rather than cabinets.  And those fundamental
shifts in market realities necessitate a shift in how we apply the law
to the facts on the ground.  And therefore, we’ve undertaken an effort
to do state-of-the-art economics and a complete assessment of the law
and market realities to bring our guidelines up to date. 

Second is: We undertook, as \[senior administration official\]
indicated, a rigorous review of all the legal statutes, including the
Clayton Act, as well as all prevailing and relevant precedent to make
sure that we were getting this right as a matter of law.  And these will
be the first guidelines ever to cite to the law, and we do so
repeatedly, because the facts and law are what are guiding us here
today, and as we apply — as law enforcement authorities and as we apply
to the law.

Finally, as \[senior administration official\] indicated, these are
guidelines for the public.  That includes participants in the market, as
well as all affected parties, whether they’re workers, consumers, or
entrepreneurs.  And we believe it’s extremely important that these
guidelines are accessible to the public at large.  And so, we’ve created
them with that in mind so that they can be read and understood at the
highest level by anybody who cares about antitrust enforcement corporate
consolidation, while at the same time providing the rigorous and
detailed tools that are necessary to undertake a thorough review of a
particular transaction. 

So we’re really eager to present these to the public, which we’ll do so
starting tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.  And then we will have a robust and
fulsome comment period that — where we eagerly await input from the
public before we finalize this draft guidelines. 

Thank you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good afternoon, everyone.  This is
\[senior administration official\] with USDA.  And thanks so much for
the chance to participate in this press call to highlight how the
Biden-Harris administration is increasing competition and also investing
in rural communities. 

We all know that for far too long, farmers and ranchers have been harmed
by a consolidated industry that’s led to bigger farms and fewer
farmers.  So, thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,
the President — the President’s executive order to promote competition
in the American economy, and the Biden-Harris administration’s action
plan for a fairer, more competitive, and more resilient meat and poultry
supply chain, we’re dedicating resources to make sure rural communities
see their fair share of the benefits to support producers and to
increase choice and lower prices for consumers. 

As one key part of this effort, tomorrow we’ll be launching a historic
partnership with attorneys general from 32 states and the District of
Columbia to help reduce anti-competitive barriers across food and
agriculture supply chains. 

Under this new agricultural competition partnership, USDA is investing
in opportunities to combine state and federal authorities to tackle
anti-competitive market structures and practices and price gouging in
food, agriculture, and related industries. 

Specifically, this initiative will enhance the capacity of state
attorneys general to conduct on-the-ground assessments of competition
issues, enhance coordination between federal and state agriculture and
competition authorities, create new and more independent research
programs, and ultimately result in fairer and competitive markets and
more resilient supply chains.   
   
Another key part of our efforts is that USDA will continue to make
significant investments to expand meat and poultry processing capacity. 
We’re doing this by dedicating resources to expand independent
processing capacity and support workers.   
   
Most recently, last month, USDA announced 15 awards totaling $115
million in 17 states through the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion
Program — MPPEP — and the Meat and Poultry Intermediary Lending Program
— MPILP.  
   
In the coming months, we look forward to continuing to deliver on our
top priorities, which include finalizing our proposed rules promised
under the Packers and Stockyards Act, which would enhance transparency
for growers, promote market access for producers, and level the playing
field.   
   
We’re also executing on the Farmers Seed Liaison initiative, which will
enhance competition by enabling our IP system to reward innovation while
keeping natural and open-source seeds — seed resources more available
for researchers as well as for farmers.   
   
Additionally, we’ll implement — we’ll continue to implement our
Agricultural Competition Partnership, which was announced today, and we
will continue to roll out additional investments in independent meat and
poultry processing capacity expansion.   
   
USDA is proud to support President Biden’s executive order to take on
challenges for producers, rural communities, and consumers by promoting
competition in America’s food and agricultural markets, delivering
benefits for farmers and ranchers, and lowering food costs for working
families.   
   
We look forward to helping spearhead President Biden’s vision for
growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, doing so by
increasing competition and empowering farmers, workers, and small
businesses.   
   
Thanks for letting me participate in this call.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Hey, everyone.  So, tomorrow,
the President will launch a new effort to crack down on junk fees in the
rental housing market.  I imagine nearly every American household can
relate to this issue.  These fees come in many forms.   
   
At the front end of the apartment search, people often pay application
fees of $50, $60, $100 or more per apartment, and have to do it many
times over if they’re applying to multiple units.  This can add up to
hundreds of dollars.  
   
Most concerningly with these fees is that they often far exceed the
amount in cost for a housing provider to actually run the background and
credit check.  Then, once an individual manages to secure an apartment,
they’re often surprised to be charged a number of fees just to move in
or to cover services that they assumed were included to begin with,
things like a few bucks to pay your rent online or a $10 a monthly trash
fee — services that you assumed were included in the underlying rent.   
   
And so, tomorrow, the President will announce a new effort to address
these hidden fees and really help consumers more effectively comparison
shop when they’re making this important decision.   
   
First, three major rental housing platforms — Zillow, Apartments.com,
and AffordableHousing.com — are launching new features on their websites
to prominently display these fees up front so that consumers can see the
true cost of various apartments and comparison shop accordingly.   
   
Zillow’s new interface will be launching tomorrow, and Apartments.com
and AffordableHousing.com will be live in the coming days and weeks.   
   
These actions are hugely impactful as tens of millions of Americans
search for housing on these sites every single month.  
   
I’ll turn it over to my colleague, \[senior administration official\],
from HUD to share more.   
   
Back in March, Secretary Fudge, our HUD Secretary, issued a call to
action to state legislators and other stakeholders to address the issue
of fees in rental housing.  And these folks have delivered in a big
way.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  Good afternoon, everyone.  Today’s announcement signifies
the Biden and Harris administration’s commitment to work across agencies
to encourage landlords to increase transparency and fairness in rents,
and limit junk fees.   
   
HUD is pleased by the industry response to the Secretary’s call to
action.  In addition, today, HUD’s Office of Policy Development and
Research is releasing a new brief that highlights state, local, and
private sector strategies to encourage fairness and transparency in the
rental market.  We hope this research will help policymakers,
influencers, and businesses see how eliminating junk fees helps entire
economies thrive.   
   
In a variety of states, leaders have taken up the charge the
Biden-Harris administration set this winter: working to crack down on
rental housing fees on the local level.   
   
Take Colorado, for example, where Governor Polis signed into law House
Bill 1099, which allows prospective renters to reuse a rental
application for up to 30 days without paying additional fees, and House
Bill 1095 to prohibit a rental agreement from including any provisions
that charge fees to tenants that failed to provide a non-renewable
notice that disguise fees as rent or that enable landlords to profit
from third-party services.   
   
Or look to Rhode Island, which signed into law House Bill 6087 to
prohibit a landlord, lessor, broker, or property management company from
requiring or demanding rental application fees.   
   
This news today shows that our commitment to ensuring transparency,
fairness, and affordability in housing are not just words.  We are
delivering with concrete, real action to make the lives of renters
across this country better.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\] and everyone,
for your comments.  We’ll now turn it — have about 15 minutes for
questions.   
   
Please raise your hand if you have a question.  I will note, we have
Comm folks — Comms folks from across our agencies who stand ready to
answer your technical questions.   
   
But I’ll now turn it over to Josh Sweigart, who I believe I saw had the
first hand up.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks so much for doing this.  You walked us through the
principles behind a revised merger guidelines.  But I’m wondering, if
you had to explain to an average reader of the Daily Dayton News what do
these guidelines do that the previous version didn’t include?  How have
the standards changed?  And what impact would it have on their lives?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  This is \[senior administration
official\].  I’ll start and then turn it over to \[senior administration
official\].   
   
But these guidelines explain how mergers, concentration enforcement, and
antitrust laws affect people on a daily basis.  They explain how they
can be applied (inaudible) people get benefits of competition in terms
of earning a higher wage or getting better benefits at work.  It talks
about how farmers can get more for their cattle and their grain by
having more competition in the agricultural markets.  It explains the
reality of market platforms and the acquisition of data and how mergers
and concentration affect average people on a daily basis with respect to
how those platforms affect their lives.   
   
And so, we’ve gone — we use painstaking efforts to make sure that we are
explaining this in a way that is not only relevant but resonant with the
broader public.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And one thing I’ll add to that is: You
know, to be clear, these guidelines don’t — do not constitute new law. 
They are an interpretation of existing law and existing case law.  
   
Just to give another example, you know, there’s a chapter in the
guidelines that lays out how we would go about assessing mergers that
may harm competition and labor markets.  This is a longstanding
principle that antitrust is supposed to protect everybody, including
workers.  We heard a lot from workers during our review process,
including about specific ways in which mergers can harm workers.  
   
So, in the — in the proposed guidelines, we really go through, in some
detail, some of the different ways in which mergers can have that
effect.  So, consolidation that hurts workers can result in lower wages
for workers, but it can also result in worse working conditions.  
   
We heard from workers, for example, that one way in which consolidation
hurts them is that merged firms will make their schedules less
predictable and give employees less control over what their work looks
like.  
   
And so, these guidelines really represent a much more nuanced,
on-the-ground view of the different ways in which illegal mergers can
hurt people, including workers.  And we were really grateful for that
insight that we wanted to make sure is being fully reflected in this
document.  
   
MODERATOR:  Great.  And I’ll turn it over to Cecilia Kang at New York
Times.  
   
Q    Thank you so much for that answer, \[senior administration
official\], and for everyone for this call.  
   
Piggybacking on that, can you address whether — in the — the full
document, what you say that’s different or specific about digital
markets; the consumer welfare standard, if there’s any talk about that;
and, specifically, on vertical mergers, if there’s discussion about
whether, in your guidelines, there should be less of a — a leaning
towards the theory that vertical mergers usually lead to efficiencies? 
So three buckets: the consumer welfare standard; digital markets, most
importantly; and vertical mergers and efficiencies within.  
   
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.   
   
So, Cecilia, you’ll note that one of the guidelines talks specifically
about platforms and the ways in which platforms are competing, right? 
So sometimes you’ll see competition between platforms to serve as the
core platform.  Sometimes you’ll see (inaudible) competition on the
platform.  And then sometimes you’ll see competition to replace the
platform, especially when we see new technologies.  So the guidelines
reflect those different dimensions of — of how competition can manifest
in some of these markets.   
   
It also goes into some detail about the ways in which mergers in
particular can undermine competition in platform markets.  So, you know,
if a firm is — is making an acquisition that will make it more difficult
for consumers to multihome and choose between different platforms, you
know, that would be relevant to us.  If a merger would enable a dominant
firm to deprive rivals of scale or network effects, that’s something
that would be relevant to us.  
   
So I would say, overall in the last decade, we’ve just seen a huge
amount of learning around the different ways in which competition
presents itself in digital markets.  And we wanted to make sure that
this document is fully representing all of those mechanisms of
competition as we’ve seen them present themselves in these markets.  And
so, would — would direct you to that — to that guideline in
particular.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you so much.  Now turning it over to Andrea Shalal at
Reuters.  
   
Q    Hey.  Thank you so much for doing this.  I have a couple of
questions.  I’ll wrap them into one, but —  
   
The U.S. Chamber is accusing the Biden administration of regulatory
overreach with all of these Competition Council and, you know, anti —
you know, cracking down on anti-competitive practices.  You know, to
what extent are you seeing any kind of shift in the way that industry is
responding?   
   
And, you know, you’ve talked a lot about using the bully pulpit from the
White House, in addition to sort of the specific actions you can take. 
Is that making any difference?   
   
And then I wanted to ask about the — on the housing front, specifically,
whether you view these junk fees that are in the housing market as
contributing to what has been a very sticky, sort of, you know,
high-rental-housing costs that have not come down as much as one would
have expected, in terms of cracking down on inflation.   
   
Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can take a stab at that.  
   
I think, to your first point, you know, we see free and open competition
as the cornerstone of capitalism, as the President has said many times. 
So we don’t see our agenda is — as in any way in opposition to
industry.  We see it as it creating — as it fundamentally being about
creating more opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to
compete on the merits and thrive.  
   
I think the housing industry commitments we’ve seen today are an example
of industry stepping up in response to the President’s call to action on
— on junk fees.   
   
We’ve also seen bipartisan progress on issues like ocean shipping, where
we passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act.   
   
We worked with Congress on a bipartisan basis to secure more funding for
our antitrust enforcement agencies.   
   
There’s, you know, also bipartisan support for addressing noncompetes. 
Many aspects of this agenda, ag competition as well, have broad-based
support.  
   
On the housing costs question, I think one of the reasons that it’s so
important that we’re cracking down on rental application fees, for
example, is that in a tight rental market, people are sometimes paying
these costs multiple times.  Because, right now, you have to pay — you
have to do multiple applications to find an apartment.  And so, we see
these fees can really add up if at each time you’re having to pay $100
just for applying to — to get an apartment.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is \[senior administration
official\] from USDA.  I’ll just add to the bipartisan piece.   
   
So the 32 attorneys general — it’s a bipartisan group of attorneys
general and truly reinforces how bipartisan the competition initiative
is, recognizing that a fundamental part of Bidenomics is both investing
in rural people and building the economy through the middle class and
from the bottom up and the middle out.  
   
One example for the Chamber of Commerce about how the investments that
we’re making are investing in businesses as well is some of the small
and independent meatpacking companies that we’re investing in.   
   
So I — I came from a — recently visited a meatpacking processing plant
in Ohio — a small processing plant.  We were providing an opportunity
for them.  We were also providing an opportunity for the farmers and
ranchers in the area.  Because of the specific labeling opportunities
that came from that boutique meat packager, they were able to access
bigger markets in other places.   
   
So, by investing in competition, we’re also investing in small
businesses.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you so much, \[senior administration official\] and
\[senior administration official\].  I’ll now turn it over to Joshua
Sisco at Politico.   
   
Q    Hi, thanks for doing this.  I have an ag-related question.  In the
House appropriations bill, I believe there was language around House
Republicans wanting to block the USDA from implementing the packers and
stockyards rulemaking.  I’m wondering how the White House and USDA is
planning to work with lawmakers to protect this part of the competition
agenda.  Thanks.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much.  The Packers and
Stockyards Act is a fundamental part of the competition agenda, and it’s
a priority for us.  As you know, we have two rules that have closed on
comment and are — are ready — are lined up for — for final rule
shortly.   
   
We also have two other rules that are in — that are currently in the
pipeline in the spring agenda.   
   
And it is part of a comprehensive approach.  And I think that’s really
important to reinforce, that there are — that there is a lot of work
that needs to be done, and that’s a crucial part of it.  But so too are
investing in small meat packers and independent — -pendent packers, the
seeds — seed liaison, and making sure that we’re giving farmers a voice
in the — the patent process are other ways that we’re working on —
working to take on this competition.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can also add from the White House
perspective that we would love to see — as I said, there is bipartisan
interest in the ag competition space.  We would love to see Congress act
on that.   
   
We are also, to be clear, ve- — very ready to play a strong defense
here.  And from the White House’s perspective, any successful omnibus
agreement would have to maintain the status quo on no new riders. 
Thanks.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks, \[senior administration official\].  I’ll turn it
over now to Molly Nagle.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks so much for doing the call.  I just wanted to ask one
question of clarification on the housing portion of this.   
   
So, obviously, the three websites are — are putting forth — forward new
steps to make the fees more transparent and to make them clear to
consumers.  But just to be clear, there is no portion of this that’s
cutting down on the fees across the board nationwide as a part of this
announcement tomorrow, correct?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That’s right.  As part of the — this is
really about the — the announcement tomorrow is it really about
transparency of these fees, which — which we, of course, think will have
— will have the effect of — of cutting them down.   
   
But in terms of the specific actions that we’re announcing tomorrow,
it’s about transparency and — and giving consumers the opportunities to,
you know, really effectively consu- — comparison shop.   
   
MODERATOR:  And I would just add that that is similar to our — the —
what we had Ticketmaster and other ticketing companies agree to at a
recent event at the White House.   
   
And for our last question, I’ll turn it over to Akayla Gardner.   
   
Q    Hey, guys.  I’m wondering if you guys could just clarify the blind
spot that you mentioned earlier.  How will this new merger (inaudible)
sort of fill in those blind spots that you think is in the congressional
law?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks for the question.  So, as I
noted, as part of this process, we really heard from thousands and
thousands of people, ranging from farmers to independent pharmacists to
musicians, who all shared with the agencies, in particular, the ways in
which mergers and consolidation over the last few decades have made it
much more challenging to compete on a level playing field and to really
compete on the merits so that whoever has the best idea is able to
really come out on top.   
   
And unfortunately, all too often, they shared with us the ways in which
mergers have really undermined that free and fair competition.   
   
And so, hearing directly from them and — and understanding some of this
history was really important for us as we put together these guidelines
and included details on, you know, mergers that hurt workers: the ways
in which you could have serial acquisitions, where there can be a series
of deals where no individual merger acquisition necessarily raises
competition concerns, but, in the aggregate, that whole series can raise
concerns.   
   
We also noted in the guideline the way in which partial ownership and
minority interest can also be a mechanism of control.   
   
So, you know, we really lay out, in addition to some of the core
guidelines, details around special settings where there are additional
considerations that we as agencies need to keep in mind that we laid out
in the document as well.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, and this is \[senior
administration official\].  I would add that, you know, to build on what
\[senior administration official\] said, that the most important
question we can ask ourselves in evaluating a merger is: How does
competition in this industry present itself and does the merger threaten
that competition?  
   
And what we’ve learned over time is that this industry is transformed,
and our daily lives today are different than they were decades ago. 
It’s important to make sure that we’re updating our guidance to keep
pace with those on-the-ground changes.   
   
And so, for example, in many instances, the problem with a merger isn’t
that — always that a company is buying a direct competitor, but it might
be buying a company that threatens its dominance, either through a
disintermediation or through technologies that might disrupt and
