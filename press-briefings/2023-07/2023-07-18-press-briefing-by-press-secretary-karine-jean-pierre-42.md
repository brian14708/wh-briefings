James S.  Brady Press Briefing Room

1:57 P.M.  EDT  
   
MS.  JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Okay, so I wanted to start
today, once again, by calling out an unprecedented harm that Senator
Tuberville’s actions have to our famil- — have to our military readiness
and military families, to every branch of our armed forces,
disrespecting those who serve and the families who serve with them.   
   
As Se- — Secretary Austin just said moments ago, and I quote, “I would
imagine our adversaries would look at something like this and be pretty
happy that we create this kind of turbulence within our force.”   
   
As CNN reported this morning, the sen- — the senator’s own constituents
in Alabama are speaking out against this attack on our military.  This
is what Greg Black said — an Air Force veteran who supported Senator
Tuberville in 2020.  This is what he had to say, and I quote, “When you
start politicizing how to promote, I think we’re stepping into the wrong
territory,” end quote.  
   
I’ll also quote Gary Counts, another veteran, who described himself as a
conservative to CNN.  And I quote, “I just don’t think that you would
hold the national security hostage over an abortion issue.”   
   
Now, the former commander of Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama,
Retired General Jim Rogers, highlighted that Senator Tuberville is right
now depriving that base of a confirmed commander — commanding officer,
saying, “I am very concerned our senator is getting led down a path that
he does not understand the full impact for the military, and I just
recommend that he reconsider that.”   
   
And the sister of a man currently — currently serving in uniform, who
withheld her name out of concern for her brother’s career, told CNN, and
I quote, “He is very proud of his career in the military.  But he was
telling me that he’s still in limbo.  Nobody wants that stress and that
pressure of not knowing if you’re going — where you’re going within the
next couple of months.”   
   
Across the nation across the political spectrum, Americans are deeply
concerned at the damage Senator Tuberville’s holds can have on our armed
services and our military spouses and the children of service members
with this disrespect to our national security and our military.   
   
As the President said in Helsinki last week, Republicans in Congress
should step up and speak out.   
   
As you all know, today the Department of Education is holding a hearing
to get public input on the new debt relief that President Biden
announced a few weeks ago right after the SCOTUS decision.  As you all
know, the hearing is a key step forward in our work to get relief out to
as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible.   
   
The Department of Education also released state-by-state data showcasing
who stands to benefit from the thir- — from the over $39 billion in debt
relief we announced last week for over 800,000 borrowers.  These are
borrowers who had been making payments for decades but were never given
the relief they were promised.  So that’s what we saw with our
announcement last week.   
   
These borrowers are owed this relief, yet Republican-elected officials,
including those who had no problem with the government forgiving
billions of dollars in business loans, are still objecting to including
their own constituents.   
   
A couple of examples here: Representative Lisa McClain of Michigan said,
“Come hell or high water, I will fight this.”   
Now, there are — more than 26,000 borrowers from Michigan are eligible
for this relief.   
   
Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina said we’re “hurting
borrowers,” but more than 24,000 borrowers from North Carolina stand to
benefit from this relief.   
   
So congressional Republicans have made it clear they will stop at
nothing to block relief for middle-class borrowers, including their own
constituents.  But President Biden isn’t backing down either.  No
president has fought harder for student debt relief.  And guess what? 
He is not done yet.   
   
Also, today, Russia attacked Ukrainian ports in Odessa, Mykolaiv just
one day after Russia suspended its participation in the Black Sea Grain
Initiative.  By attacking Ukrainian ports and effectively establishing a
naval blockade to prevent Ukrainian grain and foodstuffs from going to
global markets, Russia is exacerbating food scarcity in some of the most
food-insecure regions of the globe, like the Horn of Africa and the
Sahel and Yemen.   
   
As U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said, Russia’s action will
“strike a blow” to people who need it the most.  
   
The United States will continue to support Ukraine’s effort to get
Ukrainian grain to the people that desperately need it.   
   
And finally, I’m excited to share with all of you the latest action
under President Biden’s leadership to protect American consumers. 
Today, in partnership with the FCC, we’re launching a cybersecurity
certification and labeling program, the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, to help
Americans more easily choose smart devices that are safer and less
vulnerable to cyberattacks.   
   
We’ve all heard concerns about the security of wireless devices.  This
new program will help give Americans greater peace of mind that the
devices they’re bringing into their homes, classrooms, or workplaces are
safe — safer and more secure.   
   
Already, 19 leading manufacturers and retailers, including Amazon, Best
Buy, Google, Samsung, Logitech, and more have — have announced their
support for the program.  In 2024, the program will be up and running. 
And soon after, Americans will be able to look for the Cyber Trust
Mark’s distinct shield — just like the logo on the screens behind me —
across common household devices, such as baby monitors, home security
cameras, fitness trackers, and smart TVs and refrigerators of all price
ranges.   
   
The logo will indicate to Americans shopping online or in stores the
device they’re buying meets the U.S. government’s cybersecurity
requirements and is less vulnerable to cyberattacks.  
   
This is another key step by the Biden administration to ease the
concerns of hardworking families, from cracking down on hidden junk fees
to strengthening cyber protections and protecting the privacy of people
in their own homes.  
   
With that — oh, you are not Zeke.  You are Josh.  
   
Q    I am.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Hi, Josh.  
   
Q    But if it — if it makes it easier, you can just call me “Zeke.” 
That’s fine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  No, I’m going to call you by your given
name.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    Three subjects.  First, the U.S. soldier who crossed the border
into North Korea.  AP is reporting that he had been held in a South
Korea prison and was supposed to fly to Fort Bliss, Texas, to face
disciplinary actions.  How did he escape the airport?  And is he a
security risk?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  And I know that the
Department of Defense — the Secretary, more specifically — spoke to this
moments ago.  So I’ll have a couple of things to share.  And this is
something that Penta- — Pentagon obviously has already shared.  
   
In the afternoon of July 18th, local time, a U.S. soldier on a private
JSA orientation tour crossed, willfully and without authorization, the
military demarcation line into the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea.  And we believe the soldier is currently in DPRK custody and are
working with our North Korean counterparts to resolve this incident.   
   
DOD is in the process of notifying next of kin.  Until that is complete,
they will not release identification of the soldier.   
   
The White House, the Department of Defense, the State Department, and
also the U.N. are all working together to ascertain more information and
resolve this situation.   
   
I don’t have more to share beyond that.  We are looking into this. 
We’re trying to get more information.   
   
As I mentioned, the DO- — DOD has been in touch with their counterparts
as — as well as — as others who are certainly working on this together. 
Been in touch with the Korean People’s Army, as the Department of
Defense has done.   
   
Just don’t have any more to share beyond that.  
   
Q    Secondly, the Houston Chronicle is reporting that Texas troopers
were told to push migrant children into the Rio Grande River.  What
steps is the administration taking to verify this report and address the
findings?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I saw — we saw those reports, clearly.  If they are
true, it is abhorrent, it is despicable, it is dangerous.  And we’re
talking about the bedrock values of who we are as a country.   
   
And the indecency — the human indecency that we’re seeing, potentially,
if this is true, is just wrong.   It is just completely, completely
wrong.   
   
But I would say, sadly, it would not be surprising from a governor, who,
let’s not forget, on Christmas Eve, put migrant children on the streets
in below-zero-degree temperature.  That’s what we saw from this
governor.   
   
But again, we don’t know if this is true, if the reporting is true.  But
it is — it is truly troubling to hear this type of reporting.  
   
Q    And then, lastly, former President Trump received a letter from the
Special Counsel that he’s being investigated for his role and efforts to
overturn the 2020 election.  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says the Biden
administration has decided to, quote, “weaponize government to go after
their number one opponent,” end quote.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll say —  
   
Q    Have you weaponized government?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Here’s what we have done: The President respects the
Department of Justice, their independence.  He has been very — very
steadfast on making sure that the rule of law comes back in this
administration, comes back in the White House, and clearly the
administration more broadly.  And that’s what you have seen.   
   
I’m just not going to comment on this particular case.  
   
Go ahead, Mary.  
   
Q    On the service member who crossed into North Korea.  I know you’re
still gathering information; this is unfolding.  But, I guess, big
picture, you know, what lengths is this administration willing to go
to?  How much diplomatic capital are you willing to spend to get this
service member back, given that he willfully crossed?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’re looking into this.  We’re looking into
— clearly, there’s an investigation on th- — in this incident.  And this
is something that the Secretary said himself, which is our primary
concern at this time is ascertaining, clearly, the wellbeing of this
individual.  And so, that’s going to be certainly our primary focus
here.  
   
As I mentioned, the Department of Defense is certainly reach — has
reached out to their counterpart at DPRK.  I’m just not going to go
beyond that at this time.  
   
Q    And at this point, though, do you know if North Korea is asking for
anything in return?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share.  This is — and this is
something that the Secretary said as well: This is a very early stages
of — of this issue, of this incident.  And so, we’re trying to gather as
much information as possible.  
   
Go ahead, Jeremy.  
   
Q    Thanks.  On the soldier who crossed into North Korea, do you know
what the misconduct was that he was being disciplined for?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any information beyond what you already
know.  
   
Q    And do you know exactly where within the Joint Security Area that
this occurred?  Was it within one of those buildings at — at the Joint
Security Area?  Was it outside?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All very good questions.  As I said, this is the
beginning — very early stages of this investigation.  We’re going to
look into it.  I just don’t have anything to share beyond that.  
   
Q    Okay.  And on — on January 6th.  I understand that you guys aren’t
going to comment specifically on this case.  But the President has held
former President Trump responsible for the events of January 6th
previously in his rhetoric in a number of ways.  So I’m wondering how
does he feel about the fact that the former President may now be held
accountable for the events of that day?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, this is an ongoing case.  I’m just not going
to respond to — to any hypotheticals that’s currently, you know, out
there in the world.  I’m just not going to — be very, very mindful and
give the Department of Justice their space to do — to do this
investigation.  Just not going to comment from here.  
   
Q    And then, just quickly, on a last topic.  My colleague, Priscilla,
reported that the U.S. has been holding migrants at detention — CBP
detention facilities for more than 10 days.  This is as a result of some
of the administration’s policy changes, even though it’s U.S. government
policy to not hold those individuals for longer than 72 hours.   
   
So what is the administration doing to rectify this?  And to what extent
do you believe the President’s policies are responsible for this
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I have to look into that reporting.  It’s the
first time I’m hearing about this.   
   
As you know, we have our policies as it relates to holding migrants.  I
just have not seen that reporting, and I would have to get back so I can
actually give you the correct information.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  NSC’s Kurt Campbell is in Seoul attending a
U.S.-South Korea meeting currently.  Is he getting involved in any
capacity in getting the American soldier out?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share about specific
individuals’ involvement.  What I can say is the White House, the
Department of Defense, State — the State Department, and, certainly, the
U.N. are all involved and have — and as I mentioned, DOD has reached out
to their counterpart.  I just don’t have anything on anyone specifically
being involved.   
   
Q    But can you share anything on whether there has been a request to
the North Koreans for the return of this soldier?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — all I can say is that we’ve done outreach to our —
to the respective counterparts and, in particular, the Department of
Defense.  I just don’t have anything else to share.   
   
As I mentioned, even the Secretary of Defense said we are in the early
stages of this.  And so, we’re looking into this incident and obviously
want to get it resolved.   
   
Q    Quick one on Israel.  Will President Biden be asking President
Herzog to, sort of, take any kind of message back to Prime Minister
Netanyahu about the need for him to back off the Knesset vote or get
back into talks with the opposition to reach a compromise or potentially
some kind of consensus on the issue of judicial overhaul?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I think in our readout, that is certainly
something that the President spoke to the Prime Minister himself
yesterday.  So, that is a topic —  
   
Q    It was mentioned towards the end of the readout, so can you give us
some details?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But it’s in the readout, correct?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s in the readout.  Okay.  So, a couple of things I
do want to say and just pretty much reiterating what the President just
said moments ago during the pool spray, which is: His love for Israel is
deep-rooted and longstanding since his early days of — of government. 
So that’s important.   
   
And one of the reasons — one of the reasons this conversation is so
important is this — Israel is clearly celebrating their 70th — 70th
anniversary of Israel’s independence.  And this was an opportunity to —
to lift up, continue that partnership at a higher level, certainly.   
   
And they’re going to be talking about the advance — advancing a more
integrated, peaceful, and prosperous Middle East, which is something
that the President has certainly led on and talked about over the past —
past — more recently, past — this past year.   
   
And a couple of things.  Preserving the path of negotiating a two-state
solution is — is going to be on the table for discussion.   
   
The administration’s new plan to counter antisemitism.  As you all know,
this past May, we announced a very comprehensive once-of-a-kind
antisemitism plan, which we think is incredibly important at this
moment.  
   
The importance of upholding democratic princip- — principles, including
the checks and balances as we talk about judicial reform.  And the cha-
— and the changes have the broadest possible — if that — if there are
changes, that needs to have the br- — the broadest possible consensus
within our system.   
   
So, certainly, the President is going to talk about how the President of
Israel himself has been involved in brokering a compromise as it relates
to judicial reform.  So those are the conversations that’s going to be
on the table.   
   
But the President has certainly — has had that conversation directly
with the Prime Minister, as recently as yesterday.   
   
Q    And can you confirm a venue for the meeting?  Israelis are saying
it’s going to be at the White House with Prime Minister Netanyahu, but
the White House hasn’t confirmed the venue.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I can say is the — both the Prime Minister and
the President talked about certainly continuing to be in touch.  And so,
they’re, you know — both — both of their sides — right? — are — both
governments are going to — staff on both governments are going to have
those conversations.  I just don’t have anything to preview for you at
this time.   
   
Q    So why the hesitation in confirming the venue?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  There’s no — there’s no hesitation.  I mean, we have
said — we have confirmed yesterday that they said they were going to see
each other later this year.  We just have to — we just haven’t worked
that out in some time.  This takes a little bit of time on where that’s
going to be and how that’s going to look.   
   
Go ahead, Kelly O.  
   
Q    It does appear that there’s a hesitation to confer a White House
meeting on Netanyahu, based on just a lack of willingness to be explicit
about that.   
   
I mean, I would imagine the Prime Minister will also be at United
Nations General Assembly, and that would be another potential venue that
would fall into what you were describing yesterday.   
   
Is there any reason why the White House wouldn’t make it explicit that a
White House invitation has been extended?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, you just laid out: There’s potential other
opportunities for the two leaders to meet with each other.  As I — as I
stated — as — as I’ve stated, the — you know, the details are going to
be worked out by the — by the different teams on where — what that’s
going to look like and where that’s going to be.  But they have
committed to meeting and seeing each other in the United States later
this year.   
   
I just don’t have a specific on location.  It’s going to be worked out. 
And as soon as we know, we’ll certainly share it with all of you.  
   
Q    Can you walk us through how the President was notified about the
North Korean incident and if that generated any kind of a separate
meeting for him, or was it part of the PDB? Something like this is
certainly unusual, so if there’s any detail you could give us about how
that came about today.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That — that’s a very good question.  I can tell you
for sure that there’s — clearly, the President has been briefed,
obviously.  This is the type of incident that he would be briefed on, as
you all know.  
   
I don’t have the specifics if it was part of his PDB or a separate
briefing.  But certainly this is something that the President is
watching very closely and will be — will be kept updated.   
   
Q    Should we anticipate a call to South Korea or other partners in the
region as a result of this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, one thing I can say is that I don’t have any calls
to read out to anybody that the President is going to be calling,
specifically in — in — in either North Korea or South Korea.   
   
I can say that as it relates to our partners, we have been engaging with
— with — certainly with Sweden and South Korea, but I don’t have any
calls to lay out specifically for the President.  
   
Q    Karine, thank you.  On the matter of the U.S. soldier, you said
that the U.S. is working to resolve this matter.  Can you just clarify
what a “resolution” is?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I mean, relo- — resolve this incident, resolve
this matter to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.   
   
There is an investigation that’s currently occurring.  There has been
outreach from the Department of Defense — right? — as I mentioned, to
their counterparts over at the Korean People — People’s Army.  You have
the State Department, you have the Department of Defense, you have the
U.N. and the White House all working together to resolve this. 
Resolving this is basically getting to the bottom of exactly what
happened.  And that is important for us to know.  
   
I just don’t have more to share.  And once we do, we’ll certainly share
the information.  
   
Q    So he doesn’t mean bringing him home?  Because —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we have said — we have also said — look, he’s an
American citizen — that is important to note — right? — as we know, as a
soldier.  We have also said our primary concern at this time is
ascertaining his wellbeing and getting — getting to the bottom of
exactly what happened and what occurred.   
   
I’m just going to say what Secretary Austin said moments ago.  He’s
absolutely concerned about the welfare of his troops.  Right?  That is
something that, as the Secretary of Defense, that he is concerned
about.  And this will — will develop in the next several days and
hours.  And certainly, we’ll keep you posted.  And that is coming
directly from the Secretary of Defense.  
   
Q    Are you working under the assumption that this soldier wants to
come back to the U.S., or do you know that for certain?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not working under any hypotheticals or any
assumptions.  What we’re doing is trying to — there is going to be an
investigation into this incident.  I certainly don’t want to get into
hypotheticals, speculations of what occurred or — or how — how we ended
up here.  We just want to make sure that we get to the bottom of this.  
   
Q    And then, quickly, on another topic.  We were informed shortly
before going into the Oval Office that several members of the Israeli
delegation tested positive for COVID.  Can you tell us whether President
Herzog was tested before his meeting, given the close proximity to
President Biden?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, we have testing protocols when —
anytime somebody meets with the President.  So I can tell you that
anybody who meets with the President does indeed get tested.  I do.  We
all do.   
   
Any specifics, additional questions about the — you know, what occurred
amongst the Israeli delegation, I would certainly refer you to them.   
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
Q    We’re not in danger though, right?  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Despite the Supreme Court ruling, Alabama state
lawmakers proposed a congressional map that would — a secondary map that
would have a district that will be 42 percent Black — not quite a
majority, as the plaintiffs in the case have said.  They say this is a
violation of the Supreme Court ruling.   
   
Does the White House take that position that this proposed map does not
fulfill the ruling of the Supreme Court to have that second district
majority Black?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So that is something that I would have to refer you to
the Department of Justice.  I’m just not going to speak to that from
here.  I have not seen the secondary map of what — what it is that they
— that’s being done in Alabama.  But I would refer you to Department of
Justice.  
   
Q    And on voting rights, Senator Warnock and Senate Democrats today
are reintroducing the Freedom to Vote Act, something that the President
has called for Congress to pass, repeatedly.  Though we know the
political reality in the House for that bill, what is the White House’s
message to Americans more broadly about voting rights with the
reintroduction of the Freedom to Vote Act?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as you just stated, this is something that
the President sees as a priority and making sure that Americans have the
right to vote, have those freedoms intact.   
   
And so, that is something — a message that the President will always
continue to share.  He’s going to continue to call on Congress to act. 
It sounds like they’re moving forward in the right direction, and we
think that’s incredibly important.   
   
And it is our — it is our constitutional right to be able to — to vote,
to vote freely; to be able to make sure our voices are heard.  But just
not going to go beyond that.  
   
Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Did the President address at all Congresswoman
Jayapal’s comments in his meeting with Herzog?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say that one more time?  
   
Q    Did the President have to address Congresswoman Jayapal’s comment
that Israel is a racist state?  Did that come up?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What do you mean “had to address”?  
   
Q    Did it come up all in the conversation with President Herzog?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, they’re currently having a conversation right
now in the bilat.  
   
Q    Did he plan to address it?  Did it come up in his call with
Netanyahu yesterday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, the President has been very clear — right? —
and I kind of stated this at the at the beginning: The United States and
Israel’s relationship is a special one.  There’s a special bond. 
There’s a commitment, and it is a commitment to Israel’s right to exist,
Israel’s security and its legit- — legitimacy.   
   
I mean, that’s one of the reasons that the President spoke to the Prime
Minister yesterday and is having this important meeting with the Israeli
President.  They’re going to have a conversation on how we continue to
grow that special relationship.   
   
As I just laid out, 75 years of Israel’s independence is being
celebrated this year.  And we think it’s important to continue that
relationship.  
   
Q    The reason I ask is because, yesterday, Kirby had said that, you
know, there were — you guys were glad that she apologized.  But what we
didn’t hear was any condemnation of her comment from the White House. 
Does the White House condemn that comment?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — I mean, look, the apology was the right thing to
do.  And we’ve been very clear: When it comes to antisemitism, this
administration and the entire Biden — Biden-Harris administration have
been clear that when Israel is — is singled out because of anti-Jewish
hate, that’s antisemitism, and that is unacceptable.   
   
One of the reasons — and I just said this moments ago — back in May, the
President put forward a comprehensive plan on how to — how to counter
antisemitism. 

It is something that is one of — it’s a first-of-a-kind strategy that
we’ve not seen before.  And — and it is comprehensive and is — and is
ambitious. 

So you already have seen the commitment from this President on how to
deal with an issue that we feel is incredibly unacceptable. 

So we have been — we’ve been clear on our record.  We’ve been clear on
speaking against antisemitism throughout — throughout this
administration when we see it. 

Q    So the White House does condemn that comment? 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, I just said, if it is — if — anytime
anti-Jewish hatred is — is said, that is antisemitism, and we — and we
find it to be unacceptable. 

But at the same time, we think it’s important that the congresswoman did
indeed apologize for her comments, and we’re glad to see it.

Q    Okay.  I didn’t hear whether it was a “yes” or a “no” to that
question. 

But in another vein, there’s a vote happening in the House today, a
resolution saying that Israel is not a racist state or an apartheid
state.  Does the White House want to see strong support for that
resolution?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  First of all, we condemn antisemitism.  Anytime there
is any anti-Jewish hate, we condemn it.  We’ve been very clear.  That is
answering your question.

As it relates to anything that’s going on on the House, I’d refer you to
the House. 

But, again, I cannot be more clearer: You have the President right now
meeting with the President of Israel, a very important meeting that
they’re having.  They’re doing a bilat right now.  And one of the things
that the President is going to make very clear is the special bond and
our commitment to Israel.  And it is unwavering, it is unshakable, and
the President finds — finds that relationship, again, very deep.  And it
— it — it started when he first walked into government.

Q    I hear you, and I’m sorry to push on it.  It’s just because —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I’ve already —

Q    — there are — there’s been criticism —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We just went back and forth.

Q    — that Democrats don’t want to —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We g- — we just —

Q    — take action against other Democrats when they have to apologize
for something like this.  There has been criticism —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   We just — we just —

Q    — that you —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We just said that we’re glad that she apologized. 
Congresswoman — Congresswoman Jayapal did indeed apologize.  And we have
been very clear: Anytime Israel is singled out with anti-Jewish hate,
which is indeed antisemitism, it is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable. 

You have an administration that has put forth a comprehensive plan to
counter antisemitism, something that we have not seen in this way from
any other administration.  That shows the President’s commitment to this
issue. 

I’m going to move on. 

Go ahead, Andrew.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  Two questions.  Is the President satisfied with
the pace at which Afghan allies are being processed to enter the U.S.? 
There are a lot of folks who were left behind, who were in third
countries who served with the U.S. during the years we were there, and
they’re still waiting.  Is he satisfied?  And would he push the Senate
to include the Afghan Adjustment Act in their version of the NDAA?

And then I have a second question.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I think what I can say is our commitment continues
to stand — right? — to make sure that we take care of the folks who
helped us during the longest war in this country that we have — we have
seen, that we have supported.  And — and the work continues.  The work
is going to continue.

Any specifics on, you know, data, or any specifics on how fast it’s
moving and where we are currently, I would certainly refer you to the
State Department.

Q    And then, on — on what the former President said on his social
media site today.  Has President Biden asked for any sort of
intelligence estimate or inquired as to preparations for potential
violence in reaction to any further indictments of the former President?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I could say this: We are always prepared.  I
don’t have anything to share beyond that.

Go ahead, Anita.

Q    Thank you so much.  On Taiwan, the Vice President of Taiwan is
coming through the States soon.  He is currently the front-runner in
Taiwan’s presidential election.  Just wondering if any American
high-level officials plan to meet with him and what messages they plan
to convey to this leader as he comes through the States.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  So, we expect the Vice
President Lai will transit the United States on the outbound and return
legs of his trip to Paraguay in August.  That’s what we’re expecting. 
This is a routine, given the distances involved. 

Transits are not visits.  They are, as you know — we’ve talked about
this many times from here — unofficial.  Transits by Taiwan vice
presidents are common.  They have been about 10 vice presidential
transit in the last 20 years.  All have occurred without incident.  This
would be the 11th transit, and it would be Vice President Lai’s second. 
He previously transited in 2021. 

I don’t have anything else to — to share.  And, again, this is
consistent and longstanding practices.  It is the unofficial nature of
our relations with Taiwan and our One China policy, which remains
unchanged. 

Don’t have anything else to share.  I would refer you, certainly, to the
Taiwan gover- — to Taiwanese government on anything — on any meetings
that they may be having.

Q    And just clarifying on the engagement between Washington and North
Korea on this — on this soldier.  Is this military-to-military
communication between the U.S. —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes.  Department of Defense.  Yes.

Q    (Inaudible.)  And then, are — is the U.S. engaged in any direct
communication with Pyongyang or any political leaders in that country?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything outside of what the
Department of Defense have shared and what we have shared.  As I
mentioned, the Department of Defense is certainly in touch with their
counterparts.  
Go ahead, Karen.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Much of the country, and parts of Europe
especially, are experiencing extreme heat or severe weather right now. 
Will the President use this moment to focus on climate change with an
event or remarks?  And is there something that the federal government is
doing with some of these states — Arizona, Texas — to help people as
they’re experiencing this heatwave right now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things, Karen.  Look, we saw the
multiple reporting and ex- — of extreme weather over the past couple of
days, especially this weekend.  We’re talking about flooding; we’re
talking about wildfire smoke, extreme heat.  So, we know climate change
has an effect, and you — as you know, this President has done more than
any other president to deal with climate change, to deal with the crisis
that we’re currently seeing.  
   
A couple of things that we are doing to help communities deals with —
deal with these different extremes and ex- — extreme weather is: FEMA is
opening cooling centers.  We’re strengthening the power grid to be more
resilient to extreme heat.  We’re bringing local officials together to
discuss preparedness measures.  And we’re doing everything that we can
to tackle the root causes of climate change.   
   
This is why the Inflation Reduction Act is so important.  It is a — it
is a historic legislation that is going to do the most than any other
piece of legislation to deal — to tackle with this crisis that we’re
seeing currently.  
   
Q    Karine, where is FEMA doing the cooling centers?  And is the
extreme weather right now and this heat — is this part of the
President’s briefings that he’s getting right now?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, as you know, the President has been kept pretty
much up to date on the extreme weather situation that we have seen over
the past couple of weeks.  So that’s going to continue.  
   
As far as where the cooling centers is, we can — we can certainly get
that for — for all of you to share — to share.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  So, I’m curious — in Congress tomorrow — so will
the President be monitoring at all or get updates on the House Oversight
Committee where the second whistle- — IRS whistleblower is going to be
testifying?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the President has a busy day tomorrow.  As you all
know, he’s convening the — the Competition Council to a new — to
announce new actions to — to increase competition in American economy,
to make sure that we’re doing everything that we can to lower — lower
costs for consumers, and also to help entrepreneus- — entrepreneurs and
small businesses thrive.   
   
And that’s what the President is going to be focused on tomorrow.  These
are pillars, as you can imagine, of Bidenomics.  It’s something that
we’ve been talking about, certainly, the last couple of weeks.  So he’s
going to have a busy day.  That’s going to be the focus.   
   
Q    So is the President —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s going to be focused on the American people.   
   
Q    Is the President concerned about the impartiality of the IRS in
terms of their work and their investigations that they do then?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to speak to — to speak to the
hearing that’s happening tomorrow.  No comment from here.   
   
Go ahead, Michael.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Back on the Houston Chronicle article on the
border.  What, if anything, is the administration doing to verify those
reports?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The reports on —  
   
Q    The border.  Yeah, the — the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The numbers?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
Q    Pushing the migrants.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.   
   
Q    Yeah, yeah.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Which — which part?  The — can you say more?  
   
Q    The part about the — you know, the — the pushing — (clears throat)
— excuse me — the pushing them in the river.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So this is about Abbott, you’re talking about? 
I just want to make sure, because there is a lot of things happening at
the border.   
   
Okay.  So, look, I think what we have done — the President has dem- —
demonstrated leadership on how to — how to deal with — how to make — put
— put forward a plan that’s humane — right? — that’s humane, and
actually is also effective.  And you saw that in the past couple of
months.   
   
What we’re seeing right now, if you’re denying migrants water, isn’t —
that’s not enforcement.  That is abusive.  That is atrocious.   
   
And so, we don’t know if these reports are true.  Clearly, we’re hearing
them just like you are.  So, certainly, we’re going to call that out.   
   
And so, we have repeatedly said — we have repeatedly said that we are
willing to work with Republicans and Democrats to deal with this issue. 
The President, on his first day, said that he would put forth a
comprehensive — put forth a comprehensive immigration plan.  And that’s
what we want to work on.   
   
The President has done everything that he can, with the tools that he
has, to put forward a humane process.  And we see that that process is
working.  But when you do this in an inhumane way, we’re going to —
we’re going to call that out.  And it is abhorrent, if this is indeed
true.   
   
Q    Johnson & Johnson has filed suit against the administration over
the Medicare provision in the — in the Inflation Reduction Act.  Do you
have a response?  
   
And is there any concern from the White House that that provision, now
facing multiple lawsuits, may be struck down?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, what we’re going to continue to do is make
sure that the President does everything he can to lower costs for the
American people.  And that’s what we saw in the Inflation Reduction
Act.  The President is proud of that.  The President is — has always
said he’s going to do everything that he can to give Americans a little
bit of breathing room.   
   
And, look, what we’re seeing now, that Medicare is allowed to — allowed
to be able to have those — have those conversations to lower costs,
that’s important.  That’s important.   
   
We want to work with pharmaceuticals on how do we — how we move forward
on continuing to lower costs.  But we’re certainly not going to shy away
from what the President has promised when it comes to healthcare, when
it comes to drug cost.  And that’s why, again, Inflation Reduction Act
is so critical and so important.   
   
I’m not going to get to the legalese of this.  I’ll let the Department
of Justice deal with it.   
   
Go ahead, Courtney.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask about Julie Su.  What precedent does it
set to have a Cabinet official doing the job of — or, excuse me, have an
acting official doing the job of a Cabinet secretary, when she can’t get
confirmed or have the votes to do it?  I know that you all know that
there aren’t votes at this point to confirm her, yet she’s still doing
the job in an acting capacity, and it seems like it will be for a
while.  So what precedent does that set?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I can’t — I can’t speak to the timeline.  What I
can speak to is we are committed — the President is committed to get her
— get her through.  He nominated her because he believed that she was
eminently qualified to do the job.  And she has done it in a — in a
brilliant way.   
   
Let’s not forget the major labor agreements that she was able to do with
the West Coast ports.  That’s something she did as acting.  And let’s
not forget that — what that would have done.  That would have hurt our
supply chain.  And so, she has been able to do that.   
   
And so, she has strong support from businesses.  She has strong support
from labor.  This should not be held up.  She was unanimously, as you
all know, confirmed as Deputy Secretary by all Senate Democrats.  And
so, we’re going to continue to push forward.  
   
I can’t speak to the precedence of this or unprecedence of this.  What I
can speak to is our commitment to getting Julie Su through.  And that’s
something that the President has said.  It is — he — it is — his
commitment to her is unwavering.  And she is more than qualified to be
the Secretary of Department of Labor.  
   
Q    And is the President okay having someone in a job that can’t get
confirmed by the Senate — basically going around the Senate and putting
the the person you want in anyways?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I do want to say this, as you asked me about
your first question: There is no time limit for federal vacancies. 
Reform Act that she is serving under — that is the act that we have —
were able to do this, to make her Acting Secretary.   
   
We think, again, that she is more than qualified.  That is the reason
why the President appointed her.  And we want to see her get through
swiftly.  We want her to — to see her get confirmed swiftly.  And that’s
what we’re going to continue to call for.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Senator Rand Paul is holding up about five dozen diplomatic
nominations right now.  He’s saying it’s because the Biden
administration is not providing documents related to the origins of
COVID.  What is your message to Paul?  And do you plan to provide those
documents?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things, because there are some stats
here that are important as what we’re seeing here.  The State Department
currently has 62 state nominees outstanding with the Senate, including
38 ambassador nominee — ambassadorial nominees on the Senate floor,
awaiting confirmation for posts in Asia, Latin America, Europe, Middle
East, Africa, where U.S. leadership is desperately needed.  This is
what’s happening.  
   
And of the 38 nominees awaiting a floor vote, all but three of the
individuals are career Foreign Service.  The nominees are highly
qualified.  They’re — they are Foreign Service officers who have served
under multiple administrations and received bipartisan support.  So
there’s no reason why we should not be moving with them.  
   
Holds on State Department nominees are leaving critical posts unfilled. 
This summer, for the first time ever, you have Egypt, you have Jordan,
you have Lebanon — will have no confirm U.S. ambassadors.  And we remain
without ambassadors in other countries as well, like African Union, UAE,
Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti.   
   
So unfortunately, these nominees are under a blanket hold, as you just
stated, from Senator Paul.  The Department of State has cooperated
extensively — extensively with the senator.  They have provided
documents and other information.  But he continues to block all State
nominees for no reason.  Because they have — they have worked with the
senator, they have provided documents, and he continues to block them.  
   
Q    Great.  And one other topic.  Congressional Republicans have been
asking for more information about why Rob Malley was put on a leave of
absence and had his security clearance revoked I think about a month
ago.  Do you have any information on that for us?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the State Department.  They would
have more information on that.  
   
Go ahead, Alex.  
   
Q    There are, I think, four members of the House who are going to
boycott President Herzog’s address tomorrow.  And one of them,
Representative Cori Bush, said that the Israeli government is “enforcing
an apartheid state” and that it “shows no respect for human rights.” 
So, by your definition, is what Representative Bush said antisemitic?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, what I can say is that the President has a
longstanding relationship with Israel.

It is — he is committed to their security, committed to continuing that
relationship — hence why he is meeting with the President of Israel. 
And so, that is what’s important.  
   
I cannot speak to other — other congressional members in the House. 
That is for them to speak to why they choose to boycott or to do
whatever it is that they’re doing today.   
   
But what we can speak to is our commitment — our longstanding commitment
to Israel, our longstanding support to Israel.  And that is something
that the President will continue to be committed to.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    The Congressional Picnic is tomorrow.  And I’m just wondering: Are
— are all members invited, including — including those that may share —
may have some different perspectives from the White House on
investigations, in particular?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m not going to speak to — just be careful here
and not speak to investigations.  
   
Look, we — we have consistently invited not just Democrats but
Republicans to the White House.  You all know this.  You have seen them
walking around or them invited to events here.  That is not unusual.  So
that is something that we will continue to do.  I just don’t have
anything else to share beyond that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Media reported today that Turkey and Saudi
Arabia are holding secret talks to return Ukrainian children taken by
Russia.  Are you aware of —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I —  
   
Q    — these talks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All I heard is Turkey and —  
   
Q    Saudi Arabia — are holding secret talks to return Ukrainian
children taken by Russia.  Are you aware or in contact with these two
countries?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share on that — on that
particular question.  
   
Q    Okay.  One more question.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    South Africa asked the International Criminal Court to be — to not
arrest President Putin, who is supposed to visit the country next
month.  What do you make of that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Can you say the beginning of the — the  question?  
   
Q    Yes.  South — South Africa asked the International Criminal Court
not to arrest President Putin, who is visiting the country —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Not to arrest him?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    Because they are a signatory to the International Criminal Court. 
What do you make of that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we’ve — we’ve all seen with our own eyes and
your reporting what Putin has done to Ukraine, the devastation that he
has caused.  And this is an aggression of his own doing into a country’s
own freedom and democracy.   
   
And what we’ve seen from the Ukrainian people — and you’ve heard us
speak to this — is how bravely they are fighting for that democracy, for
their freedom.  
   
And we have seen Putin commit war crimes.  We have seen him do that, and
that’s what he continues to do.  
   
And let’s be very clear, you know, this war can end at any time.  It can
end at any time if Mr. Putin decides to.  
   
And what we are committed to, what we will say and speak to over and
over again, as you heard from the President during his press conference
in Helsinki, is our commitment to the Ukrainian people as long as it
takes to help them fight for — fight — continue to fight bravely for
their democracy and for their freedom.  And that’s our commitment.  
   
Thanks, everybody.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  See you tomorrow.   
   
2:40 P.M. EDT
