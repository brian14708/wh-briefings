James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:13 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  So, I know some of you are going to
have to leave for the pool call, which is absolutely fine.  We will also
keep you honest on when the President is getting ready to speak.  So
there are a couple of mechanics.  Chris is going to be our special
helper on this front today.  Thank you.   
   
Okay, a couple of items at the top.  As you may have seen, today, the
FAA — the Federal Aviation Administrator — Administration — announced it
will award $8 billion in airport rescue grants from the American Rescue
Plan to keep airport workers employed, construction projects going,
provide rent relief to in-terminal concession companies, and help U.S.
airports recover from the impacts of COVID-19.   
   
Thanks to the President’s successful vaccination program, America is on
the move again.  There are over three times more Americans traveling
through airports now than at any time last year, and this funding will
help airports ramp up operations, keep travelers safe, and workers
employed.  Hundreds of airports across the country will receive this
funding, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, including airports in
Philadelphia; Charleston, West Virginia; Anchorage, Alaska;
Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Portland, Maine; and Portland, Oregon.  
   
Last item for the top: It’s the first official week of summer, as you
all know, and the onset of peak wildfire season.  We’ve already — we’re
already experiencing extreme heat in the West, several large wildland
fires, and we’ve had three named Atlantic storms — including Tropical
Storm Claudette, which led to the tragic loss of life in Alabama this
past weekend.   
   
It was important to the President to meet with the FEMA Administrator
and members of the Emergency Preparedness team, including the Homeland
Security Advisor, to discuss the federal government’s ongoing
preparedness and response efforts, as well as how FEMA supports
communities in need.  Hence, that’s what he will be doing this
afternoon.  
   
Josh, why don’t you kick us off.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two subject areas.  First, with regard to voting
rights, President Biden described his 2020 campaign as a battle for the
soul of America.  What does the administration think is more important
for the soul: upholding the tradition of the filibuster or getting the
voting rights agenda through?  If you had to make the choice, what is
that choice?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we don’t see it through that prism, which won’t
surprise you.  I will say that, first, the President believes that
expanding access to voting, making it easier for people to vote should
be a fundamental right for the American public across the country.  And
it will be a fight of his presidency long past today.   
   
And I will also note — since you gave me the opportunity — that this has
been a fight that he has been battling through the course of his
career.  When he was in the Senate, he fought for an extension of the
Voting Rights Act.   
   
And it’s something that he, of course, talked about on the campaign
trail, and he will continue to use the bully pulpit but also every lever
in government to continue to advocate for moving forward.  
   
Q    And then, secondly, the President is going to meet with the FEMA
Administrator this afternoon.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Obviously, we’re seeing a lot of extreme weather and climate
events.  Researchers have an event at Columbia University this week to
look at moving people out of harm’s way in order to mitigate the effects
of extreme weather.  Does this administration believe that more people
need to leave the areas adversely affected by climate change in order to
address the issue?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s a really interesting question, Josh.  And I don’t
know if they’ll be talking about that during the President’s briefing
this afternoon.   
   
I will note that, while it’s traditional for Presidents to get briefings
on hurricanes and preparedness for hurricanes, it was important to him
and to our team to also get a briefing on wildfires and the impacts, and
also to take steps that are — to prepare for that and the impacts on
local communities.   
   
Whether that means moving people from their homes — it’s a great
question.  I’ll have to see what comes out of the briefing today.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On COVID and missing the 70 percent deadline: As this
White House sees it, what went wrong?  What happened there?  Was the
goal too high, the number just not attainable?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, we don’t see it exactly like something went
wrong.  How we see it is: We set a bold, ambitious goal — something the
President has done from the very beginning — and we are expected to meet
that goal just a couple of weeks after July 4th.  And, in fact, at this
point, as of today, we’re going to be already at that point for people
who are 30 years of age and older.   
   
What we also know, though — and we’ve learned this as we’ve been working
to get the pandemic under control, take on this herculean task where
there is no playbook — is that there are demographic groups and
sometimes populations where it’s more difficult to reach.  We’ve seen
that and we’ve talked about that as it related to — early on, to
hesitancy we were seeing in communities of color or some more
conservative communities.   
   
And we’ve seen it’s been a great deal more difficult to get — to get
young people between the ages of 18 and 26 vaccinated than adults who
are older than that.  Hence, we are redoubling our efforts to ensure we
are targeting, we are focusing on, we are making the vaccine more
accessible for those age groups.   
   
But again, we are on — we are already meeting the goal of vaccinating
with one dose 70 percent of Americans 30 years of age and older.  And we
are working toward meeting it for all adults as soon as possible.   
   
Q    And just quickly, if I can follow up on voting rights here. 
Yesterday, you said that there’s more work to be done — among that is
including engaging state legislatures.  But the problems, as Democrats
at least see it, is not problems in blue states — state legislatures;
it’s Republican-controlled states where many of these decisions are
already being made.  So what leverage do you actually have?  And what,
realistically, do you think you can accomplish in some of these red
states?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I think the point we’ve been making is that
it’s, in part, a federal approach that is needed.   
   
And I think it’s important to remember why we’re at this point: State
legislatures, as you referenced, across the country are passing a wave
of anti-voter laws based on the same repeatedly disproven lies that led
to an assault on our nation’s Capitol.  They are putting these laws in
place because they did not like the outcome and they’ve continued to
perpetuate a lie about the outcome of the election.  That’s why we’re
here.   
   
What the President and what the Vice President will do is engage with
voting rights groups; engage with legislatures who are supportive of
expanding access to voting around the country — yes, there are — even in
red states, there are many Democratic legislators or legislators who
want to expand that access; empower them, work with them, support them
in these efforts; and continue to fight to get legislation across the
finish line on the federal level.   
   
So this fight is not over.  No matter the outcome today, it is going to
continue.   
   
Go ahead  
   
Q    Jen, you mentioned the bully pulpit on the voting issue.  Jamaal
Bowman, a congressman, said earlier today, the President needs to be a
lot more “vocal,” a lot more “out in front” on the issue.  Do you guys
believe the President has elevated this issue enough, given the
seriousness that you frame it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would suggest that — that isn’t a — that is a fight — that
those words are a fight against the wrong opponent.  The President is
passionate about this issue.  He has been passionate through the course
of his time in public office.  You know, again, securing a 25-year
extension of the Voting Rights Act — when, I would note, Strom Thurmond
chaired the committee.  So that was quite a time to live through.   
   
And he’s absolutely revolted by the wave of anti-voter laws based on the
same repeatedly disproven lies that led to our assault — an assault on
our nation’s Capitol, as I know the congressman and many others are as
well.  We share their passion.  We share the desire to fight these
efforts.  We share the desire to fight against efforts by many
Republicans to suppress the vote around the country.  It doesn’t mean
that that fight will always be easy, but he is going to stand by them in
this effort.   
   
And I would note that it’s not that he has — you know, it is not just
about private phone calls — he’s certainly done a number of those — and
private meetings — as he did with Senator Manchin yesterday to convey to
him the importance to him, personally, of moving this to a debate on the
floor about this important piece of legislation.  The President has also
— gave a speech in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he gave a passionate — made a
passionate case for the importance of voting rights.   
   
He also has taken action, including empowering a number of nominees at
the apart- — at the Department of Justice who have been leading
advocates for voting rights, pushing for their confirmation to get
through.   
   
The Department of Justice also just announced a few weeks ago that they
are doubling their support and their financial support for enforcement
of important voting laws around the country.   
   
And he signed a historic executive action, just several weeks ago, that
puts in place a number of protections to ensure that people have the
ability to vote.  I would say that’s hardly being silent.  That’s hardly
sitting on the backbench.  And we are — he will be standing with
advocates in this fight for the foreseeable future.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  This White House is very good at setting ambitious
but achievable goals.  Did the White House believe that 70 percent was
achievable when you set it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, there’s no record — there’s no
playbook for this.  There’s no record to look back and say, “These were
the — these were the goals that were achieved 5 years ago or 10 years
ago,” because we’re dealing with a historic pandemic.  And the
President’s view is that we should set bold, ambitious goals and do
everything we pas- — possibly can to achieve them.   
   
And in our view, we have — part of our objective was to return the
country to normal, for people to enjoy backyard barbecues, which people
across the country — millions of people will be.  And we’ll have 1,000
people on the South Lawn here at the White House — frontline workers,
men and women who are serving — also enjoying life back to normal.   
   
But we also are honest about where we need to continue to redouble our
efforts.  And that’s among people who are 18 to 26.  That is a small —
relatively small demographic of the country, but one where there needs
to be continued work.  And we’re going to use every tool at our disposal
to push for that.  
   
Q    So what is the game plan for getting young people vaccinated in
greater numbers?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me give you a couple of examples of what we’re working
on.  It’s not just Dr. Fauci on TikTok, though that is happening. 
(Laughter.)  So, Dr. Fauci has done several Q&As with TikTok and
Instagram influencers to answer questions, to meet people where they
are, including young people, give them information they need.   
   
CDC’s COVID Vaccine Chat on WhatsApp is now live to help
Spanish-speaking young adults get vaccinated.   
   
We’re working with the private sector as well.  As you all know,
Microsoft is giving away Xboxes at Boys & Girls Clubs.  The College
Challenge is rallying university students across the country.  Walgreens
is giving out $25 to anyone who gets vaccinated there before July
4th.   
   
These are just a couple of examples of some of the approaches we’re
taking.  We’ll build on that from there.  What we’ve all — what we’ll
also note is that we’re seeing the same challenges that we’ve seen in
other groups, which is that access and making it as easy as possible is
the name of the game.   
   
And so, continuing to re- — to support our pharmacy program, to support
our mobile vaccination units, to make this — the vaccine as accessible
to young people.  They lead busy lives; we want this to be just a — just
a box they can check on their weekend to-do list.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Following up on Phil’s question.  You very ably went through the
President’s history on voting rights and related issues, and you’ve laid
out all the times he’s spoken about it. But this lectern is available to
him today.  We have not heard him talk about it.  He has the biggest
megaphone in the world.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Aside from the Tulsa speech, just a few weeks ago?  
   
Q    No, I’m talking about when the vote is happening — using the
President’s time.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    And so, clearly, the President is choosing not to do that now. 
Why?  Where is the President on this issue on a day when they’re
voting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say, first, that the President has spoke — spoken
passionately about his commitment to expanding access to voting rights a
number of times, and you will hear him speak about this again.   
   
You certainly will hear us.  We’ll put out a statement from him at the
conclusion of the vote today.  And I expect you’ll hear from — more from
him in the coming days as well.  
   
Q    On another subject, with COVID: Former FDA Commissioner Scott
Gottlieb is among the voices saying he’s concerned that children who are
not yet eligible to be vaccinated could be drivers of the variant,
especially with school coming back and camps and all of that.  What
specifically does the administration feel needs to be done to address
that issue for those not yet even eligible to be vaccinated?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  Well, as a parent of a couple kids myself who are not
yet eligible to be vaccinated, I think the challenge is we need to be
vigilant and abide by the CDC guidelines.  That’s not always easy to do,
and we know that.  And that means, you know, being mindful of social
distancing, being mindful of where mask wearing should be essential to
keep your kids protected and keep other kids protected.   
   
Certainly, we can’t expedite the work of the FDA.  They’re the gold
standard in science, and we want them to abide by whatever timeline
works for them.  But it does mean — which again, is challenging —
abiding by the guidelines for children and those who are not yet
eligible until we get to that point.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You said, yesterday, the President feels a lot — a
great deal of the crime we’re seeing is a result of gun violence, but
the stats show it’s not just gun crimes.  So why does the President
think there’s been a 30 percent increase in car thefts in D.C., 47
percent increase in robbery in New York City, or a 98 percent increase
in rapes in Atlanta?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I think, if you look at a number of cities
across the country, it is actually driven by gun violence.  
   
Take St. Louis: In 2021, 96 percent of homicides where the instrument is
known were committed using a firearm.  In New York City, from March 2020
to March 2021, shooting incidents have jumped 77 percent.  The city
recorded more than 1,500 shootings in 2020; 97 percent more than 777 in
2019.  There are major cities across the country where gun violence is
absolutely the driver, where it is absolutely increasing.  And that will
be a central part of what he’ll talk about when he delivers his remarks
tomorrow.  
   
Q    And given everything that is going on — with guns, without guns —
does the President still think that this is the best time to end cash
bail?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think I have a — any new position on that for you,
but I’m happy to check and see if there’s anything more to report.  
   
Q    So his stated position from his website, which is, basically, end
cash bail — he wants to lead a national effort to end cash bail and
reform the pretrial system.  That stands?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have a new position for you, but I’m happy to check
for you.  
   
Q    And so, for people who are watching who might be worried about a
rise in crime, what does the President think is a deterrent to
committing a crime if there’s no cash bail in place?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me give you just a sense to the degree I can,
because we’re still finalizing the specifics.  
   
There’s been, one, an increase in violent crime over the last 18 months;
it’s not just over the last few months.  And actually, if you look
statistically back, it’s more over the last five years or so.   
   
So there’s an initial set of actions the President has announced to date
to address gun violence.  Back in April, strengthening regulations on
ghost guns; stabilizing braces that make firearms more legal \[sic\] —
lethal; investing money in community violence intervention programs — an
investment that he thinks can be quite effective.  He’s talked about,
for decades — and I think you’ll hear him talk about more tomorrow —
supporting additional funding for community policing through his budget
request, and helping state and local governments keep co- — cops on the
beat.  
   
So, yes, we believe that a central driver of violence is gun violence
and is the use of guns.  We’re seeing that statistically in a lot of
areas.  But he also believes that we need to ensure that state and local
governments keep cops on the beat, that we’re supporting community
policing, and that’s a key part of it as well.  
   
Q    And just the last one.  You just said, again, you guys want to
“keep cops on the beat,” but there are reports that big cities are
having a very difficult time recruiting officers right now.  And there
are many other reports that morale is at an all-time low in big police
departments.  So why does the President think that there’s low morale
with police officers on the beat?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think we’re the right entity to give an assessment
of that.  I’d certainly look to the police departments to give that
assessment.   
   
But what I would say to you is that the President has never supported
defunding the police.  He’s always supported community policing
programs.  He’s supported giving funding to — to states and localities
around the country, including through his American Rescue Plan, because
he thinks there is an essential role to play for community policing.  
   
Go ahead, Andrea.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I want to ask you about infrastructure.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    So, there was the meeting earlier today.  Can you give us a little
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s still going on.  
   
Q    It’s still going on.  So —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As far as I know.  When I came out here, yes.  
   
Q    And are you hopeful that you’ll be able to invite those senators to
the White House for a meeting with the President?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will see.  As we do every day in democracy in action
happening here, we assess what the right next step is.  
   
And as I noted yesterday, the President is encouraged by the ongoing
talks and discussions that are continuing with Democrats and
Republicans.  We’ve sent some — he’s asked some members of his senior
team — as you noted, Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell — to go up to
Capitol Hill and meet with a group of bipartisan senators.  And once
they conclude that meeting, I expect we’ll assess what the next steps
are.  
   
Q    You’re getting a lot of criticism already about the paring down of
the very ambitious infrastructure proposals.  Things that are falling
away are things that you’ve said are top priorities, whether it’s
climate, the care economy.  I mean, how do you — how do you anticipate
dealing with and solving those priorities, spending issues, if you get
to a compromise now that is, in fact, a slimmed down version of what you
initially planned?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s a budget reconciliation process that’s just getting
underway, which we expect to be a vehicle to move a number of the
President’s bold ideas forward.  
   
Q    Can I ask you a question about Amazon as well?  So the FTC is going
to look at the Amazon-MGM merger.  There’s growing criticism about the
antitrust legislation that’s being put forth on the Hill.   
   
Are you — what is your perspective about whether there is, sort of,
fundamental reform needed to ensure that large companies don’t get too
big?  Do you see this as, sort of, an inflection point?   
   
We’ve seen companies, including Amazon, really profit enormously from
the pandemic and during the pandemic, and there have been warnings even
from international financial institutions.  So do you see that there’s
something sort of fundamental needed now to check the growth?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question.  I don’t think I’m going to be in a
position to speak to it from here.  There are legal components of this. 
I can see if there’s more we can — we can give back to you on that.  
   
Q    Just on the Amazon FTC review: Do you — can you just confirm any
details of that review?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just not going be able to confirm or speak to that
specifically from here.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    The President’s remarks tomorrow, just to follow up on policing and
crime —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — will that detail any efforts on police reform?  Or is that kind
of unilaterally focused on crime prevention?  And why or why not?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, there’s ongoing negotiations, as you know, on
police reform.  And the President would love to have a bill on his desk
that he could sign into law.   
   
We’ve seen progress being made, we’ve heard progress being made, and
those discussions are ongoing.  So I would expect that his — his remarks
tomorrow will build on — will build on a number of the announcements
that have already touched on that he’s made in the recent months, making
guns — putting in place safety measures to make our streets safer,
preventing the use of guns in violent crime across the country, ensuring
that we can have more cops on the beat to protect communities.   
   
He, obviously, is a big advocate for the benefit of community policing
so we’ll build on that foundation and lay out a comprehensive strategy
to address violent crime and gun violence as the — as we enter the
summer months.  
   
Q    Some advocates — criminal justice advocates have raised concern
that potentially having the President raise alarm about, you know, a
trend of rising crime — this crime uptick in American cities — could
actually undercut efforts on police reform, especially since legislation
is still being discussed, you know, in Congress.  So is that a concern
for the White House at all?   
   
The White House has said that, you know, the administration wants to
give members of Congress space to negotiate police reform, but that
potentially raising alarm of this crime uptick could hurt those
efforts.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say that the negotiations are happening between
Senator Booker, Senator Scott, key — Congressman Bass.  I don’t think
they’ve expressed that particular concern.  If there’s a named person
who is expressing this concern, I’m happy to speak to that.  But there’s
— those negotiations are ongoing.  We keep them abreast of our work.  
   
And again, I think, in communities across the country who advocate and
support police reform, they don’t see it as a mutually exclusive issue;
neither does the President.  We need — police reform is long outdated. 
But it’s also important to take steps to — to put in place gun safety
measures, to take any — use at any lever he can as President to do
exactly that, and to ensure there is appropriate funding and resources
needed to ensure there’s community policing in communities across the
country.  
   
Q    Just one more on FEMA — the FEMA meeting.  Given that meeting
happened today, FEMA is still involved in setting up shelters at the
border.  Since we’re going into hurricane season, as you said, is there
a deadline on when FEMA will be pulled out of that process of assisting
at the border?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to assess for FEMA.  Obviously,
they’ll make that assessment in coordination with the leadership at the
Department of Homeland Security, but I don’t have anything to preview on
the timeline for that.  They’ve been a key resource.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Going back to the 70 percent goal, the CDC data says
that there are 13 states that are falling way short of that 70 percent;
they’re less than 55 percent.  Four states are below 50 percent.  Should
those states get more of a focus right now and not the nationwide
number, as the administration plans their strategy to get vaccinations
up?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we — we’re not not focusing on those states.  I would
say that, one, it’s important to note that when we give the statistics —
including 87 percent of all seniors, 75 percent of people age 40 and
over, 70 percent of those age 30 and over — they’re from red states and
blue states and purple states, or whatever color the state may be.  
   
Our focus, from the beginning, has been continuing to redouble our
efforts among demographics and groups where we need extra assistance. 
That’s why we have taken steps to put in place 24-hour pharmacies,
walk-up sites, mobile clinics, free rides.  We have vaccines at barber
shops, baseball games, NASCAR races.  Even over the last “Month of
Action,” which we’ve been doing across the country, we’ve had 15,000
events.  We’ve attempted 1.4 million contacts or reached about 500,000
people.  And there are thousands of volunteers in 50 states across the
country.  
   
Ultimately, it’s going to be up to individuals to decide if they want to
get vaccinated.   
   
Q    Is there something more, though?  You went through all of those
incentives, and specifically tying those to that age group — that
younger age group.  But if there’s something that’s regional about this
— if it’s Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Wyoming that are those
states below 50 percent, is there something that the administration can
do to get those numbers up?  Or at this point, is this governors and
states that should be doing this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s always been a partnership, and it will continue to be a
partnership moving forward.  And it’s also up to individuals to make the
decision to get vaccinated.  And what we can do from the federal
government, of course, is to make it as accessible as possible; make
sure we have the supply — we’ve done that long ago; make sure there are
thousands and thousands of sites, vaccinators, opportunities for people
to get vaccinated; incentivize it across the country.  That’s exactly
what we’ve done.  
   
I will note: We’re not going to stop implementing these programs on July
5th.  We will continue to implement them as we work to get more people
in the country vaccinated.  
   
Go ahead, April.  
   
Q    Jen, I want to hit two topics: voting rights, as well as crime.  
   
You keep bringing up former President George W. Bush, in 2006, when he
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I do?  I keep bringing him up?  
   
Q    Well, you bought him up — you brought the extension up.  You
brought the extension up of voting rights, and —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What — I think that happened long before (inaudible).  
   
Q    Right, but you brought it up as to — it was extended for 25
years.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, okay.  I didn’t bring up George W. Bush, but, go ahead,
you can bring him up.  
   
Q    Yes, I’m bringing him up.  
   
As someone who was here when he did it —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — he was a Republican who did it.  And that’s one of his pieces
that he likes to tout when he talks about efforts in the Black
community.  What’s different with Republicans then and Republicans now
when it comes to voting rights?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What’s different?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, April, what — what should raise some
questions for Americans across the country is: Why would anyone want to
make it more difficult to vote?  Why wouldn’t we want to make it more
accessible?  What are they so afraid of?  And maybe they’re more afraid
now of what it would mean to have more people voting across the country
than they were back then.  I don’t know.  You’ll have to ask them that
question.   
   
Q    And, secondly, on crime: What’s different now as you’re trying to
push this effort on community policing, as well as guns?  What’s
different now?  What do you think will have the teeth to change the tide
that hasn’t been changed before?  In the coming years (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Different now — do you mean different from a different
period of time —  
   
Q    Yes.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  — or different from —  
   
Q    I mean, you know, community policing was in place during the
Clinton years; it was taken away.  There was conversation about it in
many years prior.  And now, you’re bringing it back again.  So you’re
bringing the issue back again.  What teeth do you believe that will
have?  And do you believe that that could become a reality again?   
   
I mean, I understand different police departments can do what they
want.  But you’re trying to make an overall sweeping push for police
departments across the nation to make this difference.  What’s different
now that will make this tide change?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say one difference now is that it’s become a
politically charged issue, when it wasn’t historically.  And if you look
back, Community Oriented Policing Services, you know, historically had
been supported by liberal Democrats; Democrats; civil rights groups,
including the NAACP, and — over the course of time.  And that has always
been the case.   
   
I would say we’re not suggesting — the President isn’t suggesting it’s
the silver bullet.  A central part of his remarks and his — his
announcement tomorrow will be about addressing gun violence, which he
thinks is a significant driver in violence in our communities and cities
across the country.   
   
And, as you know, April, there are laws that were in place: the Assault
Weapons Ban, others that are no longer in place.  There are also
additional guns — ghost guns and others that were not a reality just a
few years ago.   
   
So, there are some laws he’d like to go back to and some that he’ll
continue to work to update.   
   
Q    But, again, what’s different now?  I mean, you’ve got the powerful
NRA.  You’ve got Republicans who — anytime you touch anything about
guns, they feel like you’re taking their rights away.  What’s different
now?  Where do you think the tide will turn on this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Are you asking me about, like, the politics of now or the
—  
   
Q    The politics and, you know, this moment in time.  Why do you
believe that you have a chance to make a dent when you didn’t — when
Democrats didn’t have to do — have it before?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would just say here’s how the President sees this:
There’s been rising crime in cities for the last 18 months, if not
before that.  Yes, there needs to be reforms of police systems across
the country; the President is a firm believer in that.   
   
But there are also steps he can take, as President of the United States,
to help address and hopefully reduce that crime.  A big part of that, in
his view, is putting in place gun safety measures, using — even as
Congress is not moving forward currently — using the bully pulpit, but
also using levers at his disposal as President.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    I guess I’ll take another shot — stab at that, to use a phrase. 
Sorry.  (Laughter.)  What’s different for Joe Biden?  Thirty years ago,
he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote a crime bill,
addressed this issue.  What has he learned since then?  And what can we
look, tomorrow, that might be the same or different?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  Well, I would say, first, on the campaign: The
President said that some parts of the bill worked and some areas did not
work.  There are also steps he took as senator when he introduced or
supported legislation, I should say, to address the disparities in gun
senten- — in drug sentencing laws.  So he’s taken some specific actions
over time in areas where he don’t —  doesn’t think worked as well.   
   
There are some components of that legislation he supported at the time,
including the 10-year ban on assault weapons; including the support for
— for the Violence Against Women Act; and including the support for
community policing programs that he has been a longtime advocate for. 
And I think you will see continuity in terms of his support for those
initiatives moving forward.   
   
Q    You said that he aims to build on the announcements he’s made.  Is
there anything we can expect to hear tomorrow that we haven’t heard
before?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Stay tuned.  I can’t tell you everything, otherwise you
won’t come tomorrow.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On the President’s meeting with the chairman of the
Federal Reserve yesterday: Did the President bring up interest rates or
express his view on the direction of interest rates at all?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As you well know, that is the purview of the Federal
Reserve.  They’ve put out their own projections, as you know, about what
it looks like moving forward.  The topic and the focus of the meeting
was exactly as it was outlined in our —  
   
Q    So he did not bring up interest rates at all?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I just have no more to read out for you.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then, on the infrastructure negotiations, do you know —
has White House put anything new on the table as far as payfors?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say we’ve put a lot of different options on payfors
on the table.  And our view is there’s a fundamental question right now:
Are — are Dem- — are Republicans, members of Congress, do they believe
that rich people should have to pay the taxes they owe?  Or should we
increase the cost of travelers who are just trying to make it to
work?   
   
That’s the basic question here.  So we’ll see if they can make progress
on that exact point.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Can you say who the stakeholders will — who will be at the White
House tomorrow for this crime meeting?  Can you say who’s coming?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The announcement tomorrow?  Sure.  I don’t have it in front
of me, but we can venture to get it to you after the briefing.  Sure.   
   
Q    Okay.  Great.  And this is sort of a pullback question, but why now
exactly?  Is it just because crime rates are up and the stats are out? 
Or why is this the week, of all the weeks, that the President has
decided to focus on crime?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  First, I would say that he’s made a number of announcements
over the past several months on gun violence, on putting in place gun
safety measures.  He’s made — announced in his budget his support for
community policing and providing funding.  Maybe we haven’t drawn that
clear through-line for all of you, but this is a continuation of that,
in his view.  
   
Q    Labeling it a speech about crime is certainly different than a
speech about gun safety or it — this is — this is a different focus.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A central part of it will be on gun violence.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    I’m just going to continue this —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — crime spree, if you will.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A lot of analogies here that might be threatening.   
   
Q    My colleague, Zolan, had brought up that there are activists who
are very concerned that the President’s decision to highlight crime
right now could undercut some of the negotiations on the Hill for police
reform.  You’d asked for the names of some of them.  The Tampa Dream
Defenders is one, the Justice Action Network is another — just so we,
sort of, have that covered.   
   
But can you address how the President is going to sort of walk that line
between expressing his concern about crime without undercutting these
efforts that, as you point out, have been under- — you know, have been
underway for a while.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, what I was trying to get at — but thanks for
bringing up the question again — is that there are negotiators that are
continuing to make progress on the Hill.  And the President supports and
stands by a lot of these groups in their support and advocacy for
long-overdue police reform.  He believes that, supports it, wants to
sign a bill into law.  
   
He does not feel that they are conflicting.  And I don’t think you’ve
heard from any of the negotiators on the Hill that they feel they are
conflicting either.  So that was the point I was trying to make.   
   
And communities across the country where they are seeing — if you’re
living in St. Louis and 96 percent of homicides were done where — we
know the instrument — were done using a firearm, you do want to hear
more about what the President of the United States is going to do to
address that.  If you’re living in New York City, you do want to hear
more.   
   
And nationwide, you know, Everytown put out some information that there
were 30 — more — 30 — 3,900 additional firearm deaths and 9,278
additional firearm injuries in 2020 compared to 2019.  That’s impacting
people’s lives, people’s communities, people’s families, people’s
neighbors.  Of course they want to hear more, and he wants to share more
with the American public about what he’s going to do about it.   
   
Q    And then just on COVID: Just given that, you know, the country did
not reach this goal of 70 percent of adults being — getting one shot, is
there anything that the country cannot do?  Is there any sort of — I
mean, that was always the, sort of, benchmark for getting back to
normalcy.  And since we didn’t get there, are there things that the
country cannot do because we haven’t actually achieved the goal that we
were supposed to?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say it’s a goal we, here, set in the
White House.  I’m —  
   
Q    Is there anything you’d recommend the country not do, given that
the goal was not reached?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, this was always going to be community to community,
right?  When the President set this goal back in March, it was always
meant to be a incentive and a driver for people to see what the benefit
would be of getting vaccinated.  And at the time, what the President
said is, “If you are vaccinated, your neighbors are vaccinated, you can
all have a backyard barbecue.”  We’re doing that times about 100 by
hosting 1,000 people here at the White House.   
   
Now, if you’re in a community where you’re at 80 percent vaccination
rate, my bet is the community is pretty closely back to normal.   
   
If you’re not in a com- — if you’re a community with a much lower
vaccination rate, obviously, you’re going to make your own choices, but
you’re not operating in a community where it should be back to
normal.   
   
So, it’s always going — was always going to be local, was always going
to be based on what the decisions are made, community to community — but
not nationwide, no.  It’s really dependent on where you’re living.   
   
Q    So, because the President is in Washington, D.C., and they have got
— we have got — Washington, D.C., has gone beyond their 70 percent goal,
it’s okay to do (inaudible).  It’s okay to have 1,000 people in
Washington, D.C., at an event because Washington, D.C., has surpassed
the 70 percent, but somewhere where it’s a 50 percent vaccination rate
perhaps —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Communities are going to make their own decision.  There’s
nothing ever magical through science about 70 percent.  70 percent was a
bold, ambitious goal we set to continue to drive to get more people
vaccinated across the country.  But it’s not as if, if you’re 67 percent
in a community, you’re at a different level of safety than 71 percent.  
   
Communities are going to make their own decisions.  And I think, at — a
fundamental fact is that if you’re vaccinated, if your neighbors are
vaccinated, then you’re safe.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  One quick —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, I’m sorry.  I’m going to — I’m going to (inaudible)
here.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Chris.   
   
Q    Oh, thanks.  Can you respond to — at least a couple Republican
senators and one today said that — want to have talked about signing on
to this bipartisan talks right now on the Jobs Plan, that that would
essentially stop momentum or stop you guys from being able to do
reconciliation.  Can you respond to that idea that they’re basically
cooperating so that you can’t do the second half of your plan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think that’s how the process works,
fundamentally.   
   
Q    So it will not stop the White House from enacting and Democrats
from —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, if you just — if we just go to our episode of “How a
Bill Becomes a Law,” there’s a budget reconciliation process led by the
budget chairman; it’s proceeding.  It needs a certain number of votes. 
That’s different from the number of votes that are needed for other
pieces of legislation.   
   
That piece of legislat- — the budget reconciliation process is
proceeding.  There’ll be discussions.  There may even be disagreements
among people within the Democratic Party about what should be included
in there or not.  There needs to be 50 votes to move that forward.  But
that process is continuing and proceeding.  
   
Q    But stopping the momentum for it, as well as taking the amount of
time that these talks are taking that it — realistically, that it could
gum up the works to get this —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  How would it gum up the works?  
   
Q    I mean, this is their — this is their plan, their hope of a
strategy.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sounds like they have some more explaining to do about what
they mean.  Or maybe they need to go to “How a Bill Becomes a Law,” “How
Reconciliation Works.”   
   
Q    I’ll suggest that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Senator Sanders could — he could come to the Republican
caucus and teach them.  I’ll offer him.  
   
Q    One on foreign affairs, please?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sorry, we have to wrap it up because I think the
President is about to speak.  But thanks so much everyone.  Sorry it was
a little short today.
