MODERATOR:  Good evening, everyone.  Thank you so much for joining us
for this background briefing.  This call is on background, attributable
to “senior administration officials,” and embargoed until the conclusion
of the call.  We’ll, of course, have time for Q&A at the end.

Not for reporting or attribution, but just for your knowledge, on
today’s call we have joining us \[senior administration official\].  And
with that, I’m going to pass it off to our speaker.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, everybody, for joining. 
I thought I’d just give you an update on what we observed over the last
couple of days and heading into the last day tomorrow, after which we’ll
release the communiqué. 

And what is really striking to me is the amount of convergence we’ve
seen, both — that’s true both in terms of the direction of convergence
and also the speed with which it’s happening.

Now, I had a chance to look back, and, three years ago, if you look back
to the communiqué in 2018, China wasn’t even explicitly mentioned, even
though you could find whole paragraphs devoted to countries like North
Korea, Russia.  Back then, they couldn’t reach consensus on anything as
it related to China.

And, you know, this year, what is — what is striking is the very strong
and shared foundation for a joint approach.  And I don’t want to get
ahead of specifics in the communiqué, but I can give you at least some
of the areas of convergence, because I think they’re all profound and
really important to highlight.  
   
So I’ll give you a few examples: First, working together to respond to
China’s non-market economic practices that are harmful and distorted to
the global economy.  Being willing to speak out on human rights abuses,
including in Xinjiang.  And more than just speaking out, taking action,
responding to forced labor in supply chains, again, including from
Xinjiang.  
   
You know, this is something we talked about yesterday — some of us at
least — (inaudible) infrastructure initiative that is high standards,
values-driven, transparent, and multilateral.  And, you know, today, in
fact, there was quite a bit of discussion about coordination on supply
chain resilience and coming up with technology standards that are suited
for the 21st century so that, as democracies, we’re aligned and we’re
supporting each other.  
   
So, you know, I could go on, actually.  But if that’s not a common
approach, I don’t — I don’t know what is.  And it’s just a huge move
forward in three years, and, you know, I’m quite encouraged by what we
heard.  
   
So let me just stop there and see if there are questions.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  So, now, everyone, if you’ve got a question, please
use the “raise hand” function on the Zoom interface, and we’ll try to
take some questions.  
   
Let’s start with Anne Gearan from The Washington Post.  
   
Q    Thank you very much for doing this.  This is, kind of, logistics,
but can you let us know when you think we will see the communiqué and in
what form?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, Anne.  Sure.  I can at least give
you a ballpark sense.  So there are a couple of sessions planned for
tomorrow for the leaders in the communiqué, but (inaudible).  So I would
say sometime around (inaudible).  
   
Q    Sorry, you broke up.  Sometime around what time?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  (Inaudible) digital technology is a
little bit choppy.  I said sometime around midday would be my
expectation.  (Inaudible.)  
   
Q    Okay.  We’re actually probably going to be on a bus or a plane.  So
we’re, like — (laughs) — and (inaudible) it looks like there’s going to
be news in it, so we’re trying to figure out how best to do that.  And,
you know, anything you guys can do to make sure that we have it in real
time would be a huge help.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well taken.  And will do.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Next we will go to Josh Wingrove at Bloomberg.  
   
Q    Hi there.  This morning there was a dis- — or the indications were,
earlier today, that there was sort of a discussion between some people
who wanted China more explicitly named, including President Biden, and
others who were less keen on that, including Chancellor Merkel. Can you
give me an update on that?  And can you specify: Is — is the word
“China” going to be in the communiqué?  Because that, too, was uncertain
as of a day ago.  Thank you.    
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I would say there was unanimity in
terms of a willingness to call out human rights abuses and violations of
fundamental freedoms that invoke our shared values.   
   
You know, so this was — there has been, yesterday, and there certainly
was today, a tremendous (inaudible) this together, and what forges the
G7 partnership.  And that’s very much about our shared (inaudible).   
   
And so, there was a willingness to speak out — not just a willingness; I
think there was unanimity in terms of our (inaudible) to speak out and
(inaudible) and to be specific (inaudible), and (inaudible) and with a
commitment to take action in response to what we’re seeing.  And, you
know, again, that was — that was a — that’s a dramatic change from where
we were only three years ago.   
   
Q    And I’m sorry — we’re perhaps near our Zoom — the end of our Zoom
era, but you did cut out a few times there.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, I’m sorry, Josh.  I don’t know — I
don’t know when I cut out.   
   
Q    Perhaps I would just suggest: If there was a point you felt
particularly strongly about, if it came in the middle, we might not have
heard it in full.  So, if you wanted to sum up —  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay, I’ll just summarize.   
   
Okay, Josh, is this better now?  Can you hear me?  
   
Q    Yes.  Yes, sir.  I can.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  I’ll give it another shot.  
   
So, what I was saying was that, again, I heard from everyone that what
binds us together as a G7 partnership, more than anything else, are the
shared values of democracies.  And that, because of that partnership,
you know, it’s our obligation to call out human rights abuses and other
— other violations of fundamental freedoms that calls us into — that
really invoke our shared values.  
   
And more than just — more than just calling out those abuses, which are
— that’s important — there was a (inaudible) to take action.  And
(inaudible).  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks so much.  Next, let’s go to Steve Holland with
Reuters.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Just to be specific about what’s going to be in the
communiqué: You’re saying it’s going to cite — it’s going to criticize
China’s non-market policies and China’s human rights treatment in
Xinjiang.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don’t want to get ahead of what — I
can’t get ahead of what’s in the communiqué because it hasn’t
(inaudible) and leaders have to sign off.  But I’m just trying to
reflect the conversation.   
   
And, you know, I think you mentioned the word “criticize.”  And
certainly there’s a strong convergence in terms of a willingness to call
out human rights abuses.  But I would say, with respect to non-market
economic practices, my reference there was to work together
collaboratively within the G7 to find ways to confront those practices
and to offer a better choice and affirmative path.   
   
And there was a lot of discussion about what that could mean in terms of
(inaudible); in terms of cooperation on technology standards; in terms
of things we can work together to bolster our supply chain resilience,
ways we could come (inaudible) — ways we could come (inaudible) to
provide support to low-income countries with the resources (inaudible)
and through the (inaudible) that we’ve built.   
   
There’s a long list of items that were discussed, (inaudible) a positive
agenda, while also being clear about what we don’t tolerate.  And all of
those actions and that agenda, again, flow from shared values that
everyone — everyone — held up as the reason (inaudible).  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks so much.  Next, let’s go to Franco Ordoñez with
NPR.  
   
Q    Thanks for doing this.  I wanted to just kind of follow up on
that.  It sounds like, from the conversations, the — that the leaders
are ready to be more specific about addressing these human rights
(inaudible).   
   
But you also mentioned being committed to taking action.  I wanted to
ask: Will that be — do you anticipate that will be outlined in the
communiqué, not only calling out the human rights, but outlining some of
the steps to take action?  And if it doesn’t outline some of those
steps, do you feel like that would be falling short in any way?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, I don’t, again, (inaudible)
communiqué, but (inaudible) communiqué (inaudible) —   
   
MODERATOR:  You’re coming out a little garbled.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There’s a commitment here about how our
(inaudible) in terms of our actions, and that’s both being (inaudible)
and also what we’re for.  So you’ll see strong elements of both
tomorrow.  I can’t get into specifics again, Franco, just because, you
know, the doc is not final.  
   
If you want to go back — you already have heard about (inaudible)
important (inaudible) actions we’ve taken together.  The pandemic
response means our contributions — the unprecedented amount that the G7
has agreed to provide without conditions, without any strings attached,
both for this (inaudible).   
   
And (inaudible) to deal with (inaudible).  Because that’s the spirit in
which the discussion have taken place (inaudible) — why our model is
still the single best way to deliver for our people, but also to meet
the biggest challenges and (inaudible), supply chain resilience,
(inaudible) competition.  And, yes, (inaudible).  
   
MODERATOR:  Much of that answer was very unclear and garbled.  I don’t
know if you want to try again, but that came across as about 80 percent
choppy.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, boy.  Okay.  So, Franco, can you
hear me any better?   
   
MODERATOR:  Yes, that was a little clearer.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay, well, I mean, I started off by
saying I don’t want to get ahead of any specifics in the communiqué. 
You are going to see a very clear commitment on a number of fronts in
which — (phone line drops).  
   
MODERATOR:  Our speaker just dropped.  Give us one second while we try
to get him back on.   
   
\[Senior administration official\], are you there?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, it’s \[senior administration
official\].   
   
MODERATOR:  Hey there.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey.  I know \[senior administration
official\] is experiencing some tech issues.  So why don’t I just close
this out with a little bit of —  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That’s perfect.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  — again, sort of — yeah.  I’ll close it
out with an overview of how we’re seeing today.   
   
And as \[senior administration official\] said at the top of the call, I
mean, the — not just today, but the G7 writ large, we’ve seen — you
know, we’ve seen and felt and been encouraged by a growing convergence. 
And you look at where the G7 was three years ago — with China not even
explicitly mentioned, though entire paragraphs were devoted to North
Korea and Russia — I think it just underlines that the — where the G7
has come from there, and the fact that we have a strong, common
foundation on our approach to issues that matter.   
   
And, you know, as \[senior administration official\] said, in terms of
where we are right now, we’ve reached consensus on a number of points
that are reflective of that shared approach.   
   
We’re working together to respond to non-market economic practices that
are objectionable in a global economy; speaking out on human rights
abuses; responding to forced labor in supply chains; pursuing an
affirmative infrastructure initiative that’s high standards and
transparent; and coordinating on supply chain resilience and technology
standards so that democracies are aligned and supporting each other.   
   
And so, you know, as we close out the day, that’s what we’re seeing and
that’s where we are.  I appreciate folks bearing through some of the
audio difficulties.  And we’ll be back with one of these very soon.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks so much for joining us again, everyone.  Again, this
call is on background, attributable to “senior administration
officials,” and embargoed until the call concludes, which will be
momentarily.  Thank you so much again.
