11:27 A.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  Good morning.  Welcome to our trip to
La Crosse, Wisconsin.   
   
President Biden is traveling today to make the case directly to the
American people that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework is a major
step forward for our country and the largest infrastructure investment
in nearly a century.  It will grow our economy, create good-paying jobs,
and position America to compete with the world and win the 21st
century.  
   
A couple of Wisconsin specifics: Nearly half of — nearly half of
Milwaukee’s 160,000 water service lines are made of lead, and the plan’s
investments in water infrastructure will replace them all.  
   
The infrastructure deal will also, as you know, help make broadband
access a reality for people across the country.   
   
There’s 82,000 Wisconsin children who didn’t have access to reliable
Internet in the midst of a year of remote schooling.  This will help
change that.   
   
It will also help address the bridges and roads, of course, across
Wisconsin that need rebuilding as a core part of the Infrastructure
Framework.   
   
The place we’re going today — the place where the President will deliver
his remarks — is the La Crosse Municipal Transit Utility, which was
rewarded — awarded a federal grant in 2018 to purchase two electric
buses, charging stations, and related infrastructure.  This is part of a
broader strategy of the City of La Crosse to achieve a goal of 100
percent renewable energy by 2050.  
   
Oh, and just a little full-circle note for all of you: The buses are
being manufactured by Proterra, whose Greenville, South Carolina,
facility the President visited back in April.   
   
I also wanted to note that, yesterday, the House took an important step
in advancing the vision the President laid out with the American Jobs
Plan for growing the economy for all workers by advancing two bipartisan
bills: the National Science Foundation for the Future Act and the
Department of Energy Science for the Future Act.  
   
He was pleased to see the Senate pass crucially important investments in
our domestic strength through the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act
with massive bipartisan support, and he’s heartened to see the House
pass bipartisan investments in science and R&D.  
   
Another update on our doses going overseas: We are proud to announce
that 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine will begin to ship to
Bangladesh today.  And we expect we may have more announcements today,
as well, for additional shipments.  
   
You may have also seen our announcement — short announcement — that the
President and the First Lady will be traveling to Surfside, Florida. 
Let me give you a little bit more detail about what they’re planning to
do there.  They want to thank the heroic first responders,
search-and-rescue teams, and everyone who has been working tirelessly
around the clock, and meet with the families who have been forced to
endure this terrible tragedy — waiting in anguish and heartbreak for
word of their loved ones — to offer them comfort as search-and- rescue
efforts continue.  
   
And they want to make sure that state and local officials have the
resources and support they need under the emergency declaration approved
by the President for Miami-Dade, Florida.  
   
The visit is being, of course, closely coordinated with officials on the
ground to ensure it does not draw any critical local resources from the
ongoing search-and-rescue operations or have any negative operational
impact.   
   
And, obviously, I know you’re going to ask about meetings with local
officials; we don’t have any updates — any details on that quite yet. 
If any develop while we’re on our trip today, we’ll make sure those are
available to all of you.   
   
Okay.  
   
Q    Great.  Thanks, Jen.  Two-question subject areas.  First,
Afghanistan.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    The top general in Afghanistan said the escalating violence could
lead to a deadly civil war.  Does the administration have any concerns
about that possibility, given the withdrawals?  And what will it do to
minimize that possibility?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would note that the President met with the
leaders of Afghanistan just last Friday, and he reiterated our
commitment to working with them on not just humanitarian assistance, but
security assistance and our commitment to continue to have a presence on
the ground, which we vowed to do in the beginning, and we will — we
remain committed to do.  
   
I’ll also note that the decision that the President made to withdraw
troops from Afghanistan, it is consistent with his view over the last 20
years about the war.  But he also made that decision because it was made
clear, given the timeline set by the prior administration, that if we
did not withdraw our troops, U.S. men and women would be facing fire on
the ground.  And that was not something, as the Commander-in-Chief, that
he felt was acceptable, and hence we are on this timeline we’re on by
September.  
   
There has been assessments out there, as you know, by the intelligence
community and others.  I would refer to them on those assessments of the
situation on the ground.  
   
Q    And then, secondly, Tucker Carlson said that the NSA is spying on
him.  Is the administration aware of any espionage or listening efforts
on U.S. citizens by the NSA, and is Tucker Carlson one of them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the NSA, as I think you’re well aware — I’m not sure
everyone is aware — everyone on this plane is aware, I should say — is
an entity that focuses on foreign threats and individuals who are trying
— attempting to do us harm on foreign soil.  So, that is the — their
purview.  But beyond that, I would point you to the intelligence
community.  
   
Q    Jen, on infrastructure: So, Leader McConnell said he was satisfied
that the President has de-linked the reconciliation package and the
bipartisan agreement, but Speaker Pelosi said this morning that the
House isn’t going to vote on the bipartisan bill until the Senate passes
that reconciliation package.  So the question is: Is the White House
urging her to publicly de-link those two issues like the President did
over the weekend?

MS. PSAKI:  Our focus is on doing — the President’s focus is on doing
exactly what he’s doing today and what leaders in Congress asked him to
do, which is to go out to the public and make clear the benefits of this
package to the American people, whether it’s on roads and railways and
bridges, or components of the package that there’s less known about,
including making broadband available; making sure we’re doing
environmental remediation, something that would help lower-income
communities quite a bit; making public transit available.

That’s exactly what they expect him to do, what they want him to do, and
what the President is going to spend his time doing.  He looks forward
to and is eager to sign both bills into law, and he will leave it to
leaders in Congress to determine the order and the sequencing.

Q    So there’s no message coming from the White House to Speaker Pelosi
to publicly “de-link,” quote unquote, those two issues?

MS. PSAKI:  I think the President made clear that he is going to work
his heart out getting both bills across the finish line, and that’s what
he’s going to do, and work closely with leaders in Congress to get that
done.

Q    Jen, can you describe the ongoing outreach to progressives today?

MS. PSAKI:  Sure.

Q    You know, to what extent is the White House worried about the idea
that all the Democrats in the House won’t be a “yes” on the
reconciliation bill and the compromise (inaudible)?

MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me give you a rundown of some outreach.  It will
include progressives but other outreach as well. 

We have been — the White House was in touch with all Democratic chiefs
of staff in both chambers yesterday.  The White House also had calls
with over 60 Democratic and Republican members, chiefs of staff and
staff directors in both chambers.  This included calls with a diverse —
diverse range of ideologies ranging from members of the Congressional
Progressive Caucus to members of the Problem Solvers Caucus.   
We hosted a call today with all the Democratic — we are hosting a call
today, I should say — with all of the Democratic Senate communications
directors on the package.  And today, Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell,
and Shuwanza Goff will meet with a range of progressives to moderates
within the Democratic House Caucus, as well as Republicans.

In terms of progressive groups — which is a little beyond this but I
think of interest to all of you — senior White House staffers addressed
over 100 progressives groups through a call organized by Build Back
Together, focused on the historic progressive wins in the bipartisan
framework, including with respect to job creation; climate and clean
energy; removing all lead water pipes — something there isn’t a lot of
information out there on, which we’re trying to make sure people
understand the details of; and connecting all communities to broadband.

We also, separately, addressed 60 additional groups yesterday on a call
convened by a different outside organization.

Point being, we have every senior member of the White House working to
communicate directly with the public, with groups, with members of
Congress about the components of this package and our continued
commitment to also get the reconciliation package across the finish
line.

Q    What does that say about the fact that this Democratic White House
has to do that kind of outreach to members of its own party?  I mean, is
the President in any way disappointed by the fact that he has to engage
this way with fellow Democrats?

MS. PSAKI:  The President sees that as his job and, by association, all
of our jobs.  And part of what his objective is, at this point, is to
move beyond — and all of our objectives — move beyond the process. 
That’s an important component of it, but make sure we are clearly
articulating what the benefits are of these packages, why they can help
people, how they can help people in the country, and that’s something
we’re going to do in partnership with members around the country.

Q    Jen, Bernie Sanders was on NPR this morning talking about the fact
that this infrastructure bill doesn’t include, you know, enough for
climate.  I know you’ve said that there are climate provisions in there,
but, you know, what do you say to Bernie Sanders when he gets on, you
know, national radio and says that?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we say to Senator Sanders: You’re an important
partner, and we look forward to continuing to work with you to get this
and the reconciliation package across the finish line.

What we also have been conveying is this — the President sees this
bipartisan package on climate as a down payment.  It has a number of key
important priorities for anybody who is focused on addressing the
climate crisis, including the President, included in it.  And that
includes environmental remediation.  It includes an enormous investment
in electric vehicles, electric buses — something that will not only help
communities across the country, you know, better move around, but it
will also help our climate.  And he is also committed to continuing to
work to get more in the bi- — in the reconciliation package, something
that Senator Sanders is certainly running point and leading on.

Q    I guess my other question has to do with the reconciliation
package.  To what degree, given the amount of effort you’re having to
put into getting the compromise through — the infrastructure package
through — has there any — has any real work been done on looking at what
you can put into a reconciliation package and win support for?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    I mean, how far is this — you know, is this effort underway?  And
who’s leading that initiative?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Senator Sanders is leading that initiative, of course,
in the Senate.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) say?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say White House leaders — the same White House
leaders: Steve Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, others who are — Shalanda
Young, obviously, as our — as our Acting OMB Director.  They have
already had meetings.  They had a meeting — I think, last week, we
announced — on the Hill to discuss the next steps and the paths
forward.  They will have continued meetings over the coming weeks.  
   
We have a Jobs Cabinet.  We also have a Families Cabinet of members of
our — of our administration who we expect to also be out there
communicating about the huge benefits of the Families Plan — something
that will be central to the President’s push in the reconciliation
package as well as his budget that he’s also put forward.   
   
We also fully recognize that we’re at the early stages of this process,
and I think anybody on the Hill will tell you that.  And there are
important discussions that need to happen between a range of Democrats
about priorities, what can be in the package, and what they would
support.   
   
We’ll, of course, be engaged in that, but those need to also happen
among senators.  
   
Q    What’s your best guess for timing, in terms of getting — you know,
what — what’s your goal, your target to get this legislation passed —
both?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that Leader Schumer has conveyed that he
wants to have both packages on the floor in July, and that’s probably
the next step.  
   
Q    And tomorrow, you’ll be meeting with the western governors.  So the
President will be meeting with the western governors.  He met with the
FEMA Administrator recently and talked about increasing pay for
firefighters and just raising awareness about wildfires.  Do you have
any specific proposals that you’re going to be unveiling in terms of how
to address this problem?  There’s so many wildfires already.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You’re absolutely right.  And the President’s commitment to
making sure we’re being partners — that the administration and he,
personally, is a partner to governors who are looking ahead to a growing
wildfire season — rising heat, rising temperatures in the West — you
know, that’s something that’s been important to him personally.   
   
He already had a briefing from FEMA over the last couple of weeks.  I
don’t have anything to preview for you yet.  We will see if, by the end
of the day, we do, in advance of tomorrow.  
   
Q    Jen, on COVID, is the White House having pause on plans to reopen
to Canada and Europe because of the Delta strain?  Has — is the — you
know, because it’s causing some disruption like everywhere, as far away
as Australia.  Is that, like, getting into the — putting a fly in the
ointment for whatever plans there were to reopen?  And when are you
going to reopen Canada and Europe?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As you know, there’s working groups that are under
discussion — having discussions between our officials and officials in
Europe and other countries about what that path forward looks like.  I
don’t — I don’t have any updates on those groups.   
   
Q    So there’s no pro- — there’s no progress on — like, (inaudible)
Canada?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I didn’t — I didn’t actually say that.   
   
Q    Oh.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I said: We continue to evaluate, through these working
groups, what the criteria should be and when it would be safe to
reopen.  We are working — we’re guided by our public health officials,
but I don’t have any updates on the timeline at this point.  
   
Q    Okay.  Jen, I just — just related to that, is there any update on
the mask policy and so on for the barbecue on Sunday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, the — sorry, say that one more time.  
   
Q    I’m sorry.  At the White House barbecue on Sunday —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yes.  
   
Q    — the July the 4th barbecue — have you — what are the rules going
to be for masks and —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — vaccine and so on?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s been guidance that has been provided, which may be
updated.  But to all attendees that include the — the guidance that they
should be — they should get tested one through three days in advance of
coming to the event.  If they are vaccinated, of course, they can abide
by the public health guidelines that does not require mask wearing.  If
they have not been vaccinated, they should wear a mask.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
Q    Jen, can you talk about the strategy of going to Wisconsin today? 
Why aren’t we heading to West Virginia or Arizona or some other place
where you might be targeting a lawmaker?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Wisconsin is a place where there — where the people of
the state would hugely benefit from the components of the bipartisan
infrastructure package.  I mentioned a couple of them at the top,
including broadband access — something that more than 80,000 kids across
Wisconsin didn’t have access to, even while they were getting —
attending school from home.  There are bridges across the state that
need repair, roads that need repair — also something that would be
beneficial.   
   
We’re going to a — the location we’re going to, where the President is
going to be delivering his remarks, is an interesting example.  They
purchased two electric vehicles because of an electric — because of a
federal grant — electric buses, I should say.  That’s something that’s
going to help the City of La Crosse get to a more — a — to become a city
that is — can be a model for how you should move to a more
climate-friendly approach to transit.   
   
So, this is a place where we felt we could highlight the benefits, talk
directly to the Ame- — American people, people of Wisconsin about why
this bipartisan package is a good deal for the American people.  
   
Q    Jen, does the President believe that Americans who live in coastal
high rises are safe right now?  Or is there anything that — more that he
wants to see being done?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, one, the President supports an
investigation.  I conveyed this yesterday.  And I actually didn’t give
the specifics on who would oversee the investigation, so let me just
give that to you right now.  One second.  I have it right in here
somewhere.   
   
Okay.  So the National Institute of Standards and Technology — NIST — is
authorized to investigate building failures.  Their authorities are
modeled after those of the National Transportation Safety Board — the
NTSB — for investigating transportation accidents.   
   
They have announced they sent a team of six scientists and engineers to
collect firsthand information on the towers — the Champlain Towers South
collapse that will be used to determine if an investigation or study
will be conducted.   
   
So, obviously, that would be something the President would support, and
certainly we would look to that — if that’s a decision made — to learn
how we can help protect infrastructure across the country.  
   
Q    And any reaction to that letter that went out to the residents of
the building?  We found — CNN found, in April, that it was warning the
occupants of basically the worst possible outcome, which happened.  Any
— any reaction?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, clearly, we are providing every resource we can from
the federal government — not just to help with the search-and-rescue
operations, but to be a part of any effort to determine if an
investigation should happen moving forward.  That’s something the
President supports, and that’s a way we can be constructive from the
federal government.   
   
Q    Jen, there’s a report in Politico that suggests that your
administration is looking at reversing some of the deportations that
happened during the Trump administration.  Can you talk about that and
maybe whether there’s any limit to it or how you’re going through that
process?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s — I’d have to talk to our immigration team about
that.  I have not seen that report, but I will check in with them about
it and get you an answer.   
   
Q    And, Jen, going back to what we were talking about earlier with
infrastructure and Senator McConnell: Senator McConnell, yesterday,
claimed he’s still sort of undecided on whether to vote for this
package.  Does the White House think getting him to vote for this is a
realistic goal?  Do you view him as a partner in passing this or as
someone who’s more trying to tank the deal?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Look, I would say that the President would welcome the
support from any Republican and Democrat for a bipartisan package that’s
broadly supported by the American people, because the American people
don’t think — including people in his home state of Kentucky — that
rebuilding roads and railways and bridges is a partisan issue.  It’s
not.  Neither is making sure people have access to broadband or clean
drinking water.  
   
That’s the case the President will continue to make.  We’ll lead the —
leave the vote counting and the whip counting to leaders in Congress.  
   
Q    But does the President view McConnell as an ally in trying to get
this passed or as someone we need to get past in order to pass it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President and members of the administration will engage
with a range of leaders and officials in Congress, including Leader
McCon- — including Senator McConnell.  
   
Q    The German finance minister is coming this week to visit Janet
Yellen, and there’s these OECD tax talks.  As you know, this was a
subject at the G7.  Are you confident that you’ll — that the U.S. will
be able to prevail with that digital — you know, with the — with its
view of a global minimum corporate tax of 15 percent?  And do you have
any, kind of, updates for us as we’re heading into the G20 process
too?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  Beginning of an exciting season: the G20 season.  I
will say I would certainly leave it to the Department of Treasury for
any previews of the Secretary’s meeting, but I would remind you — and
you were on the trip with us — that it was, in part, because of U.S.
leadership that we got agreement on the global minimum tax at the G7 —
an important step forward and something we knew that there would be
continued work that would be required to be done to get that across the
finish line.  
   
But I would leave it to them for any update on that, as Secretary Yellen
is running point and leading that effort.  
   
Q    On housing finance, you had the Supreme Court ruling recently, but
we saw, in the Miami condo tower, condos were selling — they were listed
for sale between $600- and $700,000.  Does this administration plan to
do anything about the shortage of home construction and housing finance
to make sure that people can find homes where they can afford and know
that their investments will be safe?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Are you asking me about the infrastructure or the cost of
housing?  
   
Q    The cost of housing but, more importantly, the absence of supply
and the absence of new construction.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  I would say, first, on the — we certainly recognize
that the absence of certain materials, as you all know, including
lumber, has led to price increases in the housing market.  And we have
been focused on working through our supply chain team that is leading
this effort to make sure we are addressing challenges in the supply
chain, gaps in the supply chain to make sure that those materials are
more readily available.  
   
So, yes, we are doing — we are taking a number of steps as an
administration, across the board, to address housing.  As you know,
there’s been a one-month extension — I know this wasn’t what you were
asking, but just an example — of the eviction moratorium and the
foreclosure moratorium.  That will help some people in the country stay
in their homes for a period of time.  That was always meant to be
temporary.   
   
We also are working to see — to determine how we can address these
supply chain issues that have led to increases, because as you know,
Josh, from covering this quite closely, the fact that there are not new
builds is also raising the prices of houses that have been around for
some time, so we’re seeing kind of a ricocheting effect here.  But that
is part of our objective.  And some of the materials that are — is being
worked through by our economic team.  
   
Q    On this trip, Jen — so, obviously, President Biden won Wisconsin in
2020, but the area we’re going to today was more in favor of Donald
Trump.  I know the next election is a long way off, but does the White
House believe winning or getting higher margins in rural areas is
important for the President’s reelection?  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say that what should be noted is that under
President Biden’s leadership, the economy is starting to come back
again, and communities across the country — whether they’re blue or red
parts of the country — are seeing the benefits of that.  And it is — it
should be noted that a range of members of Congress who may be facing
reelections are eager to have the President travel to parts of their
districts and parts of their — and their states because of his work on
an economic agenda that works for all people, whether they live in red
states or blue states or purple states and whomever they may have voted
for the last time around.  
   
Q    Can I just ask on the supply chain stuff?  You talked yesterday
about Taiwan.  You talked yesterday about Taiwan.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    And there’s this critical meeting today on this sort of, you know,
trade council with Taiwan.  Is there any suggestion at all that the U.S.
decision to provide as many vaccine doses as were provided to Taiwan is
in some way a quid pro quo to get access to semiconductors from
Taiwan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There should not be that suggestion.  I will note that they
were being cut off from access to vaccines.  So that was a factor.  
   
Q    Jen, Senator Wyden has what he’s calling the “Press Act.”  It has
to do with the idea that Justice Department — the Justice Department is
subpoenaing reporters’ business records.  Does the White House have a
position that it’s ready to take on that?  I know the President has
obviously spoken out about how wrong it is that the Justice Department
might go after reporters’ records.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, the President has been pretty clear about what he
feels the tactics should not be as it relates to reporters and members
of the media.  And that is aligned with his long respect for the freedom
of press and the freedom of media.   
   
I’d have to look into this.  It’s a piece of legislation.  I’d have to
look into the specifics of the piece of legislation.  
   
Q    Great.  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Thanks, everyone.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.
