  \ Summit and Economic\_Deliverables"

12:54 P.M. BST  
   
MODERATOR: And so, again, in the interest of time, we’re going to move
on to this next section.   
   
I am now going to pass it back to \[senior administration official\],
again, joined by \[senior administration official\], to preview the G7
Summit, as well as the economic deliverables to come out of that.   
   
A reminder that this section, unlike the other two, is embargoed until
tomorrow morning, June 11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time.   
   
So, \[senior administration officials\], we’ll pass it back to you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:   Thanks.  I’ll start and just point
out, you know, this is the first G7 Summit in nearly two years.  It’s
the first G7 Summit that President Biden is attending.  It is the first
G7 Summit that has been held since the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic.  And we think it is an incredibly important moment for the G7
for all the reasons I was just describing.   
   
As the President has said many times, we are entering a period in which
the question has been called between democracies and autocracies.  And
pulling together the G7, plus our partner countries, we believe would
demonstrate that we’re unified in our resolve to show that democracy and
shared democratic values provide the single best path for delivering
results for our people and for meeting the biggest challenges of the
world.   
   
And I want to just reinforce that last point.  Top to bottom, the
driving, animating purpose of this G7 Summit is to show that democracies
can deliver against the biggest challenges we are facing in the
world.   
   
So, on the global economy, the G7 will be spending its time here talking
about how it can most effectively contribute to the global economic
recovery and to global economic fairness, including through things like
committing to this global minimum tax.  
   
On COVID-19, as we’ve already talked about, not only will there be a
significant commitment of doses, but an embrace of a broader roadmap to
help end the pandemic.  
   
On climate, we will have more to say over the next couple of days, but
the G7 countries will not only recommit to what they’ve laid out at the
President’s Leaders Summit on Climate, as well as their own national
contributions, but there will be tangible action proposed and adopted at
this G7, on climate.   
   
And then, in terms of infrastructure and the enormous need for low- and
middle-income countries around the world to have their infrastructure
requirements met, the G7+ will embrace a high-standards, transparent,
climate-friendly, non-corrupt mechanism for investing in the physical,
digital, and health infrastructure of low- and middle-income countries. 
It will be an alternative to that which other countries, including
China, are offering.   
   
And then, of course, there will be discussion of all of the hotspots and
the key regional challenges, as well as the way in which new
technologies are reshaping our world.  So they will discuss ransomware
and how to set the rules of the road on all forms of emerging technology
so that it’s democracies, and not autocracies, who are laying the
foundation for standards as we go forward.  
   
All of this will end up getting enshrined in the G7 leaders communiqué
that will be released at the conclusion of the summit.  There will be a
few other leader-level documents as well, but that’s the broad basis of
what we’re trying to accomplish: meaningful outcomes on COVID, on
climate, on the global economy, on infrastructure, on ransomware, and
cyber.   
   
And when you add it all up, I think a fair read of what will come out of
these next few days is one of the most substantive, if not the most
substantive, set of deliverables out of the G7 in long memory.  It’s —
there’s going to be a lot packed into these three days and a number of
significant, concrete outcomes.  
   
So, with that, let me turn it over to \[senior administration
official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, \[senior administration
official\].  So I’ll talk about the first working session of the G7,
which is going to be tomorrow.  And it’s going to focus on the global
economy.   
   
So, let me give some context, which is that the U.S. is once again
leading the world economy into recovery from a position of strength at
home.   
   
And as you know, this is a dramatic turnaround from when the President
took office four months ago.  U.S. economic growth projections for this
year have doubled since December; they’re projected to be the fastest in
almost 40 years.   
   
The labor market is clearly gathering strength.  The economy has added
over 540,000 jobs on average since the President took office, the most
over four months of any presidency.   
   
Unemployment has fallen from above 14 percent to under 6 percent, and
it’s expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023, which is about
seven years faster than compared to the post-2009 recovery.  Actually,
if you look at the latest jobs report, it showed the largest one-month
drop in long-term unemployment in a decade.   
   
And for context, long-term unemployment is especially pernicious to the
labor force.  The longer one is unemployed, the more difficult,
historically, it’s been to find new employment.   
   
So, you know, that’s the context.  And importantly, as we head into
these G7 meetings, the strength of the U.S. economy is helping to power
the global economic recovery.  Both the OECD and the IMF estimate that
U.S. economic growth this year will add a percentage point to global
growth.  And this is coming after 2020 — a year in which global growth
contracted 3.5 percent, which is the worst peacetime recession since the
Great Depression.   
   
So these economic outcomes, as \[senior administration officials\] both
alluded to, they’re the result of deliberate choices: the wartime,
whole-of-government effort that \[senior administration official\]
described to beat back the pandemic, but also the bold and unflinching
decision the President made to go big and upfront on fiscal support and
the plans to make generational investments to address structural
challenges and lift the economy’s growth potential by addressing
longstanding disparities and by boosting the innovation and dynamism of
the economy.   
   
So, here at the G7, we’ll continue to make efforts to accelerate the
global growth recovery, which, in turn, will create long-term benefits
to U.S. exports and U.S. jobs.   
   
So we’ll do that in three ways.  We’ll — leaders will encourage G7
partners to continue providing near-term fiscal support to create a
balanced global recovery, as well as long-term structural investments to
boost our innovation and dynamism together.   
   
We will also build on the commitment from finance ministers, last week,
to give active consideration to channel a proportion of the IMF’s plans
to allocate $650 billion in economic support through Special Drawing
Rights to multiply the impact of that allocation to lower-income
countries where the pandemic response needs are the greatest and where
the economic recovery has been slowest.   
   
And the last thing I’ll mention before we can take questions is: Leaders
will also endorse the historic agreement reached last week by finance
ministers for a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15 percent. 
It’s a major statement to have G7 unity on this effort.  It will serve
as a springboard to getting broader agreement at the G20.  So we see
this as a critical step towards ending the race to the bottom on
corporate taxes that’s come at the expense of workers, at the expense of
investments in domestic renewal, and at the expense of growing the
middle class.  
   
I’ll stop there.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks so much.  So, we have time for a couple of
questions.  So, if you’ve got a question on this recent G7 section or
the economic deliverables, please use the “raise hand” function.  
   
Okay, no questions.  As a reminder that this most recent section — oh,
coming in at the last second.  Well, why don’t we start with Andrew
Restuccia with the Wall Street Journal.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I wanted to ask \[senior administration official\] about
the Johnson meeting just because we only got one question on that.  Can
you talk a little bit about Northern Ireland specifically and what the
President might tell the Prime Minister on that subject?  And I would
love for you to respond to this report in the Times of the UK, as well,
if you could.  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, sure.  On Northern Ireland,
the President is going to say to the Prime Minister what he has said
publicly for a long time now, including as recently as St. Patrick’s
Day, which is that he believes that the Good Friday Agreement is the
foundation for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland; that a lot
of progress has been made over the 20-plus years since the Good Friday
Agreement came into force and that that progress must be protected; and
that the outcome of the current discussions between the UK and the EU
should ensure the continued vitality of the Good Friday Agreement.  
   
You know, the United States is not in those negotiations and not seeking
to be in those negotiations.  And we are instead a strong and vigorous
supporter of practical, creative, flexible, results-oriented
negotiations that, at the end of the day, produce a result that protects
all of the gains that the people of Northern Ireland — that all
communities in Northern Ireland have made.  And that’s what he’s going
to say.  
   
It will not be confrontational or adversarial or — you know, he didn’t
come here to give a lecture.  He came merely to communicate what he
believes very, very deeply about peace in Northern Ireland, about the
priority the United States places on that, about the priority Joe Biden
places on that.  And that’s the spirit with which he’ll approach the
conversation.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And so, in the interest of time, we’re going to
have to conclude.  Thanks so much for everyone joining.  
   
As a friendly reminder, again, this most recent section on the G7
preview and economic deliverables is embargoed until tomorrow, June
11th, 7:00 a.m. British Summer Time.  And the other two sections on the
COVID-19 vaccine announcement, as well as the preview of the President’s
bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Johnson are embargoed until this
call concludes, which will be momentarily.  
   
Thank you again for all your time.  And we’ll be in touch very soon.
