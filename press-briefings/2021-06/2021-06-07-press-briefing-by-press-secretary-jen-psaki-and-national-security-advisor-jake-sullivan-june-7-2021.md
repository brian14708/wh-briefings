title: "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki and National Security Advisor\
  \ Jake Sullivan, June 7,\_2021"
---
 
James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:42 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Full room.  I hope everyone is cozy.  So,
today, we are fortunate to have a very special guest, National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan, here to join us and give a preview of the
President’s trip.  And then, of course, we’ll do a full briefing after
that.   
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to Jake.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Jen.  And thanks, everybody.  So, as you all
know, this week President Biden will head off to Europe on the first
foreign trip of his presidency — certainly not his first foreign trip,
but the first one as President of the United States.  And the trip, at
its core, will advance the fundamental thrust of Joe Biden’s foreign
policy: to rally the world’s democracies to tackle the great challenges
of our time.  
   
We believe that President Biden goes on this trip from a position of
strength: dramatic progress against the pandemic at home; strong,
projected growth that will help power the global economic recovery as
well; renewed American power and purpose; and a rock-solid foundation of
alliances that will serve as force multipliers for our global agenda.  
   
At the G7, he will join with his fellow leaders to lay out a plan to end
the COVID-19 pandemic with further specific commitments towards that
end.  He will also join his fellow leaders to announce a new initiative
to provide financing for physical, digital, and health infrastructure in
the developing world — a high-standard, climate-friendly, transparent,
and rules-based alternative to what China is offering.  
   
He and the other leaders will endorse a global minimum tax of at least
15 percent, as you saw coming out of the G7 Finance Ministers Meeting a
few days ago.  And the G7 leaders will make a number of significant
commitments on climate, on labor standards, on anti-corruption, and on
ransomware.  
   
At NATO, President Biden will address enduring security challenges that
have been at the core of the Alliance for a long time, including Russia
and coordinating the remaining period of the drawdown of forces from
Afghanistan.  But they will also focus on emerging security challenges
to the Alliance, critically including cyber and the challenge posed by
China.  
   
President Biden will also reinforce the importance of burden sharing —
not just the 2 percent commitment that Allies made back in 2014 at the
Wales Summit, but the need for Allies to give not just cash, but
contributions to exercises and to operations that NATO is undertaking,
and to have the kinds of capabilities that make sure that NATO is a
full-spectrum alliance with Allies across the board providing the kind
of high-end capabilities NATO requires.  
   
At the U.S.-EU summit, the President and European Union leaders will
focus on aligning our approaches to trade and technology so that
democracies and not anyone else — not China or other autocracies — are
writing the rules for trade and technology for the 21st century.  
   
President Biden will also have a series of bilateral engagements,
including a U.S.-UK summit with Prime Minister Johnson, where the two
leaders will reaffirm the Special Relationship and update and upgrade it
for the modern era.  And we will have further announcements about
additional bilateral engagements that he will have both in Cornwall and
in Brussels in the days ahead.  
   
After his time at the G7, at NATO, and at the U.S.-EU summit, President
Biden will go to Geneva to meet with President Putin.  He will do so, of
course, after having had nearly a week of intensive consultations with
allies and democratic partners from both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. 
So he will go into this meeting with the wind at his back.  
   
Now, we have made clear repeatedly, and I will reinforce again today,
that we do not regard a meeting with the Russian president as a reward. 
We regard it as a vital part of defending America’s interests and
America’s values.  Joe Biden is not meeting with Vladimir Putin despite
our countries’ differences; he’s meeting with him because of our
countries’ differences.  There is simply a lot we have to work
through.  
   
We believe that President Biden is the most effective, direct
communicator of American values and priorities.  And we believe that
hearing directly from President Putin is the most effective way to
understand what Russia intends and plans.  
   
There is never any substitute for leader-to-leader engagement,
particularly for complex relationships, but with Putin this is
exponentially the case.  He has a highly personalized style of decision
making and so it is important for President Biden to be able to sit down
with him face to face, to be clear about where we are, to understand
where he is, to try to manage our differences, and to identify those
areas where we can work in America’s interests to make progress.  
   
When President Biden returns to Washington next week, we believe that we
will be in a materially stronger position to manage the major threats
and challenges this country faces: COVID, climate, China, cyber, Russia,
and shaping the rules of trade and technology for the future.  
   
So, with that, I’d be happy to take any questions that you have.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  Is this the right time to be having a one-on-one
meeting with Vladimir Putin so early in President Biden’s presidency,
before he’s met one-on-one with so many other world leaders, and at a
time when there isn’t a specific deliverable that the White House is
looking to achieve from the one-on-one meeting?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, we don’t think in terms of U.S.-Russia summits
as being about deliverables.  Because if you’re going to wait for really
significant deliverables, you could be waiting a long time,
conceivably.  So what we need to think about this summit as doing is
fundamentally giving us an opportunity to communicate from our president
to their president what American intentions and capabilities are and to
hearing the same from their side.  That has value in and of itself.  
   
Secondly, in terms of the timing, it is hard from our perspective to
find a better context for a meeting with the Russian president than
after time spent with the world’s leading market economies — the G7 —
plus India, South Korea, Australia, and South Africa; after a meeting
with all of his fellow leaders at NATO; after a meeting with the
presidents of the European Union; and then, and only then, going into
this session to be able to talk through the complex set of issues in the
U.S.-Russia relationship.  That, from our perspective, is the right
context within which to engage Russia.  
   
And as far as whether it comes too early in his presidency, if you think
about what we’ve dealt with from the outset on Russia, it’s been a busy
time: We’ve extended the New START agreement.  We’ve imposed costs for
election interference and for SolarWinds.  We’ve dealt with a Russian
buildup on the Ukraine border.  And, of course, we are contending with a
range of issues in the cyber and ransomware domain.  So, we feel that it
is an effective and appropriate context and time period for us to have
this summit.  
   
Q    And then, just as a follow-up to that: The Ukrainian President did
an interview today and implored President Biden to meet with him first,
before Mr. Biden sits down with Vladimir Putin.  Is that something that
you’re considering?  If not, why not?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, actually, I have come into this briefing room from
the Oval Office where President Biden was on the phone with President
Zelenskyy of Ukraine.  This is a call that they had been planning to
make in advance of President Biden going to Europe and meeting with
President Putin.  They had the opportunity to talk at some length about
all of the issues in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.  And President Biden
was able to tell President Zelenskyy that he will stand up firmly for
Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and its aspirations, as we
go forward.  And he also told President Zelenskyy that he looks forward
to welcoming him to the White House, here in Washington, this summer
after he returns from Europe.  
   
Q    Jake.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.   
   
Q    Hi, Jake.  Thank you.  We know that Afghanistan is going to be
discussed with our NATO Allies.  There’s been a lot of concern about
replacing some of those U.S. assets, such as the drones, to be able to
fight against the Taliban.  Can you bring us up to speed on where are
the negotiations with Pakistan?  And would the United States like to
have a drone base in Pakistan?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So I’m not going to get into the details of our
negotiations with Pakistan.  I will only say this: We have had
constructive discussions in the military, intelligence, and diplomatic
channels with Pakistan about the future of America’s capabilities to
ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a base from which al Qaeda
or ISIS or any other terrorist group can attack the United States.   
   
But in terms of the specifics of what that will look like, that will
have to remain in those private channels as we work through them.  
   
What I will say is that we are talking to a wide range of countries
about how we build effective, over-the-horizon capacity, both from an
intelligence and from a defense perspective, to be able to suppress the
terrorism threat in Afghanistan on a going-forward basis.  
   
Q    Jake, two questions — one with Putin and one here back at home. 
With Putin, the President is going into this meeting where there’s great
tension between both leaders.  And let’s talk about the trust factor:
How can you trust anything Vladimir Putin says in this sit-down when the
President comes back?  You say you’re going to learn what he’s thinking
and what he wants to moving forward.  How can you trust that, as
Vladimir Putin has already smeared the President’s name?  How can you do
that?  How can you trust?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Taking the measure of another president is not about
trusting them.  And the relationship between the U.S. and Russia is not
about a relationship of trust.  It’s about a relationship of
verification.  It’s about a relationship of clarifying what our
expectations are and laying out that if certain kinds of harmful
activities continue to occur, there will be responses from the United
States.  
   
Q    What are those responses?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  And our — well, we will lay those out for President Putin
in this meeting, and he will understand fully where the United States
stands and what we intend to do.   
   
But one thing I will say, April, is we believe fundamentally that our
capacity to ensure that harmful and disruptive activities against the
United States do not continue unabated is to be able to communicate
clearly, directly — not by negotiating in public, but by explicating our
position and our capabilities in private.  And that’s what President
Putin intends to do.  
   
Q    My second question, Jake, on voting — the For the People Act.  If
it is not passed, what is the national security issue with it?  Is there
a national security issue with it if it’s not passed?  Because we’ve
heard so much over the past few years about issues of voting.  If that
is not passed, is it a national security issue?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I would say the basic notion of democratic reform and
voting rights in the United States is a national security issue.  We are
in a competition of models with autocracies, and we are trying to show
the world that American democracy and democracy writ large can work, can
effectively deliver the will of the people.  And to the extent that we
are not updating, refurbishing, revamping our own democratic processes
and procedures to meet the needs of the modern moment, then we are not
going to be as successful in making that case to the rest of the world —
to China, to Russia, or to anyone else. And so there is a national
security dimension to this today, just as there was through the decades
of the Cold War.  
   
Yamiche.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  My question is: Can you talk a bit about how
President Biden plans to convince, especially our European allies, that
President — former President Trump was an anomaly in some ways — all the
things that he did to, in some ways, traumatize those leaders; calling
into question the need for NATO.  What’s the plan there?  And is he
concerned that those scars are going to be deeper than his ability to
address them in this one trip?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think our view going into this trip is that actions
speak louder than words, and that showing that the United States is
capable of turning the corner on the pandemic; showing that the United
States is capable of making the dramatic investments that will pull us
up and out of this economic recovery and help power global growth;
showing the world that we are ultimately capable of making the
investments in R&D and infrastructure, innovation, and workforce —
ultimately, setting that foundation for this country will be the most
effective way to show the rest of the world that the United States has
the power and purpose to be able to deliver as the world’s leading
democracy.  
   
So that’s what he’s going to try to demonstrate.  And he, as I said at
the outset, feels he goes into this from a position of strength because
of the record he’s built up over the course of the first four months.  
   
Q    And on voting, can you talk a little bit — is Congress being
briefed on the idea of voting as a national security issue?  And if the
For the People Act isn’t passed, what will that say globally, given the
fact that you just laid it out as a national security issue?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I will say, humbly, as the National Security Advisor,
I don’t tend to get into the middle of the debates up on the Hill on
issues like voting rights.  All I can say is the bottom-line principle —
not a specific question about the vehicle or the timeframe, but rather
the fundamental principle — which is that a strong, vibrant American
democracy that protects voting rights is the best way for us to make the
case to the world that our model, and not some other model, is the right
model to actually vindicate the will of the people here in the United
States, and for other democracies to be able to do the same.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Two quick questions.  One, a follow-up on Yamiche.  The biggest
concern of some of our allies has been, over the last four years and
even before, just the rapid swaying back and forth of our foreign
policy.  Now, you can’t assure anyone what’s going to happen after you
leave, but what assurances and what will you tell our allies that,
despite what we’ve seen in the past, that we have returned to normal?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think the best way to answer that question — and this
builds on what I said to Yamiche — is what President Biden can do is
show the rest of the world what America is capable of.  If we can lead
the world in ending the COVID-19 pandemic more rapidly; if the growth we
are powering for the American people here at home helps power a global
economic recovery; if we can help rally, as the President did with his
Climate Leaders Summit, action on climate — on the climate crisis so
that we actually beat this thing, ultimately, that is going to be the
best way for people to say, “Hang on, the United States can do this. 
They can deliver and we will stand up and stand behind them.”  And that
is the approach that he has taken from the first day he’s been in
office.  That’s the message he’s going to carry into these meetings.  
   
And what I believe we will deliver just out of the G7 alone, in addition
to the other meetings he’s going to have on this trip, will show that
the United States retains profound capacity to help rally the world’s
democracies to solve big problems.  
   
Q    And the second question —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Yes —  
   
Q    And I had a second question.  The second question was: Will you
look at ransomware as a national security priority?  How will we address
that in the G7?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes, ransomware is a national security priority,
particularly as it relates to ransomware attacks on critical
infrastructure in the United States.  And we will treat it as such in
the G7.  We will treat it at such at every stop along the way on this
trip.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  What is the point of meeting Putin in person if
there are no deliverables and there’s no real trust to that
relationship?  Why does the President think in-person is the most
effective way to address Putin when you could just do this on the
phone?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first of all, there’s no substitute for
face-to-face engagement in any dynamic.  He’s not just going to Geneva. 
Right?  He’s going to Cornwall.  He’s going to Brussels.  He will have
the chance to look in the eyes of literally dozens of leaders over the
course of his time, and all of that will be better than just operating
on the telephone.  That’s —  
   
Q    I’m asking about Putin though, not the other leaders.  If there’s —
if the relationship —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, but I —  
   
Q    — is centered around these issues that are so complicated, what
does this President believe — what does he believe he can bring to the
table with Putin?  And how does he assess Putin as a leader that he can
talk to across the table?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, the reason I answered with “all the other
leaders” is this isn’t something unique to Putin.  Meeting face to face
is not just something you do with Vladimir Putin; it’s something
President Biden is going to do — I think, all told, when you add it up —
with somewhere approaching 35 or 36 leaders just on this one trip
alone.  And he has welcomed the Prime Minister of Japan and the
President of Korea.  He will welcome other leaders here over the course
of the summer, because face-to-face engagement is just of a different
order of magnitude of diplomatic engagement from doing it over the
phone.  
   
Second, on this notion of deliverables in the U.S.-Russia summit: At the
end of the day, what we are looking to do is for the two presidents to
be able to send a clear signal on question — to their teams on questions
of strategic stability so that we can make progress in arms control and
other nuclear areas to reduce tension and instability in that aspect of
the relationship.  And then, second, being able to look President Putin
in the eye and say, “This is what America’s expectations are.  This is
what America stands for.  This is what America is all about.”   
   
This, we believe, is an essential aspect of U.S.-Russia diplomacy
because President Putin is a singular kind of personalized leader, and
having the opportunity to come together in a summit will allow us to
manage this relationship and stand up and defend American values most
effectively.  
   
Q    Following up on the ransomware issue, given how pervasive it is and
has been for some time.  U.S. officials have talked about the need for
international allies to work together on this issue.  Are you looking
for specific commitments from allies?  What do you want to come out of
the G7 and NATO summit with, as it pertains to ransomware to help better
protect the U.S.?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So one of the things we’d like to see out of the G7 is
the start of an action plan that covers a number of critical areas.   
   
First, how to deal with the — increasing the robustness and resilience
of our defenses against ransomware attacks, collectively.   
   
Second, how to share information about the nature of the threat among
our democracies.   
   
Third, how to deal with the cryptocurrency challenge, which is — lies at
the core of how this — these ransom transactions are played out.  
   
And then, finally, how we collectively speak with one voice to those
countries, including Russia, that are harboring or permitting cyber
criminals to operate from their territory.   
   
So those are some of the things that we are looking for as outcomes out
of the G7+.  We will also speak, in the NATO context, about cyber
threats, particularly as they relate to critical infrastructure, as
being of a different order of magnitude of security threat that the
Alliance has to concern itself with in a way that it hasn’t
historically.  But it’s got to become a priority on a going-forward
basis.   
   
Q    Jake?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Okay, so about
the infrastructure financing problem that you were talking about is
going to be announced, which countries is the United States and G7 look
at?  Is Brazil one of these developing countries to receive this
financing?  
   
And if you could update us about the discussions with Brazil on 5G,
because you have a delegation from Brazil here discussing with NSC
officials.   
   
And, finally, why hasn’t President Biden still talk with the Brazilian
president, Bolsonaro?  Why are — why he hasn’t?  And what is the message
that this send to Brazil?  It’s June.  He’s already going to — for
international trip.  He has not yet speak with Brazil.  So why is
that?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So there are a number of leaders that he hasn’t had the
opportunity to speak with.  And one of the reasons why, of course, as
many people in this room know, is he’s had an unbelievably packed and
crowded agenda, particularly domestically, and trying to beat the
pandemic and get on the road to COVID-19 recovery.   
   
So he’s looking forward to making sure he gets to touch the leaders of
every significant country in the world over the course of the coming
weeks and months.  
   
On 5G, we have made clear our view and we will communicate that with the
delegation visiting from Brazil that we believe that trusted vendors for
5G are the best way, both for — to secure telecommunications networks
and to ensure that a country’s democratic values can be protected.   
   
And then, finally, I’m not going to get ahead of the announcements on
the financing for infrastructure package.  I will let that speak for
itself.  But I will say, it will cover all of the significant regions of
the world, including Latin America and the Caribbean.  
   
Q    Mr. Sullivan?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Thank you there.  When the United States rejoined the World Health
Organization, you wrote in a statement that that meant, quote, “holding
it to the highest standards.”  Does that mean that the World Health
Organization had failed to meet those standards at some point?  And
then, what specifically is this administration doing to make certain
that they are held to those standards?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we have made clear from the beginning of this
administration, and in rejoining, that we believe the WHO does need to
be reformed.  Some of those reforms are more programmatic and
bureaucratic; they relate to ensuring greater efficiency and
effectiveness in responding to things like the outbreak of COVID-19. 
Some of them are about making sure that there is not undue influence or
interference by any single member state or country in the WHO.   
   
And then some of them relate to very targeted issues like the COVID-19
origins investigation where I have personally, and we collectively, have
been quite vocal about our view that there needs to be a second round to
this investigation that truly gets to the heart of the matter, which is
the original data and original information that is still being withheld
by China.  And our hope is that in the coming months we will see a
credible international investigation progress, including in respect to
those items.   
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  What is your expectation for when the U.S. will
lift travel restrictions on the UK and on Europe?  And what are your
current concerns?  Why haven’t they been lifted yet?  What specifically
are you looking for to have happen — for that to happen?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, let me start by saying it doesn’t really matter
what I am looking for personally, because at the end of the day this is
a process being driven by science and public health guidance.  And so it
is ultimately up to the public health professionals in the U.S.
government to make that determination.   
   
We have heard very clearly the desire of our friends in Europe and in
the UK, to be able to reopen travel across the Atlantic Ocean, and we
want to see that happen.  But we have to follow the science and we have
to follow the guidance of our public health professionals.  So we are
actively engaging with them to determine the timeframe.  
   
And I can’t give you a date today, but I will tell you that we recognize
the concern and we are fundamentally being guided by objective analysis
in this regard.  
   
Q    What is your response to arguments that those continuing
restrictions on the UK and European countries are unfair, given that
there are other countries that the U.S. does  
not have travel restrictions on?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  My view on this is: We have been transparent and clear
about the basis for our travel restrictions.  We have done so through a
process that has been guided by science and evidence.  That is how we’ve
determined how the travel restrictions have been applied and to whom,
and that is how we are going to proceed on a going-forward basis.   
   
This could — this administration’s commitment to that kind of analysis
is fundamental.  It is how — it is what has guided every aspect of our
response to the pandemic, including this issue.  
   
Q    Thank you very much, Jake.  Nice to see you.  I’m  Jeanne Pak with
(inaudible) Korea.  And regarding about the North Korea issues, is there
a possibility of U.S. and South Korea, Japan trilateral meeting at the
G7, and you’ll be discussing with the North Korean issues?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We don’t currently have a trilateral scheduled between
the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, but I will tell you there’s a
possibility for virtually anything in these small spaces where you have
just a — you know, in this case, 10 or 12 leaders in person there in
Cornwall.  But there’s nothing currently on the schedule.   
   
Q    We have a logistical question, actually.  Do you expect President
Biden and President Putin to spend any time together alone, or do you
expect that staff and aides will be present throughout all this summit? 
And can we expect a joint press conference between the two leaders?  Is
this something that you’re actively pushing for?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  All of that is still being worked out.  So when I’ve got
more to report on the modalities, both in terms of how the meeting will
be structured and the press elements, we’ll come back to you.  
   
Q    Jake, I want to ask you about the relationship specifically with
two leaders.  It was announced las week that the President will have a
bilateral with the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.  I know that
talks have been challenging with him.  Can you describe what the
administration is hoping to accomplish on that?   
   
And also, secondly, with the UK, what is the dynamic, or what’s the
personal relationship between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden?  I know we’ve
heard about the Special Relationship between the two countries.  What’s
their relationship like?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, President Biden and President Johnson — or Prime
Minister Johnson — have had the opportunity to have a couple of phone
calls.  And those phone calls have been warm.  They’ve been
constructive.  They’ve been very much down to business.  They’ve gone
through extensive agendas in both of them.  And I expect that their
meeting together will just cover the waterfront.  I mean, really, a wide
range of issues where the two of them and the U.S and United Kingdom do
see eye to eye.  They’ve been collaborating on this plan to end the
pandemic.  They’ve been collaborating on this infrastructure financing
plan.  They’ve been collaborating on virtually every aspect of the G7
agenda.  And they talked very closely about how the Leaders Summit that
President Biden hosted on climate could help provide the runway into
COP26, which Prime Minister Johnson will be hosting in Glasgow.  
   
And then, as far as President Erdoğan is concerned, they will have a
bilateral on the margins of the NATO Summit in Brussels, and there, too,
it’s going to be a broad and expansive agenda — issues right there in
the region; of course, in the Eastern Mediterranean with Syria, with
Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh — but also the role that Turkey will play on a
going-forward basis with respect to negotiations and diplomacy in
Afghanistan and how the U.S and Turkey itself deal with some of our
significant differences on values and human rights and other issues.   
   
And President Biden knows Erdoğan very well.  The two men have spent a
good amount of time together, and they are both, I think, looking
forward to the opportunity to really have a business-like opportunity to
review the full breadth of their relationship.   
   
I’m afraid I have to go.  I’m sorry, guys.  
   
Q    One more question about Ukraine — about the Ukraine (inaudible). 
Can we ask you one question about Ukraine —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Sure.  
   
Q    — and whether President Zelenskyy — you mentioned his ask to have
Ukraine join NATO.  What message will the President deliver in response,
if it came up?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So they were able to talk about, basically, every
significant aspect of the relationship, including with respect to the
U.S.’s support for Ukraine security.  But in terms of the specifics of
what they discussed, I’m going to let the two of them speak for
themselves.  I’m not going to read out that aspect of the meeting. 
Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, Jake.  
   
Okay.  All right, well, what a good way to start off a full briefing
room — our first full briefing room day since the President took
office.  
   
A couple of updates for all of you at the top:  
   
Over the weekend, the Department of Health and Human Services released
new data that showed more than 31 million Americans have gained access
to quality affordable healthcare through the Affordable Care Act — a
record high that demonstrates the strength, durability, and impact of
the historic law after years of relentless attacks on Americans’
healthcare.   
   
President Biden also reunited with President — former President Obama
for the White House’s weekly conversation to share the news, discuss how
the administration’s special enrollment period has allowed more than 1.2
million Americans to enroll in health coverage, and highlight how the
American Rescue Plan has lowered premiums and healthcare costs.   
   
Another update from the weekend: Over the weekend, the G7 finance
ministers also endorsed President Biden’s plan for a global minimum tax
of at least 15 percent.  This is a historic unprecedented progress made
possible by the President’s and Secretary Yellen’s commitment to a
global tax system that is equitable and equipped to meet the needs of
the 21st century global economy.   
   
The G7’s endorsement is another example of America reasserting its
leadership on the world stage — something we look forward to doing later
this week.  And establishing a global corporate minimum tax will help
level the playing field for the United States, ensure fairness for the
American middle class and working families everywhere, and focus
competition for business where it belongs.   
   
Last item for all of you: Today, the Department of Justice announced two
new steps to stem the epidemic of gun violence in our country, following
through on the President and Attorney General’s announcement in April of
a set of initial actions.  
First, the DOJ has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen
regulations on stabilizing braces that helped convert pistols into
dangerous short-barreled rifles, which it appears the perpetrator of the
Boulder shooting used — now that we know more.  
   
The Department is also publishing model legislation and guidance that
will make it easier for states to implement red-flag laws — something
that’s already law in a number of states across the country — which
studies have shown can be effective in reducing gun violence, including
by preventing suicides and even potential mass shootings.  This is part
of the President’s longstanding commitment to addressing the scourge of
gun violence, which continues to claim far too many lives every single
day.  
   
Josh, kick us off.  
   
I’m very thrown off by where everyone is seated.  I’ll — (laughter) —
I’ll adjust to it.  Okay, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two questions.  First, Senator Manchin laid out the
argument that election reform should be bipartisan because anything
partisan would, quote, “destroy the already weakening binds of our
democracy.”  Does the President agree with that sentiment, or is that
sentiment untenable because of the state-level changes being pushed by
Republicans?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first let me say that the President knows he was
elected to deliver on — deliver for the American people.  And his view
is that that includes making voting more accessible for people across
the country — making it easier and not harder to vote.   
   
And he’s made clear that there’s a real need for federal legislation to
protect the sacred right to vote, and we are not going to wait for
Congress either.  That’s why we’ve taken some steps through our
Department of Justice and also why we’ve — he’s asked the Vice President
to lead this effort both in working with Congress, but also at the state
level.  Because as you noted, there are a number of problematic laws
that have been moved — that have moved forward in states across the
country.   
   
I think where we are at this point is, clearly, Senator Manchin has
stated his point of view in his opinion piece over the weekend, which
many of you, it sounds like, have read, as did we.   
   
But the President’s view is that we need to move forward not just with
the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, but also with legislation, like the
For the People Act, which enjoys, I should note, broad support for —
from the American people and — because it does a couple of things that
he thinks are essential: It provides basic protections for registering
to vote and how we cast a ballot; it will prevent politicians from
drawing congressional district lines for partisan advantage; to ensure
that people are choosing the representatives that will help end the
corrupting power of money and politics.   
   
Now, in terms of the path forward and what that looks like and the
mechanics of how it moves forward in Congress, the President is quite
open to and willing to work with anyone to enact commonsense reforms
that benefit the American people.  We will stay lockstep with Democratic
leadership on what that looks like from here, but I don’t have anything
to preview about the next steps.   
   
Q    And then, secondly, the Justice Department has had a series of
policy changes with regards to its relationship with reporters and
pursuing reporters’ sources and possible prosecutions.  I was wondering:
Under this administration, will the Justice Department still be trying
to compel reporters to name sources who are anonymous or unnamed in
court?  Will they continue to do that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think that the announcement from this weekend — or
the statements from this weekend, which are entirely consistent with the
President’s comments he made just a few weeks ago, make very clear that
going forward, consistent with the President’s direction, the Department
of Justice, in a change to longstanding practice, as many of you have
noted in here before, will not see compulsory legal process in leak
investigations to obtain source information from members of the news
media doing their jobs.   
   
That is entirely consistent with delivering on the President’s comments
just a few weeks ago and entirely consistent with his policies now.  It
doesn’t mean — there are still — it’s an independent Justice
Department.  They will proceed, of course, with a range of
investigations, which, as we noted in our statement on Saturday morning,
we did not know about the gag order until minutes before the reporting
came out on Friday night.  So that’s appropriate, but at the same time,
moving forward, consistent with the President’s policies, they will not
be proceeding with those actions that have been consistent over the last
several years.   
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    The President is not happy with the Capito counteroffer.  What
happens now on infrastructure?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A couple things, Steve.  One: First, the President, I
expect, will speak with Senator Capito before he leaves on his trip —
today or tomorrow.  I know we noted Monday in our readout on Friday, but
we’re looking to schedule that call, and it’ll be prior to his departure
on Wednesday morning.  
   
As we noted also in our statement on Friday, the offer did not meet the
President’s bar of growing the economy, tackling the climate crisis, and
creating new jobs.  And I would remind all of you — both in our
counteroffer, but then in a lot of your reporting — it’s clear the
President has come down by about a trillion dollars.  What is — what
we’ve seen on the other side is they only come up by a small percentage
of that.  
   
So, look, moving forward, he’s looking forward to having a discussion
with Senator Capito today or tomorrow, and he certainly is eager to see
what can — what that discussion can entail, knowing that in any
discussion, any negotiation, both sides come closer together.  That’s
always the objective.  He’s come down quite a bit.  We’re looking to see
more.   
   
Now, at the same time, there are a lot of paths forward here, as many of
you know, even though our muscles have atrophied a bit on this — on this
front.  One is, Congressman DeFazio, as we noted in our readout on
Friday as well, is marking up — leading the markup of the House
legislation that has a lot of overlap with the American Jobs Plan this
week and a lot of — it’s a — that is a path that has a lot of
opportunity to move forward in the House.  As we know, sometimes the
House and the Senate may move forward on different paths, and we’ve seen
that take place on lots of pieces of legislation.   
   
The third pathway I would just note is there are Republicans and
Democrats who have been out there talking about their eagerness to be a
part of this discussion and a part of an opportunity to move forward on
the President’s bold ideas and historic investment in infrastructure. 
So we’ll look forward to seeing what they have to offer and what
conversation we can have with them.   
   
So all of these paths we expect to continue to make progress on this
week.  
   
Q    Separately, what is the status of the semiconductor reviews? 
Should we expect that today, tomorrow?  When exactly?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Soon, Steve.  I would expect you will have more this week. 
I know there is a lot of interest and eagerness on hearing what the
status of the review is and any policies that have — will come out of
that review.  
   
Q    On infrastructure, does —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    On infrastructure — back on that — does the President have an
agreement with Senator Manchin that if the bipartisan talks fails, then
Manchin will support the — using reconciliation to pass
infrastructure?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m certainly not going to speak on behalf of where Senator
Manchin is.  Obviously, he’s spoken to his interest in making historic
investments in infrastructure.  He’s also spoken to his openness to
raising the corporate tax rate.  Those are all positive signs, in our
view.  We’ll let him speak for himself on where he stands on any pieces
of legislation.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Given the concessions that you just outlined that the President has
made so far, should we expect this to be the final round of negotiations
with Senator Capito?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we have to see where the conversations go over the
next day or so.  And we’re certainly not going to prejudge them.  
   
Again, look, the President has come down by approximately a trillion
dollars.  We’ll see where the conversation goes when he has the
opportunity to speak with Senator Capito.  And there are a number of
paths where we can move these ideas forward at the same time.  
      
Q    You mentioned your support for this markup that’s happening on
Wednesday.  Is that a signal — should we read this as some kind of
signal to your Republican counterparts that you are ready to go at this
alone?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think it’s only just a statement of what’s happening as a
bill becomes a law, which is that a leader in the House is moving
forward with marking up a piece of legislation that has quite a bit of
overlap with the American Jobs Plan the President proposed.   
   
So, the time is not unlimited here, as we’ve stated from the beginning,
nor is the President’s willingness to compromise.  He has areas where he
wants to see greater investment.  He made clear that the proposal — or
the offer put on the table didn’t meet his own bar, but we’re very open
to where the discussion goes from here.  And he’s looking for the opp- —
looking forward to the opportunity to talk with Senator Capito, as well
as others who may come forward with ideas about how to move this
forward.  
   
Q    And just one more on this, sort of, big picture.  Secretary
Buttigieg had said that, you know, by today, you had hoped to see a
clear path on infrastructure.  Do you have a sense that there is an
emerging clear path?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have several paths.  That’s the good sign.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is there a new deadline that the President has set for progress on
infrastructure?  I know there — you know, there was Memorial Day; now
you’re outlining a few different paths.  Is there a time in which he’s
going to make a decision about which one he’s going to take, given the
deadline keeps moving?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first of all, what we said is, by Memorial Day, we
would hope to have a sense of where it looked like moving forward, and
we do.  We have a couple of paths forward.  We don’t know what the end
outcome will look like, as you typically don’t as a bill is moving its
way to becoming law.   And there are several paths forward as I’ve
noted, so we’re going to continue to work on all of those lines.  
   
I would also note that Speaker Pelosi has said she wants to move forward
with legislation on infrastructure in the House in June.  That’s exactly
what’s happening here.  Leaders — Leader Schumer said he wants to move
forward in July.  Again, the House and Senate can be on different
timelines and pathways.  
   
Q    And then, just a quick follow-up on the voting rights.  Did Manchin
give the White House a heads up that this op-ed would be coming out? 
Did you guys have any sense of how firm his position was on this
legislation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just not going to get into any channels of private
conversation with Senator Manchin or any other senator.  
   
Q    And then, just on the Vice President: Obviously, you know, last
week, the President said that she was going to take a leadership role in
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — in voting rights.  Democrats have warned that if, you know, if
Washington doesn’t take action, that the midterms will be quite
difficult given the changing voting laws.  Is there going to be a more —
you know, are we going to see signs of more urgency from the White House
about taking action on voting rights?  Obviously, the President has had
a lot of lawmakers in the Oval Office to talk about infrastructure. 
Will we see more signs of an increasing focus on trying to make progress
on voting rights?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  But I would also note that, early on in the
presidency, the President signed into law an executive order that put in
place a number of positive steps forward on voting rights, something —
an action he could take without Congress.  We’ve also empowered the
Department of Justice, of course, to take actions to implement some of
these policies.  So, we’re not waiting.   
   
I would also note that the fact that he asked his Vice President — well,
or he — they agreed, I should say, since it was her ask — but that she
would lead this effort moving forward tells you what a significant
priority it is for this White House.  
   
As you know, she’s currently on a trip to the Northern Triangle.  She’ll
be back, and I’m certain you’ll hear more from her soon.  
   
Go ahead, Phil.  
   
Q    Voting rights, Jen.  Back on voting rights, real quick.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ll go to you next, April.  I promise.  I’m just jumping
around so I don’t forget.   
   
Go ahead, Phil.  
   
Q    I just have a bigger picture one, and then one more to drill down
on infrastructure.  What’s the President’s message, or what’s your
message to Democrats, particularly progressives who’ve started to get a
little bit antsy that, you know, the window is closing; we went through
this back in 2009; it’s time for us to move; it’s not just
infrastructure — if you don’t move infrastructure, the rest of the $4
trillion agenda doesn’t move either?  What’s — how does the President,
kind of, calm that down, if he does?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think — I think his message is: He remains absolutely
committed to moving forward with a historic investment in
infrastructure, and also to put — pushing forward the American Families
Plan that will help level the playing field, lift up the next generation
of workers, ensure there is universal pre-K and access to free community
college.   
   
These are all initiatives that he has a commitment to moving forward
on.  And part of the discussion, which we talked about a little bit last
week, is also about tax reform and ensuring there’s a way to pay for a
range of these ideas.  It’s not that one is assigned by a blood oath to
one piece of — you know, one piece of the agenda is assigned to one
piece of a payfor.   
   
There’s opportunity to move forward with several components of the
President’s agenda.  We do have time.  We’re not going — we’re not using
the timeline of the Affordable Care Act as a model here, Phil.  But as
you know, and anyone here knows, it takes time to move these things
forward, to get Democrats on board, to get Republicans on board.   
   
Ultimately, we’re looking to have enough of a coalition to move forward
on these bold, historic ideas, and we obviously don’t have that at this
moment, but we’re working toward that.   
   
Q    And then, just to drill down a little bit on the — on June 9th
markup.  I mean, this is Surface Transportation package.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    It doesn’t have — most Republicans are cool to it right now.  Can
you elaborate how that is a pathway — a viable pathway forward, given
you’re looking for a bipartisan pathway right now?  Or, kind of, what
the thinking is behind that markup in that piece of legislation.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s important to note, primarily, because it
has a great deal of overlap with the American Jobs Plan, and certainly
it provides an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to vote to
support a historic investment in infrastructure.  Obviously, a markup is
just the beginning stage of the process; there’s some time to go.  But
it’s important to note because it is a piece of legislation that’s
moving its way forward, even as these negotiations are continuing.   
   
Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    And you said you’d come back to me next.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, I’m sorry.  April, you’re right.  I’m sorry.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Yes.  Back on the issue of voting rights: You said the President
issued some executive orders on voting rights, but they don’t deal with
the issue of Shelby vs. Holder 2013 when it comes to preclearance.  So
how do you equate that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I wasn’t intending to equate it.  The question earlier
was broadly about voting, right?  It was not about whether or not it’s
essential to move forward with legislation that would make voting more
accessible, ensure that everyone knew that every vote was counted.   
   
I think it’s important to know and understand: The President doesn’t
feel that, you know, the John Lewis Voting Act — Voting Rights Act is a
replacement for the For the People Act, and that it is necessary to move
forward with more than that.   
   
Q    And a follow-up on that: Tomorrow, Joe Manchin is meeting — it’s
reported he’s meeting with civil rights leaders, civil rights leaders
who pretty much align themselves with this administration.  What are
your hopes?  Because, I mean, they seem like they could be your last
hope — if there is any hope – to move him on his opposition against the
For the People Act.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, look, I don’t know that I can speak to a meeting that
has no member of the administration as participating in, April.   
   
But I can tell you that the President is going to continue, and as are
members of this administration who’ve been leading this effort — from
Susan Rice to Cedric to anyone who’s at the highest level, and,
obviously, to the Vice President, when she returns from her trip — to
advocating for a path forward on how we can ensure that everyone knows
their vote counts, that we make voting more accessible, that we make it
easier and not harder.  Those are fundamentals.   
   
The President, the Vice President, and other members of the
administration will be open to, eager to have that discussion with
anyone who wants to be constructive in that, moving forward.  
   
Q    Are you hopeful that his heart will change?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to make a prediction about Senator Manchin’s
position on an issue.  I’d point you to him to speak to that.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    On the same topic: Could you speak more to the actual argument that
Senator Manchin was making, which was less about the content of the For
the People Act and more about the fact that it doesn’t have bipartisan
support and that being behind it would be wrong for that reason alone?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the President’s view continues to be that
making voting easier for people, making it easier to vote, ensuring
people have access to that fundamental American right should be
something that Democrats and Republicans all support.  And he certainly
will continue to advocate for that.   
   
I don’t know that I have more of a comment on Senator Machin’s
position.  I would point you to his spokespeople for that.  
   
Q    And then, given the fact that we’ve been talking about how a bill
becomes a law, if he’s against the For the People Act, does that mean
that for all intents and purposes — at least for right now — it is
dead?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m certainly not going to make that prediction.  As you
know, there can be many ups and downs of legislation moving forward. 
And as I noted earlier, he’s been — the President has been clear he’s
willing to work with anyone to enact commonsense reforms that benefit
the American people, that make it easier to vote.  He’ll have those
discussions with Democratic leadership, and we’ll work together on what
the path forward looks like.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  On COVID-19 origins: China has basically already said
they think their part in an international investigation is done.  So,
why is Jake Sullivan still here saying he thinks it’s possible that
they’re going to provide the preliminary data at some point?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I don’t think we just give up that easily.  We are
going to continue to press — in coordination with the international
community — China to be transparent, to be forthcoming with data and
information.  We’re not going to just stand by and accept that they’ve
said they’re not going to participate.   
   
Now, at the same time, as you know, we’re also launching our own review
and our own process.  And I’m certain this will be a topic of discussion
as the President goes overseas this week.  
   
Q    And when you say that the White House is going to continue to
press, what is that — what is that?  What is  
“pressing”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well —  
   
Q    What are you doing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay —  
   
Q    No, sorry.  I just mean like what — what mechanisms —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What steps are we taking to press?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  We are engaging, certainly, at the highest levels,
and we’ll continue to do that, whether it’s the Secretary of State or
other leaders who engage on — through national security, diplomatic
conversations.  And we will continue to work through the WHO and also
with our international partners to exert that pressure and ensure that
we’re all going to keep pressing for them to release underlying data and
participate in the second stage of this investigation.   
   
Q    And then, just quickly, a housekeeping thing: Presidents Bush,
Obama, and Trump all commemorated D-Day anniversaries on D-Day — on the
D-Day anniversary.  Why didn’t President Biden?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can tell you that, certainly, the value — his value
for the role that men have — the men who served on D-Day, and the memory
of them — the families who have kept their memories alive over the
course of years on this day — is something the President has spoken to
many, many times in the past.  It’s close to his heart.  And I wouldn’t
be surprised if there’s more we would have to say on it.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, I know you said you don’t want to read out any private
conversations —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — but it certainly seems like the President and Senator Manchin are
sending messages to one another in the public.  You had the President,
last week, expressing some frustration about — you didn’t name him, but
senators in his party who vote with the other side.  You have the op-ed
from Senator Manchin this weekend.   
   
Are these two men on the same page?  Does the White House feel like it
understands and knows what Senator Manchin wants out of this,
particularly these infrastructure talks?  And can you say when — how
often these two have been speaking with one another — if not in person,
by phone?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can certainly tell you that the President and senior
members of the administration are in close touch with Senator Manchin
and his team about infrastructure and about a range of issues where
there is an opportunity to work together, moving forward.   
   
I’ll also note that I’m pretty sure Senator Manchin is pretty proud of
his independent streak.  And he made clear he took no offense to the
President’s comments last week.  
   
And he also noted — I think over the weekend — that West Virginia
doesn’t usually get this much attention, so maybe it’s a — you know,
that’s something he doesn’t seem to mind too much.  
   
Q    Does the President see Senator Manchin as potentially an obstacle
to his agenda?  If he follows through on not backing changes to the
filibuster, not wanting to pursue infrastructure through reconciliation,
that pretty much grounds the President’s domestic agenda.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re certainly not ready to accept that — that
analysis.  
   
I will say the President considers Senator Manchin a friend.  He knows
that they may disagree on some issues, as they do on this particular
piece of legislation.  He’s going to continue to work with him, reach
out to him, engage with him directly and through his staff on how we can
work together moving forward.   
   
Q    On the issue of healthcare, you mentioned the video of President
Obama and President Biden over the weekend.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    One of the remaining Supreme Court decisions we’re waiting on deals
with the Affordable Care Act.  Can you talk about the White House’s
preparation for that decision — what we would expect to hear from the
White House if they strike down the former President’s signature law?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly.  Well, “reunited and it feels so good” for the
Vice President and former President.  Who — someone — someone gets this
in here.  Hey.  (Laughter.)  So, even a full room, no laughs.  Okay.  
   
Look, I will say that this is one of the roles that Neera Tanden, who
has come in as a policy advisor, is playing — is planning for what the
contingencies are.   
   
As you well know, we don’t know what day this is going to come out or
what the outcome is going to look like.  And what we are staying rooted
in is our fundamental view — the fundamental view of the President and
the Vice President that the American people deserve access to affordable
care — healthcare; we should continue to improve and build upon the
Affordable Care Act.  And that’s how we’re planning for.  
   
But, you know, there’s a range of options.  I’m sure when we know the
outcome, we can — we can speak to that more directly.  
   
Go ahead, Andrew.  
   
Q    Thank you.  So, you answered a number of questions about voting
rights and people casting their votes.  I wanted to ask you about
counting the votes.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    A number of the bills that have passed Republican legislatures and
are pending before Republican legislatures take the voting and the
counting of votes and the running of elections out of the hands of
nonpartisan officials and put them in the hands of Republican state
legislatures.  This is what Donald Trump wanted done during the runup to
when Congress certified President Biden’s victory.  This is what a lot
of scholars are saying Republicans as a whole are preparing to do in the
event Democrats win close elections in 2022 and 2024.  
   
The For the People Act does not address the issue of counting the votes
and rigging or ignoring the counting of votes if a Democrat wins.  How
much of a concern is this to the President?  And what — what’s he going
to do to highlight this and find a solution?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Andrew, it’s a really important issue to raise.  And
as you’ve noted, there are pieces of legislation — putting the federal
effort aside — that are moving their way through state legislatures,
which would make it part- — a partisan — in some scenarios, in some
cases, put the hands in the power of a partisan decision-making body or
individual.  And clearly that’s concerning.   
   
We noted in the announcement about the Vice President’s role — is that
her effort would be focused partially on federal legislation and moving
that forward, seeing what path — the path looks forward — looks like
moving forward, but also working with voting rights groups, working with
state activists, working with others to see how we can address these
challenges.  
   
It is a priority.  It is a focus.  And again, the President’s
fundamental view is that it should be easier to vote, not harder, and
that we should ensure that everybody knows their vote is counted.  
   
Q    Would the President support Congress amending the Electoral Count
Act?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — I’m happy to see if there’s any specific statement of
administration policy we have on that particular piece.  
   
Go ahead, Francesca.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  With the President leaving the country on Wednesday,
is that the cutoff time for talks with Senator Capito’s group?  Or is he
advising staff, while he’s gone, to continue negotiations with those
Republican senators?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would expect, certainly, things will continue.  We
don’t know, again — we’ll see what the conversation looks like when the
President speaks with Senator Capito today or tomorrow.  
   
But either way, the President will certainly empower, as he has, his
Jobs — Jobs, you know — Jobs Cabinet to continue to engage directly with
members of Congress and leaders to continue to move his agenda
forward.   
   
The other piece of good news is that any White House is pretty well
practiced in continuing to operate and work on domestic issues while
they’re traveling overseas.  And I expect the President will remain
engaged on the American Jobs Plan, even as he’s overseas meeting with a
number of global counterparts.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Sorry, and I have a quick follow-up.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    How about Senator Romney?  Is he one of the Republicans that you’ve
alluded to that the President and the White House are also having
conversations with?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He has — Senator Romney has spoken publicly about his
interest in engaging, so certainly he’d be a person we’d be happy to
have that conversation with.  And there are certainly others as well.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  If I can go to the Vice President’s trip to the
Northern Triangle states for a minute.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    What’s different about these announce- — this announced initiative
that just landed in our inbox from the Justice Department, especially
from what was already announced with Homeland Security a few weeks ago
in terms of anti-smuggling, anti-trafficking?  Is that just to give the
Vice President something to point to today, given that there isn’t going
to be additional aid announced in the Northern Triangle?  
   
And one more thing.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    How do you respond to criticism from experts, as well as the
administration’s own border officials, who say that the Title 42 policy
is actually contributing to and exacerbating smuggling and trafficking
at the border — with people trying again and again, taking more
dangerous routes, kidnappers literally waiting at ports of entry?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I have not seen what the Department of Justice
just announced, so I’d have to take a look at that.  
   
I will say that the purpose of the Vice President’s trip is to meet
directly with counterparts in these countries to discuss how we can work
together on reducing the number of people who want to make the journey
to our border.  
   
And what — in terms of the due outs of that, of what will be announced,
I will certainly leave that to her team to announce on the ground, but
that’s broadly the purpose.  
   
But — go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    And, sorry, one more.  Jake just said that — in regard to
Francesca’s question about the travel restrictions in Europe, he said
that the administration is going to be following the science, following
the public health experts.  
   
There was reporting over the weekend that CBP has now been told twice
that the Title 42 policy was going to be lifted in March and in May.   
   
There’s also reporting that part of the Vice President’s trip is pushing
Mexico to take back more migrants and asylum seekers who are expelled
from the U.S.  
   
You’ve got public health experts, including at the CDC, saying it serves
no health — public health purpose.   
   
So, all of this seems to indicate that it’s not actually about public
health; it’s about immigration and political optics.  So how do you
respond?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, actually, what Jake was referring to is the overall
guidance by the CDC.  And there may be individuals who have different
points of view — we certainly understand that — within the CDC or other
places, but we’re talking about what the overarching recommendation is
from leadership and through their own thorough process.  So that’s what
Jake was referring to.  
   
Q    And then, a sense of timeline on — on those restrictions on the
southern border?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any sense of the timeline on that quite yet.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  To meet the President’s goal of 70 percent of
Americans vaccinated by July 4th, there needs to be about 4.2 million
adults per week vaccinated.  Last week, there were 2.4 million,
indicating a slowdown in the number of vaccinations.  Is there any
concern that the President’s goal will come close — high 60s — but not
meet 70?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say we expected a little bit of a
slowdown because of the holiday, but it is — there’s no question it’s a
bold and ambitious goal.  It’s one of the reasons that we launched this
“Month of Action” to ensure that we were using every tool at our
disposal to push these numbers.   
   
I’ll also note that, regardless of where we are on July 4th, we’re not
shutting down shop.  On July 5th, we’re going to continue to press to
vaccinate more people across the country.  
   
So, what we’re looking at — just a couple more things here — are a
couple of factors.  One, there’s a difference in data, as you all know,
as it relates to age.  Right?  So over — people who are over 40 have a
much higher percentage of vaccination than people under 40.  So,
clearly, some of our focus needs to be on people under 40 for this
period of time and this push.  We’ve also looked at the fact that there
are about 12 or 13 states who’ve already met this 70 percent marker.  
   
So, we’re going to continue to push through the finish line, through the
red tape here — not the finish line — through the red tape, to July
4th.  But I can’t make a prediction weeks ahead of time where we will
be; we’re just going to use every — every tool at our disposal to get
there.   
   
Q    And then one more on voting rights.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Where does the President feel the Vice President can best be used? 
I know that her office has made an emphasis that this legislation is
only one little piece — not little; it’s huge — but only one piece of
her work on voting rights.  
   
So does he see her as somebody who can be out in the country drumming up
support, you know, alongside civil rights groups and private
corporations?  Like where does he see her strengths as a politician
fitting into this issue?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, all of the above.  And as she noted in her statement
when this was announced, she intends to be engaged with voting rights
groups and community activists, with leaders and states — as well as on
the federal level.  
   
And I think the important component of that or the important note of it
is, even as we’re continuing to move — or press and advocate for
legislation on a federal level, there are other areas where we can have
an impact.  I expect when she gets back from her trip, we’ll hear more
from her on this.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    I wanted to get a point of clarification on an earlier question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    So, as it relates to the Supreme Court in the healthcare case, does
that mean that the White House is starting to think about plan B
legislation in the event that a plan B legislative path is necessary?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, I think we are — Neera Tanden, again, is leading
this effort, and we are planning for a range of contingencies of what
the outcome might look like.  But I’m not going to outline that quite
yet.   
   
Q    And on the surface transportation bill that you mentioned —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — working its way to the House, is that a signal that the White
House and the President is okay with sort of breaking up these proposals
into little bits and kind of just getting what you can get along the way
over a much longer period of time than maybe this June and July grand,
sort of, legislative path that the Democrats are on?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’s always been quite open to a range of mechanisms for his
bold ideas moving forward.  So, certainly, that’s been his approach from
the beginning and continues to be what his view is on mechanics.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you.  
   
Q    Real quick, can —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me — Brian, you got a question before.  So let me — I’m
going to abide by Josh here, but let me just do like two in the back
because there’s new people here who haven’t — who have not asked any
questions.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I want to ask you a couple on infrastructure.  Your
statement that you put out on Friday afternoon — you said that the
President indicated that the offer did meet his objectives to grow the
economy, tackle the climate crisis, and create new jobs.  
   
On the climate crisis component, can you outline what the President
believes needs to be in an infrastructure package in a bipartisan deal
on the climate front?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what that is a reference to is investment in
areas like EV buses and EV charging stations and some of the components
that are essential to investing in industries of the future and ensuring
that we’re creating millions of jobs while also doing it in a way that
protects our climate.   
   
Q    So those are must-haves?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not outlining must-haves here; I’m outlining what the
President would like to see more of in a piece of legislation.   
   
Okay.  Let’s do one more.  Last, in the — right there.  Right behind the
green shirt, green sleeves.  Yes, go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  I wanted to ask you, going back to the tax proposal from
over the weekend — part of that was talking about the — where large
multi- — multinational corporations are taxed.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Do you have an estimate at this point of what that would look like
for revenue for the U.S.?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of the components the President put forward in his propos- —
or which piece?  Sorry.  The global minimum tax or the —  
   
Q    The other part of it, what the President —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The bookend — the book ta- — yes.  It’s in our — it’s in our
budget.  It’s outlined in detail in our budget, which is public.  I’m
sure we can get that to you after the briefing.  
   
Thanks everyone so much.  Let’s do this again tomorrow.  
   
Q    Jen, real quick: Can you all set a deadline for when you’ll get a
grant coalition together?  Have you set one for yourself?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think somebody asked a similar question.  
   
Q    Yeah, but it wasn’t answered.  That’s why I asked.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ll see you tomorrow.  
   
1:43 P.M. EDT
