title: Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on the National Strategy
  for Countering Domestic Terrorism
---
 
Via Teleconference

(June 14, 2021)

7:06 P.M. EDT  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hello, everybody.  This is \[senior
administration official\].  Thank you very much for making time to talk
tonight as we approach the release of the first National Strategy for
Countering Domestic Terrorism tomorrow morning.   
   
As you’ll recall, President Biden indicated that we would be releasing
this strategy in his remarks in Tulsa recently.  And so what I’m going
to give you tonight is a sense of how we have done this work and what
the main lines of effort are in the national strategy that will be
released tomorrow.   
   
Since January 20th, the President has focused on addressing the elevated
threat of domestic terrorism.  And he has been equally focused on
ensuring that our efforts to counter it take place within the context of
upholding American civil rights and civil liberties.  Those are the very
freedoms that make us unique.  
   
He has discussed this issue many times with key Cabinet members,
including with Attorney General Garland, Homeland Security Secretary
Mayorkas, Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of State Blinken, and
others.  And he has emphasized the necessity to conduct this work in a
way that never undermines those freedoms, those values, and those legal
guardrails.   
   
In order to get objective and fast at — in order to get an objective and
fact-based review of the threats that we face, President Biden tasked
the intelligence and law enforcement communities during his first week
in office to produce a comprehensive assessment of today’s domestic
violent extremist threat.  The goal underpinning that assessment was to
establish a factual basis about the risk that domestic terrorists pose
upon which we could then formulate a strategy and an implementation plan
for countering domestic terrorism.   
   
An unclassified summary of that baseline study was released in March,
and it found that domestic violent extremists, motivated by a range of
ideologies, pose an elevated threat to our country in 2021, with
racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists — and specifically
those who espouse the superiority of the white race — and
anti-government militia violent extremists posing the most lethal
threat.   
   
Further, it found that violent extremists to promote the superiority of
the white race have the most persistent transnational connections and
may be in frequent contact with violent extremists abroad.   
   
However, it’s important to underscore that the study provided to us by
ODNI did not find a robust nexus between domestic terrorism and foreign
actors.  This is largely today an inside-out problem, not an outside-in
problem, although we do know that our adversaries are seeking to sow
divisions in our society.   
   
The strategy, which builds upon this fact-based assessment, seeks to
organize U.S. government efforts to counter domestic terrorism into four
pillars.  This overarching goal is the prevention, disruption, and
deterrence of domestic terrorism.   
   
What I’ll do now is outline for you the main lines of effort in these
four pillars.   
   
The first pillar seeks to understand and analyze and share
domestic-terrorism-related information.  It builds directly off of the
ODNI threat assessment that I described.  Our goal is to enhance
domestic terrorism analysis and improve information sharing throughout
law enforcement at the federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial
level, and where appropriate with private sector partners.   
   
The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has
implemented a new system to methodically track domestic terrorism cases
nationwide.  The Department of State, as well as the intelligence and
law enforcement communities, will continue to learn more from foreign
partners about the international dimensions of this threat.  
   
Pillar two involves the prevention of domestic terrorism recruitment and
mobilization to violence.  Drawing on the expertise of a variety of
federal departments and agencies, we will work with communities to help
them become more resilient to prevent individuals from ever reaching the
point of committing terrorist violence.  To do this, we’ll be
strengthening domestic terrorism prevention resources and services.   
   
For the first time, the Department of Homeland Security has designated
domestic violent extremism as a national priority area within the
Department of Homeland Security grant program.  And that means that more
than $77 million will be allocated to state and local and other partners
to prevent, protect against, and respond to domestic violent
extremism.   
   
In addition, the Department of Defense is incorporating training for
servicemembers separating or retiring from the military, who may
potentially be targeted by those who seek to radicalize them.   
   
We will work to improve public awareness of federal resources to address
concerning or threatening behavior before violence occurs.  And on that,
I would just note that one of the things we’re talking about is the need
to do something in this space, like the “See something” — “If you see
something, say something” concept that has been promulgated previously
by DHS.  This involves creating contexts in which those who are family
members or friends or co-workers know that there are pathways and
avenues to raise concerns and seek help for those who they have
perceived to be radicalizing and potentially radicalizing towards
violence.   
   
We will also be (inaudible) efforts to address online terrorist
recruitment and mobilization to violence through increased information
sharing with the technology sector and through the creation of
innovative approaches to fostering digital literacy and building
resilience to terrorist recruitment and mobilization.   
   
One of the principal tools now at our disposal is our decision to join
the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent
Extremist Content Online.  This is an international partnership between
governments and technology companies that works to develop new solutions
to eliminating terrorist content online while safeguarding the freedom
of online expression.  The previous administration had decided against
participation in this important endeavor, and we determined that it was
in our interest to join it and to work collaboratively with countries
that share our values and the private sector in countering these
pernicious developments in which online platforms are used to promote
radicalization and violence.   
   
Pillar three involves the disruption and deterrence of domestic
terrorist activity.  The work of federal law enforcement, as well as our
state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners, is
critical to countering domestic terrorism.  The U.S. government will
increase support to these law enforcement partners in addressing
domestic terrorism nationwide.   
   
U.S. attorney’s offices and FBI field offices across the country have
formally made domestic terrorism a top priority and are tracking
comprehensively domestic-terrorism-related cases, reallocating or
requesting appropriate funding and resources as needed to target the
threat.  That includes over $100 million in additional resources for the
Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security
that are included in the President’s fiscal year 2022 budget to ensure
that we have the analysts, investigators, prosecutors, and other
personnel, and resources that we need to thwart domestic terrorism and
bring domestic terrorists to justice when the law has been broken. 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement will have access
to increased intelligence sharing and training on domestic terrorism and
associated threats as well.  
   
Within the federal government, we have a special responsibility to
ensure that we address the possibility of insider threats, especially
among those who have the opportunity to be working in law enforcement or
in the military.  The Office of Personnel Management will consider
updates to the forms used to apply for sensitive roles in the federal
government that could assist investigators in identifying potential
domestic terrorism threats.   
   
The Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Homeland Security
Department are similarly pursuing efforts to ensure that domestic
terrorists are not employed within our military or law enforcement
ranks, and that they improve their screening and vetting processes.     
   
Training and resources will be developed for state, local, Tribal, and
territorial law enforcement partners, as well as for sensitive private
sector partners, to enable them to enhance their own employee screening
program and to prevent individuals, who pose domestic terrorism threats,
from being placed in positions of trust.   
   
The fourth pillar of this strategy involves confronting long-term
contributors to domestic terrorism.  It’s important to recognize that
there are broader efforts that must be pursued in tandem to the work
that we will do specifically to counter the domestic terrorism
challenge.  This work has to happen in parallel to the strategy to
address some of the long-term drivers and enablers of domestic
terrorism, including economic inequality, those who feel left behind by
the 21st century economy, structural racism, and the proliferation of
guns.   
   
That is work that will be data across our administration over the years
of our time in service and will be an essential contributor to the
outcomes that we seek on this front.   
   
So with that, I’m going to hand the mic over to \[senior administration
official\] and ask if he has any additional remarks that he wants to
make before we open this up to questions.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, thank you.  I appreciate people
joining and I’ll hand it back to \[senior administration official\] to
facilitate questions.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  We can turn it back over to the
moderator now for Q&A.   
   
Q    Hi, there.  Thanks so much for having the call.  Hopefully you can
hear me.  I wanted to — so, a couple of questions.  One, you mentioned
the request the Biden administration has made through the budgetary
process.  I mean, is this strategy basically acknowledging that the
federal government does need to hire, recruit, you know, additional
investigators, analysts, and prosecutors in order to really combat this
issue?   
      
Secondly, I know there was some talk earlier about potentially examining
the authorities around the no-fly list and adding some extremist groups
to those lists.  Can you provide us an update on that as well?   
   
And then I’m hoping you can just provide a bit more specifics in terms
of the relationship with tech companies.  We often hear that a lot —
that the government is trying to work with social media companies.  What
is being done specifically?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great, thank you for the questions. 
And I’ll take them in order.   
   
To start out, I think what the budget request, as well as the strategy
document, reflects is a sense that this threat is — as the professionals
and experts in our government conveyed in that March assessment and at
other opportunities — is elevated.  That’s their word, not mine.  And
that tackling it means ensuring that we do have the resources and
personnel to address that elevated threat.   
   
That, of course, can’t wait for the process of ensuring that we get
additional resources, recruiting and training individuals; that is
already happening.  And, of course, you see manifestations of that,
including in the pretty extraordinary pace and scope of work done by
investigators and prosecutors in the wake of the January 6 events.   
   
But the sense that this threat is going to remain persistent, that we
will continue to step up and augment our efforts to address it, I think
is captured, in part, by that budget request, by the strategy, and by
the desire to ensure that FBI — as well as broader DOJ and DHS, among
others — have the personnel and resources they need to tackle this
threat specifically, even while addressing international terrorism and
all the other threats they’re charged with protecting Americans from.  
   
On your second question: The strategy will have a brief mention of the
sort of watch-listing issue that you flagged.  I’ll say that the
strategy and our work under it leaves in place preexisting law and
preexisting policy in this area while clarifying what its implementation
means in light of the current threat environment.   
   
Now, what I mean by that is this: When individuals who meet the existing
standards — meaning, known or suspected terrorists with international
connectivity — when they meet those standards, they will be considered
for appropriate watch-listing, regardless of their ideology.   
   
That’s the goal here, is being ideologically neutral.  And those who
pose a threat to public safety and air travel, or other forms of public
safety, meet the relevant thresholds, whatever their particular
political motivation, ideological motivation might be — we want to
ensure we’re offering the necessary protection from the threat they
might pose.  
   
That ideological neutrality is being carried across the watch-listing
enterprise while also leaving in place the sort of mechanisms for anyone
who believes an error has been committed — the redress procedures
available to individuals in appropriate circumstances to seek a
correction if they believe one is appropriate.   
   
Finally, you asked about tech companies, and it’s an important part of
the strategy because a great deal of the relevant recruitment,
radicalization, mobilization to violence does happen online.  Again,
that’s not me saying that; that’s the experts and professionals who
assessed that in that March 2021 report assessment and continue to
assess that.   
   
So, there are a number of ways in which we’re trying to augment our
efforts to get at that challenge.  One is by enhancing, augmenting the
information-sharing the government does with tech companies so as to
facilitate their more assertive voluntary enforcement of their terms of
service on their platforms to protect other users from those who might
pose threats of violence.   
   
We, as a government, see different things from what any particular tech
company might see.  Any particular tech company often knows its own
platform very well.  But the government sees things — actually, threats
of violence — across platforms.  They see the relationship between
online recruitment, radicalization, and violence in the physical
world.   
   
And so, helping to illuminate these threats is a process that has
already begun between the government and the tech sector.  And it will
continue, again, specifically on this issue set, given the priority
we’re placing in addressing it.   
   
The second piece of this is, as \[senior administration official\]
mentioned, our recent endorsement of the Christchurch Call.  That forum
allows us to leverage other governments that share our concerns in this
area, as well as our commitment to free expression online in addressing
some of these challenges with tech companies, and doing so with civil
society stakeholders fully integrated into the conversation.   
   
And then the third piece I’ll flag in this area — and this gets
mentioned in the strategy as well — is fostering programming that can
build digital literacy and other forms of resilience to domestic
terrorist recruitment online and, frankly, other forms of malicious
content online that bad actors deliberately try to disseminate.   
   
You’ve seen this in DHS’s recent call for grant proposals where they
specifically invited digital literacy programming.  And you’ll see other
efforts in this area to try to help build that digital fitness across
the (inaudible).   
   
Q    Thank you very much for doing this.  The strategy mentions that the
Defense Department is reviewing it and updating its definition of
“prohibited extremist activities.”  So we’re clear: Does that mean the
Defense Department is looking into whether participating in an extremist
group is grounds for separation?  Because right now, simply being a
member of, say, a white supremacist group is not enough to get a service
member involuntarily separated.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks for the good question. 
And, obviously, the Defense Department has really shown a lot of
leadership on this, starting early in this administration, to ensure
that those critical and sensitive positions — positions of trust that
service members and others within the Defense Department hold — can’t be
abused or exploited for the sort of nefarious purposes that domestic
terrorists would like to see them exploited for.   
   
So, as the strategy indicates, they are relooking at a number of things,
and one of those is the one you rightly flag, which is how they
understand — quite literally how they define “extremism” for these
purposes.  They are working that quite hard, both as a policy matter
with the security experts and with lawyers at the Defense Department and
elsewhere, to ensure they’re doing this in a way they feel ratchets up
the protections but also respects expression and association
protections, again, for service members and for others.   
   
And so, I know that they will have more to say as they complete their
review.  But in a sense, the work — the critical work that they’re doing
through their Countering Extremism Working Group is something of an
implementing arm within the Defense Department for the overall U.S.
government’s strategic approach that you’ll see laid out (inaudible).  
   
Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks for the opportunity.  I wonder if you could talk
a little bit about why this strategy doesn’t take a position on what may
be the biggest public policy question in the domestic terrorism arena,
which is whether there should be a new statute criminalizing domestic
terrorism.   
   
And then, also, could you talk about what is going to be the inevitable
criticism on the right — that this strategy calls for using the tools of
counterterrorism against, essentially, far-right extremists?  Even
though you’re saying it’s going to be ideologically neutral, we’re
already hearing a lot of rhetoric from Republicans and Trump supporters
who fear that that’s not the case.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  On the first question, the President
wanted his Justice Department and his new Attorney General to take a
hard look at the question of whether new authorities are necessary based
on facts and analysis.  And so the strategy request that the Justice
Department review this question and come back to him with a
recommendation — based upon that, we can move forward.   
   
But we concluded that we didn’t have the evidentiary basis yet to decide
whether we wanted to proceed in that direction or whether we have
sufficient authority, as they currently exist at the federal level in
conjunction with possible in all 50 states, to continue as we are
currently organized in the pursuit of prosecution in this arena.   
   
And, \[senior administration official\], I’ll let you answer another.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, sure.  Thanks for the good
questions.   
   
So, on the second: You know, we have been rigorous here in grounding
this work and the work of the experts and the professionals.  Their
threat assessment that guided us in our strategy and policy development
is — that’s part of why we ensured that Congress had that threat
assessment in full when it was delivered in March, and that the public —
including you all, of course — had the opportunity at least to see the
unclassified executive summary, which establishes that this is a real
threat, an elevated threat, in the words of those professionals, and
that therefore formulating a strategy to tackle it makes sense.   
   
And we have been rigorous not just in the crafting of the strategy, but
also in its implementation, which is well underway, in remaining
laser-focused on violence and the threat of violence.  
   
This is a strategy that is agnostic as to political ideology or off the
spectrum.  What matters is when individuals take their political or
other grievances and turn that — unacceptably, unlawfully — into violent
action.  That’s where it comes within the sway of — so, in the document,
that’s where it becomes something that is — deemed domestic terrorism,
it requires the sort of response that cannot only protect public safety,
but in a sense, protect threats to our democratic integrity.  
   
You’ll notice, in the document, that when we list some of the recent
incidents that speak to the elevated threat level, that they come across
the political spectrum.  We acknowledge the shooting at the
Congressional baseball game, the attack on police officers in Dallas,
just as we acknowledge the attack in Charlottesville and the attack on
the Capitol on January 6th.  
   
So, it’s not motivating politics or ideology that matters for us or,
more importantly, for the strategy and implementation; it’s when
political grievances become acts of violence.  And we remain
laser-focused on that, and that’s how we’ll continue.  
   
Q    Hey, guys, thanks very much.  Two questions — one on the Pentagon. 
You talked about how the Pentagon is going to be training for those
departing the military.  The services have resisted some of that
training and some of that acknowledgement that there’s a threat.  Can
you talk about whether you think this strategy overcomes that
resistance, or you think that resistance is lowering?   
   
And then to zoom out a little bit and talk about a question that the
Europeans are asking about the current trip: A lot of experts in this
space say that, you know, there have been people focused on this issue
for years, and they just haven’t had the political top cover in the last
few years.  You’re obviously trying to provide that political top cover
now.  What guarantee can you try and make that that political top cover
will outlast these four years?  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  On the first question: Look, Secretary
Austin has made this a priority, and as you know, the Pentagon is one of
the most disciplined and hierarchical organizations in the world.   
   
And so, the efforts to pursue this in a rigorous way, to develop a plan
that will enable the Department of Defense to ensure that if people are
both, as they are recruited into the military and as they leave the
military, and within those two bounds, when they’re in the military —
that they are people who are worthy of the role of a military member if
— and to, when they leave, are not preyed upon — is something that we
trust that all those who are leading the services will support, if
that’s the direction that the Secretary of Defense asked them to
move.   
   
And on the second: Look, we have based this strategy on hard evidence. 
And what we will continue to do, as I indicated at the outset, is
provide the facts, as they’re developed, to our country, to American
citizens, to understand what we’re up against here and to do our work to
counter, as \[senior administration official\] just said, those who seek
to use violence to achieve their political ends.   
   
And that is going to be a project for us for the foreseeable future and
in which we are investing many agencies of the government and resourcing
them appropriately and asking our citizens to participate.  Because,
ultimately, this is really about homeland security being a
responsibility of each citizen of our country to help us achieve.   
   
And so, we will do our very best in the years that we have in service
and seek to embed this pattern of action and behavior in a way that will
create conditions of public safety and, at the same time, ensure that
people can express their political views as is appropriate in a
democracy.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks.  On page 18 of the strategy document, it talks about
finding ways to identify and analyze financial activity associated with
domestic terrorists, including those through existing provisions of the
Bank Secrecy Act.  I’m curious what specifically would you be doing with
the Bank Secrecy Act.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks for the question.  And,
look, the Treasury Department has, under the Bank Secrecy Act and
otherwise, some important authorities that help them be a part of the
overall U.S. government approach to understanding illicit financial
flows.  That’s something we have tried to bring to bear with respect to
counterterrorism, generally.  It’s been a significant part of how we’ve
made some progress in addressing international terrorist threats, like
al Qaeda and ISIS and others since 9/11.   
   
And as we ensure that we are bringing the full suite of tools — the
appropriate ones — to bear on the domestic terrorism problem, there is,
of course, the possibility that there may be those sorts of financial
flows be identified, and once identified, the possibility they can be
disrupted.   
   
So that is, as with a number of pieces of this strategy, something whose
full impact, I think, we’ll see as we move forward with implementation. 
(Inaudible) emphasize implementation is well underway, but in some ways,
it takes time to see which pieces pay the biggest dividends.   
   
But I think what that is an acknowledgement of in the strategy is the
role that Treasury can help play in identifying when funds are being
used in illicit ways to support this, ultimately, unlawful activity. 
And to the extent that’s determined to be happening, they and law
enforcement have various tools at their disposal to clamp down on
that.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I want to thank you all for joining
us.  We have to hop off now.  Attorney General Garland will speak
tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m.  I hope you’ll be able to tune into his
speech.  And other members of the Cabinet will also be participating in
various events.   
   
So, thanks again, and look forward to talking soon.
