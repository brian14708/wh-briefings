Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Raleigh, NC

3:29 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Today, President Biden is traveling to Raleigh, North
Carolina, where he will visit a mobile vaccination bus and highlight the
ease of getting vaccinated, encourage vaccinations, and mobilize
grassroots vaccine education and outreach efforts.  
   
The President isn’t the only one out today getting the word out about
local efforts to vaccinate more Americans today.  The Second Gentleman
and Dr. Murthy are hosting a press call to highlight new ways the
administration is encouraging young people to get vaccinated, including
new efforts from the private sector targeting young people.  
   
The First Lady and Dr. Fauci are in Florida today visiting an innovative
vaccine sites, including in a drive-through site and one at a hockey
arena that are getting Floridians vaccinated.   
   
And the Vice President is meeting virtually with local community groups
and members that are doing the grassroots work to encourage vaccinations
across the country.  
   
In his remarks, the President will highlight some of the incredible work
North Carolinians are doing to get their community members vaccinated,
Governor Cooper’s commitment to center equity in his COVID response, and
also his administration’s work to get North Carolinians vaccinated.  
   
The President will also remind Americans about the growing threat of the
Delta variant and that the vaccines are effective against the
variants.   
   
Okay.  Zeke, you want to — you want to kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  First, just following up on the President’s
remarks a few minutes ago: Could you clarify what the President said
what — that the — the bipartisan package had to move “in tandem” with
the Democrats-only package?  Is the President saying he will not, under
any circumstances, sign this bipartisan agreement unless Democrat — the
Democrats’ unilateral package also passes?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let me just first say that the American people
wanted to see a compromise.  They wanted to see a government that works
for the people.  And that is what we saw today.  That’s what the
President did.  And compromising means giving in some places, but also
finding common ground.   
   
Ultimately, this does not have a gas tax in it.  It doesn’t have an
electric vehicle tax.  It does not raise taxes of Americans who make
more than — who make less than $400,000.  And this is a big win.   
   
And so, the way that the President sees this is that — we have always
said that the President, in April, had two plans: the American Jobs Plan
and the American Family Plan.  And he has always been clear that he
intends to pass both.  
   
The infrastructure bill contains the core of the American Jobs Plan and
the reconciliation bill will be the vehicle to pass the American
Families Plan.  So, his intention is to make sure that he — we move
forward with both.  
   
Q    But the President said before that one was — that the — the Jobs
Plan necessitated the Families Plan.  Is that the case: He needs the
Families Plan in order to get — in order for him to sign that bipartisan
agreement?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s saying that he wants to do both at the same
time.  That’s what he wants to do.  He wants to make —   
   
Q    So it’s not a red line, though?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I’m going to let his words stand.  And what he is
saying — that he’s not going to give up on his legislative priorities. 
That’s what he said in April.  That’s what he was saying today.   
   
He wants to make sure that infrastructure — this investment, this
historic investment — this agreement that was made today is done. 
Right?  And we should be, you know, celebrating that — the fact that we
got this bipartisanship.   
   
But he also wants to make sure that his investment in people — the
“human investment,” as he has called it — is also done.  Because we have
to make investments that help — that help people down the — down the
line, that does generational investments, and also economic
investment.  
   
Q    Does he still favor —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So that’s his focus.  
   
Q    Sorry to cut in.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no.  It’s okay.   
   
Q    Sorry about that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Does he still favor a corporate tax increase as part of
reconciliation, now that it didn’t make the bipartisan package?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, the one thing I will say is that — like I said,
we’re not going to raise taxes on people who make less than $400,000;
that this is — this is a win.  This — there’s no gas tax.  Right? 
There’s no — any kind of like taxes in that — in that regard.  And so
that’s a big win.   
   
And so, he wanted to make sure that we do not put the burden on the
American people, that these plans pay for itself, and that’s going to be
the focus.  And we’ll have more, and we’ll continue to share when we
have more.  
   
Q    He talked about the Democratic Party being a divided, but a
rational party.  Is President Biden having any conversations today with
Senator Sanders or any of the other members who wanted more in this
bill?  What’s his outreach right now to progressives?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I — I don’t have any meetings to preview or
conversations to preview.  As you know, he’s headed — we’re all heading
to North Carolina today to focus on the importance of getting vaccinated
and making sure that we lift up the work that — that’s being done in
North Carolina today.   
   
But he has a good relationship with Senator Sanders.  They have spoken
multiple times over the last 150 days or so.  And he’ll continue to have
those conversations.   
   
As we know, the President has been all hands — “all-hands-on-deck” on
this.  Right?  He’s had multiple conversations with congressional
members.  He’s had them over in the Oval Office.  His staff — his senior
White House staff has — this week, has been back and forth to the
Capitol, having those conversations.   
   
So, that’s not going to end.  This is the beginning of, I think, this
bipartisan structure — infrastructure framework is a first step to get
to what we need to be doing for the American public, which is making
sure that we invest in them and in their future.  
   
Q    Sure.  And President Biden said he conceded or gave up a lot in
this bill, but technically he’s still going for everything else in the
reconciliation bills.  Did he really give up anything?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let me just say this: This historic bipartisan
infrastructure framework will make life better for millions of
Americans.  Right?  It will create a generation of good-paying jobs and
economic growth; position the U.S. to win the 21st century, including
combating the climate crisis.  
   
As we’ve talked about, the President is committed — again, and I’ve said
this already — to the full legislation agenda, which is including the
care economy, expanding childcare, additional investment in clean
energy, and passing a budget resolution that enacts his legislation
priorities.   
   
So that is his commitment.  And, as we know, when we compromise, you
give up a little; you know, you give a little.  
   
Q    But he didn’t give up anything.  I mean, he’s going to get
everything through — he wants through reconciliation.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But, I mean, he said it himself: There were some
things that, you know, he did give up on.  But, I think the bottom line
is that, that red line that you were talking about — like that — that
was the red line that was not crossed.  Right?  We didn’t — we’re not
rising — raising taxes for people who make $400,000 — less than
$400,000.  And there are no gas tax — tax on this.   
   
So this is a big win.  We have a bipartisanship deal.  This is something
that the President, in many ways, was elected to do, because people —
the American people really believed that he was able to do this, and he
did.  And so we’re going to move forward on that.  
   
Q    Karine, about the vaccination rates and at the event today — so,
given that we’re seeing the vaccination rates in the South and the West
go down, but there’s some COVID cases rising in some of these states, is
the White House worried that some of these July 4th celebrations might
lead to, like, regional surges in the coronavirus — may become a
super-spreader event?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible) every part of the country, we have seen a
dramatic drop in cases.  We’ve seen a drop — dramatic drop in deaths and
hospitaliz- — hospitalizations since we took office.   
   
For vaccinated people, as we all know, it’s safe to see friends and
family with no masks, go to a concert.  You see people going out to
restaurants, weddings even, vacations, or have a Fourth of July party,
which is right around the corner.   
   
But we do see varying vaccination rates across the country.  We will
continue to build trust with local messengers.   
   
These local leaders the President will be highlighting today are mission
critical to the next phase of our work.  Like, we know when the
President — as you all know, when the President travels somewhere, that
local news that they get in that local community is tremendous and is
incredi- — and is incredibly important.   
   
So we’ll continue our vaccinations program as well.  So there’s a shot —
a shot waiting for people when they’re ready.  It’s never been easier to
get vaccinated.  It’s free.  Right?  It’s easy to get.  We have worked
really hard.  The President has worked really hard to make that
happen.   
   
And to reiterate, we are doing everything we can to help states get more
Americans vaccinated.  That’s why the President is in North Carolina
today.   
   
Ultimately, though, this is an individual decision.  This is a personal
decision.  We’ve been clear, and so is the science.  The science is very
clear.  As we know, the Delta variant is contagious and more severe, but
the vaccines protects against it.  So we encourage — every day we can,
we start — we encourage the American people to get vaccinated.  
   
Q    Following up on that, at what point do you concede that the people
who want to get vaccinated have been vaccinated, the people who don’t
want to get vaccinated aren’t going to get vaccinated?  And then what
does that next step look like?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t think we concede that.  I think we have to
make sure, in order to — for us to get back to normal, which we’re
starting to do, we have to make sure that people are getting
vaccinated.  We have to make sure that we’re working with people on the
ground who are those trusted ver- — voices.  And they’re talking to
their neighbors and getting their neighbors vaccinated if they haven’t
been yet.  That’s the only way that we’re going to be able to also fight
these variants that we’re seeing.   
   
So it is in — it is mission critical to make sure that we do all that we
can to get people vaccinated.  That’s what we’ve been doing as an
administration these last 150 days.  
   
Q    Karine, has the President or anyone in the White House watched
General Milley’s comments yesterday on critical race theory or Secretary
Austin’s comments?  And what’s the administration’s view in general on
what the Republicans are saying about the teaching of critical race
theory?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me tell you where we stand.  We — we should
teach our kids the truth: America is a great country, but there have
been some dark chapters in our history.   
   
As the President said in Tulsa, “We should know the good, the bad,
everything.  That’s what a great — that’s what great nations do: They
come to terms with their dark sides.”  Slavery is a part of this
nation’s history, so was the brave work of Black and white Americans and
putting an end to it.   
   
Our children should learn all of our history.  We don’t think
politicians trying to score political points by banning parts of our
history in our classroom is a good thing.  So we trust our teachers to
teach our kids the facts and the truth.   
   
Q    Karine, just quickly, to follow up on Jeff’s in question.  We’ve
already seen some Democrats criticize the framework that the White House
and these senators came up with.  Did the White House brief other
Democrats on this framework before they came out and said they agreed to
it?  And what do next steps look like to make sure that the entire party
is unified on the path forward that the President has laid out?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, like the President said outright: Today’s
agreement is a crucial step forward in realizing the economic agenda for
the American Jobs Plan and the fruition of hard work with both
parties.   
   
This is, you know, the largest — he said this — the largest investment
in public transportation in history.  It will connect every American to
broadband, eliminate lead pipes to stop kids from drinking poisoned
water, and makes critical progress on the climate crisis — including by
making the largest investment in EV infrastructure in history,
investment in clean power infrastructure, clean transportation
infrastructure, and climate resilience.   
   
This is — also amounts to two thirds of the resources the President
proposed in the respective jobs — American Jobs Plan categories.   
   
And as the President also made very clear, on dual tracks, we’re going
full steam ahead for the rest of his Build Back Better Plan — this is
what I was saying earlier: He’s not going to give up on his legislative
agenda — working with the Senate on a budget resolution that includes a
fair tax system for the middle class, human infrastructure, the American
Families Plan and other essential investments.  And we’re going to keep
working together with — with every segment of our party and across the
aisle to get all of this done.  
   
So, we’re going to continue to talk to, you know, Republicans and
Democrats to get this done.  As you know, this bipartisan —
bipartisanship that we came together with was 10 Republicans and 10
Democrats, and so we’re going to continue that work.  
   
Q    Senator Schumer recommended the White House extend student loan
benefits through March this week — the college student loan benefits —
(inaudible), where we’re not paying back the interest.  Is that
something that’s under consideration by the White House?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let me — let me get back and talk to our team.  I
don’t have any update on that right at this moment.  As you know, COVID
really, really hurt many Americans, including students.  And so let me
get back to you on that.  I don’t have any update.  
   
Q    The President is in North Carolina today, and the First Lady is in
Florida.  Did the White House, you know, pick areas that are
particularly under-vaccinated?  Or how did it choose to go to the states
where it’s really kind of ramping up this outreach effort?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  You know, as I said at the top, or as you just
mentioned, you know, members of our administration are blitzing the
country to highlight the efforts — local communities hard work to get
more people vaccinated.   
   
You know, the local efforts are making a difference, you know?  And we —
we are — this is a grassroots operation that we’ve been talking about
for the past couple of weeks.   
   
And so this is incredibly important to have our principals out there. 
Like I said earlier, when they’re there, they get that — you know, they
get the local press there to lift up what they’re doing on the ground. 
And everything that folks are doing on the ground is critical — is
mission critical in getting people vaccinated.  And we have to continue
to make sure we get the word out there and people understand why it’s so
important to get vaccinated, in order to continue to get back to
normal.  
   
Q    Karine, we have the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s visit to the
White House tomorrow.  Can you preview what the President hopes to
accomplish?  Should we expect announcements on security at the Kabul
airport and other — and any updates on the timeline for withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Afghanistan?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So — (Air Force One experiences turbulence) —
it is bumpy.   
   
So, this visit is a — is, first, is — is first about our ongoing
commitment and support to the Afghan people and to the Afghan National
Defense and Security Forces.   
   
As we continue to undertake our security transition, Afghanistan has
experienced a significant COVID outbreak of the Delta variant, and we
will be providing 3 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the
people of Afghanistan to be shipped as soon as next week, pending
logistics.  We are also providing oxygen and other supplies.   
   
The newest COVID support, which is — which is from the tranche of the 55
million doses we announced on Monday, is distinct from the further $266
million in humanitarian assistance Secretary Blinken announced on June
4th.   
   
We are also continuing security assistance through DOD’s Afghan- —
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund to provide financial support to the
Afghan National Army National, Afghan National Police, Afghan Air Force,
and Afghan Special Security Forces, including the special mission
wing.  
   
Congress appropriated over $3 billion to ASFF in 2021, and the President
has requested over $3.3 billion for 2022.  
   
Second, the President will emphasize the need for unity, cohesion, and
for the Afghan government to focus on key challenges Afghanistan
faces.  
   
We will welcome both President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah.  And one of
the important messages we will be stressing is the need for the leaders
to be a united front as they address security and other challenges.  
   
(Air Force One experiences turbulence.)  It’s getting bumpy here.  We’re
about to land.  Here we go.   
   
Third, we will — third, we will emphasize our continuing diplomatic
support for the peace process and for all Afghan parties to engage in
good faith in that process.  
   
Obviously, these are significant challenges to this complex peace
effort, but we believe that a negotiated political settlement is the
best way to end the conflict, and we’ll continue to support those
efforts.  
   
Since 2002, the United States has provided nearly $88 billion in
security assistance; $36 billion in civilian assistance, including $787
million specifically intended to support Afghan women and girls; and
nearly $3.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.  
   
Q    Nothing on the airport that you’re expecting?  Nothing on the Kabul
airport that you know?  No announcements on —  
   
Q    (Inaudible) Erdoğan meeting —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean — so, as far as the security
situation/assessment in general, we are seeing elevated attacks on ANDSF
and Afghan government versus a year ago.  Right?  But no increase in
attacks on our military or presence since February 2020.  
   
We assess that we had not — if we had not begun to draw down, violence
would have increased against us as well after May 1st.  So, the status
quo was not an option.  
   
So, we would also note that the — much of this is Taliban violence, but
some is attributable to other groups, like ISIS-K, that were obviously
not part of any negotiations or engagements, and that the Taliban is
also fighting.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.
