James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:38 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi everyone.  Happy Monday.  Today, we are joined by
Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall and Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and
Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger.   
   
I know you all know who they are, so I’m going to skip the introductions
so we have more time for questions.  We have very limited time, but we
will try to take as many as possible.  
   
So, with that, I’ll turn it over to Liz.  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  It’s great to be with you today.  Thank you,
Jen.  
   
I have an update for you on the Colonial Pipeline and what the Biden
administration is doing to provide assistance through a
whole-of-government effort.  
   
On Friday evening, May 7th, Colonial Pipeline reported that its pipeline
system had been subject to a ransomware cyberattack.  Colonial chose to
shut down its pipeline operations as a precautionary measure and to
ensure that the ransomware could not migrate from business computer
systems to those that control and operate the pipeline.  We’ve been in
ongoing contact with Colonial, and the President continues to be
regularly briefed on the incident and our work.  
   
Colonial is currently working with its private cybersecurity consultants
to assess potential damage and to determine when it is safe to bring the
pipeline back online.  Thus far, Colonial has told us that it has not
suffered damage and can be brought back online relatively quickly, but
that safety is a priority given that it has never before taken the
entire pipeline down.  
   
Beginning on Friday night, soon after we learned of the shutdown, the
White House convened an interagency team that included the Department of
Energy, which is the lead agency for incident response in this case; the
Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency — or “CISA”; the FBI; the Department of Transportation
Pipeline Safety and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration; the
Department of the Treasury; the Department of Defense; and other
agencies.  
   
To give you a sense of what we’ve been doing together since that first
meeting, we have met throughout the weekend.  The Department of Energy’s
Information — Energy Information Agency — or “EIA” — is in contact with
state and local agencies to assess current supply and impacts due to the
shutdown.  
   
DOE has also convened the oil and natural gas and electric sector
utility partners to share details about the ransomware attack and
discuss recommended measures to mitigate further incidents across the
industry.  
   
DHS’s CISA is preparing a release to go to the broader critical
infrastructure community to ensure it has visibility into the ransomware
attack and it’s taking appropriate measures to protect its networks.   
   
Colonial is responsible for safely returning the pipeline to service.   
   
And our role in the federal government is to take proactive steps to
analyze the impacts of the shutdown on the delivery of gasoline, diesel,
and aviation fuel in states that are dependent on the pipeline; and to
identify federal options for alleviating supply shortfalls should they
develop.   
   
For example: To help address potential supply disruptions, the
Department of Transportation issued an hours-of-service waiver
yesterday, which provides greater flexibility to drivers transporting
gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products across
17 states, as well as the District of Columbia.   
   
Right now, there is not a supply shortage.  We are preparing for
multiple possible contingencies — because that’s our job, especially on
the Homeland Security team — and considering what additional steps may
be useful to mitigate any potential disruptions to supply.  
   
This weekend’s events put the spotlight on the fact that our nation’s
critical infrastructure is largely owned and operated by private-sector
companies.  When those companies are attacked, they serve as the first
line of defense, and we depend on the effectiveness of their defenses.  
   
To improve the cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure, the Biden
administration has already launched a high-priority initiative to
collaborate with our private-sector partners to harden our defenses and
to build our nation’s resilience.   
   
And that is a perfect segue to my colleague, Anne Neuberger, our Deputy
National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies.   
   
Thanks.   
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  Thank you, Liz.  Good morning everyone.   
   
So, building on Liz’s comments: As you know, on Friday, Colonial shut,
proactively, its pipeline operations as a precautionary measure to
ensure ransomware would not spread to its sensitive operational
networks.   
   
In response, we’re taking a multi-pronged and whole-of-government
response to this incident and to ransomware overall.   
   
First, we’re actively engaged with the company and offered support as
needed to restore their systems.  Right now, they’ve not asked for cyber
support from the federal government, but we remain available to meet
their cybersecurity needs.   
   
Second, we’re aggressively investigating the incident and its culprits. 
As part of their work today, FBI released a flash alert with indicators
of compromise and mitigation measures once infected.   
   
The FBI identified the ransomware as the DarkSide variant, which they’ve
been investigating since October of last year.  It’s a ransomware as a
service variant, where criminal affiliates conduct attacks and then
share the proceeds with the ransomware developers.  
   
We recommend all critical infrastructure owners and operators use the
indicators that came out in the FBI flash to protect themselves.  And if
other inc- — if other entities are infected, please notify the FBI.   
   
Third, the government is convening stakeholders more broadly to ensure
everybody has the information needed to protect themselves and to
rapidly share information.   
   
This morning, the Department of Energy convened calls with the
electricity and oil and gas sectors to keep them informed.  The
Departments of Energy, Transportation, and DHS, and others will be
sharing further indicators of compromise with the sector Information
Sharing and Analysis Centers — or “ISACs.”  
   
And the Department of Energy will be holding additional calls with
critical infrastructure sector owners as well as state and local leaders
to ensure everyone has the latest information about how to protect
themselves.   
   
Fourth, we’re taking the threats posed by ransomware seriously with
several initiatives.  First, we’ll focus on industrial control systems. 
Critical infrastructure, as Liz noted, in the United States is largely
owned and operated by the private sector, which determines their
cybersecurity protections are applied to their systems.  
   
Under that context, in mid-April, the administration launched a new
public-private initiative to enhance the security of critical
infrastructure systems and improve visibility across their operational
control systems — the systems on which all Americans depend.  
   
The Department of Energy had the lead for the first 100-day sprint
focused on the utility sector, and we will follow with follow-on sprints
with natural gas pipelines, water, and other sectors.  
   
The administration encourages all private-sector owners of critical
infrastructure to focus on improving cybersecurity, and the government
remains open and willing as a partner to support those efforts.    
   
Second: In tackling ransomware, we’re working to disrupt ransomware
infrastructure.  The FBI recently worked with international partners to
disrupt two particular strains of ransomware: the Emotet and NetWalker
strains.   
   
More recently, DOJ has established a ransomware taskforce to ensure it
can better investigate and prosecute ransomware actors.   
   
Third, CISA is leading a counter-ransomware sprint, which is focused on
helping small- and medium-sized companies, who are often the targets of
ransomware, better protect themselves.   
   
Finally, we’re pursuing greater international cooperation — ransomware
affects countries around the world — to address ransomware because
transnational criminals are most often the perpetrators of these crimes
and they often leverage global infrastructure and global
money-laundering networks.  
   
Indeed, to combat the exploitation of virtual currencies that are often
used for payment in ransomware, the U.S. Treasury has also been leading
international efforts, including driving development and adoption of
virtual assets standards under the Financial Action Task Force.  
   
With those updates, I welcome your questions, turning it over to Jen and
Liz.  Thank you for your time today.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Aamer, kick us off.   
   
Q    Thanks.  Just to clarify something: Has Colonial paid any ransom? 
And has there been any advice on that?  
   
And then, secondly, is there any timeline for when Americans should be
certain that this is going to be taken care of?  People are getting
ready — Memorial Day is not that far away, and we’re — everyone is
concerned about their gas prices.  What’s the timeline on when this
thing is going to be under control?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  Absolutely.  I’ll speak to the first, and then I’ll turn
it to my colleague, Liz, for the second.   
   
So, first, we recognize that victims of cyberattacks often face a very
difficult situation.  And they have to just balance off, in the
cost-benefit, when they have no choice with regard to paying a ransom. 
Colonial is a private company, and we’ll defer information regarding
their decision on paying a ransom to them.  
   
Q    Did you — would the administration offer any advice on whether or
not to pay a ransom?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  So, typically, that is a private-sector decision, and
the administration has not offered further advice at this time.  Given
the rise in ransomware, that is one area we’re definitely looking at now
to say, “What should be the government’s approach to ransomware actors
and to ransoms overall?”  
   
Liz.  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  So, on the issue of gas prices: As I indicated,
right now there are no supply disruptions.  And the Department of
Energy’s Information Agency — the “EIA” — is doing the analysis right
now about potential supply disruptions and what price effects that could
have.  And we’re working with other agencies to consider how, if
necessary, we can move supplies to a place where it might be needed if
it turns out that there is a shortfall.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Nandita.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  My question is just a follow-up on what Aamer was
asking.  Has the White House broadly considered advice for companies who
are victimized by — you know, in such incidents going forward?  Is there
any advice that you’re considering when it comes to paying ransom in the
future?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  So that’s a really good question.  The first and most
important advice is: Secure your systems.  In this case, the ransomware
that was used is a known variant.  The FBI has investigated many cases
of this in the past, as I noted, beginning in October.  So the first and
most important thing is to ensure that systems are patched and that
cybersecurity is maintained at the level needed in a given network.   
   
We want to see ransomware not be successful, and that begins with
greater resilience, particularly in critical infrastructure networks.   
   
Q    And another question.  You mentioned perpetrators are usually
transnational criminals.  Do you have any information on whether this
particular incident has any ties to Russia or other Eastern European
criminals?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  At this time, we assess that DarkSide is a criminal
actor, but that’s certainly something that our intelligence community is
looking into.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Josh.  
   
Q    Can I ask a little bit more about DarkSide?  What — what do you
know about them?  Is there any retaliatory measures that have been taken
or are being considered by the U.S.  
in response to this or any investigation?  You mentioned it dates back
to October.  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  Absolutely.  So I mentioned that DarkSide is a
ransomware, is a service variant.  It’s a new and very troubling variant
where it’s essentially provided as a service and the proceeds are
split.  So, in that way, it’s something that we’re particularly troubled
by.   
   
And I mentioned as well that the FBI has recently worked with
international partners to take down and disrupt ransomware
infrastructure.  We expect that that will be a continued focus area to
make it far more difficult for these actors to prey on their victims.  
   
Q    And even though you’re treating it as a criminal act, are you
saying it’s state sanctioned?  Or is there suspicion that it’s state
sanctioned?  Or do you just not — don’t know right now?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  As I mentioned a moment ago, currently we assess
DarkSide as a criminal actor.  But, of course, our intelligence
community is looking for any ties to any nation-state actors.  And if we
find that further information, we’ll look into it further.  
   
Q    But you’re not blaming a particular country right now for
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  No, we are not.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  David.  
   
Q    Thanks very much, both of you, for doing this.  
   
First, Anne, just to clarify what you said on ransomware: The FBI has,
for years, advised people not to pay it.  I didn’t quite hear you say
that, so I wondered whether or not you’re reconsidering the advice the
FBI has given across many administrations.   
   
And both you and Liz both mentioned the concern that the ransomware may
have revealed some kind of data that would then move over to the
operational side or put malware in that could move to the operational
side.  We don’t have a lot of understanding about what that concern
is.   
   
Did you no- — did you see, in the early parts of the investigation, that
there was malware in the IT side that could be moved to operational? 
Was it simply that they froze up their ability to bill and, you know,
move the fuel, which has been one theory, or that they simply learned
information that would allow the ransomware operators to later on be
able to get access to the main operational site?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  Thank you, David.  So I’ll begin and then, of course,
turn it over to Liz if she’d like to add anything.   
   
So, first, thank you for highlighting the FBI has provided advice in the
past that paying a ransom would encourage further ransomware activity
and is so troubling.  We recognize, though, that companies are often in
a difficult position if their data is encrypted and they do not have
backups and cannot recover the data.   
   
And that is why — given the rise in ransomware and given, frankly, the
troubling trend we see of often targeting companies who have insurance
and maybe richer targets — that we need to look thoughtfully at this
area, including with our international partners, to determine what we do
in addition to actively disrupting infrastructure and holding
perpetrators accountable to ensure that we’re not encouraging the rise
of ransomware.  
   
And to your second point regarding the concerns on the connection
between the information technology and the operational technology side
of a network: The operational technology side of the network is the part
that actually drives control of a pipeline, for example, and, as such,
it is the more sensitive part.  The — we are aware that it is the more
significant part.  
   
Colonial was very careful.  And one of the reasons they proactively
chose to shut down the pipeline was because of concerns to manage the
incident and gate the ransomware as quickly as they could.  So —  
   
Q    What I was asking was: Did you see evidence in the malware there
was something that could move to the operational side?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  So the Colonial incident is the private-sector entity
themselves.   
   
That being said, speaking to the ransomware directly, the ransomware
could, of course, infect technology — whether it is on the IT side or,
for example, when there’s Windows-like technology on the OT side.  
   
In this case, I won’t speak to details here because it’s subject to an
investigation and those details are held within that investigation.  But
it certainly is a concern we have in the case of ransomware and why
quickly and effectively gating the spread of the ransomware is always
the first area of priority.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We can do Kelly and Phil.  They got to be quick though
because we have — short timeline.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Can you explain to us if you believe that this — since it’s
criminal, in your judgment now, that there’s a financial motive there —
but do you believe that there was a desire to try to penetrate a kind of
system that has such huge implications for the U.S. economy and so
forth?  And how does that create concern for other kinds of systems: the
electric grid, whatever it might be, other energy companies?  Or was
Colonial just a rich target because they could financially pay,
potentially?  Do you see this as being about the infrastructure more
than just the financial incentive?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  We don’t have further information about the intent of
the perpetrators when conducting the ransomware hack against
Colonial.   
   
However, as you know, ransomware affects broad sectors.  And clearly,
criminals have learned that those sectors — one of the key sectors we
saw during the COVID pandemic was the hospital sector that was affected
by ransomware.  Clearly, we know — we see that criminal actors have
focused on the more vulnerable victims: state and local governments,
schools, critical infrastructure.   
   
And that is why coming up and addressing ransomware with great vigor is
a key priority of the administration, because we’re very concerned about
the growth in ransomware and the impact it has both on small and medium
businesses, as well as the state and local governments in the United
States and around the world.  
   
Q    Thank you, and just two quick ones.  Do you guys consider this
attack ongoing or has the malicious actor been removed?    
   
And then, Anne, just to follow up on something: You said that they have
not — Colonial has not yet asked for cyber support.  Does that create a
problem in terms of your ability to respond or the — just federal
government’s ability writ large to get a grasp or handle on what’s
happened?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  The details regarding the actual incident are being
currently investigated by the FBI.  Colonial has noted in their public
statement that they’ve worked to control the spread of the ransomware
and are actively working to bring back up their network, and they’re at
the remediation phase.  
   
So, we’re happy to see the important progress that they made there. 
And, I’m sorry, what was your second question?  
   
Q    You said that the company has not yet asked for cyber support. 
Does that create a problem for your — the U.S. government’s ability to
respond or get a handle on what’s exactly happening when a private
entity is not requesting support in that capacity?  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  Our goal is ensuring that the support is available so
that any private sector entity who is experiencing a cyber hack can turn
to the government for remediation assistance and technical assistance. 
We judge that the company said that they have adequate support.  And
they noted, in their public remarks, that they’re using a third-party
service, that they feel they’re making adequate progress with their own
resources, and we know we’re standing by.   
   
But that — that is — we’re happy that they are confident in their
ability to remediate the incident and rapidly recover to meet the needs
of their customers in this current environment.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you both so much.  I’m sorry.  They have to run to
another meeting as they go run the world.  
   
MS. NEUBERGER:  Thank you.  
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you both for coming.   
   
DR. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  I know we also have a hard stop because of the
President’s remarks.  Just keeping you busy on a Monday.  
   
Just a couple of other small things at the top.  Tomorrow, President
Biden will meet with a bipartisan group of governors to discuss
innovative — innovative ways governors are working to get the people in
their states vaccinated.  The bipartisan group will share with the
President some best practices on promoting access to vaccination,
building confidence in vaccines, and ensuring that everyone is reached
in the vaccination response.   
   
He will also acknowledge the instrumental role Democrats, Republicans,
and independents have played in the vaccination efforts thus far,
including helping deliver 220 million shots in the first 100 days of his
presidency.  And he will also discuss how this continued partnership
with governors is critical to meeting the goal of achieving 70 percent
of our adult Americans having one shot and 160 million Americans fully
vaccinated by July 4th.  
   
The meeting will include Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Utah
Governor Spencer Cox, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, New Mexico Governor
Lujan Grisham, Maine Governor Janet Mills, and Minnesota Governor Tim
Walz.  
   
Aamer.   
   
Q    Thanks.  Is there any reaction to intensifying clashes in Israel? 
In the last couple hours, it’s just gotten worse.  I know Jake Sullivan
was on the phone over the weekend with his top counterpart.  But is the
President, at this point, getting involved?  Is — what’s the next steps
forward?  And then, if I could just — I know we’re tight on time.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Second question: Any readout on the President’s remarks — the
Bucharest Nine meeting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me start with the first, and then I’ll go to the
second.  We are continuing to closely monitor the violence in Israel. 
We have serious concerns about the situation, including violent
confrontations that we’ve seen over the last few days, as you noted — as
you noted, an escalation earlier today.   
   
You also noted, Aamer, that in a call over the weekend with his Israeli
counterpart, our National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, reiterated
concerns about the potential evictions of Palestinian families from
their homes.  And they agreed that the launching of rocket attacks and
incendi- — incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel is unacceptable
and must be condemned.   
   
So, this is something that our national security team is closely
monitoring, obviously, across government.  Certainly, the President is
kept abreast and is watching closely as well.   
   
And on your second question: This meeting — if we haven’t put out a
readout yet, we will shortly.  Let me give you just a couple of
highlights here that I think I have available.   
   
One moment.   
   
Let’s see here.  Let me work to get that to you shortly after, if I
don’t have it available here.  Ah, here.  Here we go.   
   
So, as Aamer noted, the President spoke today with NATO’s Eastern flank
Allies in a virtual summit hosted by the presidents of Romania and
Poland.  He underscored his commitment to rebuilding alliances and
strengthening transatlantic relationships.  He conveyed his desire for
closer cooperation with our nine Allies in Central and Eastern — Central
Europe and the Baltic and bl- — Black Sea regions on a full range of
issues, including global health, security, climate change, energy
security, and global economic recovery.   
   
And he also expressed his support for enhancing NATO’s deterrence and
defense posture, as well as the importance of Allies increasing their
resilience against harmful economic and political actions by our
strategic competitors.   
   
In addition, he welcomed the opportunity to engage with these Allies, as
well as NATO’s — the NATO Secretary General about Alliance efforts to
meet future threats, which will be discussed at the NATO summit in
June.  
   
And finally, he stressed the importance of strengthening democratic
governance and rule of law at home within the Alliance and around the
world.   
   
Nandita, go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Just a quick follow-up on the Bucharest Nine: Was
the President’s decision to participate in the meeting just, sort of —
was it driven by this desire to show a united front against Russia?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It was a desire to have a part — have a conversation and
have a discussion with some important partners in Central Europe in — in
East- — NATO’s Eastern — with East — NATO’s Eastern flank Allies about a
range of issues, including security, of course, in the region; including
our efforts to address the global health crisis, climate change, energy
security.   
   
This group was gathering — or they had a pre- — preset gathering, and
they invited him to address the gathering, and that’s exactly what he
did.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On infrastructure: The President spent the last 10 days making very
clear his view on the merits of the corporate tax increase, and the
White House has rejected user fees as payfors.   
   
(Someone sneezes.)  
   
Bless you, Chris.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Bless you.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    The Republicans have made clear the 2017 tax law is a nonstarter
and are proposing user fees to pay for it.  I don’t understand what the
deal space is here when their payfors are considered nonstarters by you
guys, and your payfors are considered nonstarters by theirs.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, this is a big week ahead, Phil.  It’s a big week for
someone who covered Capitol Hill and is now covering the White House. 
Look, I think the President — the President’s red lines are inaction and
are anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $400,000
a year.  Those are not areas where he is going to move.   
   
He is quite open, as is evidenced by the fact that he invited Senator
Capito and a group of members to meet with him in the White House later
this week.  He’s very open to having a discussion about where we can
find agreement, where we can move forward.  And he has been encouraged
by the spirit in which Senator Capito and other Republican colleagues
are engaging with him.  And he’s hopeful that the meeting will be
constructive.   
   
Now, you’re right, and what you touched on — which is an interesting
piece of this — is that the disagreement is really about the payfors. 
There is agreement about the need to modernize our infrastructure, about
the need to do more to create jobs in the economy.  And he’s looking
forward to hearing what additional ideas they may have.  
   
Q    Can I just ask one more quick one?  I understand where you guys and
the Fed are — that inflation right now — transitory if it pops —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — to the degree that it does.  The jobs report kind of was a
reminder that we don’t necessarily have a roadmap for coming out of a
once-in-a-century pandemic economically.  Are you guys concerned about
what would happen if you were wrong and it’s not transitory, and this
ends up being an actual real problem in the weeks and months ahead, when
it comes to inflation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that our economic team watches this
incredibly closely — including our Secretary of Treasury, who has an
expansive background in watching inflation.  And so, we have confidence
in both their assessments to date and also the fact that they will watch
this as we continue to assess the state of our economy.   
   
I will say that — and the President will talk about this shortly, I
should say, later this afternoon — that his view is that, you know, we
need to — we’ve always believed that this would be — there would be ups
and downs in our jobs reports.  That is historically how it has gone —
that there are a number of factors that contribute to it being a
challenge for people to hire and people to rejoin the workforce.   
   
And there are steps we can take — and this is what he will talk about in
his remarks — as a government.  We’ve obviously taken a number of those
steps, including passing the American Rescue Plan.  But there are a
number of barriers to work — the biggest barriers we’ve seen:
affordability of childcare, schools reopening, vaccinations is actually
a huge factor.   
   
So, when you dig into this data, which obviously we’ve done over the
last couple of days, one interesting thing that struck the President as
interesting is that the week of April 12th — which is the week that the
data was compiled for the April jobs report was collected — at that
point, only 18 percent of 18- to 64-year-olds were fully vaccinated. 
And as of May 9th, it’s risen to 34 percent.  And the seven-day moving
average of positive COVID cases was 40 percent higher in mid-April than
May 8th last week when the data was compiled for next month.  So, all
I’m conveying is there are a range of factors.   
   
He’ll talk about — or — announcements on state and local funding — how
that will be distributed, which will help keep police, firefighters, and
others on the job.  He’ll talk about delivering assistance to
restaurants, which is some — where we see major opportunity for
employment or rehiring.   
   
He’ll talk about providing guidance to childcare centers, which will
help ensure that that funding gets out the door to cover child costs. 
He’ll talk about the emp- — Employee Retention Tax — Tax Credit, which
will hopefully help small- and medium-sized businesses.  But he also
believes that there are steps businesses need to take, which he’ll also
talk about.   
   
Employers can get people vaccinated.  They can pay people a decent
wage.  These larger companies have received $1.4 trillion in money. 
They can do a better job of paying a decent wage to bring people back
into the workforce.   
   
And so, you know, there’s a lot of steps different entities can take. 
And that’s where he think- — where he’ll discuss this afternoon and
where he thinks the focus should be.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Two topics really quick.  First, on ethics waivers: The
White House apparently had ethics restrictions that were preventing
officials who work here from communicating with the unions they worked
at previously, and they waived them for somebody at OMB and somebody at
the Made in America office, and I’m curious why that happened.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, since you gave me the opportunity, I will
reiterate that this administration has — the President signed an
executive order requiring all appointees across the federal government
to sign the most stringent ethics code ever adopted by any White
House.   
   
So, as you referred to, in the narrow circumstances when necessary and
in the public’s interest, the order authorizes agencies to grant limited
waivers in consultation with White House Counsel’s Office, including in
the cases you’re citing.   
   
The President, of course, has stood strong for unions throughout his
career, and he’s proud to have leading labor voices in the White House. 
And there are circumstances — very, very limited — where it is in the
interest of governing, in the interest of getting work done for the
American people to issue these waivers.  
   
Q    And then, on the economy: So, employment only rose by about 266,000
jobs in April out of 7.4 million or so job openings.  How does the White
House know that people are just choosing not to apply for jobs because
the extra unemployment benefits are so good?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say that we have looked at the data —
and Secretary Yellen referred to this on Friday, or talked about this on
Friday: We don’t see much evidence that the extra unemployment insurance
is a major driver in people not rejoining the workforce.   
   
We actually see the data and our analysis shows that lack of
vaccination, the lower rate — which is why I referred to the data in the
week that it was taken — it has an impact.  Childcare has an impact. 
Schools reopening has an impact.   
   
But there is also the need to pay a livable working wage, and that’s one
of the reasons the President will talk about that this afternoon.   
   
Q    But, as Bank of America economists who were cited in a Bloomberg
story say, anybody making less than $32,000 a year is better off
financially just taking the unemployment benefits.  So is the White
House creating an incentive just to stay home?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, the majority of economists, internally and
externally of the White House, don’t feel that unemployment insurance —
something that was done at a time where — to help unemployed people get
through a very difficult economic downturn during a pandemic — is a dri-
— is the — a major driver in our unemployment data; that there are other
factors — bigger factors — that were contributing — have been
contributing to the numbers we saw on Friday.   
   
That’s what we’re working to address, and that’s where we think our
solution should be focused.  
   
Q    And just last one, really quick.  The Commerce Secretary says the
main reason that people are staying home is fear.  How does the White
House know that people are scared?  What is that based on?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what she was referring to is the fact that
there were — there was a much lower vaccination rate just a month ago. 
And that people are fearful about getting sick.  They are fearful about
whether they’re going to have the conditions to be healthy — whether
they can send their kids to a childcare center, whether there is a
childcare center.  So those are all factors that are consistent with the
examples and reasons I just provided.   
   
Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    You mentioned that you’re monitoring inflation and that, with the
jobs report, you expected, sort of, you know, lumpy reports from month
to month.  Do you expect the same thing with the inflation report?  Is
the White House bracing for, kind of, an eye-popping topline number,
given the base effects it will be going off of?  Or are you not, sort
of, cautioning that?  Are you worried people will overreact to the one
number that will come on Wednesday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, obviously, our analysis is going to be done by our
economic experts.  They continue to convey that they believe the impact
will be temporary, transitory — however you want to refer to it — but
they’re looking at it closely.  But I don’t have any projections on that
to make from here today.  
   
Q    Can I ask a little bit more about vaccinations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    You — the average has dropped from about 3.4 million, four weeks
ago —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    — (inaudible) 2 million.  It looks like it’s, sort of, leveled off
there — declining steadily.  Is that where you expect it to continue? 
Do you expect it to keep coming down?  And what are the factors that you
think are driving that?  It’s a pretty substantial drop over the past
month or so.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, we always expected we’d be in a different
phase.  And we were at a phase, just several weeks ago — and you cover
this closely, so you know well — where there was such a demand for the
vaccine.  People were eager to get their appointment.  They were — had
vaccine T-shirts.  They were doing selfies.   
   
We are now at the point, which we always knew we would be at, where the
supply has increased — has exceeded the demand.  And it means we have to
work extra hard to get into communities; to have partnerships with local
doctors, with primary care physicians; to expand access; expand mobile
units that are going into communities to get the supply out to people.  
   
We have reached — hit a higher number than I think most people
anticipated at this point since the President was inaugurated — the
number of people who have been vaccinated, who have received their first
dose and are, hopefully, on their way to their second dose.   
   
So we knew we would be in this phase.  And we knew we’d be in a phase
where it be more difficult because we need to increase access — which
we’ve been focused on doing from the beginning — and continue to
increase confidence.  We have seen progress in both areas.  
   
Q    You mentioned, two weeks ago, the 10 million doses of AstraZeneca
that were being reviewed by the FDA.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Do you have an update on that at all?  Are they still reviewing
it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They are still reviewing it.  We don’t have an update quite
yet.  And we’re working to, hopefully, have more for you on what our —
how our approach and what our assessment will be of how those doses will
be distributed.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) quick housekeeping.  Tomorrow’s meeting with governors
— is that virtual or are they all coming?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Virtual.  
   
Q    It’s a virtual meeting.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    And can you give us, finally —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    — a sense of whether you’re considering easing travel restrictions,
particularly to Europe or whatever for vaccinated people?  Where is the
U.S. thinking on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to preview on that at this point in
time.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, David.  
   
Q    Back to this interesting question on the unemployment benefits. 
One suggestion the Republicans have been making is “End those benefits
earlier than the current plan” — which I think is the end of September —
“and use that money to go into infrastructure.”  Is that being taken up
by your side?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m certain they will bring many ideas to the meeting —
meetings later this week.  That may be one of them.  
   
But again, I think it’s important to note that we don’t see the
unemployment benefits as a major driver in the jobs numbers. We see
there being a number of other factors that have a larger impact,
including the pace of vaccination just a month ago, the childcare
impacts, the need to get more money out into state and local
communities.   
   
So that’s where our focus is going to be.  And, for us, it’s important
that we continue to remain solutions-oriented on areas where we feel can
be most beneficial to the economy and not be moved by talking points.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Yeah.  Thanks, Jen.  The White House sent out, earlier, that the
President is meeting later today with Senator Carper and Senator
Manchin.  I was wondering if you could just give us a preview of what
they plan to discuss and why those two senators, in particular, were
invited — or will it be virtual or not?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, I would expect the President will have — you
already know — he has a number of meetings scheduled this week: one with
a bica- — a bipartisan, bicameral leadership meeting on Wednesday.  He
also has the meeting with Senator Capito and a group of Republican
senators on Thursday.  
   
So these are just examples of two senators — additional members he’ll be
meeting with to discuss the American Jobs Plan, discuss the path
forward.  And I’m not sure we’ll have a big readout afterwards, but it’s
just a part of his ongoing outreach.  
   
Q    And given — just the way you said, you know, what a big week it is;
he has so many meetings with so many lawmakers — is this, sort of, I
guess, like a defining week, would you say, for how things are going to
proceed on the Jobs Plan and the Families Plan?   
   
Is the White House, sort of, you know, setting any kind of deadline? 
You’ve mentioned Memorial Day as a time we’d like to see progress.  I’m
curious, you know, where you, kind of, go after this week, given all of
the meetings that are scheduled.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President would still like to see progress by Memorial
Day and would like to sign the bills into law this summer.  That hasn’t
changed.  But we don’t have a new deadline.  But, of course, a number of
meetings, and the Senate is back, and there’ll be all sorts of
conversations happening this week.  
   
Kel — sorry.  Kelly, go ahead.  
   
Q    Do you get a sense that as the President is going to have his first
meeting with Kevin McCarthy —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — here and that leadership meeting you talked about — obviously,
the House Republicans have some of their own internal matters going
on.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Does the President think any discord they are having has an
influence or comes into the meetings that he will have with leadership? 
Does that affect how he views sitting down with them at all?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  The President knows that there is some introspection
going on in the Republican Party right now and a determination about who
they’re going to be, who they want to lead them, and what they want to
represent moving forward.  He’s not going to focus on that.   
   
He also believes that the American people did not elect him to accept
improbability or impossibility of working in a bipartisan manner.  So,
the role he can play, as President of the United States, is to continue
to seek ways to work together.   
   
And the fact is we are continuing to work — even with the family
excitement that’s happening on the other side of the aisle, we are
continuing to work with Republicans on a range of issues.  National
security.  We passed our — we confirmed our Cabinet in a faster pace
since — than — since Reagan.   We’re working to increase our
competition.  There are a lot of ways we’re working with Republicans,
even as they’re determining who they are moving forward.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Both the German Chancellor Merkel and French
President Macron have expressed their concerns over U.S. policy towards
vaccine.  They’ve basically been underlining the need for more experts,
be it for the vaccine itself or the components.  Does the President
understand their frustration?  And more broadly, do you think he
underestimated the — the negative reactions around the world?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that the President’s commitment to a
global COVID-19 response has been steadfast and consistent since day
one, when we made the decision to rejoin the WHO.  We understand that
the border — the virus knows no borders, that it is important for the
United States to continue to play a central role in addressing the
global pandemic.  
   
We’ve invested more than any other country in COVAX, and we’re pushing
other countries to invest more in the program to get vaccines to
developing countries.  We’re working to boost global production through
partnerships like the Quad partnership.  Moderna and Pfizer have
announced plans and intentions to increase supply and get it out to the
global community.  And, of course, we’ve announced that we are going to
share 60 million doses — 10 million of which, as Josh referred to or
alluded to earlier, will be hopefully approved by the FDA soon.  
   
So, there’s no question we’re playing a role.  We will continue to play
an increased role in efforts to address the pandemic and get the
pandemic under control.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Speaking of NATO’s Eastern flank,  
the important part of a security system in the Central and Eastern
Europe was supposed to be U.S. missile defense site in Poland.  The
project stalled during the previous administration.  It has been delayed
twice.  Is President Biden committed to completing the project?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to preview about a bilateral project
or project in Poland at this point in time.  The President addressed
this group today.  He provided remarks to, obviously, a group of nine
countries.  So it was not focused on one particular country, even though
I know the President of Poland was a cohost of the event.  I can
certainly follow up with our national security team and see if there’s
more to report.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    We’re seeing hesit- — hesitancy in some areas to resume activities
that even the CDC says they’re safe — you know, wearing a — not wearing
a mask outside if you’re fully vaccinated or even, in particular,
in-person schooling.  Does the administration have a strategy on helping
cure those anxieties around the country and make sure that the reopening
can go as smoothly as possible?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The reopening of schools?  Well, we actually saw data that
came out just last week that showed more than 50 percent of schools are
open five days a week, and that data is from March.  So we’re actually
seeing increasing numbers as schools receive the American Rescue Plan
funding and as they apply the mitigation measures.  
   
So, I’m not sure — but was there specific data you were referring to, or
—  
   
Q    It’s not just the reopening schools, but getting families confident
that sending their children to those schools is safe.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Sure.  This is — certainly, as we look to wait for
and hope for, of course, approval of the — of one of the vaccines to be
safe for 12- to 15-year-olds.  I know this is something that’s on the
minds of parents around the country.  My kids are not quite that old,
but I certainly relate to and understand that.   
   
And we will continue to do what we have done with a range of communities
across the country where there has been issues with confidence — whether
it’s communities of color, where there has been a massive increase in
confidence as more people get vaccinated; or more conservative
communities, where we’ve also seen an increase in confidence as more
people in communities are vaccinated.  
   
So one of the reasons that we are partnering with primary care
physicians and local doctors is because we know that is an effective way
— not just with adults, but with parents — to help address questions
they have, concerns they have about whether or not getting the vaccine,
taking the vaccine for their kids is safe, is effective, and is
necessary.  And that is a program we were — we will continue to increase
our investment in.  I think we’ll have more to say about that in the
coming days.   
   
Sorry, I was trying to understand your question.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  To go back to the Colonial Pipeline, if the U.S. does
begin to see a shortage of supply, would they consider — would you
consider waiving the Jones Act?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, as — as Dr. Sherwood-Randall alluded to, we have an
interagency process that was stood up this weekend and is meeting
regularly — many times a day — about a range of options.  
   
I’m not going to get ahead of those options.  And at this point in time,
I would just reiterate: We don’t see a supply issue.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  The first is: Is there — does
the President have a sense of how many Democrats are fully on board with
the 4 trillion dollars’ worth of plans right now, given that he’s
meeting with these two Democratic senators?   
   
And is there any readjustment happening with job — the Jobs Plan or the
Families Plan dis- — because of the disappointing jobs report last
week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first say that the President has been
regularly discussing with not just Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer,
but a range of members.  I should say, also, senior members of the White
House team have primarily been playing this role, have had dozens and
dozens of meetings and engagements and discussions about these proposals
and what’s important to a variety of members.   
   
As you know, Yamiche, you know, there are some members we’ve been
talking about a lot who want to see a smaller package; some want to see
a larger package.  So there’s a range of points of view that will
certainly continue to be a part of the discussion.   
   
This meeting with bipartisan leaders on Wednesday — of course, the Job’s
Plan will be a part of it.  They’ll also discuss a range of issues and a
range of items on the agenda during that meeting.  But I don’t — the
discussions are ongoing, and there are a range of viewpoints that we’re
intaking on.  We’re answering questions. And that is not just —
certainly not just with Republicans; it’s with a range of Democrats as
well.  
   
Q    Just want to make sure — the question was, basically, how many
Democrats?  And does the President have a sense that he could pass it at
least with Democrat support right now?  (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, Yamiche, I — what I was conveying is that there
are a range of Democrats and Republicans who have different ideas about
what the priorities are, what they should be.  Some may even want
different components of the package to be bigger; some may want it to be
smaller.   
   
So all of that is being assessed as we have a discussion.  There isn’t a
bill that’s going to the floor next week.  We’re in the early
sausage-making stage of the discussion with members of both parties.  
   
Q    And then two other quick questions.  The first is just on
policing.  Does the President — would the President sign a bill that
didn’t include an end to qualified immunity when it came to policing? 
Jim Clyburn is supporting that now.  What’s the President’s stance on
qualified immunity?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President is eager to see what the outcome of
negotiations are, and he certainly trusts in the leadership of
Congresswoman Bass, Senator Booker.  But his focus is on his hope that
he can sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law on May
25th — if I’m getting the date correct.  And he will not — we’re not
going to get ahead of those negotiations.  
   
Q    So he doesn’t have a stance right now that he would — that he would
say on qualified immunity?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re not going to — we’re not going to take a stance in the
middle of the negotiations.   
   
Q    And then the last question I have is on schooling.  I saw some
numbers that said Black children are — half of them have gone back to
school; about two thirds of Asian American children have enrolled in
remote school; compared to about 20 percent of white students. 
Essentially, the point is that Black, Latino, and Asian students aren’t
going back to school at the same rates as white students.  There are a
lot of people —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    — who are worried about that equity gap.  Does the administration
have a goal, a number in mind for — for how this should be playing out
when it comes to students and who’s going back to school?  And what —
what are the aim — what’s the aim there?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  Well, one of the challenges is that the data is from
March, and so the data at this point is a month and a half old.  It
still shows encouraging signs, but, as you pointed out there, Yamiche,
it’s not nearly where we want it to be at the end — you know, at the
conclusion of this.  And the focus of Secretary Cardona and on our
Department of Education is ensuring we’re getting these funds out to the
communities that need it in order to reopen — reopen as quickly as
possible, five days a week.   
   
There are also entities that I think one of your colleagues over here
asked about, in terms of concerns about the vaccine and safety and
efficacy that we need to continue to address at the same time as well. 
So we will continue to dig into the data.   
   
One of the things Secretary Cardona has been focusting \[sic\] — focused
on is connecting schools and best practices so that they can learn: Is
it a funding issue?  Is it a, you know, addressing-other-challenges
issue and — that school districts and schools can learn from each
other?   
   
But our goal and objective is to have all schools open five days a week,
and that’s what we’re working toward.  And we’re not going to be
satisfied until we get there.   
   
I know that — I think you have to gather, or maybe we’re even late for
that, so I’m going to wrap this up.  But we’ll see you again tomorrow. 
Thanks, everyone.
