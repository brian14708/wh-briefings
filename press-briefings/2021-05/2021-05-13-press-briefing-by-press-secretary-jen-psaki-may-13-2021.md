James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:50 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  I know we’re waiting for a gather
time, too.  So not to scare you — if there is a note passed, nothing bad
is happening.  We’ll just keep you all abreast of when it’s time to do
that.   
   
So just a couple of items for you all at the top.  Obviously, the
President just spoke to the Colonial Pipeline and progress that’s been
made.  And he was sending the clear message: There’s an end in sight for
the supply disruptions that have — affects strates — states across the
Southeast.    
   
As you all know, Colonial reported that product delivery had commenced
in a majority of the markets they serve and that they expect the
pipeline to have full operational restoration in every market by noon
today.  Obviously, there is still going to be some time until things go
back to normal.  
   
But, in the last 48 hours alone, we announced a targeted Jones Act
waiver to ease shipping of full — fuel; on top of waivers for EPA for a
dozen states, expanding gasoline supply; steps taken by DOT to make it
easier to ship fuel over land; and a number of other actions across the
federal government.   
   
President Biden and his team also — we also wanted to thank the
governors and state and local leaders throughout the affected region who
have moved very quickly in a coordinated way over the last several
days.   
   
I just wanted to speak to the unemployment insurance numbers that came
out this morning: Those claims fell to yet another pre-pandemic low. 
And while we’ll continue to note that these weekly numbers can be
volatile, the larger trend in initial unemployment number — claims shows
clear economic progress for America since President Biden took office.  
   
Since his Inauguration, the four-week average of initial unemployment
claims has fallen by over one third.  And the chart — I always love a
good chart — behind me shows that there has been a clear and sustained
decrease over that timeframe.  And over the last three months,
employment growth has averaged 500,000 jobs per month — eight times the
number of new jobs created per month, on average, in the three months
before he took office.   
   
One other note, as we continue to keep you updated on the implementation
of the American Rescue Plan: Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs
is highlighting the launch of the Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance
Program.  The American Rescue Plan will provide $386 million to cover up
to 12 months of tuition and fees and monthly housing allowance benefits
for qualified veterans who need critical retraining to enter high-demand
occupations.  
   
In addition, the American Rescue Plan will provide the Department of
Veterans Affairs with $262 million to reduce the backlog of compensation
and pension claims by increasing processing power and expanding scanning
of federal records.  
   
Finally, the Senate Judiciary Committee, today, is voting — or has
voted, I guess; lots going on this morning — on the nomination of
Kristen Clarke, the eminently qualified career civil rights attorney to
be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.  She’s one of the
nation’s most distinguished civil rights attorneys.  She began her
career in office to — in the office to which the President has now
nominated her to lead — coming full circle.  
   
Along the way, she personally prosecuted crimes based on hatred and
bigotry, human trafficking, domestic violence, and sexual assault.  She
has served at two of the nation’s oldest civil rights organizations,
working on virtually every area of civil rights: voting rights, equal
education and employment, fair housing and lending, environmental
justice, disability rights, LGBTQ rights, and I could go on.  
   
If confirmed, she would be the first woman confirmed to lead the DOJ’s
Civil Rights Division.  
   
With that, Jonathan, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  A quick one to start.  The President, in recent
days, has been saying with increasing certitude about his meeting with
President Putin of Russia.  Are you able to confirm that trip, even if
you don’t have a date or location yet?  But is that part of his first
trip to Europe?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any additional details to confirm at this point
in time.  As we have confirmed from here, the follow-up to the
President’s meeting — or the President’s invitation to President Putin
was to have conversations at a staff level through his national security
team.  Those conversations are ongoing.  
   
Q    Okay.  The President has said that he has — you just reiterated
that he hoped that the violence in Israel would soon stop, but it has
not done so.  In fact, it seems to be escalating and getting worse. 
Does he see the U.S. having a role in brokering some sort of calm
there?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the role we are playing, at this point in time,
Jonathan — as we’ve tried to keep you abreast of — is to communicate not
only with the Israelis and the Palestinians the goal and the objective
of reducing violence and achieving a stability, but also with key
partners in the region — the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Tunisians,
others — who can play an important role and have conversations with
Hamas from that end.  
   
So I would say that our objective, at this point in time, is to — we
have, over the last several days, had dozens of calls at very high
levels with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, as you know — from the
President’s call with Prime Minister Netanyahu; the Secretary of State
also spoke with President Abbas just yesterday.   
   
And our role is to — going to continue to work not just with the
Israelis and the Palestinians — have the discussions, move toward
de-escalation — but also with other key partners in the regions, as we
all work toward that peace.  
   
Q    And one more on a very different topic.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of course.  
   
Q    The governor of Ohio has announced that they will be doing weekly
drawings of $1 million for residents who’ve received at least one dose
of the COVID-19 vaccine.  What does the White House think of that
idea?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, in this phase of the vaccinations at the state and
local level, leaders are going to take new, creative approaches to
getting more shots in arms.  Treasury has — the Department of Treasury
has comprehensive guidelines, but does not typically opine on each
individual program or creative approach by different states.  And,
typically, we leave that up to states and local leaders to determine, as
long as it falls within those specific guidelines for the programs.  
   
Q    And are you moving to — should we all be potentially moving to Ohio
to — (laughter).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — I leave that up to you.  I have a special love for Ohio
in my house because my husband is from Cincinnati, so I have
recommendations if you ever move there.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just a follow-up on the Middle East.  Did the President warn Prime
Minister Netanyahu yesterday about the rising death toll of civilians
there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know we put out an expansive readout of the call
that the President had with the Prime Minister.  And in that call, of
course, he reiterated the right of Israel of self- — to defend
themselves.  You know, in our view, rocket attacks from — attacks from
Hamas into civilian neighborhoods is not self-defense.  So he certainly
reiterated that, but also reiterated the need to move to deescalate the
situation on the ground.   
   
His view and the view of our entire administration is that the loss of
any life — a civilian life, any life — is a tragedy.  And that’s one of
the reasons that we are so engaged behind the scenes in this effort.  
   
Q    And you sent an envoy to the region.  Is it possible that you would
use this violence as a vehicle to launch a new peace process?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Steve, I will say that, we have been having strategic
negotiat- — discussions — dialogue, I should say, with the Israelis
since the very beginning, since almost the first week of the
administration.   
   
Now, the focus of those discussions, or at least a lot of the
questioning, has been understandably about how we’ve used that or how
we’ve raised the Iran negotiations.  And that’s of — obviously, keeping
them abreast of that has been a part of those discussions, but we’ve
also talked about the fact that the position of the administration
continues to be that the only path towards a long-lasting peaceful
outcome is a two-state solution.  
   
Q    And lastly, does the fact that Colonial Pipeline paid a ransom make
you concerned that this could happen over and over again — these types
of hacks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, Steve, let me say that I’d refer you to the
company for any confirmation of — or comment on that particular
question.  It continues to be the position of the federal government,
the FBI, that it is not in the interests of — of the private sector for
companies to pay ransom because it incentivizes these actions, leading
to your — leading to your point.  
   
I will say that one of the lessons that other companies should take away
from this hack is that it’s important to harden your cybersecurity, to
take the necessary steps to ensure that you’re protected.   
   
There are steps we can take from the federal government.  Obviously, the
President signed an executive order last night.  We believe that it’s
important to increase cooperation, sharing of best practices between the
public and private sector in a way that hasn’t been done in past
administrations.  But, ultimately, it’s up to these companies to take
the steps to protect themselves.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On the Middle East: Some progressive lawmakers have criticized the
President’s response to the violence. Congresswoman Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez says the President’s comments “reinforces the false idea
that Palestinians instigated this cycle of violence.”  Representative
Ilhan Omar has said the U.S isn’t doing enough to condemn the killing of
Palestinian children.  What’s your response?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me take the second part of that.  Let me be
very clear: It is a tragedy for the loss of any life — a civilian, a
child — and we’ve certainly seen that as this violence has escalated.   
   
Our objective and our approach is to work with leaders in the region —
whether they’re the Israelis or the Palestinians — or leaders from other
countries who can play an integral role in influencing Hamas to
deescalate and move toward a more stable peace.  That’s the role and
that’s the focus of the United States government, but that should not
diminish the fact that any loss of life is a tragedy.  And that’s what
we would convey.  
   
Q    And on a very different topic: Yesterday, we saw the President
meeting in the Oval Office with the “Big Four” — four vaccinated
individuals —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  “The Big Four.”  
   
Q    The Big Four.  Yeah, we — they were all still wearing masks.  You
know, the CDC guidance says that vaccinated Americans can gather in
small groups inside without masks.  So why aren’t we seeing the
President model more of that behavior?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, they were wearing masks; I can confirm that.  You all
saw that in photos.  I know this has ruffled the feathers of the RNC. 
And I’m — always feel bad about ruffling their feathers.   
   
But I will say that the focus of the meeting was on seeing if there’s a
way to work forward — to move together to work toward shared objectives
of investing in infrastructure, creating jobs for the American people. 
And I think that’s what most people’s focus is on.  
   
Q    But the argument has been that if you can take your mask off, that
may incentivize others to get vaccinated — right? — to be able to
participate in some of the benefits of being vaccinated.  But, yet, we
aren’t really seeing the President, sort of, take — lead by example on
that (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President doesn’t wear his mask when he’s outside; that
guidance is clear.  There were a number of people in the Oval Office
yesterday.  Obviously, there were — there was a whole press pool.  
   
But, again, I think, if the big takeaway from the meeting yesterday — I
think what most people look at it and take away is that the President
sat there with Democrats and Republicans; they all came out of the
meeting saying it was constructive, looking to see what the path forward
could be about how we can create jobs and rebuild roads, rails, and
bridges.  And that was what the objective of the meeting was.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just to confirm, Ohio is a great state.  (Laughter.)  
   
First, the President has mentioned this a couple times, you just
mentioned it: Is the expectation, in terms of the regional players in
the Middle East, that you guys want to kind of follow a model of 2014,
perhaps, when Egypt played a pretty crucial role in brokering peace
there?  Is that what you’re going for here in your contacts with those
countries and key players in that region?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what we’re — our object- — our objective is —
in the short term, Phil — is that Egypt, Tunisia, other important
countries in the region certainly can play a role in conveying to Hamas
and leaders of Hamas the reasons for deescalate to — for de-escalation
and how that could be beneficial.   
   
And that’s a role they have played historically at moments in time. 
Obviously, every conflict is different, unfortunately, but, certainly,
many of these countries and their leaders have played this role in the
past, and we certainly look — we’ll look to them and continue to look to
them to play a role moving forward.  
   
Q    And then just two quick ones on the economy.  Senator Mitch
McConnell said that, based on the meeting yesterday, the President
understands that the 2017 tax law is no longer a part of the
conversation about financing any infrastructure — bipartisan
infrastructure deal.  Is that an accurate assessment of the state of
play?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what the President understands is there’s agreement,
as is evidenced by Senator McConnell’s comments, that we need to invest
in infrastructure; we need to create jobs; that bridges are not
Democratic or Republicans.  They don’t have party affiliation, it turns
out.  How to pay for it has long been the area where there — where we
need to find more common ground.   
   
The President has proposed a way to pay for it.  We have not seen
proposals that wouldn’t raise taxes on people making less than $400,000
a year.  So if they feel that the 2017 — changing the 2017 tax — tax
laws — bringing it back to the rates that were the rates when George W.
Bush was President; raising taxes on just 1 percent of Americans — is
not the way to do it, then we welcome what their alternatives are.  
   
Q    And just kind of a broader economic question: The UI numbers — kind
of underscoring it’s kind of been a bumpy last couple of weeks, which I
think everybody kind of expects coming out of a once-in-a-century
pandemic.   
   
Can you characterize how important is the economic recovery continuing
at a decent pace to your broader legislative goals?  Like, does that —
does that underpin your ability to do the scale of the things that
President Biden has put on the table?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would unpack that a little differently.  We know
that continuing to increase the pace of vaccinations, getting more
people vaccinated, is going to have a direct impact on people going back
to work for a range of reasons, including people feeling safe to do so,
including childcare facilities opening up so that people can send their
kids there.  And we know that that has had a big impact, of course, over
time.  These are twin crises that are related.  
   
But the proposals the President has made for the American Jobs Plan, for
the — for the American Families Plan — there are certainly some impacts
that will be very beneficial over the short term: additional assistance
for childcare, of course, beginning to put more and more people back to
work.  We know there’s more we need to do.  More than 8 million people
are still out of work.  
   
But this is all — these are also proposals and ideas that have a
long-term impact, that will increase our com- –competitiveness over the
long term that will help ensure we can compete with China.   
   
So, you know, there’s an argument to be made that we need to get through
the — continue to get through the crisis we’re in, but we also need to
think about what’s next and how we’re building the workforce of the
future, and that will continue to be his argument.  
   
Q    And just to put a quick, finer point on it — broader point being:
Because of the long-term effect of the proposals that were put on the
table, what happens with economic numbers in the near term has no effect
whatsoever on the President’s decision to pursue those going forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first I would say we look at averages — right? — over
the course of time.  So we’ve created about 500,000 jobs, on average,
over the last few months.  And we know these numbers and these data can
go up and down.   
   
We also know — and this is why I referenced the pandemic — because we
know that there has been a massive increase over — even just the last
month in the number of people who have been vaccinated as — as a — in
comparison with what the numbers were in the week that they were
measured for this month’s jobs numbers.  That was a bit of a roundabout,
but I was trying to get to a point there.  
   
So we know that.  There’s no question also and economic — economists
have said that these proposals — the American Jobs Plan — would help put
more people back to work.  There’s more we need to do, but it’s both. 
Right?  So it doesn’t impact the fact that we still need to do more over
the long-term for competitiveness, but certainly, as we still see more
than 8 million people out of work, it re- — it’s a reminder of the need
to do more now and that the economy needs more now, and that we need to
do more now across communities to create jobs.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Just a few questions on Colonial —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — and the Jones waiver, if you’re willing.  Can you identify the
name of the tanker yet?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I cannot.  I would point you to the Department of Homeland
Security.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then can you share anything on the duration of how long
the waiver will be in effect?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think what the President — what we’ve conveyed is: as — as
long as it — as it is needed to address the supply.  So I don’t — I
don’t have an additional number of days or weeks for you.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then on retaliation — and the President addressed this a
little bit — but would it be proportional since now the government
believes that these hackers do live in Russia — is there any discussion
about Nord Stream 2 or taking away something that Russia — Russia
wants?  Has there been any discussion of stopping the completion of Nord
Stream 2 as retaliation for this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we continue to think that Nord Stream 2 is a bad
project, as you know.  But we — there’s still an ongoing investigation. 
Obviously, the President was speaking to what we know now.  But in terms
of the conclusion of that, we would point you to the FBI and — in terms
of what steps could be taken, that would likely be recommended by Cyber
Command, and we’re just not quite there yet.  
   
Q    Is that on the table?  Is there any discussion about Nord Stream 2
or (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re just not quite — quite there yet.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Back to infrastructure.  Given this red line that
Republicans have when it comes to corporate tax increases, would the
White House be willing to accept not paying for part or all of this plan
if that’s the only way to get a bipartisan deal?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think we’re quite there yet.  You know, the
President proposed a plan to pay for it because he thinks that’s what we
should do.  We’re going to have a discussion — he’ll have a discussion
with Senator Capito, five ranking members of important committees that
will play a role here about how to move things forward.  
   
We’ll see what they come forward with.  Obviously, we say — take Leader
McConnell at his word, but there are a lot of players, a lot of members
on both sides will — who have a range of views about this, in terms of
what options should be to pay for it, whether it should be paid for.   
   
The President’s red line — or — I hate that term — so his line in the
sand is inaction.  He’s open to a range of proposals, but, you know,
we’re not going to make that decision unilaterally.  
   
Q    But Democrats have been open to not paying for infrastructure in
the past.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep, they have been.  But there are a number of players that
will be important as we move forward these propo- — these proposals,
these negotiations.  And we’re still at an early stage of those — this
process.  
   
Q    You’ve said many times that the President wants to see progress on
this issue by Memorial Day.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Is that code for “If these bipartisan negotiations don’t bear fruit
within the next few weeks, Democrats are going to go it alone”?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn’t say it’s that clear of a line in the sand, just
to continue our analogies here.  But we will have an assessment, after a
couple of weeks, about how things look and whether it looks like there’s
a path forward.  It doesn’t mean it’s a moment of halting or not
halting.   
   
As you know, there will be discussions up until the moment a bill passes
with Democrats and Republicans regardless.  But it will be a moment to
assess where things stand and what the right steps are moving forward,
given that’s a time, as you all know, many will go home for
congressional recess.  
   
Q    And then, finally, on Israel: Why hasn’t the administration
prioritized naming an ambassador to Israel?  And will that name be in
the next batch of ambassadors that are named by this White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would expect we’d have more in the coming weeks on
an ambassador — nominating an ambassador to Israel.  But I will say,
having lived and served at the State Department for a couple of years,
we have a very talented, trusted career diplomat who is there on the
ground; who is fully engaged with the White House, is fully engaged with
— with leaders in the region, and — as is his entire diplomatic team.   
   
So I think it’s important for people to understand it’s not as if work
halts just because you haven’t have a nominated and confirmed
ambassador.  That’s important.  But the system of governing — career
staff, Foreign Service officers — are in place so that there can be the
continuity through administrations.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On Colonial, I know the President said that he didn’t
want to comment on whether he was briefed on the payment, but, just to
put it a little bit more broadly, was the administration aware at all
whether a payment or not was made?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just not going to have any more on that.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then my colleagues are reporting that legislation to
overhaul the military justice system is getting traction in Congress. 
This is the bill led by Senators Gillibrand and Ernst.  This is broader
than what the Pentagon is looking at doing through the commission.  Is
this something that the President would support?  And has he had any
conversations with members of the Senate yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that, like the President recently
said, we have to have an all-hands-on-deck effort to end the scourge of
sexual assault in the military, underlining that sexual assault is
repugnant at any time, and that we have to uproot this horrible,
longstanding problem.   
   
As he promised during the campaign, he ordered the creation of an
independent review commission on sexual assault in the military to take
bold action to address sexual assault and harassment in the force.  That
work is underway.  It’s a 90-day process.  I think they’re around
halfway through that 90-day period of time.   
   
So obviously, these reports about support in the Senate are positive;
it’s a welcome development.  We will see how that process moves
forward.  Nothing has passed either body of Congress at this point in
time.  And even as it’s working through, the work of this commission
will continue.  
   
Q    All right.  And, sorry, just to follow up on Nancy’s question real
quick: Is the President committed to paying for the package fully or is
that TBD right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President has proposed a ma- — a ways of paying for the
— his proposals because he thinks that’s the responsible thing to do.   
   
But again, there’s going to be a range of discussions with members of
both parties.  As Nancy said, some Democrats think we don’t need to pay
for it.  Some Republicans feel very strongly about that.  Some in the
middle feel strongly too or feel which way.  That’s part of the
discussion.   
   
So we’re still having those discussions.  We’re in the sausage-making. 
And he’s proposed ways to pay for it because he felt that was the
responsible thing to do when he put out his ideas to the public.  
   
Go ahead, David.  
   
Q    A few questions on Colonial, Jen.  The President, at one point in
the statement today, said that he was going to take steps to “disrupt”
this network.  And then he was asked later on: Does that mean return
cyberattacks?  Would he rule that out?  He seemed to say no.  Did — is
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As in he wouldn’t rule it out.  
   
Q    He would not rule it out.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    That was — that was clear.  So, is his idea here something similar
to what Cyber Command did last year with another ransomware group, where
they actually stopped them from getting on their servers in an effort to
try to keep them from disrupting the 2020 election?  Is that the model
that the President has in mind?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we’re not quite there yet, David.  Obviously, this
just happened just a couple of days ago.  You know, he was providing an
update to the public and being transparent with all of you about what we
know as it relates to the investigation.   
   
That investigation is still ongoing at the FBI, and obviously Cyber
Command would make recommendations about next steps — as we often like
to say: some seen, some unseen.  But I can’t get ahead of where we are
in any internal process.   
   
Q    So when the President said that this happened from Russian
territory, was he suggesting that if it happens from your territory, as
we often say in terrorism issues — this came up often when you were at
the State Department — that the country from which an attack is launched
is as responsible for it as the attackers themselves?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say he’s making that clear because, certainly, the
host — the country where individuals are located, even as a criminal
network, even as he’s confirmed that we don’t have information from our
review process that suggests the government was involved, there’s still
some responsibility.  
   
Q    And my final question to you goes to your reluctance to discuss the
ransomware issue.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    I’m trying to figure out if, on the one hand, the government has a
policy that — of recommendation, why isn’t it in your interest to call
out companies that might actually violate what both the FBI and the
Treasury Department have recommended strongly?  In fact, Treasury
Department went beyond that last year; they said that there could be
sanctions against people who pay ransomware.  So I’m trying to
understand what the theory is in not calling them out if you know the
answer to the question.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, David, I would say that it’s the recommendation of the
FBI to not pay ransom in these cases, as you well know — for good
reason, because it can incentivize similar attacks, additional attacks,
to Steve’s other question.  
   
But, again, our policy remains — that’s our recommendation, but — that
private-sector entities or companies are going to make their own
decisions.  So, what I’m here to do is just convey the policies of the
United States government, and it doesn’t feel particularly constructive
to call out companies in that manner at this point in time.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  What does the President think about Republican
governors, such as Mike Parson in Missouri, reducing unemployment
benefits in order to force workers back to work?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what we’ve seen — we know there’s been a lot of
talking points and chatter out there suggesting that reducing or —
benefits $300 a week — in most cases, benefits to people across the
country would incentivize them to go back to work.   
   
And frankly, we find that to be a bit off — off track, because what
we’ve seen in the data is that the actual issues at play here are the
pandemic and people needing to address things like childcare, being
fearful about going back to work before they were not vaccinated.   
   
So states, governors are going to make their own decisions.  But it’s
important to convey, I think, that when you look at the data, when you
look at the facts, that’s not — we have not seen that as a widespread
driving factor in people not going back to work.   
   
Q    One more question: How will the President deal with the nearly 100
billion in back-rents that would need to be paid in order to avoid
evictions once the moratorium expires?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I know that moratorium is something that has — which is,
hence, I’m sure what you’re asking about it — has helped many, many
people across the country get through this very difficult period of
time.   
   
I think we have a little bit more time before it expires, if I’m
remembering correctly.  And, certainly, there will be considerations
made.  But it’s an — it’s a process that’s done through different
agencies and Secretaries and making a recommendation on the extension,
so I can’t get ahead of that.   
   
If we don’t make the decision to — to extend it, obviously we’ll have to
figure out how to continue to help renters.  But at this point in time,
it’s still ongoing.   
   
Q    Jen, quick question on some breaking news.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Do you know if the CDC is changing its guidance today about
mask-wearing indoors?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything I can preview for you on CDC
guidance.  That would be up to them.   
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you.  The head of a major teachers union is saying that all
schools should return to full capacity in the fall.  What’s the position
on that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We agree.   
   
Q    You do.  Okay.  Just checking.  
   
On the Putin summit, which may or may not happen, I guess: A number of
Americans are being held in Russia.  We’ve talked about them before —
Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan, for instance.  Has Russia asked for any
concessions in return for their release?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  In return for their release — from us in return for their
release?   
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Obviously, the detainment of individuals by the Russian
government is something that we raise at the highest level, and
certainly it’s raised through many diplomatic channels.   
   
In terms of what those negotiations and discussions look like, I’m just
not going to be able to give you more information on it.  
   
Q    And real quick: The markets have been very volatile this week. 
It’s giving a lot of heartburn to people who are saving for retirement
and are investors.  How concerned is the President about that volatility
and about inflation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, on the markets, I’ve been doing this long enough not
to weigh in and speak to that.  Certainly, we have a number of people in
the federal government, including our Treasury Secretary who can speak
to that more effectively than I can.  I will say, on inflation: What we
— we take that very seriously.   
   
Our — the expectation from economists, both inside and outside of the
government, is that the impacts of our proposed investments are
transitory, are temporary, and that the benefits far outweigh the
risks.  So that — we look at it through, certainly, through that
prism.   
   
Obviously, we’ve seen, over the last couple of days — to your point —
some reaction to the CPI numbers that came out just yesterday.  And, you
know, our view on that is it reflects the reality of an economy that’s
rapidly turning back on because of a successful economic strategy.   
   
And if you dig into the data, there are a couple of factors at play that
I think people are taking a look at now that we’ve dug into the data
more, including the fact that, you know, for example, airfare is
increased by 10 percent but are still almost 20 percent below
pre-pandemic levels.  The — one of the biggest impacts we saw on the
data yesterday was on used car sales, and that is a direct impact of the
semiconductor chip shortage.   
   
So, point is: There’s a number of factors here that can be explained and
we’re working to address.  And I think as we continue to communicate
that, hopefully that will give some comfort to the American people and,
of course, industries.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    A couple questions.  Can you confirm that the White House is
seeking changes to legislation that would grant statehood to the
District of Columbia, and change it so it would grant the electoral
votes to the winner of the popular vote to deal with potential
constitutional concerns?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we have issued a statement of administrative pol- —
administration policy, as you know, strongly backing the bill.  And our
view is that admitting D.C. as a state is well within Congress’s power,
and that the arguments to the contrary are faulty.   
   
But we also think there are ways to allay the concerns that have been
raised, and that’s why we’re working with Congress to make the bill as
strong as possible, as would be the case in any — nearly any negotiation
or about any piece of legislation.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Can you confirm that those are the changes that you are
seeking?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — I’m not going to get into more details of it, other than
we certainly would support D.C. statehood and strongly back the bill.  
   
Q    And on infrastructure, can you — you’ve talked a lot about progress
by Memorial Day.  Can you define what progress specifically is?  Is it —
is it a deal in principle with Senate Republicans?  Is it passing
(inaudible) transportation bills out of committees?  Or is it — what is
it?  What — what is progress to you?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, as I was saying in response to Nancy’s
similar question earlier, it’s just a marking point for us to make an
assessment of what we think the path forward looks like.  And, as you
well know from covering Congress, everybody will go home on Memorial Day
recess.  It will be quieter over near the Capitol.  Obviously, there’ll
be a lot of activity, as you all have seen this week, and that will
continue, both at a staff-level, a member-level, engagements with the
President, other high-level members of the administration, and we’ll
have a feeling on what the path looks forward — looks like moving
forward.   
   
I don’t want to define that at this point, because that’s not really to
our advantage.  There’s a couple of weeks before Memorial Day, and we’ll
just be able to take stock of where we should proceed.   
   
As — and as I’ve said before, obviously the President wants to work in a
bipartisan manner.  He thinks there’s opportunity to do that.  He was
encouraged by the openness to that in the meeting yesterday.  And
obviously he’s going to sit down, or is sitting down shortly — you’ll
know — with — with leaders here.  
   
But — but his only — his only line in the sand is inaction.  
   
Q    And a quick foreign policy one.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    In the readout with Prime Minister Netanyahu, there was no mention
on Iran.  Did the President discuss the ongoing nuclear talks with the
Prime Minister?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We regularly brief our Israeli counterparts on our ongoing
negotiations and discussions with Iran.  Rob Malley is currently taking
part of those now.  As an important partner in the region, we do
regularly brief them.   
   
I don’t have any update or anything in addition to add to the readout,
but it was primarily focused, as I think — as I think was clear, on the
escalation of violence happening on the ground at this point in time.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yes.  Senator Tom Cotton says the nation’s wealthiest colleges are
indoctrinating young people with what he calls “un-American ideas.” 
He’s proposing a new tax targeting the largest private endowments.  He
says it would raise $2 million a year.   
   
I wonder: Does the President believe that our largest — our wealthiest
schools are indoctrinating our youth with un-American ideas?  And would
he support such a tax?  Is it a good idea?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Now you’ve intrigued me.  What are the un-American ideas
that are indoctrinating our youth?  
   
Q    The legislation doesn’t lay out the precise —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, he’s not specific about the indoctrination by leaders
from universities?  
   
Q    Well, he’s been critical, for example, of the 1619 Project.  He’s
been critical and spoken about critical race theory.  He’s — he’s
claimed that there’s a liberal bias on campus that targets conservatives
— I think would be a way to put it.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What’s he going to do with the money?  
   
Q    He wants to use it for programs for — my mind — I’m having a hard
time coming up with the word — when you have job training, those sorts
of things.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, without much detail of where he thinks our youth are
being indoctrinated, it sounds very mysterious and dangerous, but —
although I don’t think that — I don’t think we would think — we believe
that educating the youth and next — the leaders of the — future leaders
of the country on systemic racism is indoctrination.  That’s actually
responsible.   
   
But, I would say, if he’s trying to raise money for something, then our
view is there’s lots of ways to do that.  We know that a number of
corporations hugely benefited financially during the pandemic.  They
could pay more taxes.  We think the highest 1 percent of Americans can
pay more taxes.  And if he wants to have a conversation about worker
training, we’d love to have him over and have that conversation.  
   
Q    And then, if I could follow up: We have a bridge over the
Mississippi River, at Memphis, linking Arkansas and Tennessee.  It’s had
to be shut down because there’s a crack in it.  Is this a fluke or
should Americans be concerned about the structural integrity of their
bridges?  And what, if anything, is the administration doing to address
this problem?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that’s an excellent example of why
we need the American Jobs Plan.  And, as you know — probably traveled
across that bridge a few times yourself, I would guess — there are
bridges around the country that are decades overdue in being repaired,
in being fixed, in ensuring that people traveling — they’re going to
work, they’re taking their kids to school — are up to the standard that
we should have in this country in one of the most competitive and
industrious countries in the world.  
   
So that’s a good example of why the President has proposed repairing
bridges around the country, repairing roads and railways.  And the good
news is that will create millions of jobs, so there’s a “win, win” for
communities around the country.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    There’s reports that former Chicago mayor and former Chief of Staff
Rahm Emanuel will be appointed to be U.S. ambassador to Japan soon.   I
don’t think you can provide, but I know the announcement on the
ambassadors will be coming soon.  But my question is: What do you expect
from the ambassador to Japan?  Do you expect (inaudible) key person to
deal with China and North Korea?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I do expect — I know there’s a lot of interest in
this.  I do expect we’ll have more in the coming weeks on nominating
ambassadors to serve in — obviously, once confirmed — important posts
around the world, and Japan is certainly one of those: important partner
in the region, important partner in addressing stability and security in
the region.  And certainly, we would see that person as someone who
would play an integral role.  
   
However, I would say there are a range of — a range of positions from
the State Department, from our national security team that may play an
additional role or significant roles, as it relates to negotiations
moving forward.  So I don’t have anything to preview on that front.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    We’ve heard repeatedly, with respect to the statements about
violence in Israel, that Israel has a legitimate right to self-defense,
but we’re not hearing about the Palestinians’ right to self-defense. 
Why is that?  And does the President believe that Palestinians have a
right to self-defense?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say, I think it’s important to note, as I
think you’d agree, that these rockets are coming and these attacks are
coming from Hamas.  And many Palestinian people are put in — being put
in danger because of the violence that is happening back and forth.  
   
And the President, in his ra- — statement yesterday, also made clear
that we — you know, he underscored the importance of working to advance
peace throughout the region, including between Israelis and
Palestinians.  Any loss of life, any threat to life — which we’ve
certainly seen — is a tragedy.  That’s what we’re working to deescalate
and try to reduce in the region.  
   
Q    But — but why not have in the statement that Palestinians also have
a right to self-defense?  That’s what I’m trying to —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Are the — are the attacks not coming from Hamas?  Do you
consider Hamas the Palestinian leadership?  
   
Q    Let me rephrase the question then: You’ve repeatedly, in the
statement, condemned the rocket attacks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Does the White House, does the Biden administration also condemn
the evictions of Palestinians from their homes in (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have spoken to that in our readouts.  And, certainly, our
National Security Advisor has raised, and we have raised at many levels,
the importance of addressing the building in these — in these
communities, and the fact that, you know, in order to move forward and
move towards de-escalation, that’s an important issue to address.  
   
So that has been —  
   
Q    But what about —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That has come up.  I think we’ve got to —  
   
Q    Okay, one last question very, very quick.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — move on and let you wrap.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Why has — when the Pres- — Secretary Blinken called both Mahmoud
Abbas —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — and also Benjamin Netanyahu.  Why didn’t the President do the
same?  By only speaking to the Israeli Prime Minister, are you concerned
that this shows sort of a one-sided viewpoint from this
administration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that the Secretary of State is an
incredibly high-ranking member of the administration — fourth in line
for the presidency, if I’m getting that correct.  He is very close to
President Biden.  And, certainly, that sends a clear message about the
importance of communicating with all parties in the region.  And we have
also had dozens of calls with a range of leaders in the region, as I’ve
conveyed.  
   
Q    You’ve been — you’ve been talking to the Egyptians.  Have you sent
any sort of message to Hamas through the Egyptians?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, Steve, the reason we’re, of course, talking
in part to the Egyptians and others in the region is that they have
significant influence over Hamas.   
   
And, unfortunately, as we saw earlier this week, assurances from Hamas
that they were prepared to stand down proved false, as they later
launched a rocket barrage.  But they are important, you know,
communicators with Hamas.  They can play an important role here.  And
that’s why we’re communicating with them, as well as the Israelis and
the Palestinians.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you, everyone.
