James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:06 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi everyone.  Happy Monday.  Okay, a couple of things
happening around here today.  Today is the deadline to file your taxes. 
That’s not a reminder to all of you, but take it as one if you’d like
to.  And we encourage everyone to file as soon as possible to make sure
they receive the full amount of benefits they are owed.  
   
Filing taxes will ensure people benefit from the three rounds of relief
and rescue payments issued since the start of the pandemic, including up
to $1,400 per person provided in the President’s American Rescue Plan. 
Filing also ensures people get all the refundable tax credits they may
be eligible for, like the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child — and the
Child Tax Credit.  
   
And today, Treasury and the IRS announced that, starting in July, the
American Rescue Plan will deliver critical tax relief to middle-class
and hard-pressed working families with children.  The first monthly
payment of the expanded Child Tax Credit will be made on July 15th to 39
million households, covering more than 88 percent of children in the
United States.  These payments will be made on the 15th of each month
unless the 15th falls on a weekend or holiday, allowing families who
receive the credit by direct deposit to plan their budgets more
effectively.  
   
Eligible families will receive a monthly payment of up to $300 per month
for each child under the age of 6, and up to $250 per month for each
child age 6 until the year they turn — over age 6, sorry, until the year
they turn 18.  More than 80 percent of the 39 million households will
receive the Child Tax Credit by direct deposit to ensure safe and fast
delivery.  
   
Only other items for the top for all of you: Today, we recognize — join
the international community in recognizing Intern- — the International
Day Against Homophomia — Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia.  
   
The Biden-Harris administration will always stand with the LGBTQI
community, and is steadily implementing the Presidential Memorandum on
Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,
Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World.  
   
As the President stated, everyone is entitled to dignity and equality.
We will continue to engage with our alli- — allies and partners to
advance the human rights of LGBTQI people at home and in all corners of
the world.  
   
Josh, why don’t you kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two quick subjects.  President Biden said last
Thursday that Israel had a right to defend itself, and that its actions
thus far were not a significant overreaction.  After the events of the
past few days, does the President still believe that Israel’s actions
have been proportionate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, Josh, let me remind people that the President
also did two calls over the weekend that we did readouts of.  And, in
those calls, he conveyed — stressed the need for Hamas to cease firing
rockets into Israel and affirmed, again, Israel’s right to defend itself
against terrorist attacks.  As I would note from the reports, there have
been more than 3,000 rockets that have been shot from Hamas into Israel
over the last several days.   
   
He also expressed his concern that this current period of conflict has
tragically claimed the lives of Israeli and Palestinian civilians,
including children.  And he raised concerns about the safety of
journalists, including those who had to leave the building from the —
where the Associated Press was based — and reinforced the need to ensure
their protection.   
   
So how we are looking at this, from our standpoint, is that our focus,
our goal — every single action we take, every statement we make is with
the objective of reducing the violence and bringing an end to the
conflict on the ground.   
   
There are times, in diplomacy, where the — we’ll need to keep those
conversations quieter, where we won’t read out every component of it. 
But that is our objective, and that is the — the prism through which
every action and every comment is being made.   
   
Q    Gotcha.  And then, secondly —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead, Josh.  Didn’t mean to cut you
off.  
   
Q    The Supreme Court agreed today to hear a Mississippi law that would
ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.  And I was curious: Does the
administration believe that law is constitutional?  And if the Court
upheld the law, what would this administration be prepared to do?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, I don’t have a comment specific to the Supreme Court
taking the case.  But generally speaking, given this is a state law, I
can say that, over the last four years, critical rights like the right
to healthcare, the right to choose have been under withering and extreme
attack, including through draconian state laws.  
   
And the President and the Vice President are devoted to ensuring that
every American has access to healthcare, including reproductive
healthcare, regardless of their income, ZIP Code, race, health insurance
status, or immigration status.   
   
As such, the President is committed to codifying Roe, regardless of the
unrelated — well, it’s all related — but to the outcome of this case.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Just stepping back a little bit from the current situation with
Israel and the Palestinian territories, we reported over the weekend
that the — your envoy in the region has been basically telling both
sides that they need to start thinking about what a peace process might
look like after this happens.  And I’m just curious whether the
President is willing to invest himself in — in being a broker in that
kind of a process, and whether you’re — you’re starting to think about
what that might look like.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Trevor, I think it’s clear to everyone who has been a
part of — and covered or been a part of — I was at the State Department
back in 2014.  We all know that the only way to bring an end to
violence, to bring an end to this escalation of violence is for there to
be a two-state solution over time.  
   
And in both calls the President made this weekend, he underscored his
strong commitment to a negotiated two-state solution as the bet- — best
path to reach a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.  
   
But in terms of what that would take or what form and what it would look
like, it is going to require both parties wanting to engage in that and
wanting to have a discussion about the path forward.   
   
And who would be the point person from this end — we’re certainly not
quite there yet.  It will be up to both parties to decide if they want
to move forward on that pathway.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then just one more question on that subject, which is:
What would be the value in making a case for a ceasefire from — from
your standpoint?  And would you do that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that what’s most important is that we
all share — the United States shares with a range of countries around
the world — those who have been outspoken at the U.N., our partners and
friends in Europe — a commitment and a desire to bring an end to the
violence.  
   
And how we are approaching this is through the prism, again, of what
steps can we take; what actions can we take behind the scenes — we’ve
had over 60 calls in the past week, from the President on down, with
senior leaders in Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and across the
region; and how can we bring an end to the violence through our
relationships in the region, both with the Israelis and the Israeli
government and also with key other partners — whether it’s the
Egyptians, the Qataris, and other key countries in the region.   
   
So that is how we are approaching it from the United States.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I want to ask that in the inverse: Why not?  What is
the value in not calling for a ceasefire right now, given many of those
countries that you just listed — our close allies France, UK, Egypt,
Jordan — have done so, are doing so?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That is true.  But what we — the role we are playing, the
action — the prism we are making all of our decisions through is: How
can we help bring an end to the violence and bring an end to —
deescalate the situation on the ground?  
   
And our calculation, at this point, is that having those conversations
behind the scenes, weighing in with our important strategic partnership
we have with Israel, also with other countries in the region, is the
most constructive approach we can take.  
   
So our approach is through quiet, intensive diplomacy, and that’s where
we feel we can be most effective.  
   
Q    And does the President’s assessment from last Thursday still stand:
that he does not see Israel’s strikes as a significant overreaction?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I think — I noted that the President also had two
calls over the weekend, since Thursday, where he conveyed his concerns
about the current period of conflict; the — the lives of Israeli and
Palestinian civilians that have been lost; and certainly raised his
concern about the safety and security of journalists and others who have
been impacted on the ground.  
   
So we’re not going to give a day-by-day evaluation.  I will say that our
objective is to — just like it is with other countries and our partners
around the world — is to play the role we can play in the most
constructive way possible to bring — to reduce the violence, to
deescalate the situation on the ground.  And a great deal of that is
going to be through intensive, quiet diplomacy behind the scenes.  
   
Q    And just one last question, if I may.  You mentioned the
journalists on the ground on that Gaza tower strike.  The Prime Minister
Netanyahu called this a “perfectly legitimate target.”  Does this White
House agree with that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that any intelligence is being handled
through intelligence channels.  I don’t have a further readout or
confirmation of any of that — those details from here, nor do I have an
assessment of that intelligence that was stated by the Prime
Minister.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    The President obviously has a decades’ long relationship with Prime
Minister Netanyahu.  They met a number of times — of course, most
recently when he was the Vice President.  
   
Tom Friedman wrote today about this being a “January 6th” moment for
Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Is there a concern at the White House and by
the President that domestic politics in Israel are currently a barrier
to an end to this escalation of violence?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I will say — I will say, Mike, good to see you, first
of all.  I will say that it’s not our role to assess or analyze the
politics on the ground in Israel.  Everybody has their own politics in
different regions of the world, and we see that play out in foreign
policy all the time.   
   
What our role is, is to play the most — be as constructive as possible
in deescalating the violence, bringing an end to the conflict.  And
there certainly is — the President has known the Prime Minister for some
time.  They’ve obviously spoken, as — hence, we did the readout this
weekend.  And I’m sure they will speak again.  
   
We were also deeply engaged at the highest levels.  Our National
Security Advisor spoke with his counterpart earlier this morning.  We’ve
done, again, more than 60 calls over the past week with a range of
partners in the region.  
   
So, our objective here — our role is not to do political analysis or —
or provide motivation for any actions, but to take steps we can take as
a leader in the world, as a country with deep relationships in the
region to deescalate the violence on the ground.  
   
Q    Speaking of domestic politics, you have a letter from a majority of
the Senate Democrats calling for the White House to demand a ceasefire. 
You also have Democrats in the party — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez —
calling Israel an “apartheid state”; Senator Bernie Sanders saying that,
potentially, this should lead the U.S. to reevaluate foreign
assistance.  What’s the White House’s message to those in the
President’s party on this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will say, if we — our message is: Sometimes you have to
step back from politics for a moment.  It’s not easy to do.  And we
recognize and agree that watching the lives lost of these Palestinian
children, of these families, the fear you see in the eyes of the Israeli
people — it is heartbreaking.  We want to bring an end to the violence. 
We want to dis- — deescalate the situation on the ground.  
   
The role we feel we can do that through — the most effective way we feel
we can do that is through quiet and intensive diplomacy, and that is
what our focus is on at this point in time.   
   
But we share an objective of deescalating the circumstances on the
ground.  We share a view that a two-state solution is the only way to
bring a lasting end to the violence.  
   
Q    And then, just on another matter: You have two self-imposed
deadlines coming up here for the White House.  Next Tuesday is the
anniversary of George Floyd’s death.  The President has said he wants to
see that legislation moved by then.  
   
And then, Memorial Day is only two weeks from today as well.  The White
House has said they want to see progress on infrastructure talks by
then.  What is the White House doing to try to meet those deadlines? 
And can you define what “progress” on infrastructure means?  Does that
mean a bill on the floor? Does that mean a breakthrough agreement with
some of these Republican senators?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would not expect a bill to be on the floor before Memorial
Day.  And all of you, including you, who have covered the Hill know that
would be some sort of record-breaking pace, so that is not what we
expect.  
   
But I will also say that, almost two weeks — which is the period of time
between now Memorial Day — is a lifetime in legislating.  It’s a
lifetime in negotiations and conversations, and conversations in
hallways, and phone calls, and meetings in person.  It will be an active
period; it will be an engaged period between high-level officials at the
White House and members of — members of Congress and their staffs and
committee staff.  
   
But, in terms of where we will be right before or around Memorial Day,
our hope is that we will have a better sense on the path forward and
what the opportunity is looking ahead.  
   
Q    And on George Floyd?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And George Floyd.  I will say that we are deeply engaged, of
course, with the members and in close touch with the members who are
negotiating the path forward, including Senator Booker, including Cong-
— including the members of the House — Karen Bass, who is leading this
effort — and we stay abreast of their discussions and their
negotiations.   
   
The President, of course, is eager to sign a bill.  He thinks police
reform and the — is long overdue.  But, you know, we’ll continue to
press forward, but we feel that is best placed in those negotiations and
those constructive negotiations that are happening between members on
the Hill.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Has the President seen this letter that was sent by Senate
Democrats today calling for a ceasefire?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Has he seen it?  I — I’m not sure if he’s physically seen
the letter.  I know that he is, of course, aware of the calls and the
points of view of a range of members of Congress on the conflict in
Israel.  
   
Q    And has he spoken with any members of Congress about the
situation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any calls to read out.  
   
Q    When members of his own party share the belief that he is giving
too much credence to Israel in this situation, are they wrong
(inaudible) the situation on the ground —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Look, I don’t —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think we are — it would be constructive to put any
labels on it, as you’ve just outlined.  The President’s view and the
view of senior leaders in the White House is that our role as the White
House, as the federal government, as the President of the United States
is to play a constructive role in diplomacy to use our role, our
relationships around the world to have intensive, quiet discussions with
leaders in the region that we have longstanding relationships with.   
   
We share an objective of deescalating the situation on the ground, of
bringing an end to the conflict.  That’s an objective we share with
members of Congress who have different points of view and are, of
course, you know — we support their ability to have different points of
view, but we are approaching it through the prism of how we feel we can
come to the most effective outcome.  
   
Q    Over the weekend, there were these reports that the Israelis had
shared intelligence with the United States regarding what was going on
in that tower that was blown up that housed the Associated Press and
others.  They said that it was shared with the United States.   
   
The Secretary of State, this morning, overseas, said he didn’t see it. 
He’s not the intelligence director, so perhaps that’s why.  Has the
President seen it?  And can you confirm that the Israelis actually
shared that intelligence with the United States?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, this would be handled, as you alluded to, through
intelligence channels, and I’m not going to be in a position now or ever
of committing or confirming who has or hasn’t seen intelligence.  
   
What I believe the State Department has confirmed is that the Secretary
was saying he has not personally seen the intelligence because such
matters would be appropriately — be handled through intelligence
channels.  So that’s not necessarily a surprise.  But in terms of who
has or hasn’t seen it, what’s been communicated, I’m just not going to
be a position to confirm that.  
   
Q    And let me ask you one on COVID real quick.  There’s been some
pushback on the idea that those of us in this room or indoor places
generally should be doing so without masks on, even though that’s now
the policy here (inaudible) —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Should be not wearing masks?  
   
Q    They should —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, should be.  
   
Q    — be wearing masks still —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    — despite the CDC guidance.  Plenty of vaccinated people say
they’re not ready to take their masks off because they fear it would
leave them on protected, even though doctors have said masks are about
protecting other people, not necessarily you wearing them.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Does the White House hear that concern or criticism?  I know there
were governors and mayors, over the weekend, who’ve expressed concern
that this came with very little notice.  What says the White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the CDC Director promised the American people that she
would convey the latest science to them as she knew it, that she would
not delay, that she would not be impacted by politics or influenced by
political pressure on the White House or elsewhere, and that’s exactly
what she did.   
   
Now, that also means — and she based that conclusion, as she outlined,
on the fact that the vaccines work in the real world, vaccines work
against the variants, and vaccinated people are unlikely to spread
COVID, based on their data and analysis by health and medical experts at
the CDC.  
   
Now, because we are working in a way that we feel is what is going to
rebuild trust with the American people — and what should have always
been the case — which is that health and medical experts will determine
that guidance, it may mean it’s going to take some time for various
sectors to implement.  
   
It also is important to note what the President said in his remarks last
Thursday: People may choose to continue to wear masks.  They aren’t
through their vaccine — they have — they’re not two weeks post-second
vaccine; they have not gotten the vaccine yet; they’re immunocompromised
— somebody in their family is.  
   
We need to treat people with kindness.  And this has already been such a
politically charged issue; that’s not our objective.  Our objective is
to share — and the President will talk about it in his remarks this
afternoon, too — and make sure people have understanding and clarity of
what the CDC guidance was conveying to people, which is that: They are
safe not to wear their mask if they have been vaccinated.  
   
Q    Is there anything else he’s announcing in those remarks that we
should be listening for?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He is announcing — he does have some news in his remarks,
Ed.  He will also be announcing that the United States will send 20
million doses authorized for use in the United States to help countries
battling the pandemic by the end of June.   
   
This is an addition to sending all of the manufactured AstraZeneca
vaccine doses overseas during May and June as soon as these 60 million
doses are cleared.  So that is a total of 80 million doses, and this is
the most doses donated by any country in the world, by five times.   
   
So, we are waiting for, of course, AstraZeneca, as you know, to go
through the approval process of the FDA, but this will put 80 million
doses out into the world by the end of June.  
   
Go ahead, Mara.  
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  Thank you.  Wait — just — I want to ask about Israel, but
the 20 million doses are AstraZeneca doses?  Or are there other —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Other doses of approved vaccines.  
   
Q    Other vaccines?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, exactly.     
   
Q    Okay.  Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.   
   
Q    So, my question is: If you say that the ultimate — the only
solution is a two-state solution, and that requires both parties to want
that, which they don’t seem to right now, does that mean that despite
all of your quiet, intensive diplomacy behind the scenes, that the U.S.
really has limited leverage and power to solve this problem?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say first that, right now, our quiet,
intensive diplomacy is of course not negotiating a two-state solution.  
   
Q    Right.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I know you’re not suggesting that.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Yes.     
   
MS. PSAKI:  But just for clarity purposes.  
   
That is to bring an end and to deescalate the violence on the ground
now.  And certainly, we feel we have strong relationships with Israeli
leaders, we have strong relationships with key partners in the region,
and we’re hopeful that those conversations — that quiet diplomacy — will
help bring an end to the violence and reduce the conflict on the
ground.  
   
As it relates to a two-state solution, you’ve been through many of
these, as have I, and it is clear that it will require both parties to
be committed themselves.  The United States cannot manufacture, on our
own, a two-state solution.  It would require both parties having that
desire to move forward.  
   
Q    So it sounds like what you want the American people to understand
is that although you are trying your hardest and doing everything you
can with all your relationships behind the scenes, you can — the U.S.
does not have the power to solve this problem or it doesn’t have the
leverage to solve this problem.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that it’s been seven days.  Every
single life that is lost — a Palestinian life, an Israeli life — is a
tragedy.  It has been seven days.  As you know, these conflicts have
been far longer than that.  That is not our objective, of course.  We
want to deescalate as quickly as possible.  
   
But, yes, it would require actions from Israel, it would require actions
from Hamas to end the violence on the ground.  There are a range of
parties and entities who are involved in those discussions, and we want
to play as constructive a role as humanly possible.   
   
Q    And I just have one more quick one: Is it fair to say that you
don’t want to answer the question — yes or no — whether the President
feels the Israeli response has been disproportionate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We don’t think — I don’t think it’s constructive.  We are
going to take — everything we convey, whether it’s a statement or an
action, is going to be to the end of deescalating the situation on the
ground.   
   
Hence, we’re not going to give a day-by-day grade.  Clearly, we want to
end the violence.  Clearly, we want to deescalate. Clearly, we want the
lives of Palestinians, Israelis to be saved.   
   
Go ahead, Nancy.   
   
Q    The Washington Post reported that the Biden administration, earlier
this month, approved $735 million in weapons sales to Israel.  Is the
White House considering putting that on hold during the fighting?  And
is the Israeli response forcing the administration to reconsider future
arm sales?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ve seen the report.  I would say the State Department
would be the entity to confirm — which I don’t believe they have — any
future sales or weapons sales.  We do have an ongoing and abiding
strategic security relationship and partnership with Israel.  But, in
terms of the status of that or considerations moving forward, I’d point
you to the State Department.   
   
Q    And just one more question.  Did the President speak directly with
any Republican senators over the weekend on the infrastructure proposal
or the negotiations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any calls to read out for you.  Sometimes these
are scheduled, sometimes they happen on the fly, and oftentimes — and
maybe we’ll just keep the theme going of diplomacy here — sometimes
those are best happening without particular readouts to have a
constructive outcome.  
   
Let’s see.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Just one more on Israel.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    As this crisis, you know, gets worse and worse every day, are there
any concerns that we might not be able to hit the Afghanistan withdrawal
deadline and might need to intervene in a peacekeeping fashion
somehow?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  
   
Q    None.  None at all?  Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ve not been — I’ve not been made aware of any concern of
the overlapping — of a — of an impact on our Afghan withdrawal —  
   
Q    Glad to hear it.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — plans.  
   
Q    On a different notion — or a different subject, rather, the mask
guidance, again: Has this triggered a new conversation about whether we
need to have, perhaps, not a mandate, but a standard vaccine passport
that businesses can use?  Or is this decision going to be left up to the
states?  I know the President was pretty critical of his predecessor for
sort of taking that hands-off approach.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We — it has not changed our view that the federal government
will not be playing that role; the private sector may.  And it may
prompt the private sector, moving forward on actions, which is where we
think it’s appropriately situated.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  So EU officials actually announced earlier that
Johnson & Johnson would be cutting its COVID-19 vaccine deliveries to
the bloc by about half this week.  And they were already behind schedule
for the second quarter.   
   
Just in light of Biden’s apparent announcement later that he’s going to
be sending 20 million vaccine doses abroad, is there any — do you have
any readouts for what countries are actually — vac- — these vaccines are
actually going to be sent to?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, let me just make sure I understand your question.  So,
“Which countries are going to get these 80 million doses” —  
   
Q    Which countries are going to receive the doses?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — “that we are announcing?”  It’s a great question.  I know
everybody is eager to know where are they going.  I expect he’ll have
more in the coming days on what our criteria will be and our approach,
and some of where it will be sent to once it’s approved through the
FDA.  
   
Q    And specifically on the EU, does disputes over intellectual
property have at all to do with the reduced exports there, or any
(inaudible) —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — I think that’s really a question for Johnson & Johnson
and their manufacturing.   
   
Q    One more question.  So, inflation numbers, obviously, last week
came back higher than were expected.  As the Biden administration
deliberates internally on the American Jobs and Families Plan, would
consistent levels of inflation or, you know, changes in the jobs reports
influence the proposals that you all would be bringing to Congress in
the package — or changing some of the policies that you all would
propose if that continues?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Is — just to make sure I understand your question: Is — are
the CPI numbers from a few weeks ago impacting our plan — our proposals
that we are —  
   
Q    Would you all change any policies you would propose, given
increased inflation numbers or —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, it’s a good question.  I just wanted to make sure I
understood it.   
   
It is — as we looked and dug into the data — and we talked about this a
little bit last week; some of this data is kind of fascinating, I’ll say
— but is that, the economy is turning back on.  We take inflation very
seriously.  Our Secretary of Treasury, obviously, the Federal Reserve is
in — responsible for monitoring it.   
   
But there are a number of factors, as the economy turns back on,
including — there are areas like the cost of airline tickets where, you
know, if you look back at pre-pandemic, they dropped by about 20
percent.  They are up about 10 percent since then.  Right?  So, there
are — there are prices where the baseline was actually lower than it was
prior to the pandemic, and that’s one of the things we’re seeing in the
data.   
   
But it has not changed our view and the view of economists, I would say,
around the country that there’s more that needs to be done to put 8.5
million Americans back to work; to ensure that we are getting working
families, working mothers the assistance they need; and to ensure we’re
competitive over the long term.  So, it has not changed our overarching
objectives and approach and our proposals.   
   
Go ahead, George.  
   
Q    Yeah, I wanted to follow on your opening remarks on taxes.  Will
you be releasing, today, the President’s and Vice President’s tax
returns?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will be, soon, releasing, as — as we believe is the
transparent approach and what the public expect — expects, the tax
returns of the President.   
   
I’ll have to double check on the Vice President, but I would expect
those will be out soon  
   
Q    And — but not necessarily today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — soon.  So I would say, “Stay tuned.  Stay at your
computer.”  
   
Q    One last thing on that.  It used to, at least, be the policy that
President’s returns were always automatically audited.  If he is
audited, that doesn’t change your decision at all on releasing the
return?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, I would expect that we will continue to release the
President’s tax returns, as should be expected by every President of the
United States.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  On Friday, Buzzfeed News was able to — within minutes —
find President Biden’s private Venmo account, which is funny, but also
speaks to the epidemic of privacy concerns that everyone in this country
has — let alone, the President.  And I’m just wondering whether any kind
of federal digital privacy reform, any legislation is on your radar.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a really good question.  And I am very aware of the
BuzzFeed story that came out last week.  I — I will have to probably
check with our team and see if there’s any specific privacy concerns —
privacy legislation or proposals that is — are being considered.   
   
I would suspect there may be, but I would delink it from the Venmo
report, which was a very interesting report because, obviously, this is
something that impacts millions of Americans out there who have a range
of accounts.   
   
But I’m happy to check with them, and we can get back to you.  
   
Q    Okay.  And I need to ask a Canada question.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  A Canada question?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, okay.   
   
Q    Yeah, Josh isn’t here, so I’m going to (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   
   
Q    Are there any talks right now with the Canadian government about
reopening the northern border?  Is that something that this
administration is pushing for?   
   
And, as you know, Canada is a bit behind the U.S. in vaccination rates. 
I’m wondering whether there is any threshold you’d like to see them hit
in Canada before the border is reopened?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We — I don’t have any update on the timeline.  We are
certainly always assessing — as it relates to travel, borders, et cetera
— what we need to do and keep in place in order to keep the American
people safe, especially during a global pandemic.  But we are constantly
evaluating.   
   
I don’t think we have specific criteria to make available, but you can —
you can let me know after — or let us know after which reporter we
should follow up with on it, and we can see if there’s more specifics on
that.   
   
Go ahead, Yamiche.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks so much for taking my question.  The — does President
Biden think that there are any war crimes being committed right now in
the Middle East?  There are some experts who’ve told the New York Times
that they think that there could have been war crimes on both sides.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re not going to be making an assessment of that from
here.  Our objective is on taking every step we can to reduce the
violence to deescalate the situation on the ground, to save lives, to
ensure that we are bringing some stability back on the ground.  
   
Q    And then just to be — just to follow up.  Are you — is the White
House, at all, I guess, maybe — or is the President at all concerned
just about the number of civilians that are being killed?  That’s why
some of these experts are telling the New York Times that these are war
crimes.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, Yamiche, that in the readouts that we put
out this weekend, we included — and I — as I’ve noted a little bit
earlier in the briefing, his concern about the lives lost.  Every life
lost is a tragedy.  And, certainly, that’s why we are eager to
deescalate the violence on the ground, bring an end to the conflict so
that more lives can be saved.    
   
Q    And may I ask you — I want to also switch to COVID.  The largest
national nurses union is saying that the CDC guidelines on masks is
putting frontline workers, and especially people of color, at risk.  And
that they’re — they’re calling for the CDC to reverse that.  What’s the
White House’s stance on that union, in particular, saying that their
members and people of color are at risk?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say we don’t have any particular response to —
directly to the union.  I will say that, again, the objective of the CDC
and of Dr. Walensky was to — to deliver on the commitment she made to
the American people, which was to provide guidance, based on health and
scientific evidence, on what people can do that is safe.   
   
And so her guidance that was put out, last week, makes clear that if you
are — have been vaccinated, their recommendation is that you are safe
not to wear a mask inside, outside, and when you’re not in large public
gatherings.  
   
There’s going to be a determination about implementation.  And there are
going to be populations and communities where they take a different
approach to implementation because a lot of it is going to be based on
the level of vaccination, the level in each community.   
   
So, we certainly respect and value that, but it is still our view — is
that — that science is the North Star.  She was delivering on her
promise.  And we will continue to work with a range of communities on
implementation.  
   
Q    Can I ask you a follow-up on COVID?  I’ve talked to some people who
are very worried about the idea that we’re operating on an honor system
in a lot of ways.  That we’re — in places like Walmart and Target,
there’s already started to be rule changes based on the CDC guidance. 
What do you say to people who think this is — that it’s worrisome to be
operating on an honor system, that it could put kids or even
immune-compromised Americans at risk?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that what this guidance provides is
information to the public about what they can do to be safe: Wear a mask
if you’re not vaccinated — that applies to kids.  I have two kids; that
isn’t always easy, but that is the health and medical guidance.   
   
If you are vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask in these
settings.   
   
So, the guidance is actually pretty clear, but it gives people the
information and the power to be able to protect themselves.  If you get
vaccinated — you go through your two doses; you’re two weeks past your
doses — you no longer need to wear a mask.  If you are not, you should
still wear a mask to protect others, but also to protect yourself.  And
it also makes clear that kids should still wear masks.  
   
So I would say that we know people are digesting this.  They are — we’ve
all been wearing masks.  Many of us have been wearing masks, I should
say, for 14 months now.  And different companies, different
organizations, different — different communities are going to implement
based on a range of factors — including the vaccination levels, cases,
transmission rates — and we all should respect that.   
   
But it was the responsible step to put out the data from the scientists
when it was available, and that’s exactly what we did.  
   
Q    If I could — my question though was on, kind of, the enforcement of
this and the honor system idea that you’re trusting Americans all over
this country to follow those guidelines.  Is there any —    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what I’m saying is that, though you’re empowered, if
you are not vaccinated, to wear a mask.  So, it is less about the honor
system — you don’t have to trust the person next to you has been
vaccinated if you have not been vaccinated if you wear a mask.  The
guidance is saying that you will be — that provides protection.  So, you
know, it doesn’t — if you are vaccinated, you don’t need to wear a
mask.   
   
So, the honor system is — I’m not — I don’t always — I’m not sure I
completely understand that argument, given it provides guidance directly
to individuals about what they can do to protect themselves.  
   
Q    And can I ask you one quick last one, which is —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — the CDC, from my understanding, it’s stop- — it’s saying that
it’s not going to be tracking breakthrough — breakthrough — people who
people who get the virus if they’re already vaccinated unless they’re
hospitalized or they die.  
   
I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the — the
thinking behind that: why the President thinks that that’s the best way
forward — to not track people who get the virus if they’re not — if
they’re vaccinated but they don’t get hospitalized or die.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would — I know the — that we’ll have a health briefing — a
COVID team briefing, I believe, tomorrow, if I’m remembering correctly
the schedule.  And it’s an excellent question that I encourage you to
ask them, and it’s certainly one that should be answered by medical
experts.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Lalit.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask you about India.  What is your
assessment of the COVID-19 situation in India?   
   
And the President has already announced $100 million of assistance to
India.  Is he thinking about additional — more assistance to India?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say — well, I’m not going to be able to give
an assessment, as a non-public-health expert, of the situation on the
ground in India.  We remain closely in touched and engaged — in touch
and engaged, and we will continue to work through how we can provide
assistance during this difficult time.  
   
As you noted, we expect our assistance to be about $100 million.  We’ve
sent seven air shipments funded by the U.S. Agency for International
Development to India.  The seventh flight, carrying additional oxygen
concentrators via commercial shipping center, arrived today, and those —
that obviously is critical for a number of the patients who have already
been — are already battling COVID.  
   
So, we will continue to provide a range of assistance.  We will remain
in touch about what the direct needs are on the ground, and hope that we
can play a constructive role in reducing the numbers and bringing some
relief to the people of India.  
   
Q    Has the President reviewed the situation himself with his senior
officials?  And of those 80 million AstraZeneca vaccines, would India be
one of the recipients?  If it is, how much would India receive?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say the President is, of course, kept
abreast of the COVID pandemic — how it’s impacting different regions in
the world, including our important partners in India.  And he has been
deeply engaged as we’ve made determinations about the type of relief and
assistance that we can and should provide.  
   
In terms of how we will distribute the doses, it’s an excellent
question.  I expect and hope we’ll have more in the coming days on how
our team — led by Jeff Zients, in partnership with our national security
team — will be making those determinations, what criteria they’ll be
looking at, and where the doses will be going.  
   
Q    One final one: One of the consequences of the President’s visa ban
— travel ban with India has been several hundred families have been
separated across India and the U.S.  Some of them are working there;
some of them went to travel.  Is there a way to unite those families
back, not to wait unless —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Within India?  Within India?  
   
Q    Yeah.  There are some families who are working here.  They went to
India for travel or to get the visa stamp, but because of the ban, they
are not able to come back and join their families here.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I know that’s very difficult.  It’s a great question.  I
think the State Department is probably the best entity to have a
discussion with about that.  
   
Okay.  Thanks, everyone.
