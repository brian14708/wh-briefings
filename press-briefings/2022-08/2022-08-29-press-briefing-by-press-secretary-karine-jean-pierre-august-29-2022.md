James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:18 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Good afternoon, everybody.   
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.  All right, today the Vice President and
the Second Gentleman visited NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida to
attend the launch of the Artemis I mission.  Despite the launch being
pulled down, we look forward to it happening when NASA says all systems
are ready.   
   
While at the Kennedy Space Center, the Vice President and Second
Gentleman met with STEM students, astronauts, and workers building the
crew modules for Artemis II, which will be the first crewed Artemis
mission, and Artemis III, which will return American astronauts to the
Moon, including the first woman and person of color.   
   
As you may have seen, today we announced that the Biden Harris
administration will host the White House Conference on Hunger,
Nutrition, and Health on September 28th in Washington, D.C.   
   
As the President said a few months ago, this will be the first
conference of this kind in more than 50 years.  The conference will
bring together government leaders, academics, activists, and Americans
from all walks of life to achieve the goal of ending hunger and reducing
diet-related diseases in the U.S. by 2030.  A key additional focus will
be reducing disparities among the communities who are impacted the most
by these issues.   
   
At the conference, we will announce a national strategy that identifies
actions the government will take to encourage the public and private
sectors to drive transformative change and address the intersections
between food, hunger, nutrition, and health.  
   
With that, Zeke, you want to take it away?  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Over the weekend, the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence said they were conducting a risk assessment of the
classified documents found at former President Trump’s home in Florida. 
Does the President intend to get briefed on — on that risk assessment
once it’s completed?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we have seen the letter from ODNI to
Congress on this, but I would refer you to either ODNI or the Justice
Department by any specific questions on this.   
   
As we have said, this involves material that is part of an ongoing
criminal investigation, and we just aren’t going to comment on that at
this time.  I hear your question; we just don’t — we’re not going to say
anything at this time while the investigation is going on.   
   
Q    This is about the President’s actions, not what they’re doing
there.  So does he — you can’t say whether or not he’ll be briefed on
—  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I can say that he has not been briefed.  I know
folks have asked, you know, if he has been briefed via the PDB or
otherwise on any classified materials.  That — I can say, as a general
matter — we just don’t get into information included in the President’s
classified materials — this is what this would be considered — or daily
briefings on sensitive national security or intelligence matters.  This
is ODNI — a decision that they’ve made.  So talking about any PDB
specifically would be inappropriate or any classified, again,
material.  
   
On this specific issue, we have been very clear the President was not
briefed in advance of this Justice Department’s recent actions.  We have
not been involved in this matter as part of the Justice Department’s
ongoing criminal investigation.  We see this as part of the underlying
material that is connected to this.   
   
So, you know, we’re — as we’ve said, we are committed to the
independence with — as it relates to any legal matters that the
Department of Justice has.  And that is something that the President has
been very clear about and is going to continue.   
   
Q    But just to, again, put a finer point on it: The President will get
briefed or will not get briefed when ODNI finishes the risk
assessment?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just — I am just saying to you this is an underlying
material — underlying matter that is related to this.  We’re just not
going to comment.  And as it relates to any classified materials or
anything that’s related to PD- — PDB, we don’t comment on that at
all.   
   
But, you know, again, this is a part of an investigation.  The President
hasn’t been briefed on any of this.  He — none of us have been briefed. 
The White House not has been briefed on any of this.  And so, we are
just going to leave it to the Department of Justice and to ODNI on
this.  
   
Q    And on a different topic, tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary
of when the President marked the end of U.S. — the U.S. withdrawal from
Afghanistan and the end of the war there.  How does the President plan
to mark that occasion?  Does he plan to speak to the American people? 
Does he plan to honor the lives of the 13 servicemembers who were lost
at Abbey Gate?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, last week, on Friday, we did put out
— the President put out a statement — released a statement where he
named each of the 13 troops who were tragically killed that day.   
   
The President feels deeply about the loss that was suffered one year
ago.  And as he said in that statement just this past Friday, he feels
strongly that we owe their families support for the rest of their
lives.  We are never going to stop seeking justice for those who were
involved in planning of the attack or for terrorists who threaten our
homeland in any way.   
   
No President feels more strongly about this than this President — about
our troops than this President and their families.  And this President —
and he and the First Lady have taken action to support our
servicemembers and their families through Joining Forces and signing the
historic pits legislation.   
   
I don’t have anything else to share with you on any future statements
that he may make.  
   
Q    Nothing (inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nothing to share about any — anything on his
schedule.  As you know, he’s going to be traveling tomorrow.   
   
Q    One more question on the DNI.  They’re assessing whether bringing
those classified documents to Mar-a-Lago damaged national security or
jeopardized national intelligence operations.  Does the President feel
that the public has a right to know the conclusion of that assessment?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m — we’re just not going to comment about
conclusions.  We’re not going to comment on anything related to this at
this time, any specifics to this.  We are going to refer all these
questions to ODNI and also the Department of Justice.  We’re just not
going to com- —  
   
Q    But it’s a question about transparency not —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I —  
   
Q    — on the investigation.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I understand.  I understand the question.  Any
underlying materials, any underlying questions to this, we’re just not
going to comment.  Of course, it’s important to have transparency, but
we’re just not going to go any further than that.   
   
Q    And then, on another topic, the President has a lot of travel
coming up.  He’s been getting out more in the country, mostly, you know,
doing events sort of touting his agenda, things that — his
accomplishments and the like.  Are we going to see him actually, as we
approach the midterms, stumping for individual candidates?  Are we going
to see more big rallies, like — like he did last week?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, I can only speak to official travel
from here; I can’t speak to any of the campaign or political travel. 
The President, the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, our Hill allies,
governors, mayors, and allied groups will take the message directly to
the American people.   
   
As you know, we had a string of successful legisla- — legislative pieces
just a couple of weeks ago.  And so, in the coming weeks, the President
will host a Cabinet meeting here; host an Inflation Reduction Act
celebration event at the White House, which is going to happen on
September 13th, as you all know; and will travel across the country to
highlight how the Inflation Reduction Act will save money on
prescription drugs, cut healthcare premiums, and cut energy costs.   
   
Other upcoming events will illustrate how President Biden worked to get
things done, including passing a historic gun safety law and making
smart investments to keep our competitive edge and rebuild American
manufacturing through the CHIPS and Science Act and bipartisan law.  
   
The President will attend a groundbreaking at Intel in Ohio, as you all
know, to address his safe — Safer America plan that helps fight crime
and make communities safer while in Pennsylvania, which is happening
tomorrow, and highlight the American Rescue Plan along the way.   
   
And so, that’s going to be our focus: to get our message out, to talk —
to speak directly to the American people on how congressional Democrats
and this President delivered.   
   
Again, I can’t get into specific — specific or any campaign trail or
what we’re doing politically, but that’s what we’re doing on the
official side.   
   
Q    The President has at least two trips scheduled to Pennsylvania in
the next week.  He’s — and he traveled there more than any other state
last year.  Obviously, he’s from Pennsylvania, but is there any other
significance to him visiting that state?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All I can say is Pennsylvania is close and dear to his
heart and he is glad to be traveling there these next couple of trips,
as you just mentioned.  
   
Go ahead, Nancy.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  Going back to the topic that Zeke brought up,
there’s been a lot of confusion.  I’m wondering if you can shed any
light on this question of whether this White House or this President
believes that a President has the ability to declassify classified
documents simply by saying so.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we want to be very careful here, as you know. 
We’re just not going to speak — it is really — the question that you’re
asking me is related to everything that is happening currently right now
with the Department of Justice and even ODNI as they — as I said, we’re
aware of the letter.  We did not have any advanced knowledge of the — of
the letter.  
   
Right now, we are — at this time, we’re just not going to make comments
on any questions related to this, any underlying questions, any content
that is related to what we’re currently seeing, that — the Department of
Justice is independently working on an investigation that is
independent, and we’re just not going to comment at this time.   
   
Q    So, you can’t say what this President believes the process is that
he needs to go through when he wants to declassify that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to — because it’s related to what
we’re all hearing and you all are reporting about, I’m just not going to
comment on it at this time.   
   
Q    When the President speaks about guns tomorrow in Wilkes-Barre, is
there a new policy he’s going to be laying out? What can you tell us
about what he’s going to say on that issue tomorrow?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have some — some preview for you on this.  So,
tomorrow, President Biden will be traveling about — about his Safer
America Plan and the simple, basic notion that, when it comes to public
safety in this nation, the answer isn’t to defund the police, it’s to
fund the police.   
   
He will highlight how his plan would invest 100 more cops for effective,
accountable community policing that builds public trust and strengthens
public safety.   
   
And as part of the American Rescue Plan — you’ve heard us say this —
that President Biden signed into law last year, we sent $350 billion to
local governments to keep cops on the beat.  And in contrast, every
Republican in Congress voted against the funding for law enforcement. 
And Trump — also Donald Trump cut $400 billion from his budget for state
and local law enforcement.  
   
So, the President is going to talk about how he brought the Democrats
and Republicans together earlier this month to pass the most significant
safety law in 30 years.  He’ll talk about how we have built on that
momentum and how we must act on ban assault weapons.  You’ll hear that
from him as well.  
   
So, again, a majority of Americans support this when we talk about
banning assault weapons; the NRA opposes it.  And so we are going to
hear from the President about — about the importance of making sure that
we protect our communities.   
   
You know, the President has been really clear that congressional
Republicans — that extreme MAGA agenda that you heard him talk about
last week is a threat to the rule of law.   
   
We will say that — he will say that you can’t propose defunding the FBI
or defund the mob that stormed the Capitol and attacked and assaulted
police officers on January 6th and pre- — and be pro-police.  And that’s
what you’re going to hear from the President tomorrow.  
   
Q    And then, finally, Senate candidate Lieutenant Governor John
Fetterman says he is going to be at the parade in Pittsburgh on Labor
Day and, quote, he “looks forward to talking to the President there
about the need to finally decriminalize marijuana.”   
   
The President has said in the past we need to rethink our approach.  Has
he decided how he wants to rethink the approach? Does he agree with John
Fetterman?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I don’t have anything right now to announce.  But I
just want to talk a little bit and take a step back to talk about the
drug — our drug policy that we — that we have been very clear about, but
I’ll leave some stuff here.  
   
We’re — we’re at an urgent moment when it comes to an overdose
epidemic.  You’ve heard the President talk about that.  More than
100,000 lives lost in the — in the most recent 12-month period.  
   
The bulk of our early efforts have been focused on addressing the
addiction and overdose epidemic.  That’s what we have talked about these
past 19 months, which has worsened during the course of the pandemic,
sadly.  
   
Untreated addiction and overdose deaths require urgent attention and
having evidence-based policies in place — in place is critical.  That is
incredibly important to this President.  But at the same time, President
Biden believes that there are too many people serving unduly long
sentences for nonviolent drug crimes — a disproportionate number of whom
are Black and brown.  That’s why, in April, during the Second Chance
month, President Biden announced 17 sentences, commutations, and three
pardons, which are more grants of clemency at this point in a presidency
than any of his five recent predecessors.  
   
As I’ve said before, the President supports leaving decisions regarding
legalization for recreational use up to the states; rescheduling
cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and
negative impacts; and, at the federal level, he supports decriminalizing
marijuana use and automatically expunging any prior criminal records.  
   
I don’t — we don’t have anything to announce today at this point, but I
just wanted to lay that for you.  
   
Q    On the Federal Reserve, Elizabeth Warren has said that she’s
concerned that if the Fed raises rates again that it could put people
out of work or tip the economy into a recession.  Does the President
share any of those concerns about an overreach or a possible
overreach?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, we’ve been very clear when it comes
to the President’s plan on attacking inflation.  He has said many times
that he gives the Federal Reserve their independence to — to make the
monetary decision on how to deal with inflation.  That is something
that, again, we give their independence.  We believe they have the
strongest tools to deal — to deal with that.  
   
But we know that Americans are feeling the pain of higher costs, higher
prices.  That’s why we have worked so hard to bring down gas prices. 
We’ve seen, for 76 days, gas prices have gone down.  It is the fastest
decline, as you’ve heard us say, in over a decade.  And so that is
important.  That’s why the Inflation Reduction Act was so critical in
dealing with — that’s going to deal with lowering costs, that’s going to
deal with that $300 billion.  It’s going to deal with reducing the
deficit, which is important, which is now — that $1.7 trillion deficit
that we have seen under this President in the past 19 months; $380
billion was done last year.  And so, this is important as well.   
   
It’s important for the President, but he’s going to continue to do the
work.  But we want to say — a couple of things that we wanted to share
is, like, you saw the new data on Friday that showed prices came down
nationwide last month and personal income went up.  So that is a sign of
inflation that is easing.  And latest CP- — the latest headline, CPI
inflation was flat.  Prices in the aggregate had no increase versus the
prior month.  
   
And this morning, we lear- — and yesterday morning — pardon me, sorry —
Friday morning, we learned that consumer sentiment is up 13 percent
since July and one-year inflation expectation dropped nearly half a
percent from — from the month — from the month before.  
   
We have more work to do.  We understand that.  We know that there are
families who are — and Americans who are still feeling the pain.  And
we’re going to continue to do the work to do —  
   
Q    So the White House doesn’t disagree with Senator Warren?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I’m just — we’re just saying that this is
something that the Federal Reserve is going to — we don’t want to step
on, you know, what the Federal Reserve is going to do.  
   
Our goal is to — to keep bringing down inflation without sacrificing the
historic and lifechanging economic gains that we’ve seen this country
has made over the last 18 months.  
   
And, you know, as Powell said — as Powell also said, the economy
continues to show strong, underlying momentum.  We have regained all of
the jobs lost during the pandemic.  And if you look at the labor market,
it — you know, consumers are spending; as I said, what businesses are
investing; and what American industry is producing, you continue to see
the resiliency in our — in our economy and that’s what matters.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Can you — can you talk a little bit about the free
COVID test program going away?  What does that mean for the COVID
testing industry?  And does it mean that rapid tests will be harder to
come by if there’s a fall surge?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, on Friday, the administration announced that it
will suspend taking orders for free tests through COVIDTests.gov because
Congress hasn’t provided the COVID funding we need to replenish the
nation’s stockpiles of tests.  As simple as that.  
   
The last day to place new orders will be Friday, September — this is
September 2nd.  And — but just to give you a little bit of what we have
done and what we’ve had to do, we’ve already distributed over 600
million tests through this program, and every household has had the
opportunity to place three orders for a total of 16 tests.  
   
Americans will continue to have other options for free testing,
including free at-home tests through private insurance, Medicare,
Medicaid, and 1,500 community-based free testing sites.  So that is
available to Americans.  
   
So, look, the administration has been very clear about our urgent
COVID-19 response funding needs for months.  We’ve been talking about it
for months.  The COVID Response Team has been talking about it for
months.  We’ve warned that the congressional inaction would face
unacceptable tra- — trade-offs and harm our preparedness and response,
and that the consequences would likely worsen over time.  
   
So this is an action we’ve been forced to take that will help preserve
our limited remaining supply, ensuring we have a limited of tes- —
supply of tests available in the fall.  So that’s what we’re trying to
be forward thinking, forward leaning here when we might face a new rise
in infections and more acute need.  
   
Q    Has the administration given up on getting COVID funds in the CR? 
And on that realm, I mean, what does that mean for free COVID vaccines? 
I mean, is it no longer —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So are you talking about the booster that’s — that
we’re about to announce?  
   
Q    Well, just —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Or that is first —  
   
Q    — providing for the costs.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So — so let me just be clear: These decisions
about the vaccines, including when will be — who and when will be
eligible are made by FDA and CDC.  So I just want to make sure, based on
their experts and their review, as we talk about vaccines.   
   
So, you know, in the meantime, the administration has been working with
state and local health departments and other partners to prepare
operationally for all scenarios.  
   
This includes working to ensure vaccines remain available in a range of
trusted convenient loca- — locations, including local pharmacies and
community health centers, and easy to access.

So, we’re planning for this.  We’re planning for a robust plan and
education program, and building on our lessons that we had for COVID-19.

And so, you know, while we’re preparing, we are doing so with the
limited funding we have left.  So, we have some funding for this.  We’ve
had to take money away from things like testing, as I just mentioned, to
help fund the procurement of these vaccines.  So, that’s one way, as I
said, we had to be really mindful in why we’re doing the testing — made
the testing announcement. 

So, needs to help strengthen our vaccination program and reach more
folks are limited.  And so, the COVID team will share more on this in
the following — when the decisions are made on how — from the CDC and
FDA — how we’re going to move forward.

But yes, we had to make some tough decisions to make sure that we’re
able to do this fall campaign once the CDC and FDA makes that decision.

Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Q    Thanks.  I wanted to drill down on the degree to which there was
White House involvement in the Trump documents story earlier this year.

Last week, we learned that the Archivist — the Acting Archivist of the
United States approached the White House Counsel and a determination was
reached here to allow the Acting Archivist to make a determination with
respect to executive privilege.

Can you — what more can you tell us about that and why the determination
was reached to defer that to the — to the Archivist?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the — the letter from the National Archivist and
the search are completely different.  We’ve been very clear about that. 
They’re not the same.  And so just want to restate that.

The recently published letter from the Archives is not about the search
and, in fact, underlines how closely the President has honored his
pledge to restore the independence of the Department of Justice
concerning investigations.

If you read the letter, you’ll see that — the way we were able to
defer.  It shows that DOJ made a request for access to an older set of
documents independently and the White House affirmed it, which is
standard.  Nothing unusual there.  And when former President Trump
attempted to assert executive privilege to block the FBI from assessing
the document, President Biden deferred to the National Archives and the
DOJ Office of Legal Counsel on the issue.

So, again, we deferred that decision.  So, this — the decisions here
have been made by the National Archives and the Department of — Justice
Department.

Q    Just to clarify, you’re saying that President Biden himself was
personally approached and he made the decision himself?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I’m saying is the White House was — they’re — we
are the ones that were able to defer, which is we affirmed — which is
normal, nothing unusual — we deferred to the — to the National Archives
and the Department of Justice legal office.  And we let them make the
decision.

It was not made here.  We deferred it so that they can make the
decision.

Q    But just to pin it down: What — are you saying that it was not the
President himself who arrived at the decision or did the President
himself make a decision?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, what I can tell you is the White House affirmed
it.  I can’t — I’ve been asked this question: “Who, specifically?”  I
can tell you the White House, here on this campus — the White House
actually affirmed it and also deferred it.  
Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Continuing on this theme — the President last week
was asked about former President Trump’s claims that he declassified all
these documents.  And President Biden said, quote, “I’m not going to
comment.  I mean, because I don’t know the detail.  I don’t even want to
know.  I’ll let the Justice Department take care of that.”

I understand that he wasn’t given advance notice about the search, the
Justice Department is independent.  But when it comes to national
security questions, shouldn’t the President want to know the details?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, when it comes to national security questions
and even classified materials, it is something that we just don’t speak
to.  We don’t get into information included in the President’s
classified materials or daily briefings on sesinive \[sic\] — on
sensitive national security or intelligence matter.  Right?  That is
something that I wouldn’t even be able to talk about because that is the
protocol that we have here. 

Look, the President was asked a question.  He answered it in — in — as —
as it relates to — right? — this is also relating to — we’ve said this —
any content, anything that’s related to underlying materials related to
this.  This is something that we are just not informed on.

This is something that it is the independence of the Department of
Justice as it relates to ODNI.  That is something that — that assessment
that they are doing that we are not involved, we are not briefed, we are
not aware of.  And I’ll leave it at that.

Q    I just want to be really clear: You can say that he was not briefed
about the warrant execution, but you can’t say whether he’s been briefed
on any —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, no —

Q    — national security issues?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Oh, I — I can tell you right now, when it comes to
the ODNI, the letter, I can surely tell you that the President was not
briefed on that, he was not aware —

Q    I’m not asking about just about the letter —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know — I — but this is all — it’s all connected,
right?  Right?  It’s all connected.  So I’m trying to give you answers
for what I can give you answers to, right?

So I’m sure — we have not been asked about that.  And I’m telling you,
for that particular piece, we were not briefed, we were not made aware
of.  That is something that ODNI — that is their assessment.  That is
something that they’re doing as it relates to the ongoing investigation
that the Department of Justice is doing as it’s connected to national
security materials.

What I can say, if asked — if I’m asked if the President has been
briefed on classified materials — we have said this before at the podium
— it is — it is something that I can’t even speak to, right?  I can’t
even speak to what classified materials he’s been briefed or daily
briefings when it even comes to his PDA \[sic\] — PDB.

That is — it is — it is classified information.  So it is not even
something that we can speak to.  That’s what I’m — I’m spea- — I’m
talking about.

Go ahead.

Q    So, Karine, you’re saying he hasn’t been briefed so far, but are
you implying that he won’t be briefed as long as the DNI assessment is
taking place?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All — I can’t even get into hypotheticals right now. 
I can speak to this moment.  I can speak to what is currently happening
right now, which is — which is we’re just not going to comment on an
ongoing investigation.  Right?  This is an ongoing investigation — an
independent investigation.

We’re just not going to comment.  And we have not been briefed on that. 
I cannot get into hypotheticals.  I don’t know — we don’t know what’s
going to happen next.  So I not going to go into a hypothetical question
of what is going to happen —

Q    Broadly —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — in the future.

Q    Broadly, though, the White House supports this damage assessment?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, this is — again, I’m just — I am just not going
to comment on that.

Q    Was there anybody in the White House who requested this assessment
ahead of time before —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.

Q    Okay.  And then Senator Lindsey Graham said, last night, “there
would be riots in the streets” if former President Trump is prosecuted
for taking classified government documents to Mar-a-Lago.  What is the
White House response to that?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we have — you know, we have seen MAGA Republicans
attack our democracy.  We have seen MAGA Republicans take away our
rights, make threats of violence, including this weekend, and that is
what the President was referring to when you all asked me last week
about the semi-fascism comment.

And he was clear: not all Republicans — there are some mainstream
Republicans — he mentioned the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan and
talked about — about him and what he’s been doing and how he said —
called them out of being that mainstream Republican.

But we have seen these MAGA, extreme Republicans making these kinds of
comments, which is — which is dangerous.  And — and this is what we are
talking about when Joe Biden — when Joe Biden was making his comments —
President Biden was making his comments last week.

Look, this is a President that believes when you are President of the
United States, it is your duty, it is your responsibility to have the
strongest voice of — when it comes to democracy, when speaking about
democracy.  And that’s what you’re going to continue to hear from this
President.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  Just to follow up on the Pennsylvania trip: You
mentioned the assault weapons ban as being kind of a key priority for
the administration.  But are you kind of out of things that you can do
from an executive standpoint?  I know months ago you were reviewing what
other additional executive actions you could take on gun violence.  Are
you — are you out of options there?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I — we don’t have — I don’t have anything else
to share on what else we can do.  But I can say this: This is a
president who has taken the most action — most executive action than any
other President when it comes to curtailing and really dealing with gun
violence.  And that’s how seriously he’s taken this.

I just laid out what he did in the American Rescue Plan — that $350
billion that helped — that went into communities to make sure that
communities were safer.  That’s — only Democrats in Congress voted for
the American Rescue Plan.  That matters. 

He’s going to go tomorrow and talk about what else we are doing as an
administration to make sure that — that we’re — that we’re — that
communities feel safer.

And — but as far as what we’re doing from the — as far as executive
actions, certainly don’t have anything to share to you — for you at this
time.

But he has called — he’s called on Congress to take actions on — on
assault weapons ban, something that we haven’t seen in 30 years.

And you’ve heard him say this: When — when assault weapons ban sunset 10
years after it was put into law — 10 years after he worked very hard to
make sure that we had that piece of legislation — we did see crime go up
with assault weapons ban — assault weapons.

So that is something that the President has been fighting for throughout
his Senate days, as Vice President.  And he’ll continue to fight for
this as President.

Q    And did you have any more color about why this part of Pennsylvania
is the appropriate place for this message?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, no — no specific color on that.  You know,
we’re going to his hometown, which is important to him, which is very
close to him.  But I don’t have any specifics.  It’s just — you know, we
go to — we go to places where we can actually be able to deliver our
message to the American people, especially all the work that we have —
we have done here in Washington with congressional Democrats.   
   
Q    One quick one on abortion.  There’s been kind of a number of
incidents nationwide where medical providers have been unsure if they
can provide certain procedures for women, even if they feel that it’s
medically necessary, if they’re going to run afoul of state law.  What
is kind of the White House guidance to medical providers about whether
they should consider running afoul of state laws in providing medically
necessary abortions?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, this is something that we are acutely aware of,
that certainly that we are a monitoring.  Look, a lot of this is — you
know, when we talk about that MAGA agenda, the MAGA extreme Republicans,
this is it. This is congressional Republicans who are touting this MAGA
agenda, including banning abortion in cases of rape, incest, and the
health of the mother.  And so this is something that the President
certainly is going to call out.  
   
We saw the Texas district court affirm that medical providers can deny
lifesaving and health-preserving care for women, even if they are
suffering from hemorrhaging or life-threatening hypertension. 
Thankfully, we saw in Idaho — a federal Idaho district court determine
that women there will continue to receive lifesaving and
health-preserving emergency care, including abortion care.   
   
But, you know, this is — this is something that the President is going
to continue to speak to: how extreme this agenda is.  The Department of
Justice is looking into it and answering your question.  Again, this is
— you know, we refer folks to them.  They’re going to do what they can
to protect — to protect women as they’re crossing over into states and —
and make sure that, you know, we can do everything that we can so that
women can make their decision — their own decisions — on what they can
do to protect their health and to protect their life.   
   
Q    I guess I’m asking: Should providers risk it?  Like if if — if it’s
a close call on whether it’s legal or not in the state —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   I mean, look, it’s not — it’s not for me to decide. 
Right?  We’re going to do everything that we can to provide any
assistance that we can so that women can get the care that they need. 
Clearly, that’s a decision that they have to make.  The Department of
Justice is doing that every — everything that they can as well in
states, working with states.  We have HHS working with states on how to
provide care for — to women.  You’ve heard us talk about the waivers. 
You’ve heard us talk about the executive actions that the President has
taken.   
   
But again, that is — that is not something that I’m going to speak
directly to.  That is something that they would have to make a decision
on.  And every state is different, right?  Every — every law is
different.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  One thing that the White House has said about the
ODNI’s review is that the White House sees this as appropriate action. 
I wonder whether you could help us understand why the White House sees
this as appropriate — appropriate action, whether that’s based on any
specific concerns that have been discussed within the White House?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   I’m — I’m just not going to get into any anything
further there.  I — again, we have seen the letter from ODNI to Congress
on this.  I would refer you to either ODNI or the Department of Justice
for any specific questions, any underlying materials.  We’re just not
going to speak to this.  This is an assessment that ODNI is doing.  And
we — we did not know anything about this beforehand.  And I’m just not
going to go any further.  
   
Q    Last week, when we were having discussions about the student loan
forgiveness program, the White House made clear that you all see this
program as basically paid for because of the deficit reductions achieved
during the President’s term.  
I wonder if the President is open to pursuing any other programs, any
other actions that could be offset by deficit reductions if it means
that he can pursue his agenda further.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to announce on this.  The
President does believe — and you heard him say this directly, not just
here at the podium — that the amount of deficit reduction we’ve seen is
enough to pay for this program. This is what Bharat — you — I think you
were here when Bharat was our guest just on Friday.  That’s one of the
many reasons this action was — is well justified in our eyes.   
   
And remember, you know, we’re on track to cut, as you were alluding to,
the deficit down by $1.7 trillion by the end of this year, and — and
including the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the deficit by another
trillion over the next decade.  
   
So, the plan the President announced provides important breathing room —
a little bit of that breathing room that he talks about — for
middle-class Americans in particular.  And it goes after — it goes
towards helping targeted Americans who are — 90 percent who are making
less than $75,000 a year.  It is incredibly important, we believe, the
student lan \[sic\] — the student loan plan is, the cancellation plan. 
And he — something that we are very proud of.  And that’s also
historic.  
   
Q    I just had one last quick one.  Is there an official estimate of
additional funding that the administration would want to deal with
monkeypox?  And will there be an official request made to Congress at
some point?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I could say this — I just want to make sure,
because we had some good updates on this on the monkeypox.  I know that
folks were really curious about what we were doing or concerns,
rightfully so.   
   
As you know, we’ve been working day in and day out on — across the
government and with cities and states and healthcare providers, public
health officials, and the impacted community to execute a strategy to
accelerate the fight against the monkeypox outbreak.  We’re making a lot
more doses available and working closely with jurisdictions to
operationalize all of this.  
   
Last week, HHS made 360,000 additional vials of vaccines for
jurisdictions to order.  That is on top of approximately 780,000 vials
that we already delivered that we have talked about here.  Seventy-five
percent of jurisdictions have moved to this method, and another twenty
percent working to do the same.   
   
This is a significant progress in a short term of time and will mean
more shots in arms.  This is a cumulative of 1.1 million vials are
delivered to jurisdictions.  And as we get more supplies, we are
approaching the point where we can offer two doses of vaccine to the
entire high-risk population via intradermal administration.  
   
So, again, this is something that — wanted to just lay that out, because
we have seen some movement, and we’re trying to meet that moment, as we
have talked about.  And that funding that you’re talking about that is
connected to the COVID and the CR, that’s something that we’re going to
continue to work with Congress on to make sure that we have the funding
needed to do the work on monkeypox and also to — the continued work with
COVID.   
   
Q    Do you have an estimate on the funding amount?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have — I don’t have an estimate for you at
this time, but just know that we’re going to continue to work on — with
Congress.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, thank you.  Revisiting the marijuana question, specifically
what John Fetterman is calling on President Biden to do is use executive
authority to de-schedule marijuana as a Schedule I drug.  Several other
Democratic senators have called on the same — called for the same.  Is
President Biden looking at that specific action?  And why hasn’t he
taken that action so far if that’s something he has considered?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, again, we don’t have anything new to share on — or
any announcement to share.  I laid out the President — our drug policy. 
Wanted to just give a little in-depth of what we have done in the last
19 months and what is important to the President.  This is something
that he has talked about — right? — during the campaign.  And you’ve
heard from him many other times talking about the — our — his drug
policy — drug policy focus and what’s important to him.  We just don’t
have anything to speak to.   
   
As I mentioned in April during the Second Chance Month, President Biden
announced 75 sentence commutations and 3 pardons, which are more grants
of clemency at this point than any other President, than any of his five
recent predecessors.  He’s going to continue to evaluate further uses of
his clemency powers.   
   
And as it relates to marijuana decriminalization, just don’t have
anything at this time.  
   
Q    Does the White House believe he has the authority to do that
executive action?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, again, I’m just not going to get into the
specifics.  Look, the administration has made progress on its promises
regarding marijuana.  An example is the DEA issued its first license —
licenses to companies to cultivate marijuana for research purposes after
years of delay during the previous administration.  This is a key step
in promoting research because it broadens the amount and quality of
cannabis available for research purposes.  And we will continue to
explore — explore what else we can do.  
   
As far as reforms, we just don’t have anything to share for you today.  
   
Q    And one last question.  John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee in
Pennsylvania, will not be at the event tomorrow with the President.  Has
he — has their campaign given you a reason?  Is the President
disappointed that he won’t be there for that event?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I can’t speak to — to the lieutenant governor.  My
understanding is he had an existing event.  So I would refer you to his
— to his office or his campaign.  
   
Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Getting back to the FDA authorization of the new
COVID booster vaccine, your answer to Franco.  When you said that you’re
planning for a robust education program and plan, but you said you’re
doing it with “the limited funding we have left.” 

So, just to clarify, when you’re trying to combat some of the hesitancy
questions right now — you know, right now only half of Americans
eligible for a booster have gotten one.  Is the White House — as you
prepare for public messaging ahead of this new shot, are you doing a
more scaled-down version compared to previous rounds because you have
limited funding to do that?  Is this different than what we’ve seen in
previous booster public messaging campaigns?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So it’s going to be a robust education program that —
we’re going to continue to do that.  And we’re going to build on the
lessons we’ve learned and focusing on the most at-risk communities. 
This will include leveraging deep partnerships across sectors to meet
people where they are with facts and answers to questions, and
empowering trusted local messegers \[sic\] — messengers with messaging
they need to engage with their communities about the importance of
vaccination.   
   
So this is what we’ve learned — because we have learned from some
lessons from the COVID-19 outreach, our comprehensive program that we
had from the beginning of this administration.  So we’re going to use
those lessons and — and do that and do the — the things that we’ve
learned that worked for the fall booster campaign.  
   
And, again, we’re going to be — targeted at-risk — at — do a more
at-risk campaign.  It will be robust.  We’re going to make sure that we
have those trusted local messengers, which, by the way — I think you
remember; you covered this so closely last year — it worked.  It
worked.  When you have those trusted voices, that — that does help make
sure that people go get vaccinated and, in this case, get their
booster.  
   
Q    And are there any concerns about supply with this new booster?  And
will everyone who wants to be able to get one be able to get one for
free?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’re — I’m not going to get ahead of the
FDA and CDC.  They’re going to lay out who is going to — who is going to
be able to receive — or how the process is going to go.  And they’re
going to lay that out, so I don’t want to get ahead of them.  
   
But look, I mean, we’ve — that’s why we’re — we’re kind of — we made the
announcement on testing, right?  That’s why we’ve had to, you know,
actually end some things and — and cut some — cut away, take some money
away from things like testing to help — to help fund the procurement of
these vaccines.  And so this is a priority.  We’re going to do the best
that we can to get vaccines to folks — folks who are most at risk, as I
just mentioned.  
   
But, you know, we’re going to continue to do the work that’s needed to
make sure we protect the American public.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  This weekend, we saw U.S. warships going
through the Taiwan Strait.  Considering the buildup of tension since the
Speaker’s visit, what was the necessity of seeing U.S. warships during
this time?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, INDOPACOM put out a statement, as you probably
saw, on Sund- — on Saturday, detailing the transit — the warships that
you’re speaking of — the Navy — the U.S. Navy warships, to be more
specific.  
   
We conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit on August 28th in
accordance with international law and demonstrated our commitment to a
free and open Indo-Pacific, as you’ve heard us say many times before
from this podium and from the President.  
   
As we have said, you will see in the coming days and weeks and months
that our presence, posture, and exercises account for China’s
provocative and destabilizing behavior with a view towards guiding the
situation in Western Pacific towards greater stability.  
   
This is not about U.S.-China.  This is about what is in the interest —
the best interests of — Taiwan’s interests, specifically, and the
region’s interest as well.

So, our policy towards Taiwan has remained consistent for decades and
across administrations.  We remain committed to the — our One China
policy.  And in accordance with that policy, we’ll continue to fly and
sail and operate where international law allows, consistent with our
longstanding commitment to freedom of navigation, as you’ve heard us
say.  And that includes conducting standard air, maritime transit
through the Taiwan Strait.  So, we’re committed to doing that and
protecting the region.  
   
Q    Hey, Karine —

Q    And another topic on —  
   
Q    Karine —  
   
WHITE HOUSE AIDE:  Karine, we got to –- to go.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I got to go?   
   
Q    Sorry, another topic on — on the Iran — potential new Iran deal. 
Iran is studying the U.S. response, but we are — we’re receiving
information here and there about a potential release of prisoners and
all this.  I know you don’t want to negotiate in public —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — but does the administration feel that the discussions are going
in the right direction?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So as far as the status of negotiations, as I said —
as you have said, we’re not going to negotiate in public.   
   
Look, we have taken a deliberate and principled approach to these
negotiations from the start.  If Iran is prepared to comply with its
commitments under the 2015 deal, then we’re prepared to do the same.  
   
As it relates to last week and the EU, we conveyed our feedback about
Iran’s comments on the EU’s proposal directly to the EU.  We will not
negotiate, again, in public, and are going to — not going to go into
details of how the process is going.   
   
I’m going to — go ahead — do —  
   
Q    Karine, I know Abdullah is trying to give you the hook.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I know.  
   
Q    Can you get a few more questions here?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know.  I’m going to take them.  
   
Q    I — thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s why — I could have walked away and not taken
your question, Peter.  But I will take your question.   
   
Q    I’ll make it worth it.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m sure.  I’m sure you will.  
   
Q    Different topic.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    How come migrants are allowed to come into this country
unvaccinated but world-class tennis players are not?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Are you — you’re talking about which world-class
tennis player?  
   
Q    Novak Djokovic.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So as far — you know, just to — just since you asked
about me — about him — you asked me about him.  So, visa records are
confidential under U.S. law.  Therefore, the U.S. government cannot
discuss the details of individual visa cases.  Due to privacy reasons,
the U.S. government also does not comment on medical information of
individual travelers.  
   
As it relates to the tennis — the tennis pla- — player, look, those
questions regarding vaccination requirements is — is — I defer you to
CDC.  This is a CDC requirement for foreign nationals.  This is
something that they decide.  This is — so, this is something that is up
to them — the U.S. Open and their participant protocols.  I’d refer you
to them; they have their own specific protocols as well.   
   
Q    But just —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So they’re two different things.  They’re two —  
   
Q    As — but —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — different things.  
   
Q    But — so, how is it two different things?  Somebody unvaccinated
comes over on a plane; you say that’s not okay.  Somebody walks into
Texas or Arizona unvaccinated; they’re allowed to stay.  Why?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That — but that’s not how it works.   
   
Q    That’s —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Like, we actually —  
   
Q    That’s what’s happening.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.  
   
Q    I know that that’s not what you guys want to happen, but that is
what happ— what is happening.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But that’s not — it’s not like somebody walks over and
— (laughs) — that’s not — that’s not how —  
   
Q    That’s exactly what’s happening.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We — look —  
   
Q    Thousands of people are walking in a day.  Some of them turn
themselves over.  Some of them are caught; tens of thousands a week are
not.  That is what is happening.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let me just lay out what we have done under this
administration:  
   
We have installed new border technology and set up joint protocols with
Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.   
   
We have already made over 3,000 arrests in the first three months of
launching an unprecedented anti-smuggling campaign with regional
partners.   
   
We’ve secured record levels of funding for the Department of Homeland
Security.   
   
We’ve put in place dedicated immigration judges so asylum seekers can
have their cases heard faster.  
   
We’ve expanded la- — labor pathways, including H-2B visas.   
   
And through the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection,
President Biden brought 20 leaders — world leaders together to manage
increased migration flows across the Western Hemisphere.  
   
By contrast, core to the prior administration, immigration strategy was
to build a wall and they couldn’t even come accomplish that in the four
years.  And they also, by talking about building a wall — which would
have taken billions of dollars from veterans, billion dollars from
schools — which is also a policy that just does not work.  It is not
that simple.  It’s not just that people are walking across — across the
border.   
   
We have a — we have a plan in place.  This is not like switching the
lights on.  Right?  This is going to take a process.  We are fixing a
broken system that was actually left by the last administration.   
   
And as it relates to the tennis star, that is totally different.  That
is a different process.  That is the U.S. Open that he is part of, and
there are a CDC — federal guidance —  
   
Q    But —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — that he isn’t — he needs to follow.  
   
Q    But why is there a CDC requirement for people that fly here, as
opposed to people that cross the southern border?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we have talked about Title — we have talked
about Title 42.  Right?

Q    This is not — this has nothing to do with Title 42.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It is.   
   
Q    This is —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Title 42 is the CDC imperative that is —

Q    And you guys got rid of it because you said the pandemic is not —  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s not —

Q    — a big deal anymore.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That is — that is not how it works.  It is not — every
— Title 42 is very much in place, and that is the process.  So there is
a CDC — there is a CDC provision for folks coming through — coming
through the southern border.  It is not just — it is not just for tennis
players.  Migrants have, also, a CDC guidance that we have to follow,
which is Title 42.  So that is not the case.  That is factually wrong. 

Okay.  Go to the back.  Right here.

Q    Yeah, thanks, Karine.  So the jobs numbers are coming out on
Friday.  So should Americans be prepared for job losses to tame
inflation?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I don’t want to get ahead of what we’re going to
see in a couple of days.  We have talked about how we’re coming off a
historic economic growth.  And it’s no surprise that the economy is
slowing down.

You’ve heard me say this, you’ve heard Brian Deese say this, you’ve
heard others from NEC sl- — say this:  slowing down as — as we’re going
into a transition — right? — again, from a historic — from a historic
economy to now a more stable and steady growth.  And that is important.

We see that as an important — as an important next step.  And so — and
we’ve talked about how we’re — as the — as we see the job growth
numbers, we’re expecting that to cool off just — just a bit as we’re
going into that transition, making sure we do not lose the gains that we
have seen this past year.

And right now, we’re still seeing a strong labor market, which matters. 
Consumer spending is strong, which matters.  And — and so, we’re going
to always look at every economic data.  That’s going to be very
important as we move forward and continue to try and deliver lower costs
in particular, which is so important at this time for the American
people.

But I’m not going to get ahead of the numbers.  But we have talked about
how we’re expecting to see a bit of a cooling as we go into a transition
to more stable growth.

Q    So, in that transition then, you’re expecting job losses by the end
of the year?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going — we’ve talked about how we
anticipate a cooling — right? — for the job numbers to — to not be at
the — at the high job growth that we have seen these past several
months.

That is something that we have talked about many times.  Any time you
all ask me about what we expect for jobs numbers, we always talk about
“we expect a cooling,” especially as we’re in a transition for a stable
and steady growth.  And that is something that is important as we’re
looking at the resiliency of our economy.

Okay.  I’m trying to see — go ahead.

Q    Thanks.  I wanted to go back to what you were saying about the
COVID-19 rapid tests.  Is it that you need more money to buy more tests
or you’re out of money to send the tests? What’s the funding issue
exactly that prompted you to shut this down for now?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’ve been very clear that the COVID-19 response
funding needs — needs for months, right?  We’ve talked about it.  You’ve
heard us talk about it in here.  You’ve heard the COVID Response Team
talk about it.  You’ve heard the President talk about it.  We’ve warned
that the congressional inaction would force unacceptable trade-offs and
harm our preparedness and response, and that consequences would be
likely worsened over time.  And that is what you’re seeing here.

So this is an action we’ve been forced to take because of the lack of
funding and not continuing getting that funding that we need from
Congress that will help preserve our limited remaining supply.  That’s
what we’re seeing.

So, ensuring we have limited supply of tests available in the fall —
right?  We are — we are preparing — that’s what we’re doing in this
administration.  We make sure that we prepare for what can come next. 
And so — you know, what we might face: a new rise in infections and more
acute need.  So that’s why we’re taking this action so we have some
limited supply for down the road.

But again, we’re going to continue to call on Congress for the funding. 
We’re going to continue to work with Congress to get that extra
funding.  But that’s what you’re hearing from this announcement.  Yes,
we had to make some tough decisions, and this is part of that.

Q    The other question I wanted to ask you is on Afghanistan,
specifically the Afghans that have come into the country in the last
year and don’t have a path to permanent legal status, or at least not an
easy one.   
   
I wanted to ask: The White House made a push to get Congress to create
such a path earlier this year, and then it kind of cooled down.  With
Congress coming back next week and a lot of these Afghans heading toward
a lot of uncertainty, will the White House make a fresh push on Congress
to get this done?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, this is an issue that’s important to
this President, important to the administration.  I’m going to check in
with our Office of Leg Affairs and the team here to see what the plan is
for the next steps.  We don’t have anything to share specifically on the
legislative component to that.  
   
Q    Okay.  Is there anything else that you can do from an
administration perspective to help these people be able to apply for
asylum more quickly or be able to have that certainty that they know
they’ll be able to stay here long term?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we all know that legislation is always the
best way to move forward with more certainty when it comes to, you know,
asylum or coming here and getting the — getting the security that they
need.   
   
But, look, one of the things that I do want to say is that, you know,
this — the Biden administration — the Biden-Harris administration is
going to continue to demonstrate its commitment to the brave Afghans who
stood side by side with the United States over the past two decades. 
And so that is a commitment that we have made.   
   
And just to give you a little bit of an update on the SIV process,
because we had made some changes to that since taking office: The
President’s — at the President’s direction, we have undertaken
substantial efforts to improve the Afghan Special Immigration Visa — SIV
program — make it more efficient and process SIV applicants more
expeditiously while continuing to safeguard our national security.   
   
Quickly after taking office, President Biden signed an executive order,
as you all know, in February of 2021, requiring agencies to surge
resources, streamline the proc- — the application process.   
   
We’ve restarted SIV interviews — which had been paused by the previous
administration, allowing a massive backlog of applications to build —
and have surged resources to this vital program, increasing the number
of staff processing SIV applications more — by more than fifteenfold.  
   
So, this is something that I wanted to just make sure that you had.   
   
And another update is: As of August 9th, over 17,000 individuals have
submitted all documents required to apply for Chief of Mission review,
or have beyond the Chief of Mission stage.  We’re working to process
those cases as quickly as possible.  The Afghan SIV program remains
active and the Department of State continues to receive the process — to
process new SIV applications as expeditiously as possible.   
   
So anything specific or anything more about that, I certainly would
refer you to Department of State.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you, guys.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  All right.  Thank you.
