James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:37 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Hi, everyone.  Good afternoon.   All right, let’s get
going.  I have some updates on now what — what was once “BIF,” now it’s
“BID.”  And hopefully we’ll get it to “BIB”.  That’s my joke for the
day.  (Laughter.)   All right.  Okay.  (Laughter.)  Thank you so much. 
Get it?  
   
All right, as you all saw yesterday, the President and a bipartisan
group of senators announced a deal on historic infrastructure investment
that will drive economic growth and create good-paying, middle-class
jobs.  The President is deeply thankful to these senators who he’s
worked closely with these past few months.   
   
This will mean breaking — break- — this will mean breakthrough
investments in our roads and bridges, in public transit, in rail,
connecting every American, including undeserved \[sic\] rural areas —
underserved rural areas, to high-speed Internet, the most significant
investment in clean energy transmission and electric vehicle
infrastructure in our history, as well as historic investment in clean
drinking water.   
   
Combined with the President’s Build Back Better agenda, the bipartisan
deal will help us create 2 million jobs a year for the next decade.   
   
This deal is going to create good-paying union jobs building roads and
bridges; working on rail; building unprec- — unprecedented
infrastructure for electric vehicles; replacing poisonous lead water
pipes that are hurting our children; building new, more resilient
structures.  
   
Yesterday, 67 senators — which includes 17 Republicans, 50 Democrats —
voted to move forward with consideration of this pas- — package, which
is not only welcome because of the life-changing benefits, as I just
listed out, this plan would mean for the American people, but also
because of the healthy signal about American democracy it sent to the
world.  And the President’s colleagues in both parties deserve enormous
credit for that.   
   
There’s an incredible — incredibly broad and diverse coalition behind
this deal, as you all know, range — ranging from the Chamber of Commerce
to AFL-CIO, and including the nation’s governors and mayors, building
trades, and majorities of Republican and Democratic voters.  
   
Last week, an analysis led by John McCain’s former economic advisor
found that its benefits would overwhelmingly flow to middle-class and
working families as it helps create millions of jobs.  
   
A new poll out just this morning from Monmouth shows an overwhelming 70
percent of the public supports the infrastructure package.  
   
And the President is also fighting for his Build Back Better Agenda,
which would make transformational investments in human infrastructure
and on climate, on education, the care economy, and on making healthcare
affordable while extending the biggest middle-class tax cut in our
history.  
   
Also, today, GDP numbers — today’s GDP numbers are further proof of the
progress we’ve — we’ve had jumpstarting our economy.  With today’s data,
the U.S. economy has now made up the losses of the last 18 months and
surpassed the pre-pandemic GDP peak.  
   
In fact, in the first year of this — of the first half of this year, the
economy grew at the latest \[fastest\] rate in nearly 40 years.  It took
two years after the last recession to return to the previous level.
 Today, it took half as long.  
   
You can see how — how far we’ve come just by looking at where we were
this time last year.  In the second quarter of 2020, we saw the largest
decline in GDP on record — a decline of more than 31 percent.  
   
That’s the — that’s the story of this President’s economic plan taking
us from the worst time of our economy in history to one of the best.  
   
That reversal is no — no accident.  It’s the result of President Biden’s
plan to curb COVID and deliver economic relief to families, small
businesses, and economic — and communities throughout the country.  
   
At — at that strength isn’t just being reflected in today’s GDP number;
it’s being seen across the economy.  Earlier this month, we learned that
the economy created eight — 850,000 jobs in June, as you all know, with
average of 600,000 jobs created each month since the President took
office.  
   
That’s a total of over 3 million jobs created under President Biden —
more jobs than any other President’s first ha- — first four months in
history.  And importantly, we’re seeing better jobs with higher ra- —
wages across the country.  
   
Recent independent forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office and
the International Monetary Fund both doubled their projections for
America’s economic growth this year to the fastest pace in almost 40
years.  
   
The last time the economy was growing this fast, Ronald Reagan was — was
telling us it was “Morning in America.”  And I think I was about 5 years
old.  So, there’s that.  (Laughter.)  
   
And this boom is backed by other signs across the economy: Consumer
confidence is up, jobs are up, personal income is up, and unemployment
is down in all 389 metro areas in the U.S. compared to last year.  
   
And today, I wanted to provide another update, as Jen has been doing
these past couple of days, on some of the innovative ways we are
reaching Americans on the importance of getting vaccinated.  
   
As we work to get more shots in arms, we’re doubling down on empowering
trusted messengers, which have been key to this process, to talk to
their communities about the vaccines, including doctors across the
country.  We have been working with local doctors and local stations to
get Americans their facts and answer questions.   
   
Since we started this program this summer, this effort has led to more
than 400 original stories and syndicated airings — airings of local
doctors’ interviews for a reach of more than 185 million broadcast and
online impressions.  
   
And, beginning in August, this effort will expand even further with
dozens of local African American doctors from the National Medical
Association joining in, helping us elevate the voices of Black
physicians and reach hard-hit communities.  
   
Finally, a brief preview of the President’s remarks later this
afternoon: The President will deliver remarks on COVID-19 virus about
where he sta- — we stand, the progress we’ve made, and the steps we need
to take now to address rising cases in the nation.  
   
He will send a strong message to all Americans — unvaccinated and
vaccinated — about the need to stay vigilant in our fight against the
virus.  And he’ll make clear that his administration will continue to
provide every resource needed to help communities and individual —
individuals across the country to curb the spread of the Delta variant
and boost vaccinations.  His remarks will highlight several new measures
that his administration will take to accelerate this effort.  
   
And now — and I know you all are eager for specifics on the
announcement, but we’ll have something to share shortly on that.  
   
You want to take it away, Alex?  
   
Q    Sure.  So my first question is going to be on specifics, actually,
so whatever you can share would be helpful.  There’s been a lot of
questions about how exactly it would work.  Will federal contractors be
covered?  How will the federal government collect proof of vaccination? 
And will those who refuse to follow the guidelines be subject to
disciplinary action or termination?  Is there any clarity you can offer
on any of those aspects?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well — so I’m — I don’t want to get ahead of the
President, so I don’t have anything specific to share.  But I’ll say a
little bit more.   
   
I know, you know, the official details on the President’s remarks and
any forthcoming guidance that — that will be coming shortly on federal
workers, as you’re asking about, Alex.  
   
But I — you know, one of the things that I want to kind of touch base on
again, which is what I was talking about — was — which was one of the
things that was under consideration yesterday — I discussed this
yesterday on the plane, on Air Force One, on our way to Pennsylvania —
which is attestation of vaccination.   
   
For those who may not know, it means confirming a vacci- — a vaccination
status or abiding by stringent COVID-19 protocols like mandatory mask
wearing, even in communities not with high or substantial spread, and
regular testing for federal employees is one op- — and in — is one
option under strong consideration.   
   
This is a — this is a really helpful way to ensure a safe workplace for
employees.  It also is not dissimilar to some of the protocols that you
all have put in place in some of the new — news room that you work in —
including Fox, Peter, who, to my understanding, is — is asking for
self-attestation to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.  So, this is
not an unusual matter.   
   
So we understand that there’s significant weight to what the federal
government handles — how the federal government handles reentry.  And a
key goal of ours is to ensure we have a sustainable model to keep
employers across the country — to make sure that they work in a safe
workplace.  
   
Q    And then on the SIV arrivals that are coming, can you tell us
anything more about that?  Are they coming tonight or tomorrow?  Are
they coming out of commercial charter, military flight?  And do you know
where they will be distributed when they arrive in the U.S.?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, the President, as you know, said clearly
that he is — he is committed to making sure that the people who helped —
who helped us these past 20 years are also taken care of and being
helped as well.   
   
Look, you know, I can tell you that the President set a clear goal.  We
will begin relocating eligible and interested Afghan SIV applicants and
their families before the end of this month.  We’re getting close to
that.  This is a whole-of-government, 24/7, worldwide effort, as you all
can imagine, and we intend to meet the President’s goals.  
   
Out of just extreme caution, as you can imagine, Alex and others, and
consideration for their safety and security and privacy of the Afghan
special immigrants and fa- — and their families, we’re not going to
discuss or confirm any details of flights at this time.  
   
Q    And then one more on the GDP report that you mentioned. While it
showed strong economic growth, it also suggested that employers are
having trouble rebuilding their inventory and may have trouble, sort of,
selling goods in the coming months.   
   
And while you guys have said that inflation is just an immediate
concern, doesn’t that suggest that there could be lingering inflation
effects in the long run if companies are not able to build some of those
— those inventories because of supply chain bottlenecks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, just to say a little bit more, just to reiterate —
like today’s GDP numbers are further proof of the progress we’ve made in
jumpstarting our economy, as I mentioned.   
   
With today’s data, the U.S. economy has now made up the losses of the
last 18 months and surpassed the predemic \[sic\] peak — pre-pandemic
peak, as I mentioned.  
   
In fact, the last half — the last first half of the year, the economy
grew at the fastest rate in nearly — early — nearly 40 years, and it
took two years after the last recession to return to the previous level;
today, it took half as long.   
   
You know, just to give you a little bit more: Just one year ago, CBO
predicted real GDP would be 3 percent below its pre-pandemic peak in the
second quarter of 2021.  Today, we learned that thanks to the shots in
arms and checks in pockets, it’s now above the peak.   
   
You can see how far we’ve come just by looking at where we were this
time last year.  In the second quarter of 2020, we saw the largest
decline in GDP on record — a decline of more than 31 percent.  
   
That’s — that’s basically the story of the President’s economic plan. 
This is what he has talked about for some — for some time, especially
when you look at his economic policy, making sure that no one is left
behind.  This is part of — as we can imagine, as we’ve talked about —
the Build Back Better Plan.  
   
As it relates to the inflation and this GDP report, you know, we knew
the restarting the economy from a standstill in the middle of a pandemic
would represent some challenges along the way, but experts inside and
outside the administration believe that the data show that most of the
price increases we are seeing are expected to be temporary.   
   
And so, this is why we continue to push for sustainable, smart policies
and investment, like the Build Back Better Plan, which the President is
going to continue to work hard towards.   
   
As I mentioned, this is his economic policy that he’s talked about for
the past year that started with the campaign, and it’s really to make
sure that we do not leave anyone behind.   
   
Q    Now that you’ve got the infrastructure deal, does the President now
turn his attention to the reconciliation bill?  And does he hope to
bring some Republicans along?  Or do you believe you’ll just have to
rely strictly on Democratic votes?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, so as you can imagine, the President — this is
just the beginning of the process.  The President is committed to his
Build Back Better plan, as I was just mentioning, which includes the
reconciliation plan.  
   
You know, as you can imagine, the President is going to continue to talk
to congressional members on both sides of the aisles, as he’s been doing
this past six months, to make sure that he gets support for something
that is incredibly important to the American public.   
   
Q    Okay.  And secondly, Iran has said they won’t return to the nuclear
talks until their new president is in power, which takes place on August
5th.  Do you think the talks will resume then?  How long are you willing
to wait?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say this — the timing for the seventh round
has not yet been announced, as you all know.  And we’re not going to
speculate to when that will be.   
   
Look, we’ve demonstrated time and again that we’re prepared to move
forward with a mutual return to the compliance with the JCPOA, the Iran
nuclear deal.  When Iran is done with its presidential transition
process, we are prepared to plan our return to Vienna to continue with
our talks.  
   
We remain interested in seeking mutual return to compliance with the
JCPOA, though, as the Secretary has made clear — Secretary Blinken —
this offer will not be on the table indefinitely.  So, this is something
that we are still moving forward with and determined to make happen.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Karine, can you tell me if you have a ballpark estimate of the
percentage of the federal workforce that you believe is still
unvaccinated?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have that number to share with you at this
time.  So, I’m happy to check with our team, but I don’t have a number
to share on that.  
   
Q    And do you believe that the President’s announcement today — is one
of the goals of this to spark more private businesses to follow suit, as
we’ve already seen in the last coming days?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, you know, I don’t want to get ahead of the
President’s announcement.  But like I said when talking about today, you
know, the federal government — we see ourselves as a model for other —
for other companies and other organizations.  And that’s something that
we don’t take lightly.   
   
But, as you can imagine, the President’s goal — you know, he’s going to
talk about this — and the President’s goal these last six months is to
really work to curb this pandemic, this virus, to fight against it, but
it’s going to take all of us.  It’s going to take all of us to do
that.   
   
And our push, our message continues to be: We have to make sure that
people get vaccinated.  And we’re going to continue to do that, as we’ve
done these last six months.   
   
Q    Thanks so much, Karine.  We have heard from some associations ahead
of the President’s announcement today — the Federal Law Enforcement
Officers Association says  
Americans have a right to privacy and choice.  They’re accusing your
administration of pushing people to undertake a medical procedure.  Are
you expecting resistance to this announcement?  And what is your
response to that?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say — I’ll say this: Look, our priority is
the American people.  We have to make sure people are safe and we’re
continuing to save lives.  That is the most important thing.  That’s how
this President sees this.  
   
We listen to the science, and we provide Americans the information they
need to protect themselves and help end this pandemic.  That is key
here.  That is critical and important.  And that is why we have strongly
encouraged Americans to get fully vaccinated, taken unprecedented action
to make it easier and convenient.   
   
It’s very easy to get vaccinated.  Just go to Vaccines.gov and make an
appointment and get vaccinated.  It’s so important, not just to protect
yourself, but to protect your family.   
   
And so that is the goal here.  This is what we want to do.  We want to
continue to make it easy and convenient for Americans to get a shot. 
And we’ve gotten more than 300 million shots in arms.  Sixty percent of
the population is now fully vaccinated.  That includes 80 percent of our
most vulnerable — 65 and older.   
   
And so this is what the President is working towards.  That’s what we
need to do and continue to do that.   
   
So, you know, I — again, I can’t get ahead of the forthcoming
announcement, but here’s what I’ll say: First, what I laid out as a
strong consideration is a choice — it is a choice that employees will be
able to make because largely unvaccinated people continue to spread the
virus, and until we have more people who are vaccinated and are curbing
the spread, there needs to be proper protocols to keep Americans
safe.   
   
And as a large employer — the largest in this country — who cares about
the individuals who keep the government running, we have an obligation
to be good stewards of the workforce and ensure their health and their
safety.   
   
We’re taking action to protect the federal workforce so that they can
continue to execute on the hard and important work of government.   
   
And just lastly, the forthcoming protocols, much of what is discussed
yesterday is not dissimilar to so many other workplaces as well.  
   
Go ahead, Kelly.  
   
Q    Just to follow up really quickly: Will there be any changes to how
frequently the President and the people around him are tested?  We were
told when the breakthrough cases were happening here at the White House
that the President is tested every two weeks, some people around him are
tested every two days.  Any changes to that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything new to provide on that.  We’ll
probably have some more information forthcoming.  But as you can
imagine, we’re going to continue to follow the CDC guidelines.  
   
Q    For people’s expectations, if they’re federal workers and they
choose not to be vaccinated, would they be responsible for the testing
protocols themselves?  Would that be provided by the federal
government?   
   
And then when we look at things like masks returning and so forth, does
the President feel he needs to set any kind of new timetable for
people’s expectations about how long this new posture, given the Delta
variant, might last?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything further on your first
question, Kelly.  So, I’ll let the President speak to that very, very
soon — in about a little bit more than an hour, he’ll lay out his plans
and what he’s — wants to talk to the American people about.  
   
To your — to your other question — can you repeat that again?  
   
Q    Setting expectations.  Since people are wearing masks now in D.C.,
we’ve got indoor mask requirements that’s happening in a lot of places
around the country.  We know just a few weeks ago the President had a
very different approach.  The science has changed, we’re told.  Is he
going to try to set expectations for the public?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I think the President, you know, I don’t — there’s
not a goal or ex- — you know, anything like that that we’re putting
forth at this moment.  What we want to make sure is that we get our
message out there and make sure people are getting vaccinated.  That is
what the science tells us, that’s how we’re going to curb this pandemic
is making sure that people get vaccinated.   
   
That’s what the President tries to do every time — almost every time he
is at the podium or speaking to the American people, he says that.  He
did that yesterday when I was with him in Pennsylvania.  He started at
the top of his remarks talking about how this is a pandemic for the
unvaccinated and it continues to be.  So that’s what he’s going to be
working towards.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  So, President Biden says that we are not
returning to lockdowns, shutdowns, and school closures, but he also once
said that we didn’t have to wear masks anymore once we were vaccinated. 
So, why should Americans trust him now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, because we listen to the scientists; we listen
to the expert.  This is a public health situation.  This is not about
politics at all.  This is about saving lives.  And this is what the
President is all about.   
   
He wants to make sure that we are saving lives.  If you look at, Peter,
the last six months, that’s what he’s done every day.  And we — and you
see that in the numbers.   
   
Now we’re at a point where we have to double down and make it very, very
clear to people that we can’t — we can’t let the pandemic win.  We have
to continue to fight.  
   
Q    So if you’re listening to the science, if scientists come to you at
some point down the line and say, “It is our opinion that there should
be shutdowns and there should be school closures,” you would do that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we listen to — like I said, we listen to the CDC
and the expert and their guidance.  Our — you know, our — the CDC is a
body that is very well respected.  And we fol- — again, we follow their
guidance.  
   
Q    And after this new guidance came out, the head of the American
Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten, came out to say, “We’re going
to try to open up schools.”  Is that good enough for the President —
just trying?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, the President and the Secretary of Education has
been very clear: By this fall, they want to see all schools open. 
They’ve been very clear about that the last six months.  That’s why, in
the historic American Rescue Plan that that he signed into law in April,
there are resources in that plan to make sure that schools are able to
open up safely, that schools have the resources to get — to have the
PPE, to get that ventilation.  And so, the President had that in mind
when he signed — when he put together that plan and signed it.  
   
Q    But now that — after the plan was out there, now, after this new
guidance, the teachers are saying they’re just going to “try.”  Is that
okay?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we’re going to continue to work closely, as we
have, with local governments, with the teachers, as we’ve done and have
— and continue to have those conversation.   
   
I want to add, though, that nearly 90 percent of teachers are currently
vaccinated.  That’s a good sign.  Now we just have to make sure we also
protect our kids — right? — in school; we protect their — we protect the
other administrators at school, people who have — who are
immunocompromised.  And that’s why the CDC put out that guidance, making
sure that people are wearing masks in schools.  
   
Q    And last one — just because you talked about this administration
having a priority of protecting the American people: Can you help us
understand why is it that the federal government is asking vaccinated
Americans to wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19, but at the same
time, federal agents are also releasing COVID-19-positive border
crossers into small towns in Texas?  How is that stopping the spread?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let’s step back for a second because I’ve — you
know, this is —  
   
(Weather alert sounds.)  
   
Oh, okay.  Very interesting.  I’m sure everything is fine.  (Laughter.) 
Um —  
   
Q    Something I said?  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It could be me.  It may — but, you know, you did laugh
at my joke, so maybe that’s a reaction to laughing at my joke.  
   
Okay.  So let’s — I just want to be very clear here — I do want to
answer your question, Peter.  
   
First, just to step back and do this 30,000-foot view: There’s been no
change in Title 42.  Families and single adults are expelled, if
possible, when apprehended at the southern border.  The majority of
apprehensions that we saw at the border in June were expelled.  Those
who can’t be expelled or are — or are awaiting processing are often
placed in alternative — alternatives to detention programs while their
cases are being reviewed.  
   
CBP provides a migrant with PPE from the moment — from the moment they
are taken into custody, and migrants are required to keep masks on at
all times, including when they are transferred or in the process of
being released.  If anyone exhibits signs of illness in CBP custody,
they are referred to local health systems for appropriate testing,
diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.  CBP takes its responsibility to
prevent the spread of communicable diseases very, very seriously.  
   
We value our partners in local communities whose work is critical to
moving individuals safely out of custody and through the appropriate
immigration pathway, and assist in mitigating COVID-19 and isolating,
quarantining when needed.   
   
So, that’s — that’s what I have for you, Peter.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I know you don’t have a number, but so we
understand the changes that the President is going to announce, what is
the current policy for federal workers reporting their vaccination
status, you know, getting tested?  What does that look like?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to not get ahead of the President here,
again.  
   
Q    No, I mean, right now.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share with you about what the
current policy is at this moment.  I’m happy to go back and check with
the team and see what we can get from that from — for you on that, but I
also don’t want to get ahead of the President.  He’ll talk about this
himself, and I just don’t want to get ahead of him.  
   
Q    Okay.  So nothing to share on whether workers have to report
anything?  Or —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I don’t have anything to share.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, yesterday, some federal whistleblowers came
forward to raise concerns about the conditions inside the Fort Bliss HHS
facility housing migrant children.  They reported inadequate mental
health services, filthy conditions, mismanagement.  Has the President
been briefed on this?  Or are there any steps being taken to
investigate?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I have not spoken to the President about this.  I
have not myself have seen this report to be able to talk to him about
this.  Let me, you know, check in with our team.  
   
As you could imagine, the safety of migrants, the safety of young — of
young people is incredibly important to us since they are in our care,
as you can imagine.  And so this is something that I’ll check with our —
with our team on.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Jenny.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  On the eviction moratorium, which expires at
the end of this week — and we all saw Jen’s statement on this — my
colleagues just reported that congressional Democrats are seeking to
extend that through December.  Does the White House support Congress
extending it to that deadline, or do you have a different deadline in
mind?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me step back for a second because this is an
incredibly important issue, as you could imagine, to the American
people.  So, given the recent spread of the Delta variant, including
among those Americans both most likely to face evictions and lacking
vaccinations, the President — President Biden would have strongly
supported a decision by the CDC to further extend this eviction
moratorium to protect renters at this moment of heightened
vulnerability.  Unfortunately, as some of you might know, the Supreme
Court has made clear that this option is no longer available.  
   
In June, when CDC extended the eviction moratorium until July 31st, the
Supreme Court’s ruling stated that clear and specific congressional
authorization via new legislation would be necessary to the CDC to
extend moratorium past July 31st.   
   
And so, in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, you know, the President
is going to work with Congress to make that happen, and that is
something that they’re working on while — we’ll probably, hopefully, be
working closely with them on that.  
   
Q    One follow-up on that.  Some lawmakers, including Maxine Waters,
are also pushing the CDC to just extend the moratorium again and then
challenge the courts to overturn it.  So, if the congressional route
doesn’t work in the timeframe that you have, why not go that route and
see what the Supreme Court does?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let me just share a little bit about what we
have been doing.  So, we will continue an all-of-government effort to
keep Americans safe and housed through the swift dispersal of Emergency
Rental Assistance to states and cities, which has been pretty — which
has been incredibly important to the American people.  And so, we’re
going to make sure we get the word out and so that people know that the
availability of rental assistance is out there and to support grantees
in ramping up their efforts.  
   
Yesterday, we held a Day of Action to promote the availability of rental
assistance, which reached tens of millions of Americans.  Last week, the
Treasury released new data on Emergency Rental Assistance Program, which
showed that more than $1.5 billion in assistance was delivered to
eligible households in the month of June — more than what was provided
in the previous five months combined.  So, in June alone, this
assistance served nearly 300,000 households, preventing them from facing
eviction proceedings.   
   
And these funds that I’m talking about current — right now can continue
to be dispersed to renters and landlords in need until 2025.  So, these
Emergency Rental Assistance funds do not expire when the moratorium
lifts.   
   
We’re engaged on an all-of-government effort to help states and
localities put additional protections in place, including encouraging
diversions proceedings so renters have the opportunity to stay in their
homes.   
   
And so that’s what we’re doing on the government side, and we will
continue to work with Congress.  
   
Q    And then, lastly, on the GDP numbers, given obviously the surge in
the Delta variant and the lower-than-expected number today, does the
White House still believe that the emergency unemployment benefits
should expire in September?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, it’s — it’s set to expire in September, as you
just mentioned.  That is something that we’re going to keep — you know,
keep look — keep an eye out.  
   
Look, our country and our economy are in a much stronger place than we
were in January.  That’s just a fact.  I talked about the — the 3
million — the more than 3 million Americans who are back at work.  And —
you know, and unemployment claims have more than halved.  
   
So we know the vaccines are working, including — including against the
variants, at protecting against severe cases, deaths, and
hospitalization.  And so, when it comes to the economy, there are no
significant signs at this point of the Delta variant’s impact, and would
expect that much of the economy impact would be felt in the communities
with lower vaccination rates, as we’ve been talking about.  That’s why
we’re doubling down on our efforts to ensure we’re reaching Americans
with vaccine where they are.  So that’s going to be our focus in the
meantime.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I know you don’t want to get ahead of the
President’s remarks, but I wanted to ask about the stra- — communication
strategy.  
   
You’ve been calling this the “pandemic of the unvaccinated.”  The
“pandemic of the unvaccinated.”  But that’s not really the case. 
Vaccinated people are getting it.  They’re spreading the virus.  Even if
they’re not hospitalized, you know, why does the White House feel that
calling it the “pandemic of the unvaccinated” is effective?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let me — let’s just bring that back just a
second.  We are seeing breakthrough cases with people who are
vaccinated, but not at — at a low — at a low rate.  So just want to not
scare people and make it sound like every vaccinated person is — is
getting the Delta — the variant, which is not the case.  It is small,
lower cases and — with breakthroughs, in particular, of people who are
vaccinated.  
   
But what has changed, as you know, is: Because the people who — the
vaccinated folks who are having those breakthroughs, they can spread it
now.  And so that is something — that is something that we should be
concerned about, which is why the CDC guidance has changed, which is why
we’re asking people to — they are asking people to wear a mask outside,
and — I’m sorry, not outside — indoors, inside.  And so we’re asking
people to mask up.   
   
So, the thing is, if people were to get vaccinated, then we would be in
a better place to beat back the virus, including the Delta variant.  And
so we have to continue to make sure — we have to continue to make sure
the unvaccinated are getting vaccinated.  You know, that’s — I mean,
when we were talking about this two months ago, the Delta variant was at
1 percent — at 1 percent.   
   
     And so — and we were seeing — you know, we were vaccinating people,
we were seeing the numbers go up in vaccinations.  
   
And now we’re at a point where, you know, people are just not doing
that.  And we know — we know for a fact it’s easy to get that vaccine. 
It’s free.  It’s accessible.  
   
So, we — that’s why we’re saying it is the pandemic of the — of the
unvaccinated, because that is why we’re seeing this variant really
taking — taking over in hospitals right now.  Hospitalization — more
than 97 percent are people who are not vaccinated.   
   
Q    Can I also ask you about — the President is reportedly meeting with
some Democrats about protections for DREAMers.  Can you talk about that
meeting?  
   
And can you also share what type of concrete action is the President
going to be doing moving forward on this?  When are we going to see the
President use some of the kind of political muscle that he has on other
priorities — say, getting out on the road, for example?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Well, he’s having this meeting today with
congressional members.  I think that’s one way that he’s, you know,
moving forward and being very active on this.  He talked about it.  He
was asked about it when — during his town hall, last week in Ohio.  He
was incredibly passionate, as you probably remember, in talking about
DACA.  
   
So, you know, in light of the ruling on DACA recently, the President
wanted to hear from legislators on this and discuss the path forward on
DACA.  To your point, he is being active in this process.   
   
And as you all know, the same day, President Biden said that the
Department of Justice intends to appeal this decision in order to
preserve and fortify DACA.  And so that’s incredibly important.  
   
And as the Court recognized, the Department of Homeland Security plans
to issue a proposed rule concerning DACA in the near future.   
   
The President also repeatedly called on Congress to pass the American
Dreams Act and Promise Act.  So, today, he’s meeting with Congress and
going to have a conversation on a path forward.  So he is, indeed, very
engaged.  
   
Q    Why not put it on the guidance?  The meeting was not on the
guidance.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, because it’s not a public meeting.  It’s a
meeting to have a real discussion with congressional members on how to
move forward.  
   
Q    Will the President, as Commander-in-Chief, require members of the
military to get vaccinated?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share — more to share on that
particular — particular piece.  As you can imagine, this is — this is —
this — these are decisions that, you know, departments and agencies have
to make.  And they’re — you know, they’re not easy decisions to make.   
   
The VA was able to do that.  They had to go through their process to
make that happen, and it was specific for folks who are dealing in the
public health sector.  
   
Q    And a quick follow-up.  So would President Biden be comfortable
with unvaccinated members of the military going to places around the
world where vaccines are not widely and readily available to those
populations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not — I’m not going to get ahead of — again,
the President is going to be speaking in not — in less than an hour, so
I don’t want to get ahead of him.  Clearly, his goal is to make sure
that people are safe.  He wants to make sure his military members are
safe as well.  And so that is what he’s going to lay out today in his
speech.  
   
Q    A question about the unvaccinated.  Based on the administration’s
outreach to communities, does the White House know more about why
certain Americans are still hesitant or resistant to getting the
vaccine?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, as you know, it’s an individual choice.  There
are reasons for many — for different Americans to — or people who are
living — living here to not get the vaccine.  But our job is to make
sure that we continue to have trusted voices, to make sure that we
listen to the science, to make sure that we have that public health
education out there, to let people know how important it is to get
vaccinated.   
   
I don’t know, you know, the different reasons of why people are not
getting vaccinated.  There are an array of reasons — misinformation is
one of them; disinformation is one of them, which we had — the Surgeon
General was here, not too long ago, talking about that and what — the
data that he had to share and how dangerous that was — or that is — to
many Americans.  
   
But our job right now, and as we have continued — as we’re going to
continue to do, as we have done, is to make sure we get that information
out there and people understand and listen to the science and the health
experts and get vaccinated.  
   
Q    And with some major companies announcing new vaccine policy, what
is the White House’s position or guidance to companies thinking of
implementing similar mandates or requirements?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know — are you talking about verification —
vaccine verification?  Or —  
   
Q    Yeah.  Or, for instance, we learned today Danny Meyer is mandating
employees and indoor diners to be vaccinated (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we’re not — we’re — as you know, we’re not going
to mandate — you know, we’re not going to do the mandating across the
board for the American people.  What we’re going to continue to do is
listen to the guidance — the CDC guidance — listen to the experts, and
follow what they tell us to do.   
   
And — but we’re not going to be mandating anything from here.   
   
Q    Does the White House, though, encourage companies to implement
their own stricter policy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, they — yeah, they have the flexibility to do
that.  They are private companies, private organizations.  They have the
flexibility to do that — to put in mandates that works for them; that’s
important to keeping their — you know, their staff safe.  And that is
important.   
   
Q    I’m told we have to wrap.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Oh, okay.  I’ll ta- — I’ll take one more.  
   
Q    Karine, can I ask a question on travel restrictions?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you very much.  What is the difference to the administration
between a vaccinated American traveling to Europe or the UK, or any
other country that the U.S. has travel restrictions on, and potentially
bringing back the Delta variant or some other strain of COVID, and
someone who’s vaccinated from one of those countries coming here and
potentially bringing one of those variants with them?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me — well, you know, the travel restrictions
comes off — comes up often.  I’ll say this for now: The administration
understands the importance of international travel and is united in
wanting to reopen the international travel in a safe and sustainable
manner.  The reopening process is guided by the science and public
health.  
   
Given where we are today with the Delta variant, as you just — you were
just laying out, Francesca, the United States will remain exist- —
existing travel restriction at this point for a few reasons.  The more
transmittable Delta variant is spreading both here and around the
world.  Driven by the Delta variant, cases are rising here at home,
particularly among those who are unvaccinated, and appear likely to
continue — to increase in the weeks ahead.  And the CDC just advised
Americans against travel to the UK this past Monday, given their surge
in cases.   
   
Any travel from any other countries, I would refer you to them.  
   
Q    And if I could just —  
   
Q    But what is the basis for the travel restrictions?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We can talk about this another time.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks — thanks, everybody.  I’ll see you tomorrow.
