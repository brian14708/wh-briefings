MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  In the birthplace of American democracy, President
Biden will articulate how to meet the greatest threat to the right to
vote and the integrity of our elections since the Civil War, renew his
call for vital legislation to overcome the rash of anti-voter legis- —
laws motivated by the Big Lie, and underline the all-of-government
efforts the Biden-Harris administration launched to use the powers of
the executive branch to protect and advance the sacred constitutional
right to vote.  
   
The President will highlight that the greatest irony of the 28 voter
suppression laws that have been passed across 17 states this year alone
is that the 2020 election stands as a model for the trustworthiness and
precision of our system, given that over 80 judges, including judges
appointed by his predecessor, threw out every challenge to it.  
   
The President will give Democrats credit for unanimously voting to
advance the For the People Act and decry the Republican obstruction of
its path, and he will reiterate that the work to pass it and the John
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement are only beginning.  
   
He will also blast the denial of the right to vote as grounded in
autocracy, under- — undemocratic and un-American and unpatriotic.  
   
And he will note that while voter suppression — that vote — while voter
suppression that these 21st century Jim Crow laws represent is sadly not
unprecedented in American history, these new insidious moves to empower
partisans over independent election authorities, in terms of who counts
the votes, are new and extremely dangerous.  
   
Such efforts, which could allow partisans to throw out the votes of
anyone for made-up reasons, are the most significant threat to today to
the integrity of our elections and to the security of the right to
vote.  
   
The President will call for a new coalition made up of advocates,
activists, students, faith leaders, labor leaders, and business execs —
executives to overcome this un-American trend and meet the moment as far
as turnout and voter education.  
   
The President will repeat that these are the most egregious attempts to
harm the integrity of our democracy since the Civil War, but that if we
show the will to save and strengthen our democracy, this can be turned
back.

Also, this week, the Vice President will meet with the Texas legislators
who broke quorum to block legislation that would have made it
significantly harder for the people of Texas to vote.

There is growing bipartisan momentum in Congress as we look towards the
— the historic framework that came together — the bipartisan framework —
that this is the product of hard work — which was a product of hard work
by Democrats and Republicans and which would make the most significant
investment in our roads and bridges since the creation — the creation of
the Interstate Highway System; connect every American to broadband,
including in underserved rural areas; stop our children from drinking
poisoned water that can impact them for life; secure our leadership in
the clean energy economy; and make the biggest investments in American
rail since Amtrak.

As Senator Portman said yesterday, people want to see our infrastructure
be improved.  They’re tired of waiting in traffic during their rush-hour
commute.  People are tired of worrying about lead pipes.  It’s very
popular because it’s something people know — know is needed.

And just this morning, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, on a bipartisan
basis, wrote to both chambers of Congress, advocating for quick passage
of the framework.  They wrote, “The bipartisan infrastructure framework
is crucial to making meaningful progress on one of the most pressing and
unifying challenges facing our country…  we believe that this framework
deserves bipartisan support in the United States Senate and United
States House of Representatives.”  The American people are calling out
for these investments, and we’re going to deliver.

One last thing, following up on Jen’s announcement of us continuing to
read out some of the innovative activities we are doing to get more
Americans vaccinated: Tomorrow, Olivia Rodrigo will come to the White
House to meet with the President and Dr. Fauci, and record videos about
the importance of young people getting vaccinated, including answering
important questions young people have about getting vaccinated.  The
videos will be featured on Olivia’s channels — 28 million-plus followers
across the channels and the White House social pages.  
   
With that, I will take the first question.

Q    Yesterday, Senator Sanders — Bernie Sanders came out of the White
House and said, in essence, to ask him — meaning the President — to stay
the negotiations on the reconciliation bill — in particular, where
things stand with a topline number.  Can you give us an update on
that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  They — look, the President and Senator Sanders — who
have worked closely together and they have, as you know, a friendship, a
relationship — they agree that the budget resolution must include key
priorities, including universal pre-K, extending the Child Care Tax
Credit, tax incentives and rebates for electric — electric vehicles.  
   
Senator Sanders is continuing to negotiate a resolution package, and the
President is confident that we’ll pass something similar to his Build
Back Better agenda.  We leave that process to — to Congress.  
   
Q    Was there a discussion of a topline figure?  Senator Sanders had
suggested up to $6 trillion.  Where does the President stand on that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  There’s nothing more that I can read out.  He is
leaving that to Congress on — on those pieces of the pieces of
legislation, including the monetary component of it as well.  
   
Q    Is the President going to mention the filibuster today in his
speech?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  As you could imagine, the President — the President
believes that we have to make the filibuster work the way it used to. 
He has talked about this.  As a senator for 36 years, he understands how
this process works.   
   
We have to make people stand there and command floor; this is the
talking filibuster that he has spoken to many times.  From 1970 to 1971,
it was invoked 58 times.  Last year alone, there were five times that
many.  For example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and
talk and talk until you collapse.  And guess what?  People got tired of
talking, filibuster broke down, and we were able to break the
filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.   
   
So, his position hasn’t changed on this.  He sees this as a, you know,
Senate procedural process.  But he has talked about the talking
filibuster many times.   
   
Q    Does the President plan to meet with the Texas Democrats that are
in Washington?  And does he think they are doing the right thing by
fleeing Texas?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say this, Weijia: The Texas legislation is
part of a concerted attack on our democracy being advanced in state
houses across the country on the basis of the same repeatedly disproven
lies that led to the assault on our nation — nation’s Capitol on January
6th.  
   
The President’s message in Philadelphia today is simple and
straightforward: The most funda- — foundational right is the right to
vote freely and fairly, and have that vote counted.   
   
The fact of the matter is that the Texas legislation would make it
harder to vote in a state where it is already too hard for many to
vote.  As you’ve heard from the President, he has said that the Texas
anti-voter bill is part of an assault on democracy that we’ve seen far
too often this year, and often disproportionately targeting Black and
brown Americans.  It’s wrong and it’s un-American.  
   
I don’t have a specific announcement on when he will be meeting — or if,
I should say — with the Texas legislators, but he applauds their
courage.  And this adds to the urgency for passage of the For the People
and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, along with the
all-of-government effort we have launched, and the movement he’s calling
for today — to overcome this moment with voter turnout and voter
education.

Q    Do you know — you said the Vice President is going to meet with the
Democrats.  Do you have any more information on that — when and where it
will be?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t.  It’s going to be sometime this week she’ll
be meeting with them.

Q    Karine, do you have any updates on either Haiti or Cuba?  The
President, yesterday, said that, you know, he’s looking at options to
support folks in both those countries.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you mentioned, Justin, the President said
yesterday, “We are careful- — we are closely following the developments
in Haiti in the wake of the horrific assassination of the — of their
President that recently took place.”  We reiterate our deepest
condolences to the family of President Moïse and to the Haitian people,
and wish First Lady Martine Moïse a swift recovery.   
   
And to echo the President: The people of Haiti deserve peace and
security, and Haiti’s political leaders need to come together for the
good of their country.   
   
As you all know, the President dispatched a high-level interagency
expert delegation to assess the situation and to determine whether
United States can offer our support.  We are in close consultation with
the Haitian government.  And we will — he said, even yesterday, he’ll
have more to share in the upcoming days.  
   
As for Cuba, yesterday, as well, the President recognized the protests
that are happening in Cuba, calling them “remarkable,” saying that the
Cuban people are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian
regime.   
   
The President reiterated that the United States stands firmly with the
people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights.  And he called on
the government of Cuba to refrain from violence or attempts to silence
the voice of the people of Cuba.  
   
Q    Karine, a number of Democratic senators have said that not every
part of President Biden’s infrastructure package — particularly under
reconciliation — should have to be paid for.  So, does the White House
still believe that the infrastructure plans have to be offset or is it
open to some parts of it in the package not being paid for?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the bipartisan framework is a historic agreement
that brings together Democrats and Republicans to invest in our nation’s
future in a way that hasn’t been done in decades.  The President offered
his own ideas about how to pay for this investment through reforming the
corporate tax code, and the Republicans offered theirs.   
   
The offsets are reasonable and responsible compromise.  He sees this as
also being fiscally responsible.  After all, there is good evidence that
the infrastructure investment, like that in this legislation, can help —
can help fact — can, in fact, help pay for itself over the long run by
expanding the economy, creating good jobs.   
   
Studies done after the framework was announced have corroborated that. 
And these offsets are on top of those savings, and the savings claimed
from long-term economic growth is smaller than what it would — likely to
occur.   
   
Q    We’re landing.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    The websites of this Russian gang who might have been responsible
for the Kaseya hack reveal they are shut down.  Are you aware of this? 
Do you have anything on this?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything — anything further to share on
that.  I don’t have anything to share (inaudible).  
   
Q    Karine, yesterday, Jen said she was going to double check on the
U.S. delegation in Haiti.  Do you know if all the members have
returned?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, all the members have returned from the
delegation.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No problem.  All right?  
   
Q    I think we’re okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.
