  \ Economic Council Brian Deese, July 2,\_2021"

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:16 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Happy Friday.  All right.  So, today, it’s
Jobs Day.  We have our special guest, NEC Director Brian Deese, joining
us, who will give us an overview and then take some of your questions.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to Brian.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I was going to say it’s a sign of the progress that
we’re making that the last time that I came here the briefing room was
significantly less full than it is right now.  (Laughter.)   
   
So, we are making — making progress across the board in all ways, except
I guess now you guys are significantly more squished.   
   
So — so, yeah, happy to spend a couple of minutes with you guys to just
provide a little bit more context.  You all heard the President
discussing the employment report that we got today, so I just wanted to
provide a little bit of additional context on how we are looking at that
data in the context of what we’ve seen over the course of the last
couple of weeks and the last week in particular.  
   
So, obviously a strong and encouraging jobs report today: 850,000 jobs
created last month.  That takes us to more than 3 million jobs created
since the President took office.  Under the hood on that, I just want to
just raise a couple of issues.   
   
First is, in addition to a strong jobs story today, we saw a strong
story about wages — wages for workers.  Average hourly earnings were up
3.6 percent over the year.  And if you take out the pandemic, some of
the — some of the movements in the pandemic, that’s — we’ve seen the
largest three-month increase in wages on record; records go back to
2006.   
   
And so I think what we’re seeing here is a labor market where, as
employers are increasingly looking for employment and jobs are
plentiful, they are paying higher wages and people are taking jobs at a
faster clip.  Good news on both fronts.   
   
The second is, as we look, there’s — obviously there’s the payroll
survey and the household survey.  The household survey is what feeds
into the unemployment rate.   
   
A couple of things under the hood in the household survey that may be of
interest to you, the first is around labor force participation.  We saw
an increase in labor force participation among the prime-age working
population.  So for those workers aged 25 to 54, we saw an increase. 
And in the pandemic, certainly because of the — some particular —
particularities around teenagers and also early retirements, that
prime-age workforce is particularly relevant, and so we keep an eye on
that.   
   
The second is, if you look at the broader definitions of unemployment —
which have been particularly something that we and others have followed
over the course of this pandemic — one notable thing this month is a
market decline in the number of people who are working part-time for
economic reasons.  So this is a category that the Bureau of Labor
Statistics tracks where people would like to be working more — like to
be working more hours but are only employed part-time.  
   
We saw a 644,000-person decline in that figure over the course of this
past month.  Again, a sign that those who are wanting to work more are
having an opportunity to do so.   
   
I would also note that there was a slight intick \[sic\] — uptick in the
number of long-term unemployed.  That number has come down since the
President took office, but that’s an issue that is a reminder that we
continue to have challenges in an economy that is coming back from a
historic pandemic, and we are still down more than 6 million jobs from
where we started.  So we still have a lot of work left to do.   
   
The third point is just to put this report in the context of a set of
economic data and indices we’ve seen over the course of the last week. 
In particular, it’s been a heavy week for economic data, so just a
couple things I wanted to flag.   
   
We saw consumer confidence come out earlier this week, and not only did
we see the index increase for the fourth straight month at very high
levels now in terms of consumers’ current and future sentiments about
the economy, but a record level of consumers are seeing the job market
as improving.  So the — in fact, the share of consumers that say that
jobs are plentiful in the economy is now at a 21-year high.  So, again,
consistent with a strong recovering labor market here.   
   
We saw both the Congressional Budget Office and the IMF come up with —
come out this week with updated growth projections.  The CBO, in
particular, doubled its projected growth for 2021 from 3.7 percent to
now 7.4 percent.  And that’s the — if we — if we achieve that growth in
that range, we would be the highest in nearly 40 years.  
   
But also, notably, the CBO not only increased its growth projections but
projected downward, where unemployment will be next year, and also
downwardly revised its projections for 10-year deficits.  So, actually,
as growth — as growth estimates increased, its projections for future
deficits as a share of our economy came down from where it was
projecting in February.   
   
Likewise, on the IMF front, projections of growth at 7 percent for the
U.S. economy and, in their words, the fastest pace in a generation.   
   
Also this week: Notably, we saw the OECD reach an agreement with 130
countries endorsing a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent.  This
has been a priority for President Biden in our economic strategy from
the beginning of this administration to try to help to galvanize a
global effort to actually end the race to the bottom on taxes, and to
encourage multinational companies to invest and compete on quality and
price, and not on the effectiveness of being able to strip profits into
local tax jurisdictions — a historic announcement this week and an
important milestone in our effort to get that done this year.   
   
Number four — and I know — and then I will take your questions — is: I
just wanted to also let you know, in terms of actions that we’re focused
on to try to help address issues that consumers are facing — increased
competition and lower prices — I want to confirm that there was some
reporting this morning that the President is indeed intending to direct
the Department of Transportation to engage in a series of rulemakings to
protect airline passengers and to promote fair and competition — fair
competition in the airline industry.   
   
This may sound esoteric, but I’ll make it very simple, particularly for
any of you who have flown or are intending to fly, now that the — that
that’s more available: These rulemakings will specifically ensure that
if a passenger pays to check a bag, they should get that fee back if the
bag doesn’t arrive on time.  Also, if the passenger pays for a service
like Wi-Fi, and it doesn’t actually work, that you will get that fee
back quickly.  
   
And —  
   
Q    Good luck with that.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. DEESE:  (Laughs.)  Um — and also, the President will direct DOT to
ensure rulemaking that will — that will establish clearer upfront
disclosure of fees — one of the challenges in being able to clearly
understand baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees at the time of
the purchase of an airline ticket so that consumers have more and better
information and understanding of what they actually are paying for.  
   
And that this — this direction will be part of a broader effort that the
President will release shortly around driving greater competition in the
economy, in service of lower prices for American families and higher
wages for American workers.   
   
So, with that, I’m happy to take your questions with one caveat, which
you’ll hear me say every time I come to talk about monthly employment
data or anything else, which is: Every piece of data is uncertain.  We
don’t look — we don’t put too much stock in any one month’s data.  We’re
looking at longer-term trends, and certainly as we assess the trend over
the longer term, we feel like we are seeing a strong and accelerating
recovery connected to and driven by the President’s economic strategy.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Josh.  
   
Q    So, good news on hiring, but we saw an increase in Black
unemployment.  Unemployment for Black men is about 10 percent — almost
double what it is for white men.  Do you expect to close this gap?  And
which policies are going to be the most important for getting that?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I’m glad you raise the issue and certainly the — it
underscores why it’s so important to not let up on the strategy that
we’ve been putting in place to drive a strong recovery as fast as we can
to get to full employment.   
   
One of the things that we know is that one of the most powerful ways of
actually addressing disparities within the labor market, and
particularly the persistent gap between unemployment rates for whites
and people of color, is to have a strong economy that is operating at
full employment where employers are seeking to have a wider scope, and
people who want to enter the labor force want to find jobs, have more
options, and have more leverage, and have more power in the labor
market.   
   
So you’ve heard the President talk about this; he went to Cleveland and
laid this out in a speech that an explicit part of his strategy is to
have policies in place to get us to full employment as quickly as
possible.   
   
I would note, to your question about the most important policies: The
American Rescue Plan was the — was unique across the world in terms of
fiscal responses to this — to this pandemic crisis.  The United States
stepping in and having a more aggressive fiscal response than almost any
country in the world.  And what you’ve seen as a result is that most
independent projections pulled forward, by a year or more, their
projection of when we will get to that full employment.   
   
But as we assess what it means to get to a full employment economy, we
believe it’s critical to look at that from an inclusive perspective and
not just look at the headline unemployment rate and recognize that these
persistent barriers that have driven those divergences in employment
outcomes need to be at the center of what we’re trying to address and
part of what we want this economic recovery to achieve.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Andrea.  
   
Q    Brian, I wanted to ask you about the OECD tax agreement.  Are you
concerned at all that that could get held up; that the U.S. could have
trouble enacting its part of that?  And also, there were several
countries that are in the European Union that didn’t sign on.  Is that
going to be a stumbling block to actually make it happen?   
   
MR. DEESE:  So, we see the announcement today, or this week, as both a
historic milestone and really important momentum to actually achieving
both of the elements that you said — momentum to enact a corporate tax
reform in the United States that would not only help to improve U.S.
competitiveness by making it more attractive to invest here in the
United States rather than invest in shifting production and profits to
low-tax jurisdictions, but also raise revenue that we could invest in
productivity-enhancing measures like investing in universal
preschool.   
   
Along the lines the President has laid out — and, in fact, the — one of
the principal arguments against the kind of tax reform that the
President has laid out is, “Well, if the United States acts, what
happens if the rest of the world doesn’t come along?”  Well, with this
OECD announcement, we’re actually demonstrating that the world is
prepared to do that, and obviously, it connects to a set of constructive
conversations we’re having with leadership and the relevant committees
in Congress right now about moving forward the President’s corporate tax
reform.   
   
And this is a process.  We — to your question about the remaining
countries, this is a process.  We saw at the G7, there were questions:
Would the G7 come along and endorse this framework?  And, of course,
they did.  Now, we have 130 countries endorsing this framework.  And
we’re going to keep working at it; we’re not there.  This is a milestone
in the process, but a real strong signal of momentum toward the ultimate
goal.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Alex.  
   
Q    Hey, Brian.  Brian, I wonder if you could address that competition
initiative that you mentioned — give us a little bit more flavor of
what’s coming on that.  And then, secondly, I wonder if you could
address — the chip shortage is still hurting.  Ford, for example, is
down 27 percent in June.  How much of a drag do you think that’s going
to have on the otherwise rosy outlook you just presented?   
   
MR. DEESE:  Sure.  So, on the first, I would say — I mean, I won’t — I
won’t get ahead of the President.  You can anticipate the President is
going to be having more to say about this shortly.  It’s an issue that
we’ve been working on across the whole of government, and the actions
that I outlined with respect to the Department of Transportation is one
element of it.   
   
But I think at the core just is — this is really about trying to imp- —
to recognize that actually having more competition and more competitive
markets is actually key to driving strong, durable, shared economic
growth.  And, in particular, we’ve seen increasing evidence that the
lack of competition in a variety of markets can actually reduce choices
and increase prices for consumers, for small businesses, and actually
also hurt wages and wage growth for workers in the labor market.  
   
And so, we’re looking at an effort across the government, looking at the
different antitrust statutes and the different measures that agencies
can take to try to improve competition and actually improve the
opportunities for businesses to compete fairly without being impeded as
well.  So we’ll have more to say about that, but that’s the basic
contours of it.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jen.  
   
Q    And then, just chips —  
   
MR. DEESE:  Oh, chips.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, look, this has been an
issue that we’ve been, you know, focused on for some time.  It was the
focus of the President’s 100-day supply chain review.  And we’ve been in
constant and close contact with the auto manufacturers, consumer
electronics producers, and also then the chip manufacturers
themselves.  
   
I would say, in the short term, I think we’re hearing signs of there’s
some improvement in the challenges.  I think the second quarter clearly
was a point where you saw that impacting, both on the production side
and the employment side.  The — we — at least the indications we’re
hearing from industry participants is that you should expect some
improvement sequentially over the second half of this year.  
   
From our perspective on the policy side, it’s why we’re incredibly
focused — you’ve seen the President laser focused on trying to move and
enact his proposal for $50 billion to invest in semiconductor
production, manufacturing resilience here in the United States.  That’s
the long-term answer to this issue.   
   
And we’ve — that’s passed through the Senate.  It’s — we’re now working
with the House to try to advance that legislation as well, and we look
forward to getting that to the President’s desk as soon as possible.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Courtney.  Oh, sorry — Jen.  Sorry.  (Inaudible.)  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    What are — just to go back to full employment — what are the
metrics that the administration will look to to determine when the U.S.
has reached full employment?  And then, on manufacturing: Why are
manufacturing jobs lagging so much — up only 15,000 in June, and still
480,000 below pre-pandemic levels?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I’ll take — I’ll take the second half of your — of
your question first.  And obviously you can have a glass and maybe it’s
half full, maybe it’s half empty.  But I would say, sequentially, what
we’ve seen is progress in the manufacturing sector, both in terms of
employment and production.   
   
And it’s important to remember, you know, where we’re coming from: We
had a pandemic and a historic economic crisis that sent — that cratered
production and has created huge supply chain challenges and bottlenecks
over the course — over the course of the economy.   
   
But I think what we’re seeing now is demand has come back faster than
anticipated, in large part because of the success of the vaccination
effort and the historic fiscal response that the United States has
taken, and you’re seeing manufacturers respond.   
   
And certainly there’s going to be some short-term issues to work
through.  But I think, you know, part of the job growth that we saw in
June is reflective of the sector’s ability to start coming back here.   
   
And the first half of your —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. DEESE:  Oh, on full employment.   
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, look, you know, our approach is to — is to look at this
from an inclusive perspective.  Our approach has been to say: What does
it mean to actually have an economy that is working for everybody, and
where workers who want an opportunity to be full participants in the
labor market have that opportunity?   
   
That means not only looking underneath the hood of the traditional
unemployment rate at the significant discrepancies we’ve seen
historically on racial and ethnic lines, but also parents and women and
what are the barriers to full participation in this economy.   
   
And so you certainly see that from the perspective of the Biden economic
strategy to try to invest in the drivers that are actually going to
increase labor force participation, increase the productive capacity of
the economy by having — driving inclusive growth, shared growth, the
kind of growth that we think will be durable across time.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Courtney.  This is going to have to be the last one.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Right back here.  Hi.   
   
MR. DEESE:  Hi.  
   
Q    I wanted to ask you about infrastructure and ongoing negotiations
—  
   
MR. DEESE:  Sure.  
   
Q    — on the Hill.  The House passed its INVEST in America Act — I
believe it was either last week or this week — and House Transportation
Chairman Peter DeFazio has said that he wants the policy in that bill to
be how they flesh out the framework that the President agreed on — the
bipartisan framework.  Is that something that you would agree with?  Is
the policy in there what you want it to look like at the end of the
day?  Are there certain policies you would want to keep in the final
bill?   
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, so that was — that was a vote that happened earlier
this week, and I congratulate Chairman DeFazio and the committee and the
House for progressing that.  
   
This is the process.  This is the — you’re seeing the legislative
process work.  You saw the Senate committee pass a Surface
Transportation Reauthorization unanimously out of committee with
Chairman Carper, Ranking Member Capito there.  And now you’ve seen a
Transportation Reauthorization pass out of the House as well.   
   
And as we’ve said for some time, the expectation is that the legislative
process will now work the way that it — the way that it has, and as part
of the bipartisan infrastructure framework, moving from a framework or
agreement to piece of legislation.   
   
As the President has said, the committee chairmen are going to be part
of that process.  The process is going — is happening in the Senate
right now.  But, obviously, working between the Senate and the House is
a key element of this, so I think it’s an important milestone.  And
Chairman DeFazio has shown extraordinary leadership on this issue, and
we’re going to keep working on it.  This is the legislative process in
real time working its will.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you, Brian, so much for joining us.  He’ll be back.   
   
MR. DEESE:  Thank you all.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, sorry, go ahead.   
   
All right.  Just two quick items for all of you at the top.  As we
shared from the podium a few weeks ago, the White House recently
established the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force — co-chaired by the
Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and Agriculture — to bring a
whole-of-government approach to addressing the near-term supply chain
bottlenecks and supply constraints.   
   
The task force has been actively engaging with a broad set of
stakeholders to diagnose problems and identify solutions.  And we want
to share a few examples of recent engagements, given this is of great
interest.  Alex asked about it just a few minutes ago — or a version of
it.  
   
On homebuilding, Secretary Raimondo and sen- — senior commerce officials
have been meeting with timber and logging companies, sawmill operators,
retailers, appliance makers, and homebuilders from across the nation,
and will meet in the coming days with affordable housing and labor
leaders to ensure the challenges in the homebuilding supply chain are
thoroughly understood from every angle to address bottlenecks in the
sector.  
   
On semiconductors — which affects many industries, including everything
from autos to everyday electronics around our homes — Secretary Raimondo
has continued to bring together semiconductor producers and users to
build trust, improve transparency, and facilitate data sharing.   
   
Since March, the Commerce Department has supported nearly $75 billion in
direct investments from both U.S. and foreign businesses in domestic
semiconductor manufacturing.   
   
And as for the Department of Transportation, under Secretary Buttigieg’s
leadership, the agency is helping address the country’s truck driver
shortages by supporting state DMVs as they return or even exceed
pre-pandemic commercial driver’s license issuance rates.   
   
In 2021, an average of 50,000 commercial driver’s licenses have been
issued each month, which is 14 percent higher than the 2019 monthly
average and 60 percent higher than the 2020 monthly average.  So,
clearly, their work is ongoing, but wanted to provide you a bit of an
update about their outreach.   
   
Finally, in vaccine sharing news: On Sunday, we — we will send — this
Sunday, we will send 1.5 million doses of Moderna to El Salvador.   
   
Sorry, I will do the week ahead.  Now, as we look to the week ahead —
which, of course, includes this weekend, because the President has a
busy schedule — on Saturday, he will travel to Traverse City, Michigan,
with Governor Gretchen Whitmer as part of the administration’s
nationwide America is Back Together Tour to celebrate our country’s
progress against the virus.  
   
While there, he will visit a cherry farm, where he will highlight the
benefits of the bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and what they will
do to deliver to communities acro- — what it will do to deliver to
communities across the country.  
After his visit to Traverse City, he will travel to Wilmington,
Delaware, where he will remain overnight.   
   
On Sunday, the President and the First Lady will return to the White
House where they will host a Fourth of July barbecue with essential
workers and military families on the South Lawn.  At 7:30 p.m. on Sunday
night, the President will deliver remarks to celebrate Independence Day
and independence from COVID-19.  And later that night, the National Mall
will be open for the traditional Independence Day fireworks displays so
friends and family can gather together to celebrate our independence
from the virus.  
   
On Monday, the President will not have public events.  It is a federal
holiday.   
   
And next week — we will have more details, hopefully, in the coming days
— but he will continue to amplify the benefits of the bipartisan
Infrastructure Framework, the American Families Plan.  And again, we’ll
have more announcements about it in the coming days.   
   
Last thing.  Emily, who many of you know — she’s going to get
embarrassed — is a part of our amazing press team.  She is a
spokesperson on economic issues — not an easy thing.  So, she’s here —
hasn’t been in the briefing room — today, so wanted to welcome her here
and thank her for all of her work.  And also, to Chairman Schiff, who
let me steal her from him, which I’m very grateful for every day.  So,
just wanted you to all know Emily if you don’t already know Emily.  
   
Josh, go ahead.  Josh definitely knows Emily.  
   
Q    Yes.  Yes.  (Laughter.)  Given last night’s announcement on halting
federal executions, is the President satisfied with the moratorium as it
stands, or does he want to go further?  And does he believe that Justice
Department lawyers should continue to seek the death penalty in cases or
should they hold off?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I will first say, Josh, that the President made clear,
even during his first conversations with then-Judge Garland about the
job, that he wanted to see an end to executions.   
   
And the announcement that was made today is — he’s pleased to see that
the Attorney General is taking steps forward which will put a stop to
executions at the federal level during this review.  And that is what’s
ongoing, and he feels that’s an important step forward in delivering on
that discussion.   
   
Q    And then, secondly, with regard to the President and sexual assault
cases and, kind of, where they are in the military chain of command: The
President stopped short of where Senator Gillibrand is on having
independent prosecutors handle felonies that call for more than a year
in prison.  What is the White House’s thinking on, kind of, the decision
relative to that proposal?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would note that we put out a statement from
the President.  And let me just highlight some — some components of that
for all of you, because this was an important step forward in his view
today:  
   
He strongly supports Secretary Austin’s announcement that he’s accepting
the core recommendations put forward by the Independent Review
Commission on Military Sexual Assault.  He views sexual assault as an
abuse of power, an affront to our shared humanity.  And sexual athault
\[sic\] — assault in the military is doubly damaging, in his view, as it
also shreds the unity and cohesion that is essential to a functioning
U.S. Military and to our national defense.   
   
He also noted — and just to answer your question — that he looks forward
to working with Congress to implement these necessary reforms.  He’s
grateful for the leadership of Senator Gillibrand, the work of Senator
Ernst, Representative Speier, and Representative Mullin who have worked
in a strong bipartisan way to move this forward.  And certainly he feels
that this announcement and the decision by Secretary Austin is a step
forward.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Same two subjects.  First, to the death penalty: There had been a
campaign pledge to introduce legislation to end the federal death
penalty.  Is that still coming?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I would say that the President felt it was so
important that it was a part of his discussion with the Attorney General
when he interviewed him and talked to him about the job.   
   
He is now — the Attorney General today announced that there will be a
halt on executions while there’s an important review, and the President
feels that’s an important step forward.  
   
Q    Some advocates have called on him to commute all federal death
penalty sentences.  That’s different than what the Attorney General
did.  Has there been any discussion of doing that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s a review that was just announced.  I don’t expect
that we would speak to that while it’s ongoing.  
   
Q    And then, on the sexual assault report, it found, in part — I’m
just going to quote here — “a wide chasm between what senior leaders
believe is happening under their commands and what junior enlisted
service members actually experience.  As a result, trust has been broken
between commanders and the service members.”   
   
It’s a scathing vote of no confidence on a predominantly male military
leadership.  And I’m just curious, in his discussions with the Secretary
of Defense or with uniformed leaders, if he, the President, has talked
to these guys at all about the fact that this persists and is now called
out in this report?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he’s certainly spoken with Secretary Austin about it. 
He’s spoken about — publicly about his concern, about what he’s seen in
the reports of sexual assault in the military that have — were
happening, of course, long before he became President.   
   
And he also called out, in a statement today — he wanted to recognize
the experience of our service members who have survived sexual assault,
and the bravery of those who’ve shared their stories with the world and
advocated for reform, which is something he felt was important to note
and call out today.   
   
I would also note that Secretary Austin, in coming out and accepting
these core recommendations, is taking an action step to change, and
hopefully change the course of, what we’ve seen over the last several —
for several years — something the President certainly applauds and
supports.  
   
Q    But it’s going to take until at least 2023 to get much of this
implemented.  And we’ve got a bill in the Senate that has 60 votes at
least; it’s bipartisan.  Is there going to be a push by him to say,
“Yes, let’s do this.  It’s another example of bipartisan cooperation. 
It addresses this issue.”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he note- —  
   
Q    You know, why not come out and endorse it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He noted in his statement that he looks forward to working
with Congress to implement these necessary reforms and to mot- — promote
a work environment that is free from sexual assault and harassment for
every one of our brave service members.   
   
And, yes, it is also the military — the leadership in the military —
Secretary Austin, someone the President nominated and works with on a
daily basis — who accepted these recommendations, and they need to be
implemented.  That will take some time, but that’s a forward step that
was taken by our own military.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    First, some housekeeping, if I can, quickly: We saw all the debris
when we arrived here at the White House earlier today.  The President
and First Lady were back at the White House when the tornado warning was
in effect yesterday.  Where did the President and First Lady shelter
during the tornado warning?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s a great question.  I know they were — I don’t know if
they were back from their trip yet or if they were arriving shortly back
from their trip — they were here at the White House.  I don’t have any
more details on whether they were moved.  
   
Q    Would you follow up for us, possibly, and let us know
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to.  Sure.  
   
Q    Let me ask you:  As we head into July 4th, very quickly, obviously
the White House has said repeatedly that shots are safe, they’re
effective, they’re available, but obviously, many states with the lowest
vaccination rates are governed by Republicans right now.  What risk does
the White House believe those pockets of noncompliance might pose to
other Americans, to the rest of the country right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the guidance from medical experts is very
clear: If you’re vaccinated, you’re safe.  If you’re not vaccinated,
you’re at risk of getting the virus.   
   
And the Delta variant — the transmissibility of it, which we’ve seen
from medical experts who have made clear that it is far more
transmissible, it can be deadly, it can make people incredibly sick — is
just a reminder of what risk people are putting on themselves if they
don’t get vaccinated.  
   
Q    And then — so for clarity, though, what risks — to my question —
what risk do you think those pockets of noncompliance pose not just to
themselves, but to the rest of the country?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn’t look at it as pockets, Peter.  I would look at it
as: Individuals in those pockets who are not vaccinated are certainly at
a significant risk, given the transmissibility of the Delta variant.  
   
Q    But you don’t think that risk is larger than those individuals
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  If those individuals are vaccinated in those areas, then
they are protected.  We have seen — also had some news this morning
about the effectiveness of J&J.  But also, we know that Moderna and
Pfizer are effective in fighting and protecting individuals from the
Delta variant.  
   
I’d also note that we announced just yesterday our plans for a surge
team, largely in response to the Delta variant across the country.  That
will include the physical deployment of personnel, virtual assistance,
direct sharing of resources.  We’ve already deployed this — a team to
Colorado to collaborate with the local Department of Health in Mesa
County.  And that’s something we will continue to work with communities
across the country to implement to address the rising threat of the
Delta variant.  
   
Q    And given the White House is going to fall shy of its 70 percent
goal for at least one shot in the arms of adults right now, is the White
House done setting goals?  Will you continue to do that?  Or do you
think that they’re no longer effective?  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, that’s one way of describing it.  Another way
of describing it is that we are on track, once the data comes in, to
ensure — to report that 70 percent of adults 27 and older have received
at least one dose of the vaccine.  That’s a significant step forward —
something we’re incredibly proud of.  It’s a reflection of the
leadership of the President, of the organizational expertise of the team
he’s hired, and that’s an enormous step forward.  That’s also why deaths
and hospitalizations have fallen by more than 90 percent since
January.  
   
We feel it’s important to set bold and ambitious goals.  Even though we
are on track to reach that goal for individuals 27 and up, our job is
not done.  The work continues even on July 5th.  
   
Q    On COVID, will we set a new goal?  Is there a new goal that you’re
targeting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have no new goal to set today, but again, we feel that
it’s important to set bold and ambitious markers and hold ourselves to
account.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Is the White House concerned that some
vice-presidential staffers reportedly feel like they work in a, quote,
“abusive environment”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first note that I try not to speak to or
engage on anonymous reports or anonymous sources.  I will say that the
Vice President is an incredibly important partner to the President of
the United States.  She has a challenging job, a hard job, and she has a
great, supportive team of people around her.   
   
But other than that, I’m not going to have any more comments on those
reports.  
   
Q    Okay.  I’m hoping to clarify the administration’s position here on
defunding the police.  You say the President does not want to defund the
police, but is the President concerned then that, last year, the
now-Associate Attorney General, Vanita Gupta, said it was, quote,
“critical for state and local leaders to heed calls from Black Lives
Matter and Movement for Black Lives activists to decrease police
budgets”?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that, as a Fox News report that came
about in February quoted, quote, ” Current and former police chiefs in
more than 53 cities across the country, as well as the National
Fraternal Order of Police, are issuing their support of the nomination
of Vanita Gupta — President Biden’s nominee for Associate Attorney
General — praising her leadership and record, and urging the Senate
Judiciary Committee to ‘quickly confirm her’ to the post.”  
   
I don’t know that that was your report or not —  
   
Q    Good quote.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — but it was certainly one from your network.  
   
Q    But she said — okay, so that’s the Fox report.  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    In Senate testimony, she said she wanted to decrease police
budgets.  So will she —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  She also made explicitly clear in her confirmation process
that she opposes defunding the police.  And the President ran on, most
importantly — did not run on defunding the police.  He’s always opposed
defunding the police.   
   
I’ll also note, because you’ve asked this question before — or a few
times over the last several days — that when we talk about individuals
in Congress and their support for funding or opposition to funding for
the police, I think what the American people are most focused on is how
people vote, what their record is, which is a public record.  
   
And I will note that while the President ran on and won the most votes
of any candidate in history on a platform of boosting funding for law
enforcement after Republicans spent decades trying to cut the COPS
program — which, again, is public record; we don’t need to under- —
undervalue the intelligence of the American people — the President ran
on increasing that funding.  It’s in his budget.  
   
In President Trump’s budget, he significantly cut that.  So that’s a
change.  
   
And the American Rescue Plan had a great deal of funding for local and
state authorities, something that can support funding for local police
in communities across the country, and something many have used.  
   
It doesn’t require me telling you names of individuals who oppose the
American Rescue Plan.  Every Republican opposed the American Rescue
Plan, and I don’t have time to read out all their names today.   
   
Q    Okay.  On another subject — the official White House account
tweeted yesterday: “The cost of a Fourth of July cookout is down 16
cents from last year.”  Sixteen cents?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There has been a reduction in some of the costs of key
components of the Fourth of July — a Fourth of July barbecue.  That was
what the tweet was noting.  
   
Q    So does the White House think that 16 cents off a barbecue has more
of an impact on people’s lives than gas being a dollar more this time —
this Fourth of July versus last year?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say: If you don’t like hot dogs, you may not care of
the reduction of costs.  
   
Q    You can’t —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You don’t have to like hot dogs.  
   
Q    You can’t buy a hot dog for 16 cents.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  A reduction of —  
   
Q    That’s like a bite of a hot dog.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will say that what we are most focused on is the fact that
we’ve created now more than 3 million jobs since the President took
office.  That’s what we’re focused on, and continuing to implement
additional components of his economic Build Back Better agenda.  
   
Go ahead, Andrea.  
   
Q    Hey.  I’m just going to switch gears completely —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Great.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    — from hot dogs.  (Laughs.)  So, the President of Belarus has shut
the border to Ukraine.  You’ve expressed concern about this halt to
travel.  Can you give us an update on what’s happening there and what
your reaction is to that?  I mean, is it time to take more serious
action?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As you know, we have put in place a number of sanctions over
the past several weeks in coordination with our European partners.  I
had not seen that report before I came out here.  I will talk with our
national security team and see if there’s any additional actions or
calls that are happening today.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, on the international front, these OECD talks are
now going to be heading into the G10 — I’m sorry, G20 meeting that’s
coming up.  The Treasury Secretary will be going.   
   
Can you just, from where do you sit, sort of, say what your primary goal
is for this upcoming G20 meeting and the finance officials, and what
you’re — you know, what the President is saying to the Treasury
Secretary about what he’d like to see get done?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, obviously, the Treasury team and the
Treasury Secretary will preview what the focus of their trip is.  
   
As you know and as you asked my colleague Brian Deese about, certainly a
component of that will be about the global minimum tax and moving that
across the finish line.   
   
I will note — and he touched on this a bit, but we are quite encouraged
— and it is a positive sign, in our view — that there are 130 countries,
representing more than 90 percent of global GDP, who have come together
to support the Biden administration plan for a strong global minimum
tax.  
   
And, of course, there’s more work to be done, but that is — will be
certainly a focus.  But otherwise, I would defer to the Treasury
Department on previewing the Secretary’s trip.  
   
Q    And then, the President is going to be speaking, later on today, to
the National Education Association.  What is his primary concern?  And,
you know, we’ve talked a lot in here about critical race theory.  Is
this something that he’s going to bring up in terms of the teaching of
American history?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, he’s married to a teacher and a
longtime teacher — still a teacher.  And so, certainly, educators and
making sure he is communicating and conveying his commitment to the
education system and the role of educators in the country is always
going to be close to his heart.   
   
I will certainly expect that he will talk a bit about his plans and
initiatives, whether it’s the American Jobs Plan or the components of
the American Families Plan, which will be critical to communities — to
school communities across the country.  But I think that would be the
focus of his remarks.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On Afghanistan, the President said, earlier, he does not think the
drawdown will be done in a few days.  The Pentagon has said it’s ahead
of schedule — the September 11th date.  So what is the latest date that
the White House is looking at right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we currently expect it to be completed by the end of
August.  So, as you know, the President decided to withdraw remaining
U.S. troops from Afghanistan and finally end the U.S. war there after 20
years.  I know there’s been some reporting about Bagram, which I expect
— it may already be out — there’ll be a statement from the Secretary of
Defense on that sometime today.  
   
But in terms of the timeline, we currently expect it to be completed by
the end of August.   
   
Q    Okay.  And when it comes to the translators that have applied — not
just translators — drivers, engineers, people who have really put their
lives on the line for the U.S. that are waiting on these applications —
is it true that the administration is considering housing them in
Central Asia — several countries in Central Asia — while they wait for
those applications to either be accepted or denied?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There have been some reports about conversations.  I’m not
here to confirm any conversations.  What I can tell you is we’ve
identified a group of SIV applicants who have served as interpreters,
translators, as well as other at-risk categories.  They will be
relocated to a location outside of Afghanistan.  There are a range of
options, but that will happen before we complete our military drawdown
by the end of August, in order to complete their visa application
process from there.  
   
In terms of locations or numbers, I’m just not going to be able to get
into those specifics for security reasons.  
   
Q    But you will eventually.  
   
And can you explain why the President was citing the July 4th weekend
when he was being asked questions about Afghanistan as to why he did not
want to answer further questions on that matter?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think what he was trying to convey to all of you is that
he is heading into July 4th weekend — a weekend for family, a weekend to
celebrate America — and that he was ready to be done answering
questions.  
   
It wasn’t — it wasn’t related to Afghanistan.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Following up there —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — one of the things that you sort of punted on was that the
fighting is getting closer and closer to Kabul.  If the Afghan
government falls, if there is a bloodbath in Kabul, is there any
circumstance where the U.S. is reconsidering, is thinking about sending
troops back?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think it’s really important to remember what the President
conveyed when he made his announcement — or how we kind of got to this
point.   
   
First, when he announced our drawdown, he made clear that the Taliban
would have been shooting at U.S. troops again after May 1st.  And the
withdwal \[sic\] — the withdrawal deadline negotiated by the previous
administration kind of set that timeline.   
   
Also, when he came into office, we had the lowest number of U.S. and
partner forces in Afghanistan since the early days of the war; an
agreement, as I note — just noted, was already in place; and the
military stalemate between the Taliban and Afghan Forces was at a
height.   
   
He also asked for a review of genuine, realistic options to advance and
protect U.S. interests.  The review did not sugarcoat what the likely
outcomes would be or rely on best-case scenarios.  And we emerged from
that with a clear-eyed assessment of the best path forward to advance
American interests, which is his focus and his role as the
Commander-in-Chief and the President of the United States.   
   
And ending the war in Afghanistan after 20 years so that we can address
the global threat picture, so that we can protect our men and women
serving was his priority.  So that continues to be and he continues to —
we’re continuing to move forward toward our withdrawal plan by the end
of August.   
   
Q    Could I ask you a follow-up on something you said yesterday.  You
were asked about the end of the Supreme Court term.  You reiterated the
President’s commitment, should there be an opening, to nominate an
African American woman.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    He said, a year ago, that he was creating a list, that he would
release that list for further vetting.  Can you tell us what the status
is?  Is there going to be a list of potential nominees that’s — that’s
released for us to see?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well there is not an opening on the Supreme Court.  So
that’s not a current hypothetical we’re even dealing with right now.  He
made clear at the time — or maybe around that time — that he would
nominate an African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court should
there be an opening while he’s President.  And he remains committed to
that — to that, should there be an opening.   
   
Go ahead, David.  
   
Q    Jen, about a little more than a week ago, the agreement with the
Iranians to allow inspections to continue at the main sites expired, and
a couple of administration officials — including, I think, the Secretary
of State — had said that it would be a big problem if we lose inspection
continuity.  
   
So, now we’re a week out.  Is it your understanding that we have no
inspection continuity?  And tell us how this affects the way the
President is hoping that all of this will unwind.  How do you actually
get to an agreement if you’re not sure that things have been diverted
along the way?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we certainly expect there could be challenges
on the road to getting an agreement.  And we’ve lived through a version
of this before, as have you.   
   
I will say that, consistent with what the Secretary of State said, we
believe Iran must comply with the IAEA’s inspectors and it must comply
with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreements with the IAEA. 
We’re working with allies and partners to reinforce broad support for
the IAEA and the director general as he and his team carry out their
important work.  
   
And certainly, our message has continued to — has been from the
beginning, but I will reiterate, that one of the reasons to move forward
and to continue to pursue a diplomatic agreement to re-engage with our
partners — P5+1 partners and the Iranians, even indirectly, is because
we want to have that reliable access and understand and have visibility
into what the Iranians are up to and how close they are to acquiring a
nuclear weapon.   
   
Obviously, we’ve just concluded the sixth round of talks.  Everyone is
back at their capitals.  I don’t have anything to preview for you in
terms of a next round, but that certainly is our hope in terms of the
next step.  
   
Q    Just following on the question you got before Afghanistan.  When I
asked President, during that previous event on the economy, about Kabul,
he said, “We’ve worked out an over-the-horizon capacity that we can be
value added, but the Afghans are going to have to be able to do it
themselves with the air force they have.”   
   
So, if we just understand what he said and then your answer before to
Kaitlan, is he essentially saying, “If Kabul falls, it is not our
primary responsibility at this point.  We’re happy to go help, but it’s
completely up to you”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’s saying that, as we said in the beginning, he asked for
a review and an assessment of what the impact could be of our decision
to withdraw troops.  We asked them not to sugarcoat that; they didn’t. 
There have been intel assessments that have been out there from our own
government.  We’re certainly aware of those.  We have never taken a step
back from those — from the podium or from the President of the United
States.   
   
At the same time, what I think he was conveying during his answer to
you, David, is that we will also continue to work collaboratively, as we
always have, with a range of countries that share our interest in
countering the reemergence of a serious external-plotting capability
emanating from Afghanistan, should that emerge.   
   
We will maintain over-the-horizon capacity, and we — that is something
that will continue, as well as our security assistance to the Afghan
National Security Forces, but they will be in the lead, as has always
been the plan when we withdraw our troops.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Sha’Carri Richardson, the U.S. track star, has been
suspended following a positive test for marijuana use.  Does the
President support that penalty or does he want to see her be able to
represent the United States fully at the Olympic Games this summer?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say, first, that this was an independent decision
made by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, and not a — not a decision that
would be made by the U.S. government, as is appropriate.  And we will
certainly leave them the space and room to make their decisions about
anti-doping policies that need to be implemented.   
   
I will also note that Sha’Carri Richardson is an inspiring young woman
who went — has gone through a lot, personally.  And I think — and she
also happens to be one of the fastest women in the world, and that’s an
important part of the story as well.   
   
So this is an independent — an independent decision by the U.S.
Anti-Doping Agency, but I also felt it was important to note who she is
and her history.  
   
Q    And can I ask a follow-up on Afghanistan?  When it comes to the
vulnerable Afghan employees that we were talking about that could be
moved to other countries, what assurances does the administration have
to them that they can be moved safely — that these visa applicants can
be moved safely?  I mean, isn’t there a target now on their backs now
that the Taliban knows that they’re, you know, potentially going to be
moved?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Sean, I think one of the reasons that I’m not going to
get into security details about what third country they might go to and
how many is exactly for that reason.  But certainly, our timeline is to
relocate these individuals to a location outside of Afghanistan before
we complete our military drawdown.   
   
I’d also note that we will continue, even after we have our military
with- — drawdown with a presence in Kabul, a diplomatic presence as well
on the ground there.  But certainly that’s the goal of our timeline and
the reason I’m not getting into more specific details.  
   
Go ahead, Asma.   
   
Q    Jen, hi.  Two quick questions on voting rights.  One is actually a
logistical question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    He said yesterday that he intends to, kind of, tour around and go
and speak on this issue.  Will he give remarks next week?  Can we get
any guidance on where he might go?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   He is eager to do that, as is evident by his
mentioning it to you all yesterday and over the last couple of weeks.   
   
And I think, as you would note, hopefully, in his statement yesterday he
is profoundly disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision.  It’s just a
reminder of how important it is to move forward on federal legislation. 
It — how important it is to — and urgent it is that Congress restore the
Voting Rights Act.  And it’s a reminder of what the stakes are here,
which is that our democracy is on the line.   
   
We — as I noted in the beginning, we are still working out and
finalizing details for next week.  So I just don’t have anything to
preview in terms of travel or the focus of his travel at this point in
time.   
   
Q    Another related question, which was actually on the remarks he gave
yesterday about the Arizona voting decision.  I just wanted to clarify
some things, so I’m going to quote — he said, “It is mildly positive in
the sense that there’s a remedy available based on the particular voting
decision.”  And kind of — I was just confused what he was talking about
was “mildly positive”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to look more closely at the specific statement. 
You know, I think that the President views this issue, broadly, as one
where we need to continue to use every lever at our disposal, whether
that is actions taken by the Department of Justice that the Attorney
General has already announced some of in the last few weeks; or it is
efforts that we have underway, led by our Vice President, to engage with
civil rights groups, state legislators, and the American people to push
back on anti-voter laws at the state level.   
   
But that’s, broadly, what his view is, and I think what he was trying to
project in the statement.  
   
Go ahead, Jen.  
   
Q    OPEC Plus has been stuck in talks around raising oil production to
ease prices.  Is the White House concerned about high oil prices?  And
has the President or anybody in the administration been in touch with
allies in — who are involved in OPEC to talk about this?   
   
And then, somewhat related, on gas prices being high in the U.S. at, you
know, peak travel time — probably even more so because of, kind of, the
pandemic getting better: You know, are you concerned about that for
Americans, at a time when it does seem like there are a lot of economic
data points working in your favor, that this one that Americans really
do feel day in, day out is not, you know, in a great position?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Sure, well, Jen, let me first say that there are, of course
— we have seen an increase in the price of oil, as anyone has seen — as
they’ve seen — who watches data.  It will be, of course, a topic of
discussion, as you noted, when OPEC meets over the coming days.  I’m not
in a position to speak to those conversations from here.   
   
I do — I can say that, currently, we expect there is enough spare oil
production capacity globally.  And as you know, because of the restart
of global economy and the resumption of normal consumer activity, there
is some impact on oil market conditions.  
   
On your second part of your question on the impact of individuals and
consumers: Absolutely.  I mean that’s one of the core reasons why the
President was opposed to a gas tax and was opposed to a — any tax on
travel or vehicles — vehicle mileage, because he felt that would fall on
the backs of Americans who are returning to their workplaces, who are
driving their kids to school.  And that was a bottom line or a red line
for him in the negotiations.  
   
As you know well, the price of gas is often linked, of course, to oil
prices.  That will again be a topic of discussion over the coming days,
but I don’t have anything to preview on that front.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On the subject of infrastructure, there are a number
of Republicans on the Hill who have raised concerns about the idea of
giving the IRS $40 billion to basically crack down on tax cheats.  They
cite a lot of concerns, one of which is that they think that this — it
raises the possibility of abuse by the IRS.  I’m just wondering what the
administration’s response to that is.  And also, how pivotal is this IRS
component to paying for the President’s infrastructure plan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I think it’s a key payfor, and one that was
agreed to by a bipartisan group who negotiated the deal.  And for
clarity, what the — what it actually would do is ensure that the IRS has
the support, the staffing, and the resources needed to ensure the
wealthiest Americans are paying what they owe.  That’s exactly what it
would do.   
   
We have some estimates of what that would raise in terms of payfors. 
Those are actually quite conservative when you look at what economists —
many economists suggest across the board.  But it is a payfor that was
agreed to and one that does not violate what was a red line for many
Republicans, which was, in these bipartisan negotiations, doing anything
to change the 2017 tax law.   
   
We will, of course, go to that when we go to reconciliation, but that
was a red line as it related to these negotiations.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, we saw that the President was exasperated this morning when he
was asked several questions about Afghanistan and Bagram.  Bear with me
for a second, but 20 years ago, we were a nation full of people — most
Americans were gung-ho, full of patriotism to go get those people who
had attacked our country in 2001.  Twenty years on now, we’re — we seem
to be — average Americans are just shrugging their shoulders at the fate
of Afghanistan.  They may have “Afghanistan fatigue.”  Does the
President feel that way?  Does he have “Afghanistan fatigue”?    And
does he sense that in the American people?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  First, I would say that the President has long felt, as many
Americans have and many leaders have, that the war in Afghanistan was
not one that could be won militarily.  That’s why we have supported
diplomatic negotiations and discussions, and we will continue to be
engaged in those moving forward.   
   
And again, we’ll continue to have a diplomatic presence on the ground,
even after we bring our men and women home.  As Commander-in-Chief, you
have to make decisions about how to protect the men and women serving. 
When the May 1st deadline was set, that gave — provided us a timeline in
which the President had to make a decision about bringing our men and
women home, or beginning that process, so that they did not risk greater
threats on the ground.   
   
He went through an entire review, an assessment by his national security
team to jump to that conclusion.  And I will also reiterate that we will
continue to provide security assistance, humanitarian assistance, and be
partners to the government of Afghanistan in the months ahead, as is
evident by the fact that he hosted leaders here just last Friday.  
   
Q    So the sense of fatigue, does he — do you — does he feel that way,
do you think?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say, I think people are a little overreading into
his response to a series of — a Q&A leading into a holiday weekend when
he had already answered three questions on Afghanistan.  And he just
said, “This is the fourth question…” and he then went on and answered a
couple additional questions.   
   
The President could not be more proud of the men and women serving who
have served over the last 20 years, and he is going to use every
opportunity he can to thank them for their service, thank the families
of those fallen service members who served proudly and bravely in
Afghanistan.  But this was a decision he made because he felt it was in
the best interest of our national security in the United States.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Oh, okay.  I think you guys have to gather.  
   
Okay, go ahead.  You’re the last one.  
   
Q    All right.  Thank you, Jen.  You mentioned that a COVID-19 surge
team was heading to Colorado.  Do you have an update on when one could
be arriving in the state of Missouri?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    And could you speak to the broader concern that the administration
might have about the Midwest as a region?  And then I do have one other
question after that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me see if I have — I think I have — oh, we are
also working with — closely with the Missouri Health Department in
identifying needs there, and we’re prepared to mobilize a team to
Missouri where the focus is on vaccine confidence efforts, epidemiology
surveillance and sequencing support related to the Delta variant.  
   
I would say our concern is where there are communities where there are
lower vaccination rates because it means more people are at risk.  And
we are going to continue to do everything in the power of the federal
government — whether that’s providing supply, whether that is sending
surge response teams, whether that is ensuring people understand where
they can get access, or whether it’s communicating directly to young
people, people under 27 who have a lower vaccination rate.  That will
continue in communities in the Midwest or in any parts of the country
where there are lower vaccination rates.  
   
Thank you.  Have a gre- —  
   
Q    And following — following up on the President’s visit yesterday —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — to Surfside: Once that investigation is complete and we know more
about what caused the collapse, is there legislation potentially — would
the White House be supportive of federal legislation that would address
issues like building standards and condo association oversight and
building recertification?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let’s see what the investigation concludes, and then we can
have a discussion about the next steps.  
   
Thanks so much, everyone.  
   
Q    Thanks a lot, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Have a great weekend.
