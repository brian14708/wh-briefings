title: Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Jen Psaki Aboard Air Force One En Route Cincinnati,
  OH
---
 
3:40 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Welcome to our trip to Cincinnati, Ohio — also known as the
birthplace of my husband.  So, a special place in my heart.  
   
A couple of announcements for you at the top:  
   
Today, Treasury released new data on the Emergency Rental Assistance
Program, which showed that more than $1.5 billion in assistance was
delivered to eligible households in the month of June — more than what
was provided in the previous three reporting periods combined.  The
number of households served in June grew by about 85 percent over the
previous month and nearly tripled since April.  
   
The data demonstrates that the administration has heard from states and
localities over the past months that ERA is helping develop a new
national infrastructure for rental assistance and eviction prevention
that did not previously exist.  
   
I would also note that also today, as a part of this effort, the White
House is hosting a second virtual convening on eviction prevention with
over 2,000 participants from cities and states across the country,
including the 46 cities that were the focus of the first summit on
January 30th.  That is virtual; everyone can tune in.  
   
Also, on August 25th, the President and members of his national security
team and across the administration will hold a meeting with private
sector leaders to discuss how we work together to collectively improve
the nation’s cybersecurity.  So that is a continuation of his effort to
work in close partnership with the private sector.  
   
Finally, I also wanted to note that, according to a new report from
Moody’s this morning, the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure
Framework and Build Back Better agenda will add almost 2 million jobs
per year, on average, across the whole decade while accelerating
America’s path to full employment and increasing labor force
participation.  
   
The Moody’s report also confirms that the — what the President said on
Monday: that these sorts of investments in making our economy more
productive will keep prices stable and decrease inflationary pressure.  
   
With that, where should we start?  
   
Q    Two questions off the top, on the debt limit.  Mitch McConnell said
today that Democrats should basically pass a hike in the debt limit on
their own; that Republicans would not vote for that.  What’s the White
House response?   
   
And does the White House believe that Democrats should pass a standalone
debt limit hike and sort of leave it up to Republicans?  Or would you be
open to including it in a reconciliation bill, or eliminating the debt
limit altogether?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we expect Congress to act in a timely manner to raise
or suspend the debt ceiling as they did three times on a broad
bipartisan basis during the last administration.  
   
As you all know, raising or suspending the debt ceiling does not
authorize new spending; it merely allows Treasury to meet obligations
that Congresses have already approved.  
   
I would also note that Republicans raised the debt ceiling throughout
the Trump administration, including after putting exorbitant deficit and
debt — debt-hoaking \[sic\] tax breaks — debt-hiking — sorry — tax
breaks for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations on the
country’s credit card.  So that’s what we expect them to do.  
   
Q  To follow up on a part that Alex just asked about at the end: Would
the administration be open to, whether now or in the coming weeks and
months, talking about fully eliminating the debt ceiling so that we
don’t have these crises — crisis moments every so often?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not making a projection of that.  We are fully expecting
Congress will raise the debt ceiling as they have numerous times over
the last couple of years.  
   
Q    But you want it to continue to exist?  
   
Q    Quick question on travel restrictions.  The airlines have been
lobbying the administration to ease travel restrictions on European
travel.  What’s the status of those conversations?  Are you moving
closer to that point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are ongoing discussions between the working groups
and, of course, updates and briefings with our health and medical
experts about when it is safe to do that.  We will be guided by the
science.  And I don’t have any prediction of what the timeline looks
like.  
   
Q    The President said a few days ago that he would have something more
to say within a few days on the travel restrictions.  Can you at least
give us a sense of the timing for when you think there may be some
easing or loosening?  Or is it — is the upsurge in Delta variants, in
cases involving Delta, pushing that off?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He gets regular updates from his COVID team; that’s what he
was referring to.  But he is going to be guided by their recommendations
on when we should ease travel restrictions, which are based on a range
of criteria.  
   
Q    Just on Nord Stream.  So, today there’s been announcements about an
agreement reached with Germany.  There were lots of signals about this
already last week.  There’s widespread criticism of this among
Republican lawmakers who feel that the administration isn’t actually
acting on the laws that they have passed — that have been passed by
Congress.  
   
Are you —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In what way?  
   
Q    Because of the waiving of the sanctions.  But then there are other
sanctions or other laws that haven’t — where sanctions haven’t been
fully implemented.  Are you concerned that you may be sending a wrong
signal to Russia about this pipeline?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say on part of your question: We’re
committed to following the law and continuing to examine entities that
have engaged in potentially-sanctioning behavior, as would be abiding by
the law.  That has not changed.  
   
This announcement today follows, of course, the meeting the President
had with Chancellor Merkel last week, where they said that they would be
asking their teams to look at practical measures we could take together
to address what our root issues are here, which we have voiced many
times in the past.  
   
So even though the pipeline was 90 percent built when the President took
office, what our objective is, is to prevent or reduce the geopolitical
impact that it was going to have.   
   
So I know these have been announced; I think a lot of you are following
them.  But for the purpose of the full context, these measures, in our
view, represent a significant impact by Germany, supported by the United
States, to push back against the Kremlin’s harmful activities and to
advance a more secure and sustainable energy future for Ukraine and
other frontline NATO and EU countries.  
   
So, yes, it was 90 percent built.  We feel confident about the impact of
these measures.  And, of course, we’ll continue to abide by the law,
which includes using sanction authority as needed.  
   
Q    Can you say how much U.S. money will flow into this billion-dollar
Green Fund for Ukraine energy independence?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question, Andrea.  Let me — it’s really a State
Department announcement that we’re making today.  I’ll see if there’s
more details I can get back to you.  
   
Q    Quickly, I have a follow-up on Nord Stream.  Is the Zelenskyy visit
a part of that deal in terms of, you know, giving them a visit as part
of the concessions to Ukraine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  No.  They’re unrelated.  We have long been in touch
with the Ukrainians about scheduling a visit.  
   
Q    And then, one other thing on the borders, please.  The reports
today that DHS has extended the restrictions on the Canadian and the
Mexican border: Can you give any explanation as to why, especially given
the recent announcement from Canada about vaccinated travelers?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We rely on the health — the guidance of our health and
medical experts, not on the actions of other countries.  
   
Q    And does the White House — is there concern, though, about
repercussions about, like, easing restrictions at one border and not the
other?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We created these working groups so that we could have an
open line of communication about what the criteria looked like, what
measures needed to be met.  Those are ongoing, and, of course, we are
continuing to be briefed internally as well.  
   
Q    Could you say something about infrastructure and, sort of, the
progress on the Hill and —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    — you know, the Republicans, potentially this group of 10 or 11
lawmakers, supporting a vote next week to move forward on the bill?    
   
And then, kind of related to that, on reconciliation: It seems like the
Democrats in the Senate are still a far way off from a real agreement on
that.  Would you be concerned if that gets pushed later into August,
into September, and this whole process continues to drag on?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, the President is enormously grateful to the
work of Republican senators who have poured so much good work — and
Democratic senators, of course — and vision into the bipartisan
infrastructure deal; is eager to deliver these economic benefits that
Americans in red states and blue states have deserved for so long.  
   
So, we certainly — we were encouraged to see the comments of Senator
Romney this morning, and we understand this is a legislative process,
and it’s ongoing.  
   
In terms of the reconciliation process, of course, we’re working in
close coordination with Leader Schumer.  We are grateful to his
efforts.  He has conveyed his interest in moving this forward in July,
and we’re — we’re looking forward to supporting that effort.  
   
Q    On the infrastructure, what — to the Republicans’ criticism about
the shell bill vote that’s being held today: Essentially, what is the
harm in waiting until Monday, like the GOP negotiators on the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Framework wish to do?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first note that this is just a vote on a
motion to proceed, so a motion to debate.  This is not a vote on a final
package.  And this is the same procedure that the Senate used as it
related to the AAPI Hate Crimes bill and as it related to a number of
pieces of legislation already this Congress.   
   
So, it is par for the course and normal operations up there on the
Senate side.  This is merely a motion to proceed, and certainly we were
encouraged, again, by Senator Romney’s comments this morning.  
   
Q    And sticking with some Congress news here, the select committee for
January 6: The White House statement that was released just before we
took off — among the things that was listed in this statement was that
they’re confident in Speaker Pelosi’s ability to proceed with an
investigation that is full, investigative, and transparent.  The word
“bipartisan” was not included in there.  And I’m wondering, is the White
House disappointed that Speaker Pelosi’s investigation, as it will
proceed, will be technically bipartisan because of Liz Cheney’s
involvement, but not truly bipartisan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  First, we stated at the time our disappointment that there
wasn’t bipartisan support for a select committee when there was an
opportunity to vote for that.  And we also have long stated our support
for Speaker Pelosi in getting to the bottom of what happened on January
6 — a dark day in our democracy — and we support her efforts for moving
forward on that initiative.  
   
Q    And, Jen, are you concerned that no matter what product comes from
Speaker Pelosi’s investigation or Leader McCarthy’s separate
investigation — that no matter what comes of it, the result is always
going to be perceived as partisan, based on what happened today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think many Americans across the country, regardless of
their political affiliation, look at the events of January 6 as a dark
day in our democracy.  The President strongly supports taking steps to
get to the bottom of what happened so we can prevent it from happening
in the future.  
   
Q    Jen, on the visit to Ohio today, the White House put out a
comprehensive list of what it says it’s going to be doing for the people
of Ohio, but notable in the absence in that list was anything about
fentanyl, the opioid epidemic.  Has that been deprioritized?  Where — is
it still a priority?  And what do you say to the people of Ohio and the
country with — there’s still a plateau and tens of thousands of people
dying?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely, it’s a top priority, and there’s no question it
is an issue that has impacted people across Ohio and continues to.  Any
health expert will tell you that the most important thing we could do is
make sure people have access to healthcare coverage.  That’s something
the President has taken a number of steps to ensure more people have
access to, including opening up the Special Enrollment Period, including
pushing for tax cuts to incentivize more people to get access to
healthcare.  That is the best way, but certainly this remains a priority
and will continue to be and he may even talk about it today in the town
hall.  We’ll see what questions come up.  
   
Q    Another question on behalf of the radio pool: Are you encouraged by
the shift in messaging by Republicans and Fox News now overtly talking
positively about vaccines?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to — I’m not going to designate it
around one individual or one network or one social media platform.  I
will say that our view is that we are at war with the virus; we are not
at war with a social media platform or with a network.  And so anyone
who goes out there and shares accurate information about the
effectiveness of the vaccine, about the fact that it can save lives, is
a positive step in our view, and hopefully it continues.  
   
Q    Jen, can I ask you another question on inflation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    The signs seem to be — there was a — there was a hope, I think,
that the prices would peak over the summer months.  Now it looks like
that may continue and slip into the fall.  Are you concerned by this
sort of sustained, you know, increase in prices and this sort of — like
the fact that it’s not coming down, or there are no indications yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we take inflation very seriously.  Obviously, it’s the
purview of the Federal Reserve, and I would point you to their
projections about inflation coming down in 2022.  That’s also in line
with a number of outside economists.  But we do take it incredibly
seriously.  
   
I would also note that there are a number of impacts, including the
economy turning back on; steps that we’re taking in addition to getting
more money in the hands of the American people, including the Child Tax
Credit that just started going out a few weeks ago, to make sure they
have extra assistance in this time, even as we’re seeing prices go back
up, some to pre-pandemic levels.  But we’re also working to get
important initiatives across the finish line.   
   
I would, again, return to where I started, which was the Moody’s
analysis that conveyed that this would help address inflation in the
future by providing more supply out there.  
   
Q    A COVID question, Jen.  If Axios hadn’t learned about the positive
case at the White House, would the White House have informed the public
about it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me give you a little bit of an update here.  One
moment.  I just want to do this completely accurately.  Sorry.  
   
Q    And sort of related to that, just — you know, is — are there any
discussions happening within the White House about potentially, you
know, direct- — or encouraging, if not requiring, mask wearing again on
the White House grounds or anything like that?  We’ve seen — I think
people are, on the Hill and at the White House, are wearing masks a
little bit more today than they might have been a week ago.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say on that: We abide by public health
guidance by the CDC.  The CDC guidelines currently are: If you are
vaccinated, you do not need to wear a mask.  If you are not vaccinated,
you should wear a mask.  That’s the guidelines we continue to give to
members of the White House staff.   
   
Now, if individuals decide to wear masks for whatever reason, we support
that, and that’s their personal choice — and individuals do for a
variety of reasons.   
   
So, let me just give you a little bit of an update to some of the
questions that were asked yesterday.  There are approximately 2,000
people on the White House campus each day.  So, statistically speaking,
COVID cases among vaccinated people will occur, just like they occur
across the country.  They have occurred; they will continue to occur. 
We’re prepared for that.  
   
So, as the instance yesterday shows, cases in vaccinated individuals are
typically mild or asymptomatic.  There’s — this is more — this is one
more reminder of the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines against severe
illness or hospitalization.  
   
Because of our commitment to transparency, what we’re going to be
providing are up- — moving forward — are updates on any White House
official who tests positive for COVID-19 that the White House medical
unit deems as having had close contact with the President, Vice
President, First Lady, or Second Gentleman.  That will up to — be up to
the White House medical unit, based on the criteria of the CDC.  And
this criteria, again, is up to the CDC.   
   
At no point has the President been required to change his behavior or
self-quarantine due to a close contact with an individual who tested
positive for COVID.   
   
I’d also note that, today, an email from our COVID-19 operations
protocol team has been sent to White House staff informing them of the
official policy that if you are in close contact with a principal and
test positive for COVID-19, your case will be disclosed to press, along
with any other relevant details, and that we will share the name of the
staffer if that individual agrees to do so.  Of course, we respect their
privacy.   
   
So, that is our policy moving forward.  
   
Q    Can I ask one follow-up on that?  For July 4th, anyone coming to
the White House lawn who was not vaccinated was asked to wear a mask. 
Should we take that policy to mean that the athletes who were unmasked
at the White House yesterday were all vaccinated?  Was that confirmed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The policy that we continue to convey with public events is
the CDC policy: If you are vaccinated, you don’t need to wear a mask. 
If you are not vaccinated, you should wear a mask.  
   
Q    Is that the same for outdoors, though?  You’re saying, outdoors, if
you are unvaccinated, you need to be wearing a mask if you’re at the
White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is — we — our guidelines are not different from what CDC
guidelines are.  
   
Q    What guidance is the First Lady following as she heads to Tokyo for
the Olympics?  And is there still confidence that she’ll be kept safe,
as we’re seeing some breakout infections?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Yeah — so, I would say: One, we have consulted.  The First
Lady is on her way — proceeding to Tokyo — and that has been done in
consultation with, of course, our White House medical unit, with staff
about what protocols she and the delegation should abide by.   
   
I would note that while she is leading this delegation — because it was
important to the President and the First Lady that we cheer on our
athletes and show support for the United States at the highest level —
it is a delegation of two, and usually it is a much larger delegation. 
They will have limited public interaction, and they will be taking every
precaution throughout the course of their trip.  
   
Q    Can you say another word about this cybersecurity meeting that
you’re hosting —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — or that the President will host on August 25th?  Can you say what
private-sector leaders are going to be participating, and whether —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re not quite there yet.  Yeah,  
I mean, it’s more than a month away.  
   
Q    No, I understand.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    But you — you know, you’ve had a focal point on ransomware.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    You’ve been having regular meetings on ransomware.  Is that going
to be a big focus for that meeting — ransomware?  Or is it, you know,
cybersecurity writ large?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  I think we’re not quite there on the agenda for the
meeting.  What I would note is that the President felt it was important
to use the White House as a forum for bringing together private sector
leaders to have a discussion about both how we can work together and
also what best practices are, which is including them taking — hardening
their own cybersecurity protections and also what the U.S. government
can do.   
   
And, as you know, there have been ongoing considerations, from a policy
perspective, of what we can stake \[sic\] — take — what steps we can
take.   
   
As you also know from covering this closely, ransomware attacks have
increased over the last 18 months.  There’s no question it’s a big issue
and factor for private sector companies.  I think there’s no question it
will be a part of the agenda at this meeting, but in terms of what the
day looks like, we’re not quite there yet.   
   
Q    Will the Milwaukee Bucks come to the White House?  Has the
President invited them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He did tweet about them today —  
   
Q    Yeah, I saw (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — congratulating them.  I’m sure we will invite them to the
White House.  We don’t have a scheduled meeting quite yet.  I’m sure
they’re celebrating on their own today.  
   
Q    About Iraq, if I may: When the Prime Minister comes to the White
House, should we expect announcements regarding U.S. troops or maybe a
timeline, anything?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to get ah- — quite ahead of the meeting. 
Obviously, it’s an important meeting to discuss our relationship with
Iraq and with the Prime Minister, and certainly our presence on the
ground and their role moving forward.  
   
Q    Jen, the State Department officials who were briefing earlier on
the Nord Stream deal made the point that getting this issue off the
table with Ukraine will allow a broader discussion of security issues
with Ukraine.  There’s been a lot of interest, of course, in terms of
supporting Ukraine vis-à-vis Russia and its aggression.  Are you — are
there any new initiatives that you can talk about in terms of bolstering
Ukraine security or the security of the Eastern Flank allies?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there’s a couple of things that were in the package
that, I think, will benefit Ukraine, so let me highlight some of those. 
Germany will help to preserve gas transit revenues for Ukraine and buy
time for Ukraine to eliminate its dependence on Russian gas and transit
fees, as it has long sought to do, including with U.S. support.  Germany
will do this by committing to appoint a special envoy to use all its
available leverage to negotiate an extension to Ukraine’s gas transit
agreement with Russia.  
   
There’s no question that the impact, in what we’re trying to address
here, is the impact on the Eastern Flank countries of this pipeline. 
And so that is part of our effort as we, you know, work to finalize the
deal announced today.  
   
Q    So, I mean, the President of Ukraine will be coming here to visit
with the President —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — at the White House.  What — you know, what is your vision at this
point — I realize it’s still a month off — but for that meeting?  I
mean, what do you hope to get out of that meeting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think we’re in a position to preview it quite yet. 
We will, as I — as we get closer to the meeting.  
   
Q    Should the Ukrainians feel a little disappointed about the Nord
Stream final decision going through?  And they’ve been kind of bracing
for it since May, when the U.S. said they would waive sanctions.  But
given the announcement today of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit later, based
on the decision that’s coming, do they have a right to feel a little
disappointed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think, again, part of the objective here, as the President
said last week, was to work to address the geopolitical impact of this
pipeline — a pipeline that was 90 percent built when the President took
office.  And Ukraine and the impact on their energy security is
certainly part of that, and there are initiatives in this that help to
address that.  
   
Q    Just something quickly on —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — on the statement that came in from the bipartisan group of
lawmakers working on the infrastructure deal: They say that they’ve made
significant progress and are close to a final agreement.  I don’t know
if you were aware of that before you came back here, or if there’s
anything else, sort of, on the progress here beyond what you said
before.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That certainly is a positive sign.  I will check more on
that and see if there’s more to report from our end.  But we’ve been
encouraged and grateful — encouraged by the progress and grateful to the
work of both the Democrats and Republicans involved.  
   
Okay.  Thanks, everyone.  
   
Q    Is there going to be ice cream in Cincinnati?  
   
Q    Graeter’s ice cream?  Raspberry chip?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — I don’t think so, but we’ll have to — I don’t know.  
   
(Laughter.)  
   
Q    Now I really want —  
   
Q    I’m sure he’s aware of it.
