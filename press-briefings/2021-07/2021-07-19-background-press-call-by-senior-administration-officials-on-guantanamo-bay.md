Via Teleconference

9:04 A.M. EDT  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for
participating in today’s call, which is on background and attributable
to a “senior administration official.”  
   
The contents of this call are embargoed until completion of the call.
For your awareness, the leaders on the call this morning are \[senior
administration officials\]. A reminder, though: For purposes of this
call, they are “senior administration \[official\] 1” and “senior
administration official 2.”  
   
With that, we turn it over to SAO-1.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for
joining us today as we announce news related to Guantanamo Bay Detention
Facility. Today, the Biden administration announces that, earlier this
morning, Abdul Latif Nasir has been repatriated to the Kingdom of
Morocco.  
   
The United States is grateful to the Kingdom of Morocco for its
willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay
Detention Facility.  
   
You may recall that, in 2016, the Periodic Review Board process
determined that law of war detention of Abdul Latif Nasir no longer
remained necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to
the national security of the United States. Therefore, the Periodic
Review Board recommended that Mr. Nasir be authorized for repatriation
to his native country of Morocco, subject to security and humane
treatment assurances.  
   
However, the steps necessary to effectuate that repatriation were unable
to be concluded prior to the end of the Obama administration.  
   
On June 17th of this year, the Department of Defense notified Congress
of its intent to repatriate Mr. Nasir to Morocco, and, in consultation
with our Moroccan partners, we have undertaken a responsible transfer.  
   
The Biden administration remains dedicated to a deliberate and thorough
process focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and
ultimately closing of the Guantanamo facility.  
   
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All right. With that, we’ll turn it over
to SAO-2 for brief remarks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning, and thank you for joining
us. The Periodic Review Board — or “PRB” — process is a discretionary,
interagency process established by Executive Order 13567 to determine
whether the law of war detention of a particular detainee remains
necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the
security of the United States.  
   
The PRB membership includes a cross-section of the national security
community. Each panel consists of one senior career official from each
of the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State;
the Joint Staff; and the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence. The PRB’s decisions are subject to review by the Review
Committee, comprised of the principals of those departments and
agencies.  
   
The Department of Defense developed and administers the Periodic Review
Board process for eligible Guantanamo Bay detainees, including the
provision of personal representatives to assist the detainees in the
process. Detainees may also have the assistance of private counsel in
the process at no expense to the government.  
   
In making a determination as to the eligibility for transfer, the Board
is given access to a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment of the
information about the detainee: information submitted in any previous
PRB hearings; any statements from the detainee, family members, and the
detainee’s personal representative and personal counsel; medical
information about the detainee, including mental health information; and
an assessment of conditions in the detainee’s home country.  
   
The PRB assesses that information together with the detainee’s testimony
at the hearing, should he choose to participate, to determine whether
continued detention remains necessary to address a continuing
significant threat.  
   
This transfer we are discussing today was certified by the Secretary of
Defense in accordance with the requirements as outlined in the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, and Congress was
appropriately notified.  
   
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And with that, we can go ahead and open
up for questions.  
   
Q  Hi, guys. Thanks for doing this. Can you tell us anything about
whether this is any kind of beginning of an acceleration of trying to
repatriate more Guantanamo prisoners? And can you tell us more about
military prosecutors asking, a couple days ago, to wipe from the record,
you know, information gleaned from torture and that decision? Thanks
very much.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, thanks. This is SAO-1. So, I will
say that, at the present moment, 10 detainees — there are 39 detainees
remaining at Guantanamo Bay; 10 detainees have been recommended for
transfer by the Periodic Review Board. We are continuing to rely on that
PRB process to determine whether law of war detention remains necessary
to protect against a continuing significant threat to the national
security of the U.S.  
   
But for those detainees that have been recommended for transfer, the
administration is very much focused on looking to pursue transfer, but
I’m not able to get into the specifics of the process underway.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q  Hi, thanks. I’m just going to try that again. How many — of the 10
that’s been recommended for transfer — how many is the administration, I
guess, negotiating over with other countries to take them? And can you
give us any sense of what countries you’re talking to? And who has the
lead on that for the administration — like, who is the person who’s
actually got point for negotiating to transfer people (inaudible)?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah. Sure. So, again, I’m not able to
share specifics of the state of diplomatic negotiations at present. But,
again, we’re very much focused on the (inaudible) deliberate and
thorough process to responsibly reduce the detainee population, and that
does, indeed, include identifying locations for transfer for the
detainees that have been recommended for transfer thus far.  
   
I want to underscore that, as we’ve demonstrated today, the Biden
administration will apply all the necessary diplomatic resources to
facilitate the transfer of detainees found eligible. So, the Department
of State is the lead for engaging in those diplomatic negotiations.  
   
Q  Hi, thanks for doing this. I just want to follow up on — regarding
Mr. Nasir, is he going to be detained in Morocco, or is he going to be
released under some sort of monitoring there?  
   
And also, can you give us an idea — just give us — I think it would
helpful just for everyone to have, like, the overall breakdown of the 39
people. You mentioned that there were 10 people in the PRB process or
who had been approved. Can you — and can you say how many are subject to
a military commission process? How many are approved for a potential
transfer? All of that, just so we have those numbers of the 39 that
remain. Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah. Thanks. And I’m going to have to
refer you to the government of Morocco for further information on the
status of Mr. Nasir now that he’s been repatriated.  
   
With regard to the breakdown, I don’t want to risk getting a number off,
so I’d like to take that — take that back, and we’ll get back to you
with the proper breakdown just to ensure that I give you exact
accuracy.  
   
Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can chime — “SAO-2” can chime in on
the exact breakdown of people.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, following this transfer today, there
are 39 detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Ten are eligible for transfer.
Seventeen are eligible for a Periodic Review Board. Ten are involved in
the military commissions process. And two detainees have been
convicted.  
   
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you for your math.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, everyone, we have some — we have
limited time on the call. I just wanted to, again, thank everyone for
participating this morning.  
   
Again, everything is on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials.” Contents are embargoed until completion of
this call.  
   
\[Redacted.\] And at this time, we’re going to conclude the call.
