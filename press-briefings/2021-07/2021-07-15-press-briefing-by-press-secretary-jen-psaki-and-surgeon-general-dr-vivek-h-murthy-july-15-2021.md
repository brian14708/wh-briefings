James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:05 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. We have another special guest today. Doesn’t
sing as well as our guest from yesterday — (laughter) — but very
knowledgeable.  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Definitely don’t ask me to sing.  
   
MS. PSAKI: (Laughs.) Today, we have a special guest, Surgeon General
Vivek Murthy. The Surgeon General has been one of our leading voices on
public health in the administration, in particular around the COVID-19
response.  
   
Today, he published an advisory on health misinformation as an urgent
public health crisis, and he is here to talk more about this issue and
take a few of your questions.  
   
With that, I will turn it over.  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Hello, everyone. How are you?  
   
Q  Good, thank you.  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: It’s nice to see you all today. And thank you,
Jen, for that very kind introduction.  
   
As all of you know, we’ve come a long way in our fight against COVID-19,
and we’ve come a long way thanks to the efforts of many, many people
across communities in the United States.  
   
But right now, we are seeing COVID deaths markedly down from their peak
in January. We have 160 million people who have been fully vaccinated.
And hundreds of thousands of people each day are choosing to get
vaccinated. That is all good news.  
   
But we are not out of the woods yet. Millions of Americans are still not
protected against COVID-19, and we are seeing more infections among
those who are unvaccinated. And that’s why I want to talk to you today
about one of the biggest obstacles that’s preventing us from ending this
pandemic.  
   
Today, I issued a Surgeon General’s Advisory on the dangers of health
misinformation. Surgeon General Advisories are reserved for urgent
public health threats. And while those threats have often been related
to what we eat, drink, and smoke, today we live in a world where
misinformation poses an imminent and insidious threat to our nation’s
health.  
   
Health misinformation is false, inaccurate, or misleading information
about health, according to the best evidence at the time. And while it
often appears innocuous on social media apps and retail sites or search
engines, the truth is that misinformation takes away our freedom to make
informed decisions about our health and the health of our loved ones.  
   
During the COVID-19 pandemic, health misinformation has led people to
resist wearing masks in high-risk settings. It’s led them to turn down
proven treatments and to choose not to get vaccinated. This has led to
avoidable illnesses and death. Simply put, health \[mis\]information has
cost us lives.  
   
Now, health misinformation didn’t start with COVID-19. What’s different
now though is the speed and scale at which health misinformation is
spreading. Modern technology companies have enabled misinformation to
poison our information environment with little accountability to their
users. They’ve allowed people who intentionally spread misinformation —
what we call “disinformation” — to have extraordinary reach.  
   
They’ve designed product features, such as “Like” buttons, that reward
us for sharing emotionally-charged content, not accurate content. And
their algorithms tend to give us more of what we click on, pulling us
deeper and deeper into a well of misinformation.  
   
Now, we need an all-of-society approach to fight misinformation. And
that’s why this advisory that I issued today has recommendations for
everyone.  
   
First, we include recommendations for individuals and families. We ask
people to raise the bar for sharing health information by checking
sources before they share, to ensure that information is backed by
credible, scientific sources. As we say in the advisory, “If you’re not
sure, don’t share.”  
   
Second, we’re asking health organizations to proactively address
misinformation with their patients. Today, the American Academy of
Pediatrics is announcing an educational campaign to help parents
navigate online health information. I’m encouraged to see this
commitment. And, again, this is just the beginning.  
   
Third, we’re asking educational institutions to help improve health
information literacy.  
   
We’re asking researchers and foundations as well to help us learn more
about how health \[mis\]information spreads and how to stop it.  
   
Today, the Rockefeller Foundation is announcing a $13.5 million
commitment to counter health misinformation. The Digital Public Library
of America is announcing that they will convene a set of librarians,
scholars, journalists, and civic leaders to confront health
misinformation together.  
   
Fourth, we’re saying we expect more from our technology companies. We’re
asking them to operate with greater transparency and accountability.
We’re asking them to monitor misinformation more closely. We’re asking
them to consistently take action against misinformation super-spreaders
on their platforms.  
   
Fifth, we’re also asking news organizations to proactively address the
public’s questions without inadvertently giving a platform to health
misinformation that can harm their audiences.  
   
And sixth, we know that government can play an important role too by
investing in research, by bringing individuals and organizations
together to address misinformation, and by supporting groups that are
working on this issue.  
   
On a personal note, it’s painful for me to know that nearly every death
we are seeing now from COVID-19 could have been prevented. I say that as
someone who has lost 10 family members to COVID and who wishes each and
every day that they had had the opportunity to get vaccinated.  
   
I say that also as a concerned father of two young children who aren’t
yet eligible for the vaccine, but I know that our kids are depending on
all of us to get vaccinated to shield them from this virus.  
   
Every week, I talk to doctors and nurses across our country who are
burning out as they care for more and more patients with COVID-19 who
never got vaccinated — all too often because they were misled by
misinformation.  
   
We must confront misinformation as a nation. Every one of us has the
power and the responsibility to make a difference in this fight. Lives
are depending on it.  
   
You can read the full advisory at
SurgeonGeneral.gov/HealthMisinformation.  
   
And I hope that you will see it as I do — as a starting point from which
we can build a healthier information environment, safeguard our nation
against future threats, and ultimately, empower people to lead healthier
lives.  
   
Thanks so much for your time. And I’ll turn it to Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Andrea.  
   
Q  Andrea Shalal with Reuters. I wanted to ask you whether you see any
evidence at all that the misinformation or disinformation that you’re
seeing comes from any nefarious sources. Are you seeing some structures
behind the scenes that point to who or what might be behind them? We’ve
seen Russian disinformation in the past. We’ve seen, kind of, that
hybrid warfare. Are you seeing any indication that there could be nation
states behind this disinformation?  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Well, Andrea, thank you for the question. The
misinformation that we’re seeing comes from multiple sources. Yes, there
is disinformation that is coming from bad actors. But what is also
important to point out is that much of the misinformation that is
circulating online is often coming from individuals who don’t have bad
intentions, but who are unintentionally sharing information that they
think might be helpful.  
   
And that’s why, in this advisory, we make it very clear that among the
things we’re asking individuals to do is to pause before they share, to
check sources. And if they’re not sure if a source is credible, to not
share. You know, one of the things we have said, again, is that when it
comes to misinformation, not sharing is caring — unlike what many of our
moms taught us earlier in life. (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q  Thank you very much. Surgeon General, is misinformation the number
one reason why people are not getting vaccinated?  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Well, Kaitlan, it’s one of several reasons why
people are not getting vaccinated, but it’s a very important one because
what we know from polls, Kaitlan, is that two thirds of people who are
not vaccinated either believe common myths about the COVID-19 vaccine or
think some of those myths might be true. Myths like, “You can get COVID
from the vaccine,” which is absolutely not true. So we know that it’s
not the only driver that’s leading people not to be vaccinated, but it
is a very important one.  
   
Q  And do you personally believe that public figures and public
companies that are helping spread misinformation about the vaccine
should be held accountable?  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Well, I think in a moment like this when we see
misinformation literally costing us our loved ones, costing us lives,
all of us have to ask: How we can be more accountable and responsible
for the information that we share?  
   
And those of us who may have larger platforms, I think bear a greater
responsibility to think about that. But the bottom line is all of us
have an important role here to play, and technology companies have a
particularly important role.  
   
We know that the dramatic increase in the speed — speed and scale of
spreading misinformation has, in part, been enabled by these platforms.
So that’s why in this advisory today, we are asking them to step up. We
know they have taken some steps to address misinformation, but much,
much more has to be done. And we can’t wait longer for them to take
aggressive action because it’s costing people their lives.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead in the middle, and then Rachel. And then,
unfortunately, he has to go. Go ahead.  
   
Q  So, the reality is a lot of the health misinformation you were citing
came from this lectern last year. I mean, what do you think the best
approach is to counter or deal with misinformation that comes from
public officials — people in position of authority?  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Well, what I would say is that when it comes to
determining what is accurate, in terms of health information, science
has to guide us. And the good news is that we have credible science
individuals in our country. We have doctors and nurses in communities.
We have public health departments and the CDC. We have medical schools,
nursing schools, and healthcare institutions.  
   
These should be our sources of credibility when it comes to evaluating
whether information is true or not. I think one of the greatest roles
that public leaders can play is to point to scientists and to credible
sources and have them speak directly to the public.  
   
I’ll note for you that that’s one thing that this administration has
done is work hard to put science, scientists, and healthcare
professionals in front of cameras to — having to speak directly to the
public. That’s what we have to do more of.  
   
The problem right now is that the voices of these credible health
professionals are getting drowned out, and that’s one of the reasons we
are asking technology companies to help lift up the voices of credible
health authorities. It’s also why they have to do more to reduce the
misinformation that’s out there so that the true voices of experts can
shine through.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, Rachel.  
   
Q  Thank you so much for taking my question. So are there specific
elected leaders that you believe are part of the problem with pushing
this misinformation?  
   
And we had an ABC News-Washington Post poll that showed that 93 percent
of Democrats say they’re vaccinated or will be vaccinated, but only 49
percent of Republicans say the same. So, how do you break through to the
people who may be trusting some of these elected leaders that are
pushing, maybe, some of this misinformation more than they actually
trust members of your administration?  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Well, thanks, Rachel. You know, I think about
this as I — as I think about doctoring, and as I think about my approach
to patients, which is: I recognize that each patient that I was blessed
to care for is an individual, you know, regardless of what their
political affiliation or their past may be. They’re an individual and I
— my goal was to understand what their needs and desires were, what
their values were, and then to help them improve their health.  
   
We have to take a similar approach here when it comes to reaching people
with information about COVID-19 and the vaccine. We’ve got to recognize
that sometimes the most trusted voices are not the ones that had the
most followers on social media or are the ones that have the most, you
know, name recognition. Sometimes the most trusted sources are a mother
or father or a faith leader or a local doctor or a nurse, and that’s
why, to reach people with accurate information, what we have to do is
partner with those local trusted voices.  
   
That’s why, in this advisory, one of the things that we point out an
important role for government is to support local organizations,
including healthcare professionals, so that they can get out there and
speak directly to people and share that information.  
   
These public health efforts move at the speed of trust, and we have to
recognize where trust is — you know, where those relationships are —
invest in them, support them, so that people can ultimately get the
information they need to improve their health.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Thank you so much for joining us.  
   
Q  Jen, I have a follow-up for —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Thank you.  
   
Q  — the Surgeon General on —  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think he has to go, unfortunately. Thank you so much.  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: Thank you so much, Jen. Thanks, everyone.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay, I think we’re getting ready to start the briefing. I
think everybody has a lot of questions. So why don’t you —  
   
Q  (Inaudible.) You never —  
   
MS. PSAKI: We — we are going to proceed with the briefing, and then
we’re happy to take lots of questions in the room.  
   
Okay. So, unemployment claims, which you all saw the data come out this
morning — today’s data on new unemployment claims is further proof that
the President’s economic plan is working.  
   
Today marked another new pandemic low in initial unemployment claims —
the lowest level since March of 2020. And the four-week average of new
claims continued to decline, dropping to its lowest level in 16 months —
down 55 percent since when President Biden took office.  
   
This is evidence of the strengthening labor market we’re seeing across
the economy: Unemployment is down, wages are up, and three million new
jobs have been created in five months — the fastest rate in U.S.
history.  
   
We just gave you a few headlines over here, just in case you haven’t
read all of your own coverage. (Laughter.)  
   
And because of the President’s Rescue Plan and his work curbing the
pandemic, the United States is expected to return to full employment by
next year instead of 2024, which was the projection when the President
first took office.  
   
Another piece of news today: We heard the President, of course, announce
today that $15 billion in Child Tax Credit payments were distributed to
tens of millions of families, covering 60 million children. Working
families will receive these payments on the 15th of every single month
for the next year thanks to the American Rescue Plan.  
   
Eighty-six percent of American families will receive their payment by
direct deposit. It will show up in their bank accounts as “Child CTC.”
Others will receive their check in the mail today or in the next few
days.  
   
And just as a reminder: The American Rescue Plan is providing the
largest-ever Child Tax Credit. And this is a historic increase that will
provide middle-class families with critical tax relief. And many project
it will help cut the child poverty rate in half.  
   
I have a little update for all of you on ransomware, as well as
vaccines. And then we’ll get to your questions.  
   
In April, the President directed agencies to take aggressive action to
counter the ransomware threat at home and abroad. We have coordinated
these efforts, regularly convening an interagency task force that drives
coordinated whole-of-government action to counter ransomware.
Participation spans the whole government including law enforcement, the
intelligence community, center risk management agencies, regulators, and
other national security agencies.  
   
Today, as a part of our ongoing ransomware efforts, the Department of
Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Treasury, and State announced
new resources and initiatives to protect American businesses and
communities from ransomware attacks.  
   
Those include: The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of
Justice launched StopRansomware.gov, a coordinated, federal government,
one-stop resource for public- and private-sector organizations to reduce
their risk of ransomware attacks.  
   
The Department of Treasury announced a FinCEN exchange on ransomware to
discuss efforts by the public and private sectors to increase targeted
information sharing and analysis, and pursue criminal actors and
networks that engage in such attacks.  
   
And the Department of State announced it will offer up to $10 million in
rewards for information leading to the identification or location of any
person engaged in state-sponsored, malicious cyber activities.  
   
This is a part of our ongoing efforts and our ongoing work of our
interagency process that is a new — a newer initiative in this
administration.  
   
Finally, last night, Haiti received 500,000 doses of COVID-19 Moderna
vaccines donated by the United States through the COVAX facility. And we
will send a significant amount of additional doses to Haiti soon, in
consultation with local health authorities.  
   
The embassy in Haiti has worked closely with Haitian health — the heal-
— Haitian Health Ministry, Pan American Health Organization, and UNICEF
to ensure that these vaccines arrive safely and securely, and that they
are also distributed equitably and without interference to the people
who need them most.  
   
We remain, of course, a partner of the Haitian people in building a more
stable and secure Haiti, including in its fight against COVID-19.  
   
Go ahead, Alex.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. Can you talk a little bit more about this request for
tech companies to be more aggressive in policing misinformation? Has the
administration been in touch with any of these companies and are there
any actions that the federal government can take to ensure their
cooperation, because we’ve seen, from the start, there’s not a lot of
action on some of these platforms.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, first, we are in regular touch with these social
media platforms, and those engagements typically happen through members
of our senior staff, but also members of our COVID-19 team, given, as
Dr. Murthy conveyed, this is a big issue of misinformation, specifically
on the pandemic.  
   
In terms of actions, Alex, that we have taken — or we’re working to
take, I should say — from the federal government: We’ve increased
disinformation research and tracking within the Surgeon General’s
office. We’re flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread
disinformation. We’re working with doctors and medical professionals to
connect — to connect medical experts with popular — with popular — who
are popular with their audiences with — with accurate information and
boost trusted content. So we’re helping get trusted content out there.  
   
We also created the COVID-19 — the COVID Community Corps to get factual
information into the hands of local messengers, and we’re also
investing, as you all have seen in the President’s, the Vice
President’s, and Dr. Fauci’s time in meeting with influencers who also
have large reaches to a lot of these target audiences who can spread and
share accurate information.  
   
You saw an example of that yesterday. I believe that video will be out
Fri- — tomorrow. I think that was your question, Steve, yesterday; I did
a full follow-up there.  
   
There are also proposed changes that we have made to social media
platforms, including Facebook, and those specifically are four key
steps.  
   
One, that they measure and publicly share the impact of misinformation
on their platform. Facebook should provide, publicly and transparently,
data on the reach of COVID-19 — COVID vaccine misinformation. Not just
engagement, but the reach of the misinformation and the audience that
it’s reaching.  
   
That will help us ensure we’re getting accurate information to people.
This should be provided not just to researchers, but to the public so
that the public knows and understands what is accurate and inaccurate.  
   
Second, that we have recommended — proposed that they create a robust
enforcement strategy that bridges their properties and provides
transparency about the rules. So, about — I think this was a question
asked before — there’s about 12 people who are producing 65 percent of
anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms. All of them
remain active on Facebook, despite some even being banned on other
platforms, including Facebook — ones that Facebook owns.  
   
Third, it’s important to take faster action against harmful posts. As
you all know, information travels quite quickly on social media
platforms; sometimes it’s not accurate. And Facebook needs to move more
quickly to remove harmful, violative posts — posts that will be within
their policies for removal often remain up for days. That’s too long.
The information spreads too quickly.  
   
Finally, we have proposed they promote quality information sources in
their feed algorithm. Facebook has repeatedly shown that they have the
levers to promote quality information. We’ve seen them effectively do
this in their algorithm over low-quality information and they’ve chosen
not to use it in this case. And that’s certainly an area that would have
an impact.  
   
So, these are certainly the proposals. We engage with them regularly and
they certainly understand what our asks are.  
   
Q  And then, one of the problems with vaccines right now is that they
become politicized. You guys — the White House has obviously made the
calculation that it’s important to be more aggressive in confronting
this information, but is there at all a concern that that could backfire
and further contribute to politicization? And is there anything that you
can do to prevent that at this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, you’re abs- — you’re absolutely right, I should say,
Alex, in that we have to be very careful and we are mindful of being
quite careful of not politicizing the effectiveness of vaccines, the
fact that they can save lives — young people, old people,
middle-of-the-road people.  
   
It’s important for us — we’ve made a calculation to push back on
misinformation. You’re right. But that’s one of the reasons, as Dr.
Murthy was conveying, we have empowered, engaged, funded local voices,
because they are often the most trusted voices — doctors, medical
experts, clergy — you know, people who are members of — civic leaders in
communities.  
   
That’s where we are putting most of our resources, even as we are
working to combat misinformation that’s traveling online or traveling,
unfortunately, out of the mouth of elected officials from time to
time.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Just want to follow up on the ransomware —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  — questions. So the President told us last week that there’s this
meeting tomorrow of the U.S.-Russian working group on ransomware. Can
you say a little bit more about that meeting?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think it was actually yesterday.  
   
Q  It was? Okay. And can you give us any kind of a further readout of
what decisions were made, if any? Last week, the President also said
that it made sense to potentially go after servers that were being used
in these ransomware attacks. Has the administration made any decisions
about whether to proceed with that kind of action?  
   
MS. PSAKI: So I would say that the meeting, which I believe was
yesterday — I will double confirm for you, Andrea, and for others — but,
is part of ongoing engagement that has been occurring at the expert
level since the President met with President Putin.  
   
So it’s been ongoing. No one meeting is necessarily decisive; it’s about
having a continued discussion about our expectations and steps that need
to be taken to address ransomware attacks, cyberattacks, and what the
capacities are on information of course that we have.  
   
In terms of specific actions, the President, of course, reserves the
right and the option to respond in a time and a manner of his choosing
should he believe actions warrant. But I’m not going to preview that
from the podium today or probably any day.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  So a senior administration official had told us in the aftermath of
that conversation that we should expect action within days and weeks,
and some of it would be visible, some of it would not be visible. I
understand you can’t share a lot of information, but can you say whether
any action has in fact been taken that perhaps is not visible to us?  
   
MS. PSAKI: There’s nothing more I can preview or detail for you from
here. I certainly understand the interest.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  The President has designated $10 billion for testing in schools, but
we’ve seen some states, like Idaho and Iowa — they say they don’t even
want the money. So is that a mistake? And who should be held responsible
if children in those schools get sick?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, certainly, we’ve always said from the beginning that
local school districts are going to make decisions about how to use the
funding and resources available, but also how they’re going to apply the
mitigation measures that have been laid out by the CDC. And certainly we
would expect that members of their local community, parents, others who
care about the health and wellbeing of their children would voice their
concern if they have it. But it’s always worked that way in terms of
local school districts implementing policies.  
   
The role of the CDC is to provide public health information. Our role
from the federal government was to secure funding to ensure schools that
need resources — they don’t all need resources — but have access to
those funds should they need it. Many have used it, many have applied
it, and many schools will be opening as a result of that funding.  
   
Q  Is there a concern, though, about not being able to even track an
outbreak if there is one because of the lack of testing, possibly?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we certainly — the CDC certainly does track where there
is a rise in cases. As you see, they put out publicly available data. I
expect they would continue to do that. But I would point you to them for
more information on how they would track.  
   
Q  Can I just ask one quick follow-up on inflation: We heard from the
Fed Chair, Jerome Powell; he’s testifying on Capitol Hill this week. He
noted that inflation has notably increased but he believes that it will
remain elevated in the coming months before moderating.  
   
We’ve heard from Republicans who say the administration is sort of
flooding the economy with cash. Even Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin
— I talked to him yesterday — he says that he has concerns about
inflation. Is the White House underestimating the impact of all of this
government spending that it will have on inflation?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, our experts believe — and the data shows and the
Federal Reserve Chair, who operates independently, conveyed, yesterday —
that most of the price increases we are seeing are expected to be
temporary due to the consequences of restarting an economy shut down
during the pandemic. And we’re seeing that in certain industries more
than others as prices go back to where they were pre-pandemic. And that
certainly was an ex- — we had an expectation that would be an impact.  
   
So areas like spike in car prices due to supply chain challenges on the
— on the restart or a spike in hotel room costs as the hospitality
industry gets going — these are — a number of these are transitory or
they’re impacted by other factors, including supply chain issues, which
we’re working with Democrats and Republicans to help address through the
CHIPS legislation.  
   
But I want to be clear: We take — we understand the threat that
inflation poses. We will be vigilant as responses are needed — are
needed.  
   
As it relates to legislation: We’re continuing to advocate for the way
to keep prices in our economy down is to increase the supply of goods
that consumers want to buy and keep the costs of producing and getting
them to market lower. That’s exactly what the President’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Framework and the Build Back Better plans will do.  
   
And I would also remind you all, it’s an eight-year investment in better
roads, bridges, and transit systems. So this is not an immediate influx
in the next few months of funding; it’s over the course of several years
because this is a long-term issue.  
   
And it will also — if, as we — as we work to pass the Build Back Better
reconciliation package, increase the availability of childcare, more
workers will enter the workforce, increasing our output, and helping to
keep prices down.  
   
So we are quite mindful of it. We do monitor it. I would also note the
Federal Reserve, who’s independent, has also projected that the
inflation numbers will come down to about 2.2 next year from where
they’re projecting for this year, which is something we also watch
closely.  
   
Q  Can I follow up on that, Jen?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q  Is the —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q  Are you confident that the government is going to be able to find the
parents who qualify for the Child Tax Credit but are outside of the tax
system?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we have a — as you’ve seen as we’ve implemented a
number of our programs to date, we have a means — a number of means of
trying to identify individuals who are eligible for these programs. Some
of it is by promotion in communities for individuals who may not have
had to pay taxes or may not be in the system.  
   
And certainly we will be vigilant and do everything we can to reach
every single person who’s eligible, get out the word to communities that
they are — that they are maybe people who are eligible, even if they
don’t make enough money to pay taxes.  
   
Q  So what are the other avenues, specifically, that you’re using to
find these parents?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think you’ve seen us use a number of avenues in the
past few months where there were not individuals — as it related to our
$1,400 checks that we put out just a few months ago. We put out a
website where people could go if they had not paid taxes because they
did not make enough money to pay taxes.  
   
We also, of course, work with local communities to get out and make sure
— get the word out and make sure people know they are eligible. Again, I
would think — I think that, starting today, the vast majority — vast,
vast majority of people who are eligible, of course, will get their
checks direct — through direct deposit and through direct checks. So,
we’re talking about a small percentage of individuals who we would be
looking to find. And, of course, we will be vigilant about doing
everything we can to find them.  
   
Q  And one follow-up on that: Will the President accept a spending bill
that does not extend the tax credit for four years like he wants?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, there’s —  
   
Q  (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI: There are a range of details I know you are all eager to see
and to have, and there’s been reporting about it. We will certainly
leave it to Leader Schumer and Democrats on the Hill to put out all of
the specific details.  
   
But the President certainly understands that there could be changes,
even to his original proposal and even from here as the final
negotiations continue.  
   
Q  So, he would accept that? Sorry.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to negotiate from here, Kaitlan, but we’ll look
to see what the final package looks like.  
   
The President has advocated for an extension of the Child Tax Credit
because he thinks it is a benefit that helps working families. That’s
why he’s proposed it in multiple packages, and we’ll look to see the
final details.  
   
Go ahead, Weijia.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. I know you said this is moving, but some Democrats
have expressed they believe the Child Tax Credit should be permanent.
Does President Biden agree with that or does he think the four-year
extension is adequate?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, as you know, Weijia, he put in his proposal a five-year
extension. He certainly understands that there was going to be — and
there was — a range of views. Some wanted it shorter. Some wanted it
longer. Some didn’t want it at all. That’s part of the negotiations and
the discussion.  
   
I think one of the calculations here that senators and Congress have to
work through is what components can be worked through that you can pay
for in the package. That’s a factor as it relates to — certainly to the
Child Tax Credit, which, as I understand, costs about a billion dollars
a year.  
   
So, we’ll let them work out the length of it, and we look forward to
seeing the de- — the final details made public in the coming days.  
   
Q  On the bipartisan bills —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  Some Republicans have just said that — that they’re not prepared to
vote on something that is not written yet. They just expressed this on
the Hill. As Senator Romney said, it would be a dereliction of duty to
vote, even procedurally, on something that has not been written. Does
the President agree with Senator Schumer’s timeline to hold a vote
before all the language is finalized?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I think it’s important to remember that there
was an agreement that many senators were a part of — Democrat and
Republican — on the framework that is the basis of this piece of
legislation — right? — that they agreed to. The President certainly
expects that everyone will stay true to their commitment, as — as he
will.  
   
Of course, the President believes that his most important role he can
play is to continue to advocate for the key components of what’s in this
package, why it’s important for people to support it in Congress, and
why the American people should be excited about investments in roads and
railways and bridges and investments in making sure we’re addressing our
climate crisis.  
   
He will leave the mechanics and the timeline up to Leader Schumer.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. Now that you’ve had a few days to think about it,
does this White House still think the protests in Cuba are happening
because people are upset about a rise in COVID cases there or is there
some thought, maybe, given to the possibility that they’re protesting
because they are sick of communism?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, Peter, first, I would say: Communism is a failed
ideology, and we certainly believe that. It has failed the people of
Cuba. They deserve freedom. They deserve a government that supports
them, whether that is making sure they have health and medical supplies,
access to vaccines, or whether they have economic opportunity and
prosperity.  
   
And instead, this has been a government — an authoritarian communist
regime — that has repressed its people and has failed the people of
Cuba. Hence, we’re seeing them in the streets.  
   
But I would note that the ideology of the government, which has failed,
has led to a fail- — a lack of access to economic opportunity, to
medical supplies, to COVID vaccines. So all of those pieces are true.  
   
Q  And there are protesters now in this country who are chanting, as
these protests in Cuba are going on, “Where is Biden?” So, where is he?
What is he doing to protect these people who are rising up against the
leaders of this failed experiment?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, first, he is certainly advocating for and speaking out,
as we put out a statement — multiple statements — maybe one of you will
ask him a question about Cuba today. I will — I will leave it to all of
you to determine that.  
   
But, one, he has made clear that he stands with the Cuban people and
their call for freedom from both the pandemic and from decades of
repression and economic suffering to which they’ve been subjected by
Cuba’s authoritarian regime.  
   
There’s an ongoing review of our own policies. And as we look at those
policies, one of the big factors is ensuring we are not doing anything
to pad the pockets of a corrupt authoritarian regime. And that is
certainly a factor as he’s considering, but we’re looking closely at how
we can help in a humanitarian way, how we can help support the voices of
the Cuban people, and there’s an ongoing policy review in that regard.  
   
Q  We’d be happy to ask him about it later if he calls on us.
(Laughter.) But one more —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Anyone can ask anything they want. But go ahead.  
   
Q  One more for you: Why is the Secretary of State Blinken trying to
address human rights in the U.S. by inviting experts — U.N. experts from
Cuba and China here?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I would say that the Secretary put out an
extensive statement on why he is holding — why he believes that we need
to play a role in lifting up and pushing countries to do better on human
rights, on ending systemic racism in their countries. Certainly, human
rights is always going to be a priority for the Biden administration and
for this State Department.  
   
As the Secretary said in his statement, he believes responsible nations
must not shrink from scrutiny of their human rights record. Rather, they
should acknowledge it with the intent to improve it, and also push and
lift up and put a — shine a light on other countries that need to do
better. And that is the role we’re playing here from the United
States.  
   
Q  But you just rattled off all these problems with Cuba. They’ve got
dissenters disappearing down there. In China, they’ve got a million
religious minorities in internment camps. Why are they going to come
here and tell us how to improve our country?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I certainly don’t think that’s the format of the event. But
lifting up and elevating human rights; systemic racism; the — the steps
that have been taken — the poor treatment of Uyghurs, as I think you’re
referencing here — in China; and pushing other countries with a
spotlight on them to do better is certainly a role we can play from the
United States.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Can I ask about South Africa very quickly?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  There have been days of looting and unrest there in South Africa.
They’ve now destroyed hundreds of businesses. At least 117 people there
have been killed. Does the White House have any reaction to what’s
taking place there? And what, if any, role does the U.S. government have
here to help try to quell the situation?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We certainly track and watch closely and certainly have
concerns about unrest that we see in the streets in South Africa.  
   
In terms of the specific actions, I think the State Department is
probably best equipped, but I’m happy to talk to our national security
team if there’s anything specifically we can convey from here.  
   
Q  Let me follow up. Yesterday, I asked you about Afghanistan. Is there
anything more you can tell us about those Special Immigrant Visas as
they relate to the Afghan interpreters, translators, engineers, and
others?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. Let me try to provide a little bit more detail on how
the process works, which I — you have all understandably been asking
about.  
   
So, as I’ve noted in the past, our immediate focus is on interested and
eligible Afghan nationals and their families who have supported the
United States and our partners in Afghanistan and are in the application
pipeline — so translators, interpreters, others, their family members
who are in the process.  
   
There are approximately 20,000 Afghans who have applied. So, those are
the individual interpreters or translators; that does not include their
family members. And about half that have completed the necessary
paperwork to move forward in the process.  
   
I believe, also, the State Department is going to do a more thorough
briefing, but I’ll just go through as many details as I can from here.  
   
Once individuals — this is how the process works — once individuals are
approved through the security vetting process — which their paperwork
conclusion does not conclude it; there’s another vetting process they
would conclude — they may be eligible under humanitarian parole.  
   
Under that parole, a lot — a large portion of that group could be
relocated directly to a military base in the United States where they
would receive medical checkups.  
   
Those who have not yet completed their background checks would first be
relocated from Afghanistan to either a U.S. military base overseas or to
third countries, where they will be safely housed until their visa
processing is complete and they can be transferred to the United
States.  
   
I would also note we are not considering any location or place for the
third-party countries that would not be safe, would not treat them with
respect, and not — would not ensure that they are treated humanely
through the journey of their process.  
   
Also, on our vetting process — this is a thorough process. There are
some of these individuals who have completed their paperwork and are in
through the vetting process. Their family members may not be in the same
stage of the vetting process, so that may have an impact too of the
timeline and how — not the timeline, but of, kind of, how they’re moved
and where they are moved to.  
   
So — and the third par- — the third-country move would be temporary
until they finalize their paperwork and security vetting process is
complete.  
   
So that is a little bit more detail on the process. Hopefully, that
helps.  
   
Go ahead, Alex.  
   
Q  President — former-President Bush yesterday, in an interview,
criticized the withdrawal, and he said he’s very concerned about the
Afghan women. So what is the U.S. going to do to ensure the safety of
those women in Afghanistan after we leave?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I would say that the President agrees that we
need to ensure we are continuing to support — through humanitarian
programs, through security programs — the women of Afghanistan. And we
certainly respect the right of the former President to voice his view on
— on Afghanistan and the President’s decision.  
   
It’s not a secret that President Biden and President Bush haven’t seen
eye to eye on matters relating to the use of military force. So, we
respect his right to voice his opinion; we just disagree.  
   
I would also note that while we continue to provide security and
humanitarian assistance, we also intend to have a diplomatic presence on
the ground to continue to be a source and resource for individuals in
Afghanistan.  
   
Q  And, just secondly, Senator Manchin is quite upset about some of the
climate provisions in the 3.5 trillion package. Is the White House
reaching out to him? Is it — is the White House prepared to move off of
some of that — lessen the — some of the provisions?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we, of course, are in touch with Senator Manchin, I can
assure you, as we are in touch with a number of senators who will be —
who have been pivotal partners and will continue to be moving forward.  
   
I think there was — one of the concerns I think I saw expressed — but
tell me if this is what you were asking about — is fossil fuels. Is that
the specific piece?  
   
Q  Right.  
   
MS. PSAKI: So, while of course the pa- — the plan and the package will
go a long way in addressing the climate crisis — and that is a huge
priority to the President, ensuring that these tax credits are in the
reconciliation bill, which is something that did not make it into the
bipartisan deal, is something the President has advocated for. And we’re
eager, of course, to pivot to a clean energy future.  
   
We don’t intend to do so just by — just by banning fossil fuels or
leaving any working community behind. And what we’d certainly convey to
any concerned individuals is that President Biden has formed an
interagency working group to mobilize federal investments to support
hard-hit coal, oil, and gas, and power plant communities across the
country. That working group has already identified 30 billion in
existing federal resources that could be accessed by communities.  
   
We don’t want to lose — leave communities behind. We still think we can
move forward in addressing our climate crisis.  
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q  A follow-up to that —  
   
MS. PSAKI: First day of your presidency. Congratulations, I think?  
   
Q  Thank you very much. No, it’s —  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t know if it’s “congratulations”; it seems hard to
make. Go ahead.  
   
Q  — “Thank you” when it’s over. (Laughter.)  
   
I wanted to ask a follow-up to Alex’s question, and that is: How does
the President see his role in the negotiation on the reconciliation
bill? Is he an intermediary between some of the more liberal elements of
his party and Senator Manchin? Is he a closer? Is he directly involved
in this? He went up to Capitol Hill yesterday. What’s he going to be
doing in the weeks ahead?  
   
MS. PSAKI: He’s going to be available for whatever is needed to get
these bills across the finish line. And a lot of the discussions are
happening, certainly, at a staff level. As you all know, we have a
number of very experienced individuals here who have gotten a lot of
bills across the finish line: Steve Ricchetti, Ron Klain, Louisa
Terrell, and many beyond them. They are playing a big role — Brian Deese
— in discussing and having conversations with members.  
   
A lot of the discussions, though, are primarily between the Democratic
members themselves about what the final package and the final details
look like. Leader Schumer and his team will put out the final details on
— on the timeline that works for them.  
   
But I will tell you: The President is available. He’s ready. He’ll pick
up the phone. He’ll host people. He’ll have snacks, drinks — whatever is
needed in order to get these bills across the finish line. And I think
leaders in Congress certainly know that.  
   
Oh, go ahead, Brian.  
   
Q  Thanks. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, to follow up on
inflation. Inflation surged to 5.4 percent in June — its the largest
jump since 2008. You all say it’s temporary, but today Axios is
reporting the JPMorgan Chase CEO is saying, “I don’t think it’s only
temporary,” and that it’s a little worse than the Fed predicts. Now,
there’s a disparity there. How are you going to address what they think
may be permanent?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say, first, that many outside experts,
including the Federal Reserve — even if JPMorgan or Jamie Dimon or
whomever it is disagrees — have projected that the — that the rise of
inflation is transitory and have projected a lowering of inflation next
year.  
   
We also have seen in the data that some of the issues — and I outlined
this a little bit earlier, like the spike in car prices, which we know
has a bigger issue — has another issue involved in it, which is the
supply chain issues which we’re trying to separately address — or hotels
and some of the — of the industries that — related to travel that have
seen increases because the economy is turning back on.  
   
So we certainly will refer to economic experts out there, the Federal
Reserve, and many others who have projected the transitory nature of
this, as well as what we see as a number of the factors that are leading
to the impact currently.  
   
Q  The second question is about Jeff Flake. Earlier this week, he was
nominated to the President to go to Turkey as our envoy. That
ambassadorship is — that’s a problematic area. What is it exactly in the
former senator’s background that gives this administration confidence
that he can carry out his task there?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, he’s a former member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee — someone who played an important role in discussing,
debating, and — and working on a range of foreign policy issues as — in
his role as a former U.S. senator. So that is a pretty good basis.  
   
Okay. Francesca, go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. I have a foreign policy question.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  Just to stay on inflation for a moment: What is the White House’s
message to average Americans, including those who are limited income,
though, who are experiencing higher prices right now for food and
clothing and other goods and services. You mentioned that it’s expected
to die down next year, but what is your message to them in the meantime?
Is it simply just to wait it out?  
   
MS. PSAKI: That’s certainly not what I’ve ever said, but I will say our
message is that we understand the threat that inflation poses. We will
be vigilant about any responses needed.  
   
It’s important for Americans to know and understand that these impacts
are temporary and some of these price increases are a result of the
economy turning back on. And experts will tell you that — whether it’s
the hotel industry or the airline industry going back to pre-pandemic
prices.  
   
I’ll also note that the President has taken a number of steps, including
ensuring that the vast majority of the American people were getting
$1,400 checks, getting the Child Tax Credit out to people’s bank
accounts today, because he knows that Americans need a little extra help
— still need a little extra help as the economy turns back on. So he’s
committed to helping working people, and it’s also important for people
understand the transitory nature of inflation.  
   
Q  And can you provide a status update on investigative assistance for
Haiti? And also, when can the public expect the administration to make a
determination on whether it’s changing its policy towards Cuba?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. I don’t have anything for you on the timeline on Cuba
policy. I will note that we certainly look at the policy through the
prism of how we can most help the Cuban people — the people who have
been out in the streets looking to have their voices heard in these
protests.  
   
And even as we look at individual components of policies that would be
under consideration — including, say, remittances — there are a range of
factors. There are a number, of course, of people who have called for a
return for allowing remit- — remittances to go from family members to
individuals in Cuba.  
   
On the flip side of that, or one of the challenges is: the prevention or
our desire to prevent remittances or any funding going in the hands or
the pockets of leaders in Cuba.  
   
So, these are challenging issues. There’s an ongoing review. I don’t
have a timeline to preview for you.  
   
In terms of Haiti — let me see. I do think I have a little bit of an
update for you. Let me see what I have for you.  
   
So we’ve — we’ve provided a couple of updates of what we’ve provided.
So, I — just in case you don’t have this. The FBI is providing
investigative assistance to the Haitian authorities at the request of
the government of Haiti. They remain committed to working alongside our
international partners to administer justice. That was a specific ask.  
   
We’re also continuing to provide ongoing security assistance and — and
consultations, as they have also requested. We’re still working with
leaders in Haiti to refine their requests, and that review is ongoing.
We’re in regular touch. And as we have additional components to provide,
we’ll share that with all of you.  
   
Q  I think we have to wrap.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay. Let’s — go ahead. One more. One more.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. I — two quick ones. So, first —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Uh — yeah, I know. I — we’re wrapping. It’s like a last
one.  
   
Q  — Senate and House — Senate and House Democrats say that they want to
put citizenship halfway into the reconciliation package. Is the White
House supportive of that strategy?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yep.  
   
Q  Okay. And then — can I squeeze in my last one — (laughter) — since
that was so fast?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. That was an easy one. Go ahead.  
   
Q  Okay, so the — Florida’s governor and some FEC commissioner in Miami,
representatives are calling on Biden to greenlight a plan that would
allow the deployment of higher altitude communication balloons to beam
Internet into Cuba. Is this something the administration plans to do?
And if not, why not?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, the lack of Internet access, as you know, which is why
you’re asking, is a huge issue in Cuba and one that is very challenging
for the people of Cuba so they can gain access to accurate information,
they can correspond with family members and others.  
   
We are certainly looking at that to see what can be done to address, but
in terms of that specific proposal, I don’t have an assessment of that.
I can see if there’s more specifics on it.  
   
Q  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Thanks, everyone.
