  \ Raimondo, July 22,\_2021"

12:41 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  Okay, we have a special
guest.  Happy to welcome back Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.   
   
Today, she will be telling us about a new economic development
initiative that the Department is launching, thanks to the American
Rescue Plan.  She’ll take a couple of questions.  After that, as always,
I’ll be the bad cop.   
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to Secretary Raimondo.  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Thank you, Jen.  Let’s see here.  Thank you,
Jen.   
   
Good afternoon, everybody.  So, as the President often says and as we
all know, we’re on the road to recovery.  And today, with this
announcement, we mark a real step forward in that recovery.   
   
As Jen just said, the President signed the American Rescue Plan into
law, intended to get our country back on its feet.  And thanks to that
law, I’m thrilled right now to be announcing the launch of a
transformative $3 billion economic development initiative that will be
running out of the Department of Commerce.  I’m even more excited to say
that, starting today, this afternoon, every community in America can
begin applying for that funding.   
   
We believe that this is the largest local economic development
initiative that the Commerce Department has ever made.  And it’s a
testament to the President’s commitment to do far more than simply
recover, but to build back better and make sure every community and
every American is included in our comeback.  
   
Everybody ought to benefit from this $3 billion initiative — from
working mothers working to balance multiple jobs; to young adults
looking for work; to factory workers or retail workers who lost their
job in the pandemic — many of them mid-career and they’re wondering,
“What happens to me now?  What happens to me next?”  
   
These funds — this initiative has been specifically designed to make
sure that we are going to be providing high-quality, real jobs for you
and for your community.  
   
What we saw during the pandemic, and what we all know, is that some
people did very well.  Those who were doing well did very well.  But
millions of Americans continue to struggle, and it’s uneven.  Those who
continue to struggle — it’s been disproportionately women, people of
color, communities of color, rural communities, and Tribes.   
   
We know 2 million American women dropped out of the labor force since
the start of the pandemic, mostly because of lack of affordable
childcare and paid leave.  So, ensuring that these $3 billion are
distributed equity is core to our investment strategy.  We know that
equity is good for workers, good for business, and good for the
economy.   
   
As many of you know, I’m the former governor of Rhode Island, and, as a
governor, I saw what good-paying jobs mean to American families and mean
to communities.   
   
This initiative has the potential to create, we believe, 300,000 jobs in
the near term, revitalize dozens of communities around America, and
drive innovation in unser- — underserved communities and revitalize
depressed economies.   
   
The good news is the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development
Agency has been doing this for decades.  They have a track record of
success.  In fact, I saw that, on Monday, when I was in Albany, where
EDA’s investment over the last 10 years have helped that city and region
become a global semiconductor and bio-science hub.  And, in fact, the
employment growth rate there has grown by 30 percent in those
industries.   
   
This initiative that I’m announcing today will bring that type of
transformative growth to communities all over the country.   
   
So, at the end of the day, as the President has so often said, our
economy can’t recover until everybody in every community is included.   
   
So I’d like to briefly describe the components of this $3 billion
initiative.  It begins with what we’re calling the “Build Back Better
Regional Challenge”.  This is a $1 billion challenge for up to 30
regions across the country seeking to revitalize their economies.  It’s
designed to focus on innovation and spur projects that grow new
industries and scale existing ones.   
   
Secondly is what we’re calling the “Good Jobs Challenge,” which
allocates a half a billion dollars towards industry-led workforce
training and apprenticeship programs with a particular focus on women,
people of color, and underserved communities.  
   
Importantly, we have designed this so that funds can also be used for
support services like childcare and transportation while folks are
getting trained so we make sure they — they get to the finish line of
the training and get a job.  
   
For the hard — hard-hit communities hit hardest by the loss of travel
and tourism, we’re providing $750 million to accelerate the recovery of
trarel \[sic\] — travel tourism and outdoor recreation.  Through the
economic adjustment assistance, we’re offering a half a billion dollars
to hundreds of communities across the country to create new jobs, spur
economic development, and put Americans back to work.   
   
Our “Indigenous Communities Commitment” sets aside $100 million to meet
the needs of Indigenous communities with everything from broadband to
health centers and more — deliberately designed to be flexible to meet
the needs of the community.  
   
And finally, we are making a $300 million commitment to invest in
economic development in coal-affected communities.  We believe that this
$300 million investment in coal communities is the largest economic
development that EDA has ever made in coal communities.  And we know
that it will enable these communities to recover, diversify their
economies, and grow.  
   
So, these grants together reflect the values and priorities of President
Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, and they, alongside of the Jobs Plan,
will accelerate America’s economic recovery and help the country
continue to get back to work.   
   
So, spread the word.  It’ll be — applications go live this afternoon,
and we look forward to working with communities around America.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jeff.  
   
Q    Madam Secretary, two questions.  One, can you explain how people
can apply for these grants?   
   
And two, on a separate topic:  The Commerce Department has a Supply
Chain Advisory Committee.  Can you give us an update on what you’re
doing about chips and other supply issues?  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Yeah.  Thank you.  So, as I said, this afternoon,
on the EDA website — the EDA website applications will be live.  So we
want to get this money out the door as quickly as possible.  EDA has six
regional offices around the country, which we will be working with.  But
this is — I want to clarify: This money is for states, cities, counties,
nonprofits, universities — not for companies.  So it’s coalitions of
nonprofits in communities, specifically designed to be locally led and
managed.   
   
We’re doing a lot on the chip shortage.  I am engaging almost daily with
industry.  We are working as hard as we can to get the House to pass the
CHIPS Act or their version of USICA.  And we’re putting plans in place
right now, already, on the team to invest the $52 billion.  We need to
incentivize the manufacturing of chips in America.  And so, we are very
focused on putting the pieces in place so that can happen.  
   
Q    With regard to the EDA grants, I understand that you’re going to
judge some of these by return on investment.  How are you defining ROI,
given that that can often exclude priorities like gender and racial
equality?  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  So, our number one investment priority is equity. 
And as our team decides which — these are — this is a competitive grant
process.  By the way, I think that the fact of the competition will help
communities to come together as a community and put their best ideas
forward.  
   
In order to qualify to get the money, you have to prove to us that
equity — you’ll have an equity lens.  And whether it’s job training that
you’re doing, you have to give — you know, I have to make sure that
women, people of color, veterans, people who’ve been left out will be
included in this.  
   
So it’s a lens that we’re going to take across the $3 billion.  
   
Q    And, like, whoever does it the best?  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Correct.  Exactly.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Rachel.  
   
Q    What type of — thank you, Madam Secretary.  What type of follow up
will there be?  You’re emphasizing equity, but will you be following up
to make sure that that money is distributed fairly to the communities
that you’re speaking of that really do need it?  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Great question.  So, we are deeply committed for
this to be transparent.  Everything is going to be online.  It’s going
to be on our website.  It’s going to be a wide-open, transparent
process.  And we are, at the get-go, putting in place accountability
measures.  And this is something I am very serious about — having been a
governor, being on the ground.  We’re going to track every penny to make
sure that it’s doing what it’s supposed to do.   
   
And the ROI — the ROI is jobs. We think we can create, in the short
term, hundreds of thousands of jobs, and fundamentally revitalize dozens
of communities around America so that, a few years from now, we’ll
create 300,000 jobs; 10 years from now, we will have communities that
are a beehive of economic activity that, five years ago, were
distressed.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Nancy.  
   
Q    Thanks, Secretary Raimondo.  A few days ago, the U.S. government
and governments around the world accused China of malicious cyber
activities.  Have you gotten any reaction from your Chinese government
counterparts about these accusations?  
And do you believe that the statements alone are going to be enough to
change Chinese behavior if they aren’t paired with punitive measures
like tariffs or sanctions?  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Yeah.  So I have not had — to answer your first
question, the answer is: No, I have not had any interaction.   
   
The Pre- — President Biden has been very clear on this: There will be
consequences.  And we will use all tools at our disposable \[sic\] — at
our disposal in order to protect Americans and American businesses.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Tamara.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You mentioned that some of this money would go to
communities hit hard by the loss of travel and tourism.  Do you have a
sense of how big that hit has been and how — what share of that is
because of the public health-related travel bans?  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  So, we know that nearly every community in America
has been affected.  And I want to be clear that, of the $750 million,
every state will receive something.  So, $500 million is going out as
quickly as we can in the next few weeks, and everyone will participate. 
And then, $200 \[million\] or so is competitive.   
   
I think that it’s im- — I think the answer to your question is — it’s
impossible to answer — or I don’t — I don’t think it’s possible to
figure it out that way.  But we do know, about a year and a half ago, we
shut down travel and tourism.  I lived it in Rhode Island — you know,
Newport, Narragansett, Block Island closed; we shut it down.  And we’re
still trying to build back after that.  
   
And so that’s what this money is intended to do: to help these
communities to get back into the business of tourism and travel.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Kelly.  
   
Q    How would you assess, Madam Secretary, the work — worker shortage
that many employers are finding — that they’re having difficulty getting
back up, especially in some of the hospitality and tourist areas?  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  It’s — it is acute.  There — there is — every
business I talk to says that they need to find talent.  So, I don’t know
if I would call it a “shortage,” per se; I would say there’s a skills
gap.  And that’s why we put so much money of this $3 billion — you know,
a half a billion of $3 billion is just for skill development,
apprenticeship, high-quality job training.   
   
What I hear all the time is — from companies — “We are ready to hire,
but people need to have the skills.  They need digital skills,
cybersecurity skills, data — you know, data skills, cloud computing
skills.”  And so that’s what we have to get at the business of.   
   
And by the way, we need to make sure that women and people of color and
people in rural areas have those digital skills so they can get those
good jobs.  So that’s what this is about.  And that’s what I hear most
often from companies.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Kaitlan is going to have to be the last one.  
   
Q    Thank you, Secretary.  Last week, the President said he would have
an update for us on international travel restrictions in a few days.  Do
you have any update on that?  And do you believe it’s time for the U.S.
to reopen its borders?   
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  I do not have an update on that except to say a
couple of things: International travel is vital, and it’s vital to
commerce.  And we are taking a methodical approach based on data and
based on science.   
   
My primary message with respect to that and to the American people: Get
vaccinated.  Like, increasingly, this is a disease of the unvaccinated. 
Ninety-seven percent of people in hospitals with COVID are
unvaccinated.   
   
So, if you’re asking me, you know, what can we do to get our economy
back on track — get vaccinated.  Because as more people do that, then we
can continue to think about opening travel, going back into the office,
et cetera.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you, Secretary Raimondo.  We appreciate you.  Thank
you so much.   
   
Q    Just a quick follow up on training?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sorry.  She’s got to go.  Busy day.   
   
Okay.  Couple items for you at the top.  This afternoon, the President
will bring together leaders from both the labor and business community
at the White House to talk about the critical need to invest in
America’s economic strength by passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Framework.   
   
While some of the participants at this roundtable may have sat across
the negotiating table in the past, now they’ve joined together as part
of a broad coalition of labor and business leaders backing this plan. 
And they’re joined in their support by bipartisan leaders in Washington,
governors, mayors, and an overwhelming majority of the American
people.   
   
I also wanted to note that today the Department of Justice is
announcing, or has announced, the launch of five gun trafficking strike
forces in regions around the country to combat the uptick in gun crimes
that we’ve seen over the last 18 months.   
   
As part of this announcement, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney
General will visit the headquarters of ATF in Washington before the
Attorney General travels to Chicago to meet with the leaders from the
Chicago Police Department and attend a listening session with
participants in a group that offers innovative programming to reduce gun
violence.  
   
The regional strike forces we’ve talked about a bit in the past, but
they will leverage existing resources to ensure sustained efforts across
city and state boundaries to help stem the supply of illegally
trafficked firearms in five key regions: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles,
the San Francisco Bay Area/Sacramento region, and Washington, D.C.   
   
And this is part of the administration’s comprehensive crime reduction
strategy announced last month by — at the White House with Attorney
General Garland.   
   
In addition to targeting gun traffickers to keep guns out of the hands
of criminals, the President’s plan bolsters local law enforcement
efforts by giving them the resources they need to hire more police
officers and engage in effective community policing.   
  
I also wanted to note that, this afternoon, the President will sign H.R.
1652, which will help strengthen and restore funding for the Crime
Victims Fund, which has lost billions of dollars over the last five
years.   
   
This was originally passed in 1984 and — which established the Crime
Victims Fund, which received most of its fundings — funds through
deposits from criminal fines and penalties from convictions in federal
cases and does not receive any appropriated funding of taxpayer
dollars.   
   
The awards grants the — this — the awards grants to states, local
governments, and other entities through DOJ Office for Victims of
Crime.   
  
With that, Josh.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Three subjects.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    First, given the spread of the Delta variant, return to offices, is
the administration looking at new mask guidance, as reported by The
Washington Post?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know that the head of the CDC, our public health
arm, just spoke to this earlier this morning and made clear that there
had not been a decision to change our mask guidance.  
   
Q    Two, it’s being reported that President Biden plans to impose
sanctions on Cuban officials because of the attacks on protesters.  Can
you outline the administration’s goals with regard to those
sanctions?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, I can confirm for all of you that there will be
more from the Department of Treasury and the Department of State later
this afternoon on sanctions.  And the announcement will be coming from
then — from them.  
   
But I — in terms of our approach to Cuba and what we’re trying to
accomplish, we have, of course, condemned mass detention, sham trials,
and disappearances that are attempts to threaten the Cuban people into
silence.   
   
We continue to call for swift — the swift release of peaceful protesters
who have unjustly been detained.  We’ve made clear over the last week
that addressing this moment was a priority for the administration and
for President Biden, and that he has — he had asked his team to look
into a range of options that would both help the Cuban people, help
provide humanitarian assistance, help look into addressing issues like
the lack of Internet access, and that also sanctions authority was a
part of those considerations.  So this is an announcement that will be
coming later this afternoon.  
  
I’d also note that we’ll continue to engage closely and coordinate with
our international partners, from the OAS to the U.N. and others, to
collectively condemn the actions of the Cuban government.  
   
Q    And then last, real quick, National Association of Realtors says
that home prices are up 24.3 percent from a year ago to $363,300 — a
record.  Are home prices too high for an economy that’s supposed to be
growing from the bottom up and middle out?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say the President is quite focused on
making sure we’re doing everything we can to help middle-class families
as the economy is recovering and as there are ongoing challenges in our
economy that have been longstanding, including supply chain issues,
which you and many others are quite familiar with.   
   
And as he talked about a little bit last night, there are a range of
factors that impact that — the shortage of lumber that is starting to
pick back up has, of course, impacted the building of new homes, which
has raised the pri- — the prices of older homes.   
   
So, his focus and a big focus of this administration is on addressing
supply chain issues to help address some of these skyrocketing prices in
the market.  But, also, he is focused on providing assistance to
renters, to homeowners, and others to get through this period of time in
our economy.   
   
Go ahead.  
  
Q    Jen, today, China rejected a WHO plan for a second phase of an
investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, including audits of
laboratories and markets.  What is the White House’s reaction to that? 
And how will this impact the U.S. dealing with China on this going
forward?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first reiterate that we — the United States
supports the WHO plan for phase two, which commits to ensuring these
studies are scientific, transparent, expert-led, and free from
interference.   
   
We have certainly seen the PRC’s comments again rejecting phase two of a
WHO study.  We’re deeply disappointed.  Their position is irresponsible
and, frankly, dangerous.  Alongside other member stat- — member count- —
states around the world, we continue to call for China to provide the
needed access to data and samples.  And this is critical so we can
understand to prevent the next pandemic.  This is about saving lives in
the future.  And it’s not a time to be stonewalling.   
  
I would note that we believe in a multilateral approach; that has not
been an approach that has been taken prior to the President taken office
— taking office, and that has been a big focus of his strategy —
strategy as it relates to our engagement with China.   
   
So — and that relates to our approach to global health security, which
is why we rejoined the WHO on day one.  Unfortunately, phase one, as you
all know, did not yield the data and access from China that we think is
necessary.  But our support for a multilateral approach and the phase
two plan is because it’s rigorous and science-based.   
   
But most importantly, it’s not just the United States calling for this. 
As a part of our renewed engagement and our efforts to build a coalition
of support around the world with allies and partners, we’re joined by
the international community on this — partners and multilateral
organizations who are also calling for and pressuring China to be
engaged in the sta- — the second phase of this discussion.   
   
I would also note — I’m almost done; there’s a lot to say about this
topic.  In Cornwall, which many of you were with us — with us for that
trip, the G7 leaders, together, called for a transparent, evidence-based
investigation, including in China.  And after the phase one study, we
were joined by allies and partners across the world in a joint statement
calling for a transparent and independent analysis expressing our
concerns over the lack of access and urging momentum.   
  
It’s clear China isn’t living up to their obligations.  What our focus
is on is building this multilateral effort and support for putting
pressure on and making clear that it’s unacceptable and dangerous.  
  
Q    Do you foresee any consequences for China for this decision?   
  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to get ahead of any policy process.  I
will tell you that, again, our approach to China, as it relates to
global health security, is going to continue to be in a coordinated
fashion with our international partners.  
  
Q    And just one last one on China.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
  
Q    They also started a new crackdown in Hong Kong, this time on
children’s book authors.  Any thoughts on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we have expressed many times before — unfortunately,
because there has been reason to express many times before — our
concerns about the crackdown on freedom of speech, freedom of media, a
crackdown on — on human rights activists in Hong Kong.  And we continue
to express that.   
  
Go ahead.  
   
  
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You mentioned there had not been a decision to change
the guidelines on wearing a face mask for fully vaccinated Americans. 
But have there been any conversations within the administration about
possibly changing those guidelines?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we are guided by the science, and we’re guided by our
public health experts.  And any decision would come from the CDC.  The
head of the CDC spoke to this earlier this morning.   
   
Q    So conversations within the administration — that’s what the
Washington Post was also reporting: There were early conversations in
the administration about possibly changing those guidelines.  
  
MS. PSAKI:  I’ve seen the reporting, but what I can tell you is that
there has been no decision to change our mask guidelines.  Any decisions
about public health would be driven by the CDC.  But, of course, we are
engaged with public health experts and the CDC about how to continue to
attack the virus.  And we’ve never said that battle is over; it’s still
ongoing.  
  
It would be more concerning — or should be more concerning to all of you
and the American people — if we were not having those conversations. 
So, there are certainly conversations about steps we can and should
take.  But I think Dr. Walensky was quite clear this morning.  
   
Q    And just one quick follow-up.  We heard the CDC Director today warn
about the rise in the Delta variant, saying that it’s spreading with
incredible efficiency.  At what point would the White House reconsider
the protocols for the President and for administration officials?   
  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re guided by the public health guidance and the CDC
guidelines, and that’s what we abide by here.  They have not changed
those, and so we continue to abide by the guidelines we have announced
to all of you.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Obviously, there are a lot of parents who are
wondering what school is going to look like in the fall.  And last
night, the President said this, quote, “The CDC is going to say that
everyone under the age of 12 should probably be wearing a mask in
school.  That’s probably what’s going to happen.”  Has the CDC indicated
that that is in fact their position already —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They already —  
   
Q    — and how soon could we hear from them about that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  They did already announce that several weeks ago as a part
of their CDC guidance for schools — because anybody under 12 is not
eligible to be vaccinated, so they would not be vaccinated, and so
therefore they should be wearing a mask.   
   
Q    Got it.  Also, we now know that Hunter Biden is going to be able to
meet with prospective buyers at two art shows where his paintings are
going to be on display later this year.  How does this square with the
goal of keeping him in the dark about the buyers of his art as a means
to prevent even the appearance of undue influence?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, this showing that was — that you’re referencing was
previously public.  He’s not going to have any conversations related to
the selling of art.  That will be left to the gallerist, as was outlined
in the agreement that we announced just a few weeks ago.   
  
We believe this is a reasonable system that has been established that
allows for Hunter Biden to work in his profession within appropriate
safeguards.  So he’s not going to discuss anything related to the
selling of art.  And I would reiterate that the gallerist will be the
only person who handles transactions or conversations in that vein and
will reject any offer that is out of the ordinary.   
   
Q    Wouldn’t it be more transparent to just release the names of the
buyers so that everyone would know who purchased this art and how much
they paid?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we don’t — we won’t know who the buyers are; Hunter
Biden won’t know who the buyers are.  So, I think the re- — the origin,
I think, of this line of questioning, which is understandable, is about
whether this would provide un- — provide a situation for undue
influence.  But we won’t know who they are, so there’s no scenario where
they could provide influence.  
   
Q    Couldn’t they just announce on social media that they bought a
painting?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I think we have set up a system which we feel is
appropriate — has appropriate safeguards.  We believe that Hunter Biden,
just like any child of a President, should be able to pursue their
professions and their passions.  And any selling of the art would be
through the gallerist.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  On schools, first: Now that the Education
Department admits they made a mistake in their guide for reopening by
in- —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  How so?  
   
Q    Well, they included advice from the Abolitionist Teaching Network,
and they came out and said that was not supposed to be in there.  Is the
administration going to follow up with school districts to make sure
that the Abolitionist Teaching Network material is not in lesson
plans?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, just to be clear, for the context — because I know you
love context of what —  
   
Q    Yeah.  (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — you’re asking about here — what you’re referring to is a
citation in a report of which there were 1,000 citations.  So, I’m quite
impressed with your researchers for finding one of a thousand
citations.  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It was an error in a lengthy document to include this
citation.  This specific site does not endor- — we — does not represent
the administration’s view, and we don’t endorse the recommendations of
this group.  And I believe it’s been removed or is in the process of
being removed.  
   
Q    But we are close to the schools reopening.  And is there any
concern if you don’t endorse this material that was in there — citation
or not — that it’s in lesson plans?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that — as we — we said many times
before — we don’t dictate or recommend specific curriculum decisions
from the federal government.  That is and will continue to be handled at
the local level.  And we believe that the American people trust teachers
to make those decisions, not government.   
   
Q    And then, on masks: A few weeks ago, the President said we were
“closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.” 
Is that still the case if you guys are now reportedly considering asking
vaccinated people to wear masks again?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first of all, the CDC Director, who oversees decisions
along those lines and all of our public health decisions, made clear
that that was not a decision that had been made, just a few hours ago. 
So, I point out that first.  
   
Second, I would say: What the President was referring to and continues
to talk about, as he did last night at a town hall, is that we’re quite
proud of the progress that’s been made.  People over 65 — more than 80
percent are vaccinated.  Almost 70 percent of adults are vaccinated.  A
hundred and sixty-two million Americans are vaccinated.  That is
certainly progress.  
   
But we are still at war with the virus; we’ve never said that would be
over.  We’ve always said that we’d be — continued to — continuing to
focus on ensuring we’re meeting people where they are and getting them
vaccinated, keeping them safe.  
   
Q    But, the President said, in May, “vaxxed or masked.”  Is — I think
a lot of people got the vaccine because they were hearing him say, “If
you get the vaccine, you don’t have to wear masks anymore.”  So —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And that continues to be CDC guidance.   
   
Q    And you can say that that’s going to be the guidance forever?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I am not the CDC Director.  
   
Q    I understand, but people don’t care who tells him to wear a mask. 
If it’s the White House —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They should care.  
   
Q    — if it’s the White House or the CDC, what difference does it
make?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Shouldn’t they care if it’s a doctor or medical expert or a
spokesperson?  I think most Americans actually do care.  
   
Q    It’s the government.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Kelly, go ahead.  
   
Q    Is there a conversation about encouraging people to make the
personal choice that Dr. Walensky talked about today — if they, for
example, are vaccinated but live in a state with low vaccination rates
or have other considerations?  Is part of your messaging going to be
encouraging the personal choice piece on mask wearing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that is currently our messaging, right?  So I would
say that for communities, where there are lower rates of vaccination —
and, as we know, that’s really concentrated in only a handful of states
across the country where most of the cases are coming from, as we’ve
seen the rise in the Delta variant, which is more transmissible, and, if
you’re not vaccinated, it is transferring, no question, more quickly
across people — people should wear masks.  And that is something we will
continue to encourage leaders and civic leaders and educators and people
who are trusted voices in communities to make clear.  
   
Q    And those are vaccinated people you’re referring to — to make the
personal choice to wear the mask in those high-rate areas?  That’s what
I’m asking about.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s — that’s not the advice of the CDC at this point in
time, so that is not a message we are conveying to people.   
   
Q    Okay.  Dr. Walensky said today that it can be a personal choice
with the vaccinated.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of course.  Of course, it can be.  And some people make that
decision because they are immunocompromised, because they have family
members, because they just want an extra layer of protection, and we
should all respect that.  But it is not proactive guidance that the CDC
is providing.  
   
Q    Last night, the President said, “You’re not going to get COVID if
you have these vaccinations.”  Why did he say that when that is not what
the science says?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what the science says is that 97 percent of
hospitalizations are people who are unvaccinated.  So, yes, there are
cases of individuals who are vaccinated, to be absolutely clear, who —
who do have — gotten COVID.  It is a very small percentage and a small
number of people.  
   
And those cases — vast, vast, vast majority are asymptomatic and they
have — they have minor symptoms, which means that you are largely
protected.  That was the point he was trying to make last night.   
   
Q    It’s been a couple of days since we talked about the breakthrough
case on the campus here and that you acknowledged there were additional
breakthrough cases.  Can you give us, now, the number of breakthrough
cases that have occurred during the Biden presidency?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that our medical experts, our
health experts have been conveying from the beginning, as have we, that
there would be cases of individuals who are vaccinated who tested
positive for COVID.  There are 2,000 people who work on the campus, and,
of course, that means that, just statistically speaking, there will be
people who are vaccinated individuals who get COVID on the campus.   
   
What I announced yesterday or conveyed yesterday was what our policy
would be moving forward.  But, no, I don’t think you can expect that
we’re going to be providing numbers of breakthrough cases, no.  
   
Q    Really?  That’s not transparency to give us a number — not the
names, but a number of these cases?  You must have that information.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Kelly, I think, one, we’re in a very different place
than we were several months ago.  The vast, vast, vast majority of
individuals who are vaccinated who get COVID will have — will be
asymptomatic or have mild cases.   
   
Every individual at this White House has been offered a vaccine, and we
have been very clear that we will be transparent with anyone who has had
close proximity contact with the President or any of the four
principles, as deemed by the White House Medical Unit, with all of you. 
And if they — if they approve having their name released, we will also
release their names, but we will protect their privacy.   
   
That will be our policy moving forward, and we understand and agree that
that is in the public interest.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, last night, at the CNN Town Hall, the President was asked by
an — a restauranteur about the worker shortage that the Commerce
Secretary just called “acute.”  She described it as a “skills gap,” but
the restauranteur said that he had, right now, job openings that he
can’t fill.  And he asked the President if there’s anything that his
administration can do to help him and his business.  The President
seemed to struggle with an answer.  Is there anything that his
administration can do to help that restauranteur or people who are
similarly situated with this acute worker shortage?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that we have already implemented —
and the money has gone out the door — goes — it continues to go out the
door for our Restaurant Restabilization Program — something that was a
part of the American Rescue Plan and helped many, many hundreds of
restaurants across the country stay open, reopen.  And that was
assistance that came from the American Rescue Plan that the President
signed into law.   
   
I think what the President was noting is that, at this point in time,
it’s also a workers’ market.  And in some places, it may be that you
have to pay more wages in order to attract workers.  We don’t have all
the details, of course, about his individual circumstance, but we
implemented a major program that helped restaurants stay open —
something we strongly supported, we advocated for as a part of the
package.  
   
Q    If I can ask a follow-up to the question about the President’s son
and the art gallery event.  You said that Hunter Biden is not going to
discuss anything related to the sale of his art.  Is that a promise that
has been made in writing?  And if so, is that an agreement that could be
made available to the public?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m making that clear to all of you now that that is an
agreement that has been made as a part of this — as a part of these
events.   
   
Q    Is it in writing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can check and see if there’s more detail.  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But I think it’s pretty clear what the agreement is, so I’m
not sure it’s more complicated than that.  But I will see if there’s
more to provide.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  One on masks and then one quick one on the Fed after
that.  Dr. Fauci told reporters earlier today that there isn’t enough
research to know whether breakthrough cases can result in long COVID. 
The President has repeatedly told the public that, you know, they should
— they’re safe from the worst effects of COVID.  How can he be sure
without this research?  And if there’s even a chance that breakthrough
cases can result in long COVID, why not recommend masks more widely?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what the President is referring to — one,
we’ve seen some interesting polling over the last week — I believe it
was a CBS poll — that showed that vaccinated people in the country are
more fearful about the Delta variant than unvaccinated people.  That’s
clearly concerning to us because unvaccinated people should be more
fearful.  And what the President wanted to convey to people in the
country is the impact and effect of getting vaccinated.  
   
So, we also know statistically that 97 percent of hospitalizations are
for people who are unvaccinated and that the vast majority of cases are
asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms, which the health and medical
experts will tell you —  
   
Q    We’re talking about the long-term — long-term effects here — right?
— which we don’t know yet.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s true.  There’s still research about a range of
components of the impacts of COVID over the long term, which our health
and medical leaders will advise us on.  They also have not changed their
guidance on masks.  That is not a determination that’s being made by —
from a political standpoint or from anyone in the White House.  That is
something the CDC and our health and medical experts are advising on,
and they look at a range of factors.  
   
Q    And just on the Fed.  Is the President concerned at all that
choosing a new Federal Reserve Chairman during a period of economic
uncertainty and inflation could complicate economic recovery or spook
the markets?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I just have nothing to preview for you in terms of the end
of the term next winter.   
   
Go ahead.  Oh, you already asked.  Go ahead, Jen.  
   
Q    On infrastructure, Senator Carper, one of your allies, said that he
wants to make sure that the water infrastructure measures that the
Senate already passed and the Surface Transportation Reauthorization
bill that passed out of his committee are also included in the
infrastructure agreement.  I know that the bipartisan group said
yesterday that they were 99 percent of the way there.  I know there are
some issues that Republican lawmakers are working out with the White
House right now.  Are Senator Carper’s concerns also something that the
White House is aware of and working on at this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re certainly aware of the concerns that have been
expressed, or asks or requests by a range of members.  This is typically
what happens, as you all know, in this period of time where we’re very
close to a point where there’s going to be a vote on a motion to
proceed.  And everybody who has initiatives, who has priorities is going
to make their voice heard.  That’s a part of the process.  We respect
that.  So, certainly, we’re engaged in discussions, as is the
leadership.  
   
And I would also note that — that we are — we see clear signs of
momentum.  And we’re quite — we were quite encouraged by the letter —
yesterday’s letter signed by 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats showing
positive signs about being able to go forward soon.  And the President
is, of course, eager to deliver these economic ben- — benefits to
Americans in red states and blue states that they’ve long been waiting
for.  
   
Q    Do you think there’s flexibility to add more money to this bill for
those measures that were — got wide support on the Hill, in the
Senate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think there was a clear agreement that the President and
members of both parties stood outside of the White House and announced
just a few weeks ago.  Of course, there will be final discussions over
the coming days as they work to finalize the bill text.  
   
Q    And just on the filibuster: The President said last night that
getting rid of it would throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing
will get done, and that’s sort of his justification for not getting rid
of it.   
   
With maybe the exception of anything that can kind of be done along
party lines and perhaps this infrastructure bill as well — likely this
infrastructure bill — is anything getting done?  Will anything get done,
you know, that can’t just be done through reconciliation, you know, once
we get past this infrastructure thing?   
   
And/or if the things that can’t get done are things like voting rights
that are so big — or dealing with climate or immigration — is there
really any difference between having the filibuster in place and getting
rid of it?  What’s sort of the President’s justification for not getting
rid of it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, the President doesn’t make the decision on
filibuster rules or parliamentary rules in the Senate; the Senate does. 
And he’ll leave that to the Senate.  It also requires the majority in
the Senate to support a rule change.  And so, what he was referring to
is simply what that process would look like and the fact that there are
some in the Senate who have said they would halt all business if that
conversation were to happen.  
   
So, in some means, he was reporting out what is publicly known about
what the process might look like moving forward.  I’ll leave it to all
of you to whip count on how many votes there would be for filibuster
changes.   
   
Q    But — and you’re saying that there is — that he’s not engaging on
this.  He has kept — continually talked about wanting to move back to
the talking filibuster.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  And —  
   
Q    So he is weighing in on a part of the filibuster (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And — and he talked about that last night.  
   
Q    Right.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And talked about the fact that it shouldn’t be so easy to be
obstreperous — I think is a word he’s used before I’ve wanted to use in
here — and it shouldn’t be so easy to prevent legislation from moving
forward.   
   
I’ll also note that, you know, the President ran for office because he
felt that people’s fundamental rights were being violated by the last
President.  And voting rights and racial equality is central to what he
wants to do as President.   
   
So he has already taken a number of steps.  He will continue to advocate
for the For the People Act — which every Democrat voted to advance after
he worked the phones — and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   
   
He and the Vice President have launched an all-of-government effort to
protect and advance voting rights in every way we can through the
executive branch after his executive order.  And the White House
Counsel’s Office Legislative team, Public Engagement team, and the
Domestic Policy team all remain very engaged on.   
   
So he is going to use every lever at his disposal.  He’s going to
continue to elevate these issues, but he does not, alone, make changes
to the — or does not even have a official role in making changes to
procedures in the Senate.  
   
Go ahead, Anne.  
   
Q    On the Delta variant: We heard the President, last night, speak at
some length about the effects on individual Americans — what the
consequences are from this new, highly transmissible variant if you’re
not vaccinated.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    I wonder to what extent is he worried, are you worried about the
effects — one step beyond that — on his agenda and the things that he
wants to do this fall if we do end up where the trajectory currently is
with basically two camps.  You have safe, vaccinated Americans, and you
have unsafe, unvaccinated Americans.   
   
He has said before he wants to be President for everyone and have an
agenda to match.  How can that come true, moving into the fall, if you
have so many people in this country who are still at risk of
hospitalization and death?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  So just so — I’m just trying to understand your question. 
How will —  
   
Q    The impact on the agenda — his agenda.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In what way though?  Like his legislative agenda?  
   
Q    Well, I mean, his — yes.  His general agenda for improving the
lives of Americans —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — across a variety of spheres, as he’s talked about, movingly,
several times, including last night.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    What he wants to do —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, no, I just wanted to make sure I understood your
question.   
   
So, look, I think that he said in the beginning, and he reiterated last
night, that getting the pandemic under control, protecting Americans
from the spread of the virus has been, continues to be his number one
priority.  And that he’s going to govern for all Americans — Democrats,
independents, Republicans, even people who did not vote for him.   
   
So, one of the reasons that he does — did an event like the town hall
last night, and one of the reasons why he speaks about what the dire
impacts are of the spread of the most transmissible version of the virus
we’ve seen to date is because he wants people to be protected.   
   
We’ve seen, in a lot of these states, there has been a — you know,
misinformation traveling.  There has been a, in some cases, a political
bent of who is and isn’t getting vaccinated, unfortunately.   
   
We don’t want this to be a partisan issue.  So, he’s going to keep at
it.  I’m not sure on his legislative agenda how that — I don’t know how
to make that connection, but it will continue to be his priority moving
forward.  There’s no question.  
   
Q    And then, on Iraq: the Iraqi Prime Minister will be here Monday. 
In April, the administration said that the U.S. and Iraq have agreed to
eventually withdraw U.S. combat forces and that talks would take place
beginning then — toward that end.  Can you give us an update on where
those talks stand, and whether the President will be able to announce
either a date certain or more specific plans about the withdrawal of
U.S. combat forces on Monday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure, well, I’m not going to get too far ahead of the
meeting, which won’t surprise you.  But I will tell you that — I will
remind you, I should say — as Prime Minister Kadhimi stated publicly
last week — even with the decreasing need for U.S. forces with a combat
role on Iraq, his government is requesting continuing support from the
United States and the coalition for training and enabling its forces,
logistics, intelligence sharing, and other areas of security
cooperation.  
   
We’ve responded to that request and the discussions between our
delegations have been extremely constructive and are ongoing.  U.S.
military forces are in Iraq, at Iraq’s invitation, to support Iraqi
forces in their fight against ISIS.  We routinely discuss the activities
of U.S. forces in Iraq and evolution of the mission, from the height of
the ISIS campaign to today, where ISIS remains a threat but major combat
operations have ended and Iraqi capacity has increased significantly.   
   
So, this is an ongoing discussion.  We — I would note the Prime
Minister’s comments.  Our delegations will continue to discuss.  And
we’ll have more to say — I’m sure they’ll have more to say after their
meeting.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  I’d like to ask questions on Tokyo Olympic Games.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   
   
Q    First Lady Jill Biden is bound to attend the opening ceremony.  The
Opening ceremony’s creative director was fired yesterday for — over the
Holocaust joke he made in 1990s.  Does White House have any comment on
that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly, we support that decision and disagree with
his comments — offensive comments.  The First Lady will still plan to
attend the Opening Ceremony to support U.S. athletes and represent the
U.S. government at the highest level.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Karen.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Florida Governor DeSantis was talking about mask
mandates for kids earlier this morning.  And he said, “We’re not doing
that in Florida.  We need our kids to breathe.  We need our kids to be
able to be kids.”  He said “It’s terribly uncomfortable for them to do
it.”  That obviously goes against the CDC guidance —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    — for kids under 12 who aren’t vaccinated and what the President
said last night.  Is that putting kids in Florida at risk?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as a parent myself — and I know you are one — if I
were a parent in Florida, that would be greatly concerning to me because
kids under the age of 12 are not vaccinated; they’re not eligible yet. 
As the President said last night, obviously it’s going to be led by the
FDA, but certainly we hope that will be soon.   
   
But that puts kids at risk.  It’s not aligned with public health
guidelines.  We know masks are not the most comfortable thing.  I will
say, my kids are quite adjusted to them, as I know many kids are.  So,
certainly, we would have concern about any step that doesn’t abide by
public health guidelines and we think it puts people at greater risk.   
   
Q    Is the President frustrated that in the fall when kids go back to
school across the country that there could be very different standards
for kids under 12?  And is there something that he can do about that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President can speak out, as he did last night,
about the risks of the Delta variant that is more transmissible than any
variant we’ve seen to date, about the risk to young people of the spread
of COVID, and about the fact that the CDC has put out clear guidelines,
clear mitigation steps that can be taken to keep families safe, kids
sape — safe, individuals safe, and then there are a range of steps that
people can take.   
  
I think what’s notable about the CDC education guidelines is that it
made very clear it’s important for kids to be back in school, and that
that’s important for their mental health.  It’s important for kids to be
learning.  We don’t want to put kids behind who — you know, and create
some sort of an additional educational gap.   
   
But there are recommendations by the public health experts for a reason;
he’ll continue to elevate them.  But ultimately, those decisions will be
made by local school districts.  
   
Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q    Thanks so much.  Can you confirm that White House officials are
involved in these discussions about whether or not they need to update
the mask guidance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, the CDC Director made clear that was not a
decision made.  We are regularly in touch and have regular meetings with
our public health officials, including the CDC, about how to continue to
address the virus.  That shouldn’t surprise anyone.  On — those
conversations cover a range of topics.   
   
But I think the most important thing for the public is that there hasn’t
been a decision made.  It will always be led with public health
guidance.  And they’ve made that very clear this morning.  
   
Q    It’s just unusual that no one will confirm the discussions are
actually happening.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think because the report on it was a little
breathless about what it implied was happening when the CDC Director
said that’s not a decision that’s been made.  And we want to be clear to
the public: Nobody is being advised — who’s vaccinated — to wear a
mask.  That is not what the public health guidelines says.  
   
Q    Is the White House concerned about the messaging aspect of this,
given not having to wear a mask is often a perk of being vaccinated that
the White House and other top health officials have touted?  So, are you
concerned that if there is a change to the mask guidance for vaccinated
individuals when they’re indoors that it would be harder to sell
vaccinations, essentially?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there hasn’t been a change.  And it’s pretty clear now
that if you’re vaccinated, you don’t wear — need to wear a mask.  If
you’re not vacckinate \[sic\] — vaccinated — that’s a hard word — you do
— you should wear a mask, according to the public health guidelines. 
That’s not a prediction that the CDC Director made this morning.   
   
We certainly know that it is important — even as parents, as Karen was
asking about before — when you have kids, you’re not wearing a mask. 
I’m not wearing a mask at the playground, or I’m not wearing a mask, you
know, indoors; my kids are still wearing masks.  That’s not terribly
confusing to people.   
   
So, you know, we’ll continue to communicate, convey what the accurate
public health guidelines is.  Nothing has changed about that.  And, of
course, we have ongoing discussions about how to keep the American
people safe.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just related to that, is the White House position still the same on
vaccine verification?  Have there been any conversations about promoting
businesses choosing to verify vaccinated status for attending concerts
or dining indoors?  Is there — is there any discussion around vaccine
verification, or changing the posture?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is not — our position has not changed, nor do I
anticipate it would, on guidance coming from the federal government.  It
is also entirely appropriate for private-sector entities and
universities and hospitals to make decisions about how to keep their
community safe.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    If we can go back to the President’s comment about ending the
filibuster, how it would create chaos — what did that mean exactly? 
What kind of chaos would be created?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, as I answered — I think it was Jen’s
question, over here, in response to her question — what the President
was speaking to is the fact that it’s a parliamentary process.  It’s not
something you <s>wage</s> \[wave\] a magic wand to change.  It will
require the majority of votes in the Senate.  There would be debate
about that process in the Senate.  And there are manys — many
individuals in the Senate who have been clear that they would throw the
Senate into chaos and halt all progress.  So, I think he was reporting
out on what you all have publicly reported on yourself.  
   
Q    And then, in regards to Senator Carper, since there’s no room to
lose a Democrat in this, what is the White House doing to get him back
on board?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t know that he’s characterized himself as “not on
board” with the infrastructure bill that is incredibly popular and
supported by the majority of people across the country, but we also
understand and recognize that, in the process of legislating, there are
periods where people want to have their voice heard — we support that;
have asks they want to make; have components they want to see in
legislation.   
   
That’s the part of the messy process of legislating.  That’s what’s
ongoing.  We’re engaged with a range of members, including, of course,
Senator Carper and, of course, working closely with Senate leadership as
well.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Just following up on Anne’s question on Iraq. 
There has been criticism on the part of the administration that there is
a lack of clarity on what the U.S. wants to achieve in Iraq.  So, can
you explain, beyond defeating ISIS or controlling ISIS, what is it
exactly that the President wants to do in Iraq, and perhaps a
timeline?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I’m not sure I can say much more than what I
said to — which it was an extensive answer, I will say — to Anne’s
question, which was that we are in Iraq at the invitation of Iraqi
leadership, obviously.  And they have asked our military to remain — to
continue to play a role in — their government is requesting continuing
support from us and the coalition for training and enabling their forces
— its forces, logistics, intelligence sharing, and other areas of
security cooperation.  That’s something the Prime Minister spoke to last
week.  
   
I also noted that we are in ongoing discussions with them.  The Prime
Minister is going to be here next week, but I don’t think I have much
more to preview for you.  
   
Q    Can you clarify what is the President’s latest position on his
proposal to partition Iraq, or soft partition Iraq, that he has
supported in the past?  Can you give us clarification on what’s his
latest position on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think he’s made that proposal in any recent time,
but he’s looking forward to the meeting with the Prime Minister.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Quick question on Guantanamo Bay.  I heard you say, last week —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q    — that the goal is to close the detentions facility there.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    I guess 39 detainees remain.  What are the next steps that the
administration is taking to close Guantanamo Bay?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would point you to the Department of Defense
and their leadership on this effort.  I — there are 39 detainees who
remain at Guantanamo Bay; 10 are eligible for transfer, of course; 17
are eligible for a Periodic Review Board; 10 are involved in the
military commissions process; 2 detainees have been convicted.  So, I
would point you to the Department of Defense, and they can outline more
specifically.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  All right.  I got to go because we got to go see the
President.  
   
All right.  Thanks, everybody.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) breaking news (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re not going anywhere.  We’re here, Brian.
