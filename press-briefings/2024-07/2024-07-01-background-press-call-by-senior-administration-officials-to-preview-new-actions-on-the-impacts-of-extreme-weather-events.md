title: "Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials to Preview New Actions\
  \ on the Impacts of Extreme Weather\_Events"
---
 
Via Teleconference

5:03 P.M. EDT  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  All right.  Thank you all for joining us.  My name is
Jeremy Edwards, and I am with the White House Press Office.   
   
Today we’ll be discussing new actions the Biden-Harris administration is
taking to deal with the impacts of extreme weather events and an
operational briefing tomorrow on extreme weather that the president will
receive.  
   
As a reminder, this call will be on background and attributable to
“senior administration officials.”  But for your situational awareness,
I want to let you know who you’ll be hearing from today, and this is the
order in which they will speak.  So, first up, we’ll have \[senior
administration official\], \[senior administration official\], \[senior
administration official\], and \[senior administration official\] is
going to close us out.  
   
When \[senior administration official\] is done speaking, we’ll go into
a Q&A that will also be on background also attributable to senior
administration officials.  You can use the “raise hand” function during
that portion of the call.  
And we’ll try to get through as many questions as we are able to.  
   
And with that, I am going to turn it over to \[senior administration
official\].  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you very much, Jeremy. 
Confirming that you can hear me.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Loud and clear.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  Great.  
   
Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today.  Across
the country, tens of millions of Americans are experiencing the effects
of extreme weather events.  You all are well aware of the
record-breaking heat we had last month across the country.  The Fourth
of July holiday week is expected to feature dangerously hot conditions
again for multiple regions across the country, and above-normal
temperatures are also expected for much of the country later in July,
especially the central and eastern United States.  
   
We have seen devastating fires in New Mexico, Oregon, and California;
historic flooding in Iowa and Minnesota; and we are all tracking
Hurricane Beryl, a major hurricane that formed exceedingly quickly and
early in the Atlantic.   
   
In addition to posing direct threats to lives and livelihoods, major
weather events have significant economic impacts.  Last year’s record 28
individual billion-dollar extreme weather caused — and climate disasters
caused more than $90 billion in aggregate damage.   
   
Climate change is fueling more frequent and more severe weather events. 
And as these impacts intensify, President Biden is delivering on the
most ambitious climate agenda in American history — an agenda that is
not only strengthening climate resilience and lowering energy costs for
hardworking families but is also protecting our communities and workers
from its impacts.  
   
Tomorrow, the President will receive an operational briefing at the D.C.
Homeland Security Emergency Management Agency Emergency Operations
Center, from the National Weather Service and officials from the
Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and the Department of Labor.  

Our local partners are on the front lines of dealing with these climate
events, and we — our work in support of them to both help anticipate and
manage them.   
   
The president is going to hear from Ken Graham, the director of the
National Weather Service, who will provide an extreme weather forecast
for the summer and outlook on the 2024 hurricane seasons and wildfire
season.  Director Graham is also going to highlight the National Weather
Service’s new heat risk tool that is helping communities forecast
extreme heat and its impacts.  
   
The president will hear from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell about preparations that
are underway to rapidly respond and support our state, local, Tribal,
and territorial governments when they are dealing with catastrophic
impacts that often exceed their own ability to respond.  This includes
response personnel and direct federal assistance.   
   
I will say that, because of COVID, we’ve strengthened how we support
communities.  We have federal personnel — in particular, FEMA — response
experts who are embedded in our emergency operation centers around the
country.  This means that FEMA and the team here are in constant
communication with our state, local, Tribal, and territorial officials
to understand what assistance is needed as an extreme weather event is
unfolding.  
   
The president will also announce new actions we are taking, which you
will hear about shortly from OSHA and FEMA.  
   
Just a bit about the federal response.  This past month, we’ve already
responded to dozens of major disasters this year.  In fact, we’re
tracking 10 more open major disaster declarations compared to last. 
These include the devastating wildfires in New Mexico, where 8,000
people in the town of Ruidoso were told to drop everything and evacuate
because the fire spread so fast.   
   
We’ve seen historic flooding in Iowa and Minnesota.  Southern Minnesota
received two months’ worth of rain in nine days, causing entire
communities to become submerged and the partial failure of the Rapidan
Dam.   
   
We are tracking Hurricane Beryl closely as it continues to march across
the Atlantic.  Although it is not projected to significantly impact U.S.
interests — mainly, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands — the storm
rapidly escalated from a tropical storm level to a major Category 4 in
only 48 hours.  And it’s the first time we’ve ever seen a Category 4
hurricane in the Caribbean in June.  And we are prepared to stand by and
support the impacted countries in the region, to include Jamaica and
potentially Belize and Mexico.  
   
Since day one, this administration has been committed to protecting
communities across the country.  It does not matter whether they are a
blue state or a red state or a blue state — or a blue county or red
county.  And we will continue to work with our state, local, and Tribal
and territorial governments to keep people safe from the impacts of
extreme weather.  
   
The president and his administration, because of investments in
forecasting and in technology, are continuing to help communities
prepare for extreme weather disasters before they happen and will, as I
said, continue to support communities during and after they strike.  The
historic funding and investments are helping to bolster resilience and
mitigate the impacts of extreme — of the extreme weather.  
   
His $50 billion in climate-related investments represent his commitment
to addressing what he has called the existential crisis of our
lifetime.   
   
Now I am pleased to be able to turn it over to \[senior administration
official\], who is going to talk about one of the announcements. 
\[Senior administration official\], good afternoon and over to you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you so much, \[senior
administration official\].  Today, I am here to let you know that
tomorrow, we will be sending to the Federal Register our proposed rule:
heat injury and illness prevention in indoor and outdoor work settings. 
And we’ll also be making that proposal available to the public on our
website.  
   
The purpose of this rule is simple.  It is to significantly reduce the
number of worker-related deaths, injuries, and illnesses suffered by
workers who are exposed to se- — excessive heat and exposed to these
risks while simply doing their jobs.  This proposal will cover an
estimated 35 million workers.  
   
I’ll explain who it covers by first explaining who it doesn’t cover.  It
doesn’t cover workers who are working indoors in air-conditioning
consistently below a heat index of 80 degrees.  It doesn’t cover
short-duration exposures, like people who are taking short trips
outside.  It doesn’t cover indoor sedentary workers.  So, workers with
lower risk.  It also doesn’t cover certain workers where coverage would
be infeasible, like emergency responders.  And then, finally, it doesn’t
cover teleworkers.  
   
The rule instead focuses on workers who are both working in heat and are
engaged in activities that could lead to increased tor- — core body
temperatures due to their work assignments and requirements.  In this
aspect — it’s this aspect of their work, whether they are making
deliveries, carrying mail all day, working construction, picking
vegetables, repairing powerlines, doing landscaping, it’s — these are
the — these things that put workers at risk, and these are the
populations that the rule is targeting for protection.  
   
For employers of indoor and outdoor workers who are engaged in physical
activity and can expect to be exposed to a 80-degree or more heat index,
they are within the scope of the rule.  
   
Let me explain just the nuts and bolts of the rule.  These are the
requirements for employers that fall within the scope of the rule, so
they are the ones who have workers who they can expect to be exposed to
that 80-degree heat index.  
   
First, they have to establish a heat injury and illness prevention
plan.  So, they have to make an assessment of the workplace, they have
to establish policies to comply with our rule, they have to establish a
heat safety coordinator at the workplace, they have to have certain
procedures for responding both to symptoms of heat illness as well as
heat illness emergencies, and then they have to evaluate their plan at
least annually or when there’s — certain events occur that indicate
there’s a need for refresher training or a need to change the plan.  
   
The next thing that they have to do is monitoring.  And so, monitoring
involves checking the heat exposure to workers to determine if there are
elevated risks.  So, for outdoor workplaces, they would use a measure of
heat index, they could use a forecast of heat index, or they could use a
more complex form of measurement called wet-bulb globe temperature.  But
the triggering — the triggering temperature or the triggering heat index
is 80 degrees.   
   
For indoor settings, they evaluate high-heat work areas and have to make
determinations about how they do monitoring indoors to make sure that
they are adequately measuring the heat in the places where workers are
likely to be exposed.  So, they have to have a monitoring plan.  And,
again, they are either measuring the heat index, or they are using
wet-bulb globe temperature.  Of course, forecasting is limited — doesn’t
really have much use indoors.  They also have to have employee input on
that monitoring and how that monitoring system will be put into place.  
   
And then, finally, all of these employers have to have training and re-
— meet certain training and recordkeeping requirements.  
   
So, I talked about the initial heat trigger of 80 degrees.  There is
also a high-heat trigger: a heat index of 90 degrees or — or a wet-bulb
globe temperature that is equal to the NIOSH RECA exposure limit, or
REL, which is a more complex way of measuring the impact of heat on
workers.  We expect most employers will use the heat index, but we are
making this more scientifically precise method available to workers as
an option under the proposed rule.  
   
Under the initial heat trigger, again, that’s 80 degrees — a 80-degree
heat index or the wet-bulb globe temperature equal to the NIOSH
recommended alert limit, or the RAL.  
   
So, if an employer — if an employer’s workers are exposed at that
initial trigger of an 80-degree heat index, there’s a set of commonsense
requirements.  They’re well established, and they’re based, in part, on
rules that have successfully been implemented in some other states that
have done their own rulemaking.   
   
These are — you know, there are five basic elements.  One is access to
drinking water.   
   
The second is to create a break area so workers can cool down.  So,
outdoors, that would be in shade or an indoor air-conditioning space. 
And for indoor workers, that would be a cooler area using controls such
as air-conditioning or fans, ventilation, or dehumidification.   
   
The third element is worker access to those rest breaks when needed.   
   
The fourth element is an acclimatization plan.  So, this is — this is
focused on new employees or those returning to work whose bodies are not
adjusted to the heat.  And so, acclimatization can be addressed either
through a gradual increased load or by giving them 15-minute rest breaks
every two hours with monitoring for symptoms to make sure that they are
adjusting appropriately.  
   
Notably, acclimatization is the leading killer  
among the different factors related to heat illness.  So, three out of
four workers who die on the job due to heat-related — heat illness die
on that first week in — on the job.   
   
And then, finally, that fifth element at the initial trigger, they have
to have regular — the employer has to have regular and effective
communication with employees to ensure compliance with the requirements
of the rule.  
   
At the high-heat trigger — this is the 90-degree heat index — there are
four additional elements that have to be in place under the proposal. 
One is mandatory rest breaks for all employees — 15 minutes every two
hours.  These need to be paid unless it coincides with a break time that
is not required to be paid, like an unpaid meal break.   
   
Second, there have to be observation of employees by managers for
symptoms.   
   
Third, there have to be — there has to be check-in with isolated
workers, so workers who are working alone.  And that has to happen every
two hours via two-way communication.   
   
And then, fourth, there has to be a hazard alert that is triggered at
the initial trigger that reminds workers about drinking water, taking
the rest breaks, and then on emergency response procedures.  
   
Again, these are commonsense, time-tested methods of protecting
workers.  We believe that these will be achievable for employle- —
employers and protective of workers and that they will save a
significant number of lives and prevent a significant number of worker
injuries and illnesses each year from heat.  
   
Thank you.  And I will — I will pass it over to \[senior administration
official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you so much.   
   
Good afternoon, everyone.  \[Senior administration official\] here at
FEMA.  I lead resilience at FEMA.  And tomorrow, we are excited to
announce the selection of $1 billion in funding made available for the
fiscal year 2023 Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities
program. 

FEMA is also announcing the selection of 93 communities and Tribal
nations that will be receiving nonfinancial direct technical assistance
through the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. 
We also received the largest number of subapplications this year since
the launch of the program, including the most numbers of requests for
BRIC Direct Technical Assistance.   
   
For those of you less familiar with the program, the BRIC grant program
provides proactive investment and resilience for communities so that
they are better prepared and remain resilient prior to a natural
disaster.  BRIC also provides funds annually for hazard mitigation
planning and projects to reduce the risk of damage before a disaster.  
   
We also offer communities the — support with nonfinancial direct
technical assistance — the BRIC DTA that I mentioned before. 

Through this type of technical assistance, communities get access to
subject matter experts that they may not have on staff; they have
support for building collaborative partnerships that really help them
design and develop better projects that we’re seeing getting funded not
just through FEMA but other programs as well.  And so, a whole range of
support through the Direct Technical Assistance program.  
   
This year, we are thrilled to announce that we have 656 projects being
selected for the $1 billion in climate resilience funding as part of the
Invest in America agenda.  And what’s really exciting is that we’re
seeing these selections from across the nation.   
   
But as the — we — we’ve seen that this year, we have 80 percent of our
subapplications being selected for — from subapplicants that have
applied to the program for the first time.  And so, a whole range of —
of new types of communities accessing — potentially accessing these
dollars.  
   
Many of these programs and projects that are being recommended for
selection have many nature-based solutions in them.  Seventy percent of
the dollars are for disadvantaged communities.  And so, we see both
geographic diversity, underserved communities being selected for
projects, and a whole range of types of hazards being addressed through
the selections in the BRIC program.  
   
These selections will really help states, Tribes, local governments,
territorial governments address current and future risks from natural
disasters, including extreme heat, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes,
earthquakes, and increased flooding.  This also helps communities tackle
both their current and their future risk to additional things as —
additional challenges that they’re facing as well.  
   
And so, with the — with these selections, I wanted to highlight that the
selections also further underscore the Biden-Harris administration’s
commitment to equity and environmental justice.  These awards will
assist the most disadvantaged communities in building resilience both to
climate change and extreme weather events.   
   
This is a Justice40-covered program.  And so, at minimum, the overall
benefits are intended to flow to — 40 percent of the benefits are
intended to flow to disadvantaged communities.  But what we have found
in these — this year’s selections is that not only have we exceeded our
Justice40 goals, we will be delivering 67 percent of total funding in —
in our FY23 BRIC grant cycle to Justice40 communities.  
   
We are also implementing the Community Disaster Resilience Zone
legislation that President Biden signed into law that calls on FEMA to
make sure that we are creating a program to really direct funding and
support to the most high-risk, in-need communities.  And this grant
cycle, 127 million of the total federal cost share will be benefiting
communities with census tracts that have been designated as Community
Disaster Resilience Zones, and they will be receiving a 90 percent
federal cost share, as articulated in the law.  
   
We also have been very much — we have ver- — we have been focused on
outreach to many different types of communities, including urban and
rural disadvantaged communities.  And this year, we saw 20 out of our 56
competitive projects are in economically disadvantaged rural
communities.   
   
We also live in a nation where only one in three jurisdictions have
adopted the latest building codes, and building codes save lives.  And
so, this year, we had piloted for the first time a set-aside for
building code adoption and enforcement.  This was part of FEMA’s
approach to implementing the National Initiative to Adopt — to Advance
Building Codes.  And so, this dedicated funding was the — it was the
first time that FEMA was providing this dedicated funding for building
codes.  
   
We’ve selected 129 subapplications totaling $55.7 million in support of
this priority.  And these funds are going to be helping recipients adopt
and enforce hazard-resistant building codes.  This is a huge increase
from prior years, where even in the la- — from 2020 to 2022, we only saw
49 subapplications focused on building code activities.  This year, it’s
137 building code subapplications.  That’s 180 percent increase in
communities asking for support with adoption and enforcement of gil- —
building codes.  
   
I’d mentioned the focus on nature-based solutions.  And for those of you
who may not be as familiar, nature-based solutions are sustainable
planning, design — and design approaches to really ensuring projects
support adaptation and resilience.   
   
Eighty-four percent of our projects in economically disadvantaged rural
communities have some form of nature-based solutions included in them. 
And overall, 57 percent of the national competition has projects with
nature-based solutions.  They’re — so, very exciting to see very
well-rounded disaster resilience projects being selected.   
   
In closing, the BRIC Direct Technical Assistance part of our program
that I’d mentioned also saw a historic increase.  Four years ago, when
this program, BRIC, first got started, there was only eight communities
selected for BRIC Direct Technical Assistance.  Th– this administration
has had a commitment to doubling it each year.   
   
And this year, we are thrilled to announce that 93 communities and
Tribal Nations have been par- — selected to participate in this 36-month
opportunity.  That’s — more than doubles the goal of our 2022 BRIC DTA
selections, which was 40.   
   
And so, very exciting to see this program really meet communities where
they’re at and provide a range of support — from engineers to planners
to project scoping — to really ensure that resilience needs are getting
met at the ground level.  
   
So, happy to answer any questions during Q&A.  But the — the top-line
message here is that it’s been a thrilling and exciting year to see how
many more communities and range of needs are being addressed through the
BRIC program, both through our — our grant side as well as the direct
technical assistance, across the nation.   
   
Thank you.  And over to \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\], and grateful to my colleagues’ just incredible effort across
the government to make sure we are standing with communities and workers
as they face down the impacts of a changing climate.  
   
One of the things I think you’ve heard from everybody is that this has
been a priority and area of focus for the president from day one.  Not
only are we seeing the impacts of climate change in our communities all
across America, thanks to Joe Biden’s leadership, we are seeing the
solutions take root across the country as well.   
   
You think about the drought that’s been plaguing the West — this year,
as we went into the summer, we saw elevation at Lake Mead 1,075 feet. 
That is visibly different than what you saw in years past.  That is
because of the conservation activities and the historic leadership that
the president has exercised in bringing the states together around water
conservation, taking on that impact of climate change.  
   
Around the country, utilities are stepping up in a big way to make sure
that climate change does not disrupt power systems.  You’ve got folks in
Colorado, thanks to President Biden’s infrastructure law, that are
putting in thousands of fire-resistant coatings on wood poles so that
they don’t burn down the next time a fire sweeps through.  In Louisiana,
thanks to the president’s infrastructure law, hundreds of structures are
being upgraded.   
   
And together, just that one grant will avoid 564 million customer
minutes of power interruption.  That’s lives saved, livelihoods saved,
improved public health outcomes.  
   
When you think about the scrouge of wildfire — and \[senior
administration official\] has talked about some of what we’re already
seeing in this season intensified, exacerbated by a changing climate —
think about this: Thanks to the president’s leadership — Joe Biden’s
leadership — the Forest Service, in 2023, was able to improve the forest
management, clear out hazardous fuels in over 4 million acres of
forestlands across the United States.  That means when the fire comes,
as we know it will, it will have less fuel, and less damage and
destruction will follow.  
   
You think about what our Housing and Urban Development Agency is doing:
helping renters be able to access support as they cool in these summer
months.  And just a couple of weeks ago, our secretary was in Chicago
announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in resources to put in things
like heat-resistant roofs and energy efficiency measures, resiliency
measures that help people stay safe in the face of a changing climate.  
   
In our transportation system, a massive investment, a generational one,
to modernize our infrastructure — and not just to move it to lower
emissions but also to adapt to the new reality in which we live.  One
city receiving $24 million thanks to the president’s infrastructure law
to help replace roadways in a way that combats the urban heat island
effect by putting in pavement that actually helps cool.   
   
And, you know, one of the things that’s so obvious — and \[senior
administration official\] talked about the emphasis on Justice40, the
emphasis on meeting not just all communities but, in particular, the
most vulnerable ones — that’s so important.  We know that because of
historic pla- — practices like redlining, there’s more pavement and
fewer trees in communities that were historically redlined — the legacy
of racist policies.  
   
So, that’s why we are taking action — bold action, historic action, and
action that’s delivering real, meaningful, visible difference on the
ground.  And we do that even as there are folks in Washington who deny
the very fact that climate change exists; as folks in Congress mark up
appropriations bills designed to gut our agencies’ capacity and
capability to measure what is going on, to inform the public and
decision-makers of what we need to do to take on this risk, to invent
and manufacture the solutions here in the United States of America to
combat this crisis.  
   
The president, under his watch, has made sure we do not waver in taking
on this crisis.  And that’s why he’s been able to create over 300,000
jobs, building clean energy across America.  That’s why he’s been able
to double our pace of decarbonization.  And that’s why in every vector
of risk in which climate change shows up in our communities, he has
helped us step up in a big way to build resilience, build adaptation,
and protect communities and workers.  
   
Today’s announcements show him leading yet again in — in historic
fashion.   
   
Back to you.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you for that, \[senior administration official\]. 
And thank you to all of our speakers.   
   
We’re going to try to jump into the Q&A now.  Get through as many as we
can for the next about 10 minutes.   
   
As a reminder, this will be on background, attribution to “senior
administration officials.”  The contents of this call, as a reminder,
and the associated factsheet you should have got just before are on
embargo until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.  
   
With that, we’re going to jump into the queue and go to Ariel Wittenberg
from E&E News.  Ariel, you should be able to unmute now.  
   
Q    Hey there.  Thanks for hosting the call.  I have two questions for
\[senior administration official\] on the worker protection rule for
heat. 

The first was: I’m curious about restaurant workers.  It wasn’t clear to
me from your description of if they would be, like, covered or if
employers of restaurants would — would cover that. 

And also, I just wanted to ask: I know you guys just sent this rule to
OMB for review like — I think it was three weeks ago.  That seems like a
rather fast review.  And I’m just curious — I assume that might show the
administration’s priorities here but was hoping you could address
that.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Certainly.  As to your first question,
it would depend on the worksite.  But in general, it would seem likely
that, under this proposal, restaurant workers in the — in the back of a
restaurant would be covered and service would also be — you know, around
people who were cooking, working with dishwashers that were hot, they
would be covered.  Restaurant workers who are servers would — it would
depend on whether the temperature was consistently kept below an
80-degree heat index through air-conditioning.  
   
As to your second question, we put an incredible amount of work into
this rule on the front end, getting a lot of stakeholder input, put a
lot of resources into it and really worked hard to craft a rule that
would move quickly through — through the process.  I think that the —
the fact that we’re here today is a good reflection of the importance of
the rule to the administration and the priority that it — that it has.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\].  
   
Our next question is going to come from Ella Nilsen from CNN.  Ella, you
should be able to unmute now.  
   
Q    Hi, everyone.  Thanks so much for holding this call.  I was curious
if whoever is on from FEMA could provide an update on the major
disasters fund and just how it is holding up with all of the
billion-dollar disasters that have happened so far in the year, if there
is any concern it will slip into the red before, you know, the end of
the summer, if there’s any updates on that.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Senior administration official\], do
you want to take that?  I’m also prepared to address that.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can speak to it high level.  And
then, \[senior administration official\], feel free to jump in.  
   
So, what you’re referring to is our Disaster Relief Fund.  And last
year, we were in Immediate Needs Funding.  And, again — so, as we head
into the summer months with the forecast that we have, the
administration, I think, is supportive of additional dollars to the
Disaster Relief Fund to help meet all the immediate lifesaving needs.   
   
But, \[senior administration official\], feel free to add here.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That’s — that’s spot on.  And, in fact,
in the updated supplemental request that we sent to the Hill last week,
we are requesting $9 billion for FEMA to further replenish the Disaster
Relief Fund to support just what we’ve talked about today but our
communities across America that face severe flooding, wildfires,
tornadoes, and other hazards.  
   
The answer to your question about whether it will be in the red: It just
all depends on the scope, scale, and number of disasters that we have. 
But it is just — it’s imp- — it’s why it’s imperative that we get that
replenishment as part of the supplemental package.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you both. 

Our next question will come from Astrid Galván from Axios.  Astrid, you
should be able to unmute now.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you.  Was just wondering, going back to the
heat-protecting workers rules, is — I know that you all worked with some
of the trading — trade industry groups who have pushed back against some
of these proposals.  Can you talk about some of — what pushback you saw
and that you’re expecting, especially legally — you know, any lawsuits? 
But also, what are some of the most important provisions in this new
rule that are going to have the most impact for workers?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.   
   
So, there’s certainly associations who have expressed opposition or
misgivings about the rule.  However, I’d say over the last 10 years,
there’s been a growing recognition of the importance of doing something
to protect workers.  As an example, we had a national adviser committee
of construction representatives to advise us on health and safety.  And
it’s comprised of management, labor, and public stakeholders.  And that
group voted unanimously that we proceed expeditiously with rulemaking.  
   
And so, while we — while we may not agree on the contents of the
proposal, there are a fair number of employer groups out there that
recognize the importance of a level playing field when it comes to a
heat rule.  
   
With respect to your — with respect to the most important provisions, I
would say the basics of rest, water, shade, and acclimatization and then
making sure that the employer has taken a proactive approach in planning
around those.  But those are four basic elements that we’re looking to —
that are most critical.   
   
But it does require a workplace-specific assessment because there are
going to be different hazards in a — in a foundry than there are on a
farm.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you, sir. 

We have time for a couple more questions, so we’re going to go to Kellie
Meyer from Nexstar.  Kellie, you should be able to unmute.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  Thank you for doing this.  
   
I wanted to ask specifically about concerns about Hurricane Beryl.  It
looks like it will miss the USVI and Puerto Rico this time, but as you
said, this is incredibly early for Category 4.  And people in the USVI
and Puerto Rico are already experiencing power outages without there
even being a storm.  How is FEMA working to ensure that these
territories can withstand another — a storm this summer?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you so much for that question.   
   
So, FEMA is — works very closely with all the states and territories to
make sure that thing- — that communities are ready in advance.  And
should there be an event where the state’s capacities or the territory’s
capacities are exceeded, there’s the process to really push forward that
support.   
   
And so, we have pre-positioned supplies in Puerto Rico and in a number
of other places across the nation.  And also, that’s one of the reasons
that today is so important and this announcement with the Building
Resilient Infrastructure Communities is so important, because it’s
actually what we do in advance that is going to make the most difference
in people’s lives.  
   
And so, FEMA very much is ready for — to support response and recovery. 
But we are also the nation’s resilience agency, helping communities
invest in disaster risk reduction and resilience so that we’re able to
recover more quickly when these events happen.   
   
And to your point about — your question about Puerto Rico and the V.I.s
in particular, that’s an area that we’ve been very focused in energy
projects and microgrids and helping retrofit el- — power poles.  And so,
a lot of work has been going into these places to help them weather the
next storm.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\]. 

Our next question is going to come from Lisa Friedman at the New York
Times.  Lisa, you should be able to unmute.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Question for \[senior administration official\].  A
couple of people (inaudible) at this, but there were — there were, you
know, obviously, two very important Supreme Court decisions this week
affecting federal regulations.  Can you talk about, you know, if there
were discussions in rolling out this regulation about — you know, I
mean, is there anything that you’ve done that you think will make it
legally stronger to industry and others that are expected to — to
challenge the rule?  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Unfortunately, I believe \[senior administration
official\] had to jump off early.  But I don’t know if \[senior
administration official\] or \[senior administration official\] wants to
jump in there.  Otherwise, we can get back to you offline, Lisa.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Senior administration official\], you
want to take that?  And if not, we’ll get back offline.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I could just — I would say this is —
keep in mind, this is a proposed rule.  We feel very confident in our
statutory authority to address hazards in the workplace.  So, I don’t —
I don’t believe the most recent rules are going to have a direct
impact.  But, you know, we’ll certainly be mindful of our explanation of
our authority when we get to the final rulemaking process.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you for that. 

And our last question is going to come from Stephanie Ebbs at ABC. 
Stephanie, you’re good to go.  
   
Q    Thanks, everyone.  I just wanted to follow up also about the rule. 
Can you address how this rule would impact protections in states that
have passed state laws blocking cities or employers from implementing
these kinds of mandatory break?  And also, can you address what the
penalty will be — would be under the proposed rule for employers that
don’t fulfill their requirements?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Certainly.  So, this rule, if
finalized, would — would apply to all states under federal
jurisdiction.  So, that would include Texas and Florida.  If — if you
look at the Florida statute, it expressly notes that this — this is
within OSHA’s authority, whether — regardless of your opinion on that
law.  
   
In state plan states — so these are states that run their own OSHA
programs, are approved by us and monitored by us — they would have to
have a rule in place that was as least as effective.  So, they would
either implement ours or we would review theirs to make sure that it was
as least as protective as — as the rule that we finalize.  
   
And then on penalties, this would fall within the normal penalty
structure.  So, this would significantly increase penalties for
heat-related violations.  Right now, we have to use our general duty
clause to protect workers from — from hazards that they’re exposed to by
employer inaction, and the maximum penalty is around $16,000.  This
would provide significantly more.  And it would depend on the facts to
give you a number.  
   
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you for that, and thank you to all of the speakers. 
That does conclude our call.  I know there’s a lot of interest in these
announcements and we weren’t able to get to everybody, so please do not
hesitate to reach out to the White House Press Office or me directly,
and we will try to route those questions and answers for you as quickly
as possible.  
   
Again, as a reminder, this call is embargoed until tomorrow at 5:00
a.m., and that applies to the factsheet that we sent around as well. 
Also, as a reminder, attribution for any remarks and the Q&A portion of
the call is for a “senior administration official.”  
   
Again, reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns or just
need some help getting some more answers.  And we thank you for your
time.  Have a good one.
