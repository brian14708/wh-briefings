Via Teleconference

12:09 P.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you so much for joining us
today for this call on background to discuss the ongoing efforts and new
developments from this administration to counter narcotics, particularly
fentanyl.  
   
On the call, not for reporting purposes, we have \[senior administration
official\].   
   
This call will be on background, attributable to a senior administration
official, and it will be embargoed until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow, Wednesday,
July 31st.   
   
And we will pass the word to \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thanks so
much for joining this call today.  I wanted to — we wanted to bring
everybody together to discuss two important announcements that we are
making tomorrow.   
   
Tomorrow, the President is signing a national security memorandum that
will take our fight against illicit fentanyl to  
to the next level.  And he is also calling on Congress to pass a
legislative proposal that incorporates several ideas that have been put
forward by members of Congress but that will help us close key loopholes
and engage further in this fight against deadly fentanyl and other
synthetic opioids.   
   
As I think everybody on this call knows, President Biden and the Vice
President, Kamala Harris, have been prioritizing ongoing efforts to
counter the production and trafficking of illicit drugs and tackle the
fentanyl crisis since day one of the administration.  And so, I’m going
to start by just refreshing everybody’s recollection with some of the
things that we have already done, and then I will turn to the
announcements for tomorrow.  
   
So, just a few things.  In just the last five months, border officials
have seized over 442 million potentially lethal doses of fentanyl at the
U.S. borders.  Over the past five years, we’ve seized more fentanyl than
in the previous — over the past two years, we’ve seized more fentanyl
than in the previous five years combined.  
   
Early in his presidency, President Biden issued an executive order
targeting foreign persons engaged in the global illicit drug trade and
has since sanctioned over 300 persons and entities under this authority,
cutting them off from the U.S. financial system.   
   
The Department of Justice has, since 2021, arrested and prosecuted
dozens of high-level Mexican cartel leaders, drug traffickers, and money
launderers, including the arrests last week of one of the Sinaloa
cartel’s co-founder, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García.  And they have
placed many, many dangerous drug traffickers behind bars.  
   
In 2023 — in November ‘23, President Biden negotiated the resumption of
counternarcotics cooperation with the People’s Republic of China.  This
has spurred increased cooperation on law enforcement actions and ongoing
efforts to shut down companies that fuel illicit fentanyl and synthetic
drug trafficking and cause American deaths.  
   
President Biden has made diplomacy in this space a top priority.  He’s
engaged with leaders around the world to spur global action in the fight
against synthetic opioids, including by establishing a Trilateral
Fentanyl Committee with the governments of Mexico and Canada; launching
a Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats, uniting more than
150 countries in this effort; and ongoing work with G7 partners and
others.  
   
And while today’s call is mostly on the fight against the supply chain
of illicit fentanyl and precursor chemicals, it’s also important to
acknowledge the important work that the Biden-Harris administration has
done to address — to focus on treatment and saving lives through things
like making naloxone the lifesaving opioid overdose reversal medication
widely available over the counter.   
   
The Biden-Harris administration has invested over $82 billion in
treatment, which is 40 percent more than the previous administration.   
   
And these investments are saving lives.  For the first time in five
years, the number of deaths from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids
has started to decline.  But we all know that one death is too many
deaths.  And there is more to be done.   
   
And so, building on all of this ongoing work that has been done and that
continues to be done, tomorrow the Biden-Harris administration is making
two key announcements.   
   
First, it will be issuing a new national security memorandum that calls
on federal departments and agencies to do even more than they have
already been doing to stop the supply of illicit fentanyl and other
synthetic opioids into our country.  It will lead to increased
intelligence collection, increased coordination and cooperation, and
increased disruption efforts.  And also importantly, will help spearhead
some key work with the private sector, recognizing the important
private-public partnerships that are so important for tackling this
fight effectively.  
   
And separately, the President is going to be pushing a series of
legislative proposals that we are calling the “Detect and Defeat” set of
proposals that incorporates a lot of the good work that Congress has
already done.  And we are going to work with Congress and continue to
encourage that Congress passes key legislation to close some of the key
loopholes that drug traffickers exploit.   
   
So just a few of the initiatives that are included in this proposal
are:  
   
First, it establishes a nationwide pill press and tableting registry so
that law enforcement can keep track of machines and protect against
their illicit use in producing fake fentanyl pills.  This would help
level up the way we regulate machinery akin to how we regulate and deal
with precursor chemicals.   
   
Secondly, it would impose new important penalties on drug smugglers and
traffickers.   
   
Three, it would lead to the permanent scheduling of fentanyl-related
substances as Schedule I drugs.  
   
And four, it would require importers of small packages to provide
additional information to Customs and Border Protection officials so
that we can keep track of these packages and better detect and identify
packages that are carrying illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and
related machinery.  
   
We also, of course, continue to call on Congress to pass the Bipartisan
Border Security Agreement, which provides funding for more border agents
and more drug detection machines to effectively address the fentanyl
that — and identify fentanyl before it comes into our communities.   
   
So with that, I will stop and open it up for questions.  
   
MODERATOR:  All right, if you have a question, please raise your hand.  
   
Apologies.  We had some technical difficulties.  
   
Travis, you should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks for doing this.  Could you give an update on the PRC
conversations that you’re having, and any details around how well or
poorly the collaboration on this issue has gone with them in
particular?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Appreciate the conversation. 
So, the conversations with the PRC continue.  In fact, there is a
delegation of senior officials that is coming to meet tomorrow to
continue discussions.  There continues to be  
coordination on specific law enforcement matters.  There continues to be
discussion with the PRC about the importance of scheduling, and we’ve
seen some important scheduling announcements out of the PRC.  And there
continues to be ongoing discussions with the PRC about how to more
effectively tackle illicit financing.  
   
I want to be clear: Of course, there is a lot more that needs to be
done.  We are making steps, and there is progress in our discussion, but
we are well aware of the fact that there is  
a lot more that the PRC needs to do and that we continue to urge in
every possible channel that the PRC does to effectively shut down the
companies that are supplying the precursor chemicals that are then used
to make illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids that are killing
Americans and so many others.  And fully recognize the need for
additional actions to address illicit financing of these drugs and drug
traffickers as well.   
   
So, we continue to make progress.  We continue to engage.  I think we’ve
seen some important steps that would not have been possible had
President Biden not taken steps to relaunch our counternarcotics
cooperation.   
   
But we continue to engage with a recognition of the fact that there is a
lot more that needs to be done.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.  We’ll go next to Carmen Paun.  You
should be able to unmute yourself.  Please state your outlet.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you.  This is Carmen Paun from Politico.   
   
Just on the memorandum, what exactly is this sort of, like, bringing
new?  Like, what new tools is it offering to agencies that they don’t
have yet?  Sort of, like, what’s the added value of it?  
   
And just on China, if I may.  The Select Subcommittee on China in
Congress had a report a few months ago, basically saying that, you know,
the Chinese authorities were subsidizing some fentanyl exports.  And I
was wondering if that has come up in your conversation with your Chinese
counterparts.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, so I’ll take the second part of
your question first.  
   
We’re aware of that report.  We do not have any information to support
that finding that the PRC is actually subsidizing these exports.  So I
think there’s a need for an ongoing conversation about that.   
   
In terms of what the NSM is doing, it is a — as all NSMs, it is a
direction to departments and agencies, and it’s a direction to
departments and agencies to do even more than they are already doing to
redouble their efforts to disrupt the supply chain of illicit fentanyl
and other synthetic opioids, among other things.  It directs the
prioritization of intelligence collection on this challenge, with the
understanding that there has been an extensive amount of collection. 
But as the drug traffickers adapt and as the supply chain evolves,
there’s a need to do even more to make sure that we have the best and
most up-to-date common operating picture for all agencies and
departments to work off of in strategically disrupting the supply chain
and the traffickers.   
   
And it requires departments and agencies to do even more to work
together to share information across intelligence and law enforcement
and within different law enforcement channels, and to break down any
existing information silos so that we can more effectively go after drug
traffickers and the supply chain.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.  We’ll go next to Jose Diaz Briseño. 
You should be able to unmute yourself.  Please state your outlet.  
   
Q    Yes, my name is Jose Diaz with Reforma Newspaper from Mexico.   
   
You mentioned the arrest last week of the Sinaloa cartel founder, “El
Mayo” Zambada.  And I wanted to ask what specific information you have
of whether these arrests could lead to less fentanyl flowing through the
border.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  So, obviously, we can’t
predict exactly what will happen, but we do know that as we take drug
cartel leaders off the streets and we take some of the high-value
players into our custody and put them behind bars, it disrupts the
organizations and it makes them — it makes it harder for them to
continue to operate.   
   
And so, you know, again, we will have to wait and see what exactly the
implications are in terms of the amount of fentanyl that drug
traffickers and others seek to take across our borders.  But as I said,
we continue to engage in efforts to take the cartel leaders and their
key intermediaries off the streets.  
   
And I’d just add that Mexico has been a really important partner in this
work.  Mexico, as I know you know — in May, Mexico extradited to the
United States “El Nini,” one of the most — a key notorious drug lord,
who was also involved in murder and kidnapping and other heinous
activity as well.  And so, we are deeply appreciative of the partnership
with Mexico as we continue to engage in this.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.  We’ll go to Michelle Jamrisko.  You
should be able to unmute yourself.  Please state your outlet.  
Q    Hi, yes.  Michelle Jamrisko from Bloomberg.  Thanks again for doing
this.  
   
I had a follow-up on the China line, if I could.  Just a little bit more
on — you mentioned increased cooperation.  I’m wondering how you measure
that at this point.  I know you also cited some crackdown by the Chinese
on the companies that produce, you know, the substances that contribute
to the fentanyl flows.  But do you have reliable and verified
information that those have been cracked down on and that they haven’t
popped up elsewhere in China?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, a few things.  I mean, we have, as
you noted, as part of our — you know, we have — I just want to kind of
highlight some of the things that have happened as a result of our
cooperation.   
   
So, the PRC in June arrested an individual who was charged by the
Department of Justice in an indictment that was announced in June and
was involved in a money-laundering scheme on behalf of the deadly
Sinaloa cartel.  We know that these kinds of arrests reverberate through
the PRC system and they send an important message.  
   
There is ongoing efforts to engage on other law enforcement matters as
well.  As you noted, the PRC issued a law enforcement notice to its
chemical industry, warning PRC companies against the illicit trade and
precursor chemicals and pill press equipment.  We know that the PRC took
some action against companies of concern.  We continue to monitor and to
assess whether or not these companies are reconstituting in other form,
and it is part of the ongoing discussion that we have with the PRC.   
   
I want to be really clear: These are important steps.  The other thing
that I will note is the PRC scheduling of 46 new substances and a
commitment to move forward on the scheduling of others.  
   
These are steps.  We recognize that there is a lot more to do.  And, you
know, our goal with the PRC is to continue to engage but to continue to
also take steps to independently verify as well and continue to push and
encourage additional actions.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.  We have time for two more questions. 
We’ll go next to Zolan.  Please unmute yourself and state your outlet.  
   
Q    Hi there.  Thanks so much for taking the time.  Zolan Kanno-Youngs
from the New York Times.  You mentioned that the legislation that you’re
proposing would impose new penalties on drug smugglers and traffickers. 
Can you be a bit more specific on what those penalties would be?  Are
you talking about kind of increased mandatory sentences?  And also, who
are we talking about by drug smugglers and drug traffickers?  Thanks a
lot.  
   
Sorry, did I lose you?  Hello?  
   
MODERATOR:  Sorry, could you repeat your question?  We lost you for a
minute there.   
   
Q    Sure.  I was saying that you mentioned that the legislation you’re
proposing would impose new penalties on drug smugglers and traffickers. 
I’m asking if you could be more specific on what those penalties are. 
Are they mandatory sentences?  Are they longer sentences?  And who are
we talking about when we say drug smugglers and drug traffickers?  What
specific sort of laws are we talking about there?  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Appreciate the question.  I
mean, I’m happy to discuss this more with you as well separately, but
there are a range of different proposals in the package.   
   
So, one is an amendment to the Kingpin Act.  Another, as we talked — as
I said before: By permanently scheduling fentanyl-related substances as
a Schedule I drug, that imposes additional penalties — or associated
with being a Schedule I drug — on those who distribute and/or possess
these drugs.  There’s also a proposal to make xylazine a Schedule III
drug, which similarly imposes penalties on those who unlawfully
distribute xylazine.  To be clear, that provision has exceptions to
account for its legitimate veterinarian use as well.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.  And we’ll take our last question. 
We’ll go to Abigail.  Please state your outlet.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Abigail Hauslohner, Washington Post.  
   
I was hoping you could just talk a bit more about — in your
conversations with the PRC, are you finding at this point that you have
a willing and good-faith partner on fentanyl specifically in taking
these kinds of actions?  What is the PRC asking from the U.S. in return
for taking the kind of steps that the U.S. wants to see?  
   
And as far as obstacles, you said, you know, obviously they need to do
more.  Are the bigger obstacles their own interdiction capabilities, or
is it a willingness to take the actions that the U.S. wants to see? 
Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  So, thanks for that question.   
   
Obviously, it is a complex and complicated relationship, but I will say
that we are encouraged by the continued commitment and conversations.   
   
As I said, there is going to be a delegation from the PRC, who is here
tomorrow, to continue to work through some of these issues on a range of
different fronts, including law enforcement cooperation; including
efforts to tackle illicit fentanyl; including some of our ongoing asks
with respect to scheduling in particular, encouraging and really pushing
and urging the PRC to schedule all of the substances that have been
scheduled by international bodies; and including ongoing discussions
about how we further some of the information exchanges that we have
initiated, which, again, don’t solve the problem, but they are
incredibly — they’re an incredibly important first step both for our
enforcement officials to be able to get better information about some of
the companies that are shipping drugs to the United States and also for
us to be able to share information among the things that we have
initiated as a regular scientist-to-scientist exchange as well.  And
that scientist-to-scientist exchange, among other things, looks at
emerging trends in ways that are helpful.  We had another exchange of
that group at the end of June.   
   
Again, as I’ve said, the United States, we are always looking to verify
any assertions about actions that have been taken by the PRC.  They have
claimed to shut down 14 key websites and suspended over 330 business
accounts and over 1,000 online shops that are engaged in the sale and
distribution of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals of concern.   
   
But as there continues to be a significant supply of precursor chemicals
out of the PRC, there’s obviously a whole lot more to do.  And that’s
why these ongoing conversations and engagements are so important, even
if we’re taking small steps one at a time.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much to everyone for joining.  That’s all the
time we have today.  If you have any additional questions, please do
feel free to reach out.   
   
Again, this call was on background, attributable to a senior
administration official.  And the embargo will lift tomorrow, Wednesday,
July 31st, at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  And I will be able to send some
documents later this evening on these two announcements tomorrow.   
   
Thank you, and have a good day.  
   
    12:36 P.M. EDT
