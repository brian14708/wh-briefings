Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Boston, Massachusetts

2:01 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Hello.  Okay, a couple of things at the top. 
Okay, good afternoon.  We are on our way to Boston, as all of you guys
know, where President Biden will participate in a phonebank and a
fundraiser for the DSCC and Senator Warnock.   
   
The Prince and Princess of Wales are also in town to host the Earthshot
Prize.  The President looks forward to spending time with Prince William
at the JFK Library, where President Biden shared his vision to end
cancer as we know it.  We expect that they will discuss their shared
climate goals, prioritization of mental health issues, and decreasing
the burden of the disease.   
   
We’re rounding out a big week here at the White House.  And we’re —
we’ve had a lot of great news for the American people.  As we know, as —
as we end this week, jobs are up, incomes are up, consumer spending is
strong, and the economy is growing.  At the same time, inflation is
moderating, gas prices are down.  And this morning, President Biden
signed legislation averting a rail shutdown that would have been
devastating to our economy.   
   
None of this is by accident. It’s because of — the President has
continued to follow through on his promises to — to rebuild the economy
from the bottom up and middle out, to take actions to lower costs for
Americans, to bring manufacturing and supply chains back to the U.S.,
and to make sure our economy works for working people.   
   
While there’s still more progress to be made, the economic data we’ve
seen this week is strong and positive news for the American people.   
   
And now for a quick look at our week ahead.  On Sunday, the President
will return to Washington, D.C., from Camp David.  In the afternoon, the
President and the First Lady will host Kennedy Center honorees in the
East Room, including actor and filmmaker George Clooney;
singer/songwriter Amy Grant; singer Gladys Knight; composer, conductor,
and educator Tania León; and Irish rock band U2, compromi- — comprised
of band members Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen, Jr.  
   
In the evening, the President and the First Lady, the Vice President and
the Second Gentleman will attend the 45th Kennedy Center Honors.  This
is the second consecutive year of the Biden-Harris administration which
they have — all have attended the nation’s highest award for lifetime
achievement in the arts.  
   
On Monday, the President and the First Lady will host the Congressional
Ball on the state floor.   
   
On Tuesday, the President will travel to Phoenix, Arizona.  The
President will visit TSMC, a Taiwanese company making a major investment
to manufacture cutting-edge chips in Phoenix, and discuss how this — his
economic plan is leading to a manufacturing boom, rebuilding supply
chains, and creating good-paying jobs in Arizona and across the
country.  
   
We will have more additional information of the rest of the week and how
the President’s — the President’s engagement.  
   
With that, Zeke, you want to kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The President (inaudible) a tweet a couple of
hours ago condemning antisemitism and calling on people to — saying
silence was complicit — complicity.  Who was he talking about?  Who was
that tweet addressed to and referring to?  Because he didn’t name — name
names.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as we have seen an increase in — in hate
speech — in antisemitism, in particular, to your question — and, you
know, the President has always — stands against that.  He is standing
with the Jewish community.  
   
The President, for years, including after the hateful march in
Charlottesville that drove him to run — his father had sai- — had said —
had said silence is complicit — complicity.  And as President of the
United States, he feels that it’s important for him to be very clear.   
   
And like you’ve also heard him say, the common theme of all forms of
bigotry is that hate doesn’t go away, it only hides.  The — the
grotesque poison of anti- — antisemitism is not hiding.   
   
And just yesterday, he and President Macron recognized the hundreds of
thousands of Americans who gave their lives to overcome the horror of
Nazism and keep us free.   
   
And so he believes, as President, it is important to speak up.  But
again, we’ve all seen it — you guys have asked me this multiple times —
the increased hate speech that we have seen on — on —  
   
Q    But who in particular?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think — I don’t think it matters who in particular. 
I think what the President is trying to say is being silent is
complicit.  And when we see this type of hatred, when we see this type
of antisemitism, we need to call it out.  
   
Q    Who is being silent?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We need to be — we need to be very, very clear and —
and condemn that.  And that’s what you’re going to continue to hear from
this President.  That’s what you’re going to continue to hear from the
administration.   
   
Akayla, go ahead.  
   
Q    Yes.  So, yesterday, the President said that he was going to go
back and get paid leave not just for rail workers, but for all workers. 
I guess, if you could just give us an idea of what that looks like: Is
that new legislation?  Is that more negotiations with unions?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you guys know, the President has supported paid
sick leave for all Americans, not just the rail industry, and his fight
for the critical benefit will continue.  
   
And he’s — I mean, I’ll just point you to his words yesterday in the
press conference.  He’s also fought for and secured paid sick leave for
additional workers during his presidency.  
   
For example, his American Rescue Plan included a tax credit to help
small- and medium-sized businesses providing sick leave to their
employees.  And he’ll continue forcefully advocating for Congress and
employers to extend paid sick leave to all workers.   
   
And so that’s what’s important.  He con- — he’s going to continue to
fight to secure paid leave, again, for all Americans.   
   
And as — as you can tell from his remarks this afternoon, the
President’s focus remains, again, on getting Congress to act.  And
that’s — and that’s how he’s going to focus on this.  
   
And just — oh, sorry — and one more on layoffs that we’ve been seeing
recently.  We saw, you know, a few — a few months ago with tech
companies and now with media companies this week.  Does the White House
see this potentially as a sign of a recession?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’ve also clearly have seen these reports, and
we’re watching closely anytime there are reports of Americans losing
their jobs.  
   
President Biden knows firsthand the impact of losing a job and how that
can have on an entire family.  I don’t have a comment on specific moves
or announcements by any particular companies here.  
   
But broadly speaking, this week’s jobs opening data showed layoff
remains near record lows.  And so, that’s important to point out. 
Similarly, today’s jobs and this week’s GDP revision show the U.S.
economy continues to grow and add jobs.  
   
Again, I’m not going to speak to any actions by a company.  But again,
you know, the jobs report — you saw that today.  And we’re headed in the
right direction.  
   
Q    A follow-up from the President’s — the President’s remarks
yesterday about speaking to President Putin.  Does that willingness
reflect any kind of a shift in his thinking about Ukraine and diplomacy
about Ukraine with or without Ukraine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, no, that does not change — that thinking.  He has
been very clear.  He’s written it in op-eds.  You’ve heard him saying in
speech, “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.”  
   
Look, the President has said he has no plans to speak with Mr. Putin
since Mr. Putin has shown no signs that he’s willing to end the brutal
war against the people of Ukraine.  
   
In fact, he has done the opposite, as you all have seen for yourselves
and reported, as Russia has attempted to destroy Ukraine’s civilian
infrastructure and deprive the Ukrainian people of heat, power, and
other critical services as winter approaches, causing suffering for
millions of people.  
   
But President Biden has been clear: We will continue to provide support
to Ukraine for as long as it takes as they defend their country against
Russian aggression.  
   
I know we don’t have that much time.  
   
Q    Do you also have any updates on what you’re doing to help
potentially have exemptions on the interna- — on the Inflation Reduction
Act for France or Europe, as discussed in the state visit yesterday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re talking about the — with — during the press
conference what the President said?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — and you’re talking about the glitches, in
particular, the comment that he —  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, no, to — to your question.  No, we don’t have any
plans to go back to Congress for legislative changes to the Inflation
this time.   
   
For any historic legislation — for — for any historic legislation like
IRA, there is a complex implementation and process, which is actively
underway at federal agencies.  But we don’t have anything — we’re not
going to be addressing any glitches.  
   
Q    But he — but he indicated that they would go back and look at
making some accommodations.  Are you saying that that’s not true
anymore?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just saying that — we’re — we’re not going to be
doing that.  I just answered the question and said, “No, we’re not going
to be doing that.”   
   
And look, this is a historic piece of legislation.  As you know, the
Inflation Reduction Act is going to really help the American people when
it comes to lowering costs, healthcare costs.  And it’s also a — has a
historic investment in dealing with climate change.  
   
Q    I’m not —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And the prob- — the President has — was very clear in
that.  
   
But to your question, the answer is no.  
   
Q    Yeah, no, I wasn’t saying you weren’t answering the question.  I —
my impression from what the President said yesterday was that there
would be at least some looking at what they can do to address France’s
concerns.  Are you saying no to that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say this —  
   
Q    Because that seems contradictory.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President was clear: There are ways we can address
Europe’s concerns.  Right?   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay?  If that’s what you’re asking me.  That’s why I
was asking at the beginning what exactly was the President’s comments
you were asking about.  
   
So, this is a matter —  
   
Q    Generally about the IRA.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, got it.  This is a matter we are working out
through substantive consultations and European counterparts.  We won’t
get ahead of that process.  I think that’s what you were asking me just
now.  
   
We are committed to an IRA implementation approach that moves quickly,
that gets the tough questions right, and that has appropriate guardrails
so that the American families and workers start seeing the benefits of
lower energy costs, good-paying jobs, abundant clean energy, and
increased resilience to climate change as quickly as possible.

But to the exceptions questions, again, we’re having — we’re having
discussion and — to address Europe’s concerns. 

Q    Karine, Clyburn said today that he received a phone call from the
President last night informing him of his decision to pick South
Carolina first for the primary calendar, and that he was pleasantly
surprised.  I’m wondering if you can give us a sense of, you know, how
the President arrived at his decision, who he consulted with, any
timeline on that, and how he got to that.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, we take the law very seriously here,
and it — and it places strict limits on what I can — can say about the
future elections and political party process.

So, here’s what I can say: As a candidate in 2020 and, as we have heard,
the night — the night of the New — New Hampshire primary — you heard
directly from the President — Joe Biden, at that time, made clear that,
to him, respecting our diversity as a nation and breaking down barriers
for all our people is a foun- — is a foundational principle. 

He believes that what — that’s what Democrats in office stand for.  And
he has upheld the principle as President.  He promised his
administration would look like America, and it does.  He has staffed the
most diverse Cabinet in Whi- — in White House history, American history.

He promised to fight to ensure our judicial branch reflects America, and
he has.  He’s confirmed more Black women to appellate judgeships than
all of his predecessors combined.  And he fulfilled his promise to
confirm the first Black woman to the Supreme Court.

He works — he works to honor the values in every way that he can as a
leader.   
   
I’m not going to get into specific conversations that he may have had
with the — with the congressman.  But again, I just laid out how the —
the President thinks about this process.

Q    To follow up on the jobs report, the report showed that wages are
continuing to rise at a rapid pace.  You know, how worried is the White
House that that means inflation will stay higher for longer?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I mean, I just laid out how we’re seeing
more jobs, and more jobs mean opportunities for American workers and
more families that are able to put food on the table and pay the bills.

So, look, there are a couple of things — and you hear us tick this —
take these data points out many times.  The economy has created more
than 260,000 jobs last month.  That’s just looking at this current job
report.  We have 10.5 million jobs that have been created since the
President Biden took office — again, looking at this job — the jobs
report.

Recent inflation reports shows Americans are beginning to see
much-needed break in inflation.  So, we’re seeing a moderation in
inflation.

Seven hundred fifty thousand — you hear us talk about this —
manufacturing jobs that have been created under this President.

GDP increased.  We saw that number.  It was — it was from — we — the
original estimate was 2.6 percent.  We saw this week it was actually 2.9
percent in the last — in that third quarter.

And the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low.  So, wages are up, and we
think that’s also important — looking at this job report, looking at the
data points over the last couple of months.

Q    How do you factor that into inflation, though?  I mean, is there
more that the President should be doing to try to bring down inflation
with wage gains —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, the President —

Q    — going up?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President has been very clear, right?  He said,
when it comes to his economic plan, inflation — dealing with inflation,
fighting inflation, lowering costs for American people — is his number
one priority.  And he has done that. 

You’ve heard us talk about the gas prices and how that’s come down. 
That’s because of the President’s historic actions that he’s taken over
the past several months.

All right, thanks, everybody.

Q    Karine, has the President seen the Netflix documentary trailer for
the “Harry & Meghan” documentary?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, I have not seen them yet — seen it yet. 
(Laughs.)  I don’t know.  I have no idea.  He’s been pretty busy.

As you know, he’s been — he has been welcome — he welcomed the President
of France and the First Lady of France.  As you saw, that was a really
positive visit.  They were able to strengthen their — their friendship —
our oldest ally.  And you guys saw that for yourselves, starting from
the welcoming ceremony yesterday morning to the state dinner.

Okay, thanks, everybody.  We got to sit down.
