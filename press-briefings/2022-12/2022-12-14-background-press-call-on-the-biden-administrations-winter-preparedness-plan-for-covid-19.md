Via Teleconference

5:07 P.M. EST  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Hello, everybody.  Happy Wednesday.  Thank you for joining
us for a press call to discuss the Biden administration’s winter
preparedness plan for COVID-19.   
   
As a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials.”  It’s embargoed until the morning at 5:00
a.m.   
   
You should have just received a factsheet right before this call — right
before I started talking.   
   
But without further ado, I have \[senior administration official\] on
the call to walk through the plan, and then we’ll take some of your
questions.   
   
So, \[senior administration official\]?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much, Kevin.  Good evening,
everyone.  Thanks for being here.   
   
As Kevin said, you should have the factsheet in your inboxes, so I’m
going to keep this as brief as possible.   
   
As expected, we’re seeing COVID cases rising in parts of the country
following Thanksgiving.  And while COVID isn’t the disruptive force it
once was, we know that the virus will circulate more quickly and easily
as folks gather indoors for the winter holiday season.  
   
Throughout the Biden administration’s COVID response, our first
principle has been to be prepared for whatever the virus throws our way,
and we have delivered.  This moment is no different.  
   
To that end, today we’re announcing our Winter COVID-19 Preparedness
Plan to ensure that we stay ahead of increases in COVID-19 cases and
hospitalizations this winter.  
   
Our plan is focused on a few different things.   
   
First, making it even easier for Americans to access the tools we know
work to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, or worse — like
vaccines, tests, and treatments.  
   
Second, we’re standing ready to support states and communities with
personnel, supplies, and other resources to get more shots in arms and
meet urgent clinical needs as they arise.  
   
Third, accelerating our efforts to protect the highest-risk Americans,
in partnership with states, at nursing homes and other long-term care
facilities, starting with updated vaccinations.  
   
Now let me get more specific on a few key aspects of the plan.  
   
First, starting tomorrow, each household can visit COVIDTests.gov and
order a total of four at-home tests to be mailed directly to their
doorsteps for free.  That’s four free tests per household, regardless of
how many tests they’ve ordered previously, with tests starting to ship
next week — the week of the 19th.  
   
This adds another way Americans can access free tests this winter,
including through their health insurance plan, which covers free — eight
free tests per month per individual, as well as thousands of
community-based locations around the U.S., like community health
centers, schools, and long-term care facilities.  
   
We’re able to reopen COVIDTests.gov for a limited round because, in the
absence of congressional funding, we’ve acted within our limited
resources to buy more at-home tests for our national stockpile.   
   
Second, we’re making it clear to governors and local leaders that we’re
in this together, and we’re asking them to get ready and step up too,
now, to get more people vaccinated, including through mobile and pop-up
vaccination clinics and to expend — to expand access to testing and
treatments, including through more test-to-treat sites, in advance of
the winter.  
   
We stand ready to support them in any way that we can, including making
federal personnel available to be deployed as requested by states to
address pressing needs, and pre-positioning personal protective
equipment and other critical supplies, such as ventilators, to ship out
to states if needed.  
   
Third, we’re putting our comprehensive surveillance capabilities to work
in order to closely monitor Omicron subvariants that emerge here at home
and around the world.  From genomic sequencing to detect the evolution
of the virus, to waste water surveillance and traveler-based genomic
surveillance to monitor trends, we will stay on top of this virus and
communicate clearly about what we’re seeing and what we know.  
   
Last and certainly not least, we’re focusing on highest-risk
individuals, including those elderly living in nursing homes.   
   
We have the tools we need to prevent death and severe illness, and we
want all nursing homes to take action now.  To that end, we are
releasing a winter playbook for nursing homes and long-term care
facilities.  This is a shorthand document focused on updated
vaccinations, treatment for residents testing positive, and improving
indoor air quality.  
   
We’re also expanding the pool of staff members at nursing homes who can
administer shots, and we’re reaching out to governors where nursing home
vaccination rates are low so that we can offer our support.  
   
Let me just close with this.  We know what to do in this moment.  We
have the tools, infrastructure, and know-how we need to effectively
manage this time to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, minimize
disruptions, and respond to challenges.  Everyone just has to do their
part.  
   
For individuals, that means getting your updated COVID-19 vaccine right
away and making use of other tools, like tests, and seeking out
treatment as soon as you test positive.  
   
Making sure — I’m sorry.  We’re doing our part by making it even easier
for people who can do these things — easier for people to do these
things by helping states and communities in any way we can.  And we
stand ready for whatever comes this winter.  
   
With that, I’ll take questions.  Kevin?  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\].  First, let’s
go to Sarah Owermohle at STAT News.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you for taking my questions.  So I just wanted to ask,
first, just why this can’t be on the record rather than on background. 
I think that that transparency would help people.   
   
But then also, I’m wondering, since the administration has been saying
for a while now that you don’t have funds for the continued COVID-19
response, just where the funds came for these new tests.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  So, quickly, Sarah, on the first issue: Across every issue
area at the White House, we hold embargoed calls on background ahead of
any major announcement.  
   
\[Senior administration official\]?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much for the question.  You
know, this entire time as we have been fighting COVID, we’ve been
talking about making hard choices given limited funding.   
   
And when we — sorry — and, you know, there remains an urgent need for
additional COVID funding to help us stay prepared in the face of an
unpredictable virus.  So, at the end of the day, you know, we had to
repurpose some of our existing money to focus on this important
initiative as we are seeing cases go up.  These are always hard choices,
and we have to make trade-offs.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Fenit at The Post.   
   
Q    Hi.  I will just second what Sarah about why this can’t be on the
record.  I understand that you hold these briefings ahead of
announcements.  I don’t see why that Americans can’t read the name of
the government official explaining these — these actions and why they
have to read unnamed government officials.   
   
That aside, my question is about masks.  How do masks factor into your
winter prepared — preparedness plan, especially since we’re not just
dealing with COVID but flu and RSV, too?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, thank you for that question.  As
you’ll see in our plan, we do reference masks.  The administration has
given out hundreds of millions of masks for free, and they are widely
available.   
   
They were originally distributed to pharmacies, and we are now ensuring
that they are also being distributed to places where people who might
have greater challenges accessing free masks can get them, including
food banks, community health centers, and other locations.   
   
And I think we view masks to be just one important tool in an arsenal of
tools that is part of a multi-pronged strategy to combat COVID.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thank you.  Let’s go to Shannon Pettypiece at NBC.  
   
Q    Could you just bring us up to date on what the supply of Paxlovid
is like?  Like, what’s the latest numbers on how many doses you still
have out there?  You know, is that readily available?  Are you really
re- — pre-positioning any doses?  Just sort of what’s the state of play
with Paxlovid?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  Good question.  So we have
distributed out from our government stockpile roughly 6 million doses
out to jurisdictions.  I am confident in saying that we will have
sufficient Paxlovid supply for domestic use for the foreseeable future. 
We feel very good about our resources with regard to Paxlovid.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Madison Muller at Bloomberg.

Q    Thank you for taking my question.  I was wondering if there are any
efforts right now to address some of the losses with monoclonal
antibodies, given that people with, you know, immunocompromising
conditions are most at risk of severe COVID, and the variants have
knocked out some of those.  Are there any ongoing efforts to find new
monoclonal antibodies or help development of those?  Thanks.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Another excellent question.  Yes, so
this is obviously something that is very front of mind for us.  You
know, especially with regard to the immunocompromised who cannot take
oral antivirals like Paxlovid, we are always looking to expand our
arsenal and are looking at drugs in the pipeline.

I think that, you know, this is something that we think about all the
time in terms of ensuring that we have a wide array of tools for people
across the population, including the immunocompromised.

That said, I will just say, you know, our go-to is oral antivirals,
including Paxlovid, which we believe most of the population can take
safe- — you know, safely.  And it’s a highly safe and effective product,
extremely effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalization
and death. 

So, you know, that is really consistent with NIH clinical guidelines,
consistent with the statements coming out of FDA and CDC.  You know, we
are very much leaning into the message that people should be considering
Paxlovid as a first choice when they test positive.

MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks.  We’ll take a couple more.  Let’s go to Zeke Miller
at the Associated Press.

Q    Thanks for this.  What are the administration’s current projections
for the COVID component of this winter surge?  How many cases are
expected?  How many deaths, serious illnesses are forecasted in the
coming months?

And, you know, you mentioned that this is all — you know, that you’ve
freed up this money to buy more vaccine — to buy more at-home tests; you
have supplies of masks already on store shelves, you have vaccines.  It
seems that the administration’s problem here is that there’s a demand
problem; nobody — or, majority of Americans are not taking you up on
them.  Where is the strategy to change that?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Great question.  So, just
going to the first part of your question first, you know, we’ve been
talking for months about being prepared for a winter surge.  You know,
before Thanksgiving, we talked about the six-week push for
vaccinations.  And we are constantly looking for ways to be ready. 

You know, we’re a few years into — we’re a few years into the pandemic. 
And, you know, we are prepared for this moment.  We have the tools. 
We’ve learned from the past.  And, you know, we saw an uptick in cases
after Thanksgiving, and we believe that was expected when people gather
indoors.  You know, we expect those sorts of things.

We’re closely monitoring cases post that.  And we are standing ready and
prepared with the tools that we have assembled to face this this winter.

MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks.  Let’s go to Cheyenne Haslett at ABC News.

Q    Hi, thank you.  Can you just clarify a little further where
specifically the money was taken from to put towards these tests, and if
you’re buying more new tests or if you’re just opening back up the
supply that you had from the last go-around, and how many tests are
left? 

And I’m also wondering where things stand with the public health
emergency and when you see that winding down.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, in terms of where the funds came
from, they’re ARP funds.  And we’ve had to think very hard about how
exactly to make these trade-offs in terms of how we use these funds.  So
it’s from ARP.  
Procurements are ongoing, and so I can’t give you exact numbers on how
this is going to land.  But we feel confident that we are going to have
enough tests to get through this next round, four per household, in the
coming weeks.

And on — oh, and on PHE, the basic thing that I will say there is this
is a decision by the HHS Secretary.  The PHE remains in place.  And
everyone is committed to give 60 days’ notice before it comes down.  I
don’t really have more I can say on that.  
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, we’re going to do one more question.  Let’s go to
Courtney Rozen at Bloomberg.

Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  One — oh —  
Can you hear me, Kevin?

MR. MUNOZ:  Yes.

Q    Okay, great.  One population that I didn’t hear you mention are
communities that are deemed as socially vulnerable by the CDC.  I know
that the Increasing Access to Testing program was launched at CDC for
the purpose of reaching those groups.  And I don’t see anything on here
about you amping that up or increasing your work with state officials to
target those particular groups that might be more vulnerable to a
surge.  Can you describe what you’re doing there?   
   
And then my second question for you is: I’ve been talking to state
health officials, and I know that several states have suspended their
own procurement operations for testing, specifically at-home rapid
COVID-19 testing that you’d be providing through the USPS option.  Do
you expect that states will rely more heavily on you during this
expected or possible increase in cases, given that they might not be as
set up to get their own supplies as they were maybe a year ago?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Excellent questions, both.  So,
starting with your first question, we’re very committed to reaching all
vulnerable populations.  We talked a lot about nursing homes, long-term
care facilities.  And we view the populations in those areas to be the
most vulnerable because we — you know, what we’re seeing in the numbers,
in terms of hospitalizations and deaths, our oldest Americans are being
hit the hardest in those areas.  So it’s something that we are really
focused on.

That said, we are also, of course, deeply committed to equity and to
making sure that we can make vaccines, Paxlovid, masks, and tests
available in communities across the country.  We’re doing pop-up
clinics.  We are trying to meet people where they are to get them these
products.  We are trying to go through non-traditional channels to get
these products to our most vulnerable populations.

On your second question — on your second question — I’m sorry, can you
just remind me of the question?  Testing to states?  Is that what it
was?

Q    Sure, yeah.  I wanted to ask you about how you’re working with
states, given that so many of them have suspended their own operations
to procure their own tests.  Do you expect that states are going to rely
more heavily on you, as the federal government, to provide tests should
we see a stark increase in cases?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, here’s what I will say: You know,
we are reaching out to governors of every state, and we are lending a
helping hand.  We are stepping up and saying, “We will help you however
we can to meet this moment in time.”

And so whether it’s testing, whether it’s surge, you know, employees and
medical personnel, whether it’s helping them facilitate pop-up sites for
vaccinations and test-to-treat, we are all in on supporting them however
we can.  And that door is open, and we continue to do that outreach all
the time.

And — oh, and I guess I should say, you know, we’re continuing to
pre-position personal protective equipment.  I think I said that in my
remarks.  But as part of helping manage surge in the jurisdictions,
we’re relying not just on people but on supplies and other materials
that we can send to them to the extent that they’re short on things.

MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Thank you, \[senior administration official\]. 
And thank you, everybody, for joining.  As a reminder, this call is
embargoed until the morning.  If you have any questions, just reach out
directly to me. 

Have a good night.
