  \ Security Communications Advisor John\_Kirby"

1:54 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  So, I want to begin by
sharing some news on how President Biden is fighting for working
families and lowering costs by taking on corporate rip-offs.  
   
Ahead of his State of the Union Address, the President is convening his
Competition Council this afternoon to announce new actions to crack down
on hidden junk fees and promote competition.  President Biden is
establishing a new strike force, co-chaired by the Justice Department
and Federal Trade Commission, to crack down on illegal pricing.  
   
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is slashing credit card late
fees from an average of $32 down to $8. This will save consumers $10
billion a year, an average savings of $220 for the 45 million people who
are charged late fees each year.  
   
The Department of Agriculture is finalizing a rule to protect small
farmers and ranchers.  The Federal Communications Commission is
circulating a proposed rule that would ban “bulk billing,” helping lower
Internet costs and increase choices.  
   
Our administration’s actions to ban hidden junk fees will save Americans
more than $20 billion a year.  The President will make clear in his
State of the Union that he will continue fighting to lower costs for
families.  
   
I have some news we’d like to share with you all.  On March 15th,
President Joe Biden will host Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of Ireland for a
bilateral meeting, followed by St. — by a St. Patrick’s Day celebration
at the White House on March 17th, continuing a longstanding St.
Patrick’s Day tradition.  
   
The leaders will reaffirm the close and enduring partnership between the
United States and Ireland and the extraordinary bonds between our
people.  They will discuss our countries’ shared commitment to continue
supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal aggression, as well as
our cooperation on a range of other global issues.  
   
They will reaffirm their steadfast support for the Belfast/Good Friday
Agreement as we welcome the recent restoration of Northern Ireland’s
Executive and Assembly.  
   
Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will
also host the Taoiseach and Mr. Matthew Barrett for a breakfast at the
Naval Observatory on March 15th.  
   
And as you can see when I walked out, three of our amazing wranglers
came out with me.  And so, before we get started with the briefing, I
have a couple things that I want to say.  
   
So, you know, they’re moving up in the world.  They’re going to stay in
the family but still moving up — and it’s so well deserved of all three
— into new roles, obviously.  
   
Allyson Bayless has been by my side since day one and a rockstar
wrangler — I’m going to get emotional — for the last two years, is — is
moving over to the campaign.  There is no one who worked harder or more
hours than — on our team than Allyson, as you can — as you can all
attest by the hours of the day that she responds to your emails.  She
accomplishes everything with diligence and composure.  And she always
has a bright, bright sunshine spirit, even when we — even I’m in — when
in my dark spaces, as we tend to joke around.  And she has a — an
incredible sense of humor and a wit that is unmatched.  
   
Silas Woods has — has the biggest heart of everyone that I know.  And
sometimes I worry about him because he has such a big heart.  And every
single day, I see him go above and beyond to coordinate movements, get
you all what you need and make accommodations for everyone as he — as he
can.  And some of you don’t know he’s often the reason you’re able to
get that shot, right?  Silas is really good at getting that shot — shot,
get in the room, or hear what the President has to say, obviously.  
   
There isn’t a single person here who doesn’t have a kind word to say
about Silas, and there’s no better teammate, which is why the Second
Gentleman is stealing him from us.  He came from OVP, so now he’s going
back, essentially, to that world.  The Press team won’t be the same
without Silas, but we’re glad we’ll still get to work with him every
day.  I’m going to miss you very much, Silas.  Literally, the biggest
heart of anyone that I know.  
   
And finally, Davis.  Davis Conger came to us from the State Department,
having traveled the world with Secretary Blinken.  He’s brought skill
and professionalism to our team, and he’s — and he is someone you always
know you can rely on.  Every day, he has brought competence, kindness,
and coolness under pressure to his job.  He’s always so even cool —
even-keeled and cool, which is why Annie Tomasini has hired him as an
advisor in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff.  
   
Three — three incredible new roles for three incredible young people. 
We are extraordinarily proud of all of you — the work you’ve done and
the work you will now continue to do at a higher level, obviously, on
behalf of this President.  And so, I’m super, super proud of you.  You
guys are like — like my kids who are flying out — flying off.  So, I’m
glad you will still be part of the broader team, obviously.  And I’m
really, really sad to see all of you go, but I am so personally,
personally proud of all of you.  
   
And now, they’re going to get up and they’re going to walk out —
(laughter) — because there’s so much work to do, as you know, as
wranglers.  But thank you, guys.  Love you all.   
   
MS. BAYLESS:  Thank you, Karine.   
   
MR. WOODS:  Thank you, Karine.   
   
MR. CONGER:  Thank you, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
All right.  With that, Admiral John Kirby is here to give an update on
the Middle East.  And, Admiral, the floor is yours.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thank you, Karine.   
   
Good afternoon, everyone.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  This morning, I think you all are tracking, the Department
of Defense conducted another airdrop of humanitarian assistance into
Gaza.  Three U.S. C-130s dropped 60 bundles with a total of over 36,000
Meals, Ready-to-Eat.  We were joined in this endeavor by several
Jordanian aircraft as well.  
   
As President Biden has said, this will be a part of a sustained effort
while our — with our international partners to scale up the amount of
lifesaving aid that we’re getting into Gaza.   
   
And as I said last week, we’re exploring other channels to get aid into
Gaza, including a maritime route.  To that end, we are looking at both
military and commercial options to move assistance by sea.  There’s
still an awful lot of work that’s being done on this to flesh it out.  
   
Of course, we’re also going to continue to urge Israel to facilitate
more trucks and more routes, opening up more crossings so that more aid
can get in to people in need and increase that flow.  
   
And, with that, I’ll take some questions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Zeke.  
   
Q    Thanks, John.  That number on the — the 36,000 meals.  Was that
just the U.S. contri- — contribution to that?  Or was that also the
Jordanian contribution to that airdrop?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That was just the U.S.  The Jordanians flew — I believe it
was four aircraft.  And I can get you the exact number of how much they
dropped.  But it was — it was food that they dropped too.  
   
Q    And then in terms of the scale of that, I mean, that’s a drop in
the bucket of what the need is in Gaz- —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Oh, certainly.  
   
Q    — in Gaza right now.  And you talked about the maritime corridor
planning as well.  I mean, this war has been going on for, you know —
for, you know, five months now.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Why isn’t the U.S. and its allies further along in the planning
stages for a maritime corridor or other operations like an air drop with
more equip- — with more equipment, more resources, more personnel on
standby?  Should — you know, from the moment the President gave the
go-ahead, shouldn’t there have been more contingency planning to get
more aid in much faster?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’ve been working on the humanitarian assistance from —
since the beginning, as you said, many months ago.  And quite frankly,
the best and most efficient way to get aid in to people in a confined
space like that in a very urban environment is on the ground.  
   
I mean, yes, you can move more volume in — in ships, whether they’re
military or commercial ships, but eventually that stuff has to get
ashore, then it has to get loaded onto vehicles and then trucked in. 
Right?  
   
So, the trucks are the best way to do that.  And that’s why we’ve been
working so hard to — to try to increase the flow.  And during the
week-long pause that we had before, we were able to get it up to 200
trucks a day.  
   
It was through President Biden’s urging that we got the Rafah Cros- —
Crossing open to aid.  It was at his urging that we got Kerem Shalom
open.  But it just hasn’t — the flow just hasn’t been enough to meet the
need.  And as the war has progressed, the need has gotten obviously much
more dire.  
   
So, it’s not like we — even though we’re just now talking about
airdrops, it’s not like the idea of airdrops just — just happened, just
dropped out of the sky.  It’s been something we’ve been talking about
for quite some time.  And the maritime route as well.  
   
The maritime route, yes, it can move more volume at sea, but it also is
going to require a heavier logistics lift and some infrastructure ashore
and very much going to need the support of allies and partners.  And so,
those discussions are ongoing.  
   
Q    And then does the President have any plans to meet with Benny Gantz
before he leaves Washington this evening?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Ed.  
   
Q    Thank you for answering that one.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, we can go and move on from Ed now.  
   
Q    Nope.  A few others here.  (Laughter.)  
   
The President this morning signaled that he’s concerned about violence
in Jerusalem and in the region in the coming days.  Is there something
specific he’s been told to anticipate?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I — I won’t speak to specific intelligence one way or the
other, Ed.  I mean, obviously, this is something we’re — we’re always
mindful of, particularly given what’s going on between Israel and
Hamas.  But I don’t think I’m going to elaborate on that.  
   
Q    There — just to backtrack on something from last week.  I don’t
think you’ve been asked about this, at least on camera.  But when he was
in New York and suggested he had reason to believe there would be a
ceasefire by Monday, and that hasn’t happened, why did he think that at
the time?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  He was referring to updates and briefings that he’d been
getting from the national security team about the progress of
negotiations.  Obviously, we all wish that that had happened.  We wish
that it would happen today.  But we’re still — we’re still negotiating. 
We’re still trying to get there.  
   
Q    And on Haiti.  Is the U.S. continuing to monitor that situation? 
And does it have any sense of the whereabouts of the Prime Minister?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes.  As far as I understand, no.  I will let the Prime
Minister speak to his travel.  But I’m not aware that we have any keen
sense of what his whereabouts are.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Mike.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Just following up on Haiti.  You’ve called on Americans to
evacuate.  How should they do that when the airport is under attack?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We — again, I’d refer you to the State Department to —
they’re the ones that issued that — that advisory.  Not a safe time for
Americans to be in Haiti right now.  There are other ways to leave. 
Again, I’ll let the State Department do that.   
   
They’re — they’re in touch with — or are making themselves available to
Americans who are there and want to — want to get that information.  
   
Q    You said yesterday that you’re working to expedite this
multinational force led by Kenya to deploy to Haiti as soon as
possible.  They’ve said that they’re ready to deploy within 72 hours. 
The holdup is funding — in part, U.S. funding — that was pledged by the
administration that’s being held up, as we understand it, by Republicans
in Congress.   
   
How urgent are those conversations?  And how are you going to expedite
it if you’ve got this — this key holdup?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I’m not sure that that simplistic explanation is
exactly accurate, that the — that that is the only thing holding this
up.  But let’s put that — but let’s put that aside.  
   
You’re right, we’re going to need some — we’re going to need some
support.  And we are working actively with members of Congress.  I mean,
we — I think — I think we can all recognize that this is in our interest
as well as the region’s interest and certainly the interests of the
Haitian people to get a more stable, calm, secure environment there.  
   
Q    So, just one last follow-up.  If — if that’s a simplistic
explanation, then what — what is the holdup?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, we — there’s — they’ve al- — Kenya has already agreed
to do this.  That’s a big first step.  And we’re working with Kenya,
we’re working with other partners to see if we can get this
multinational security mission up and running as soon as possible.  
   
I just don’t have any more updates for you other than that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Selina.  
   
Q    Thanks, Admiral. Thanks, Karine.  You had said yesterday that part
of the reason why it’s so hard to get aid into Gaza is, in some cases,
because of the Israeli War Cabinet.  Is that acceptable?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  There’s nothing acceptable about the dire situation on the
ground in — in Gaza in terms of the lack of food; lack of water; lack of
medicine; in some cases, a lack of fuel.  That shouldn’t be acceptable
to anybody.  So, short answer to your question is: No, it’s not
acceptable.  And that’s why we continue to work with our Israeli
counterparts.   
   
As I said in my opening statement, and you’ve heard the President say as
well and the Vice President, that it’s time for Israel to open up more
crossings and allow more aid in.  
   
Q    And on the Vice President.  There were reports that the National
Security Council had asked her to, quote, “tone down” her speech on
Sunday.  What can you say about that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would point you to what the Vice President’s spokesperson
already said about that story, in — in calling it inaccurate.  
   
Q    Does the administration still believe it’s more effective to
withhold public criticism of Netanyahu in order to have more sway in
private?  And is that private sway waning?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I’m just — I don’t think I’m going to accept the
premise of that question.  I mean, we have been nothing but candid and
forthright in private with our Israeli counterparts and, certainly, in
public in the comments that we have made.   
   
And you’ve heard, again, from the President and the Vice President in
just recent days expressing very clearly what our concerns are with the
humanitarian situation in there and how it is unacceptable and how we
need the Israelis to step up and do more.  
   
Q    And just lastly, Hamas said today they won’t accept a deal that
does not include a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.  Is
that realistic?  And if not, where do negotiations go from here?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I ain’t going to negotiate in public.  We — we’ve been
working this real hard.  As — you heard from President Biden just today
that we’re still hopeful we can get there.  But nothing is done until
everything is done, and not everything is done in terms of this
negotiation. 

So, what we’re looking for and what we want: a temporary ceasefire for
about six weeks that will allow us to get more aid in and, more
importantly, get all those hostages back with their families where they
belong and reduce the violence.  That’s the deal on the table.   
   
And as the President also said today, it’s a rational deal, and the
Israelis have been cooperating.  They have been negotiating in good
faith on this.  It’s time for Hamas to step up to the plate, take a
swing, and let’s get this thing done.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    The — Hamas is saying that they have now extended a deal that
Israel has not responded to.  Israel is saying that Hamas has to accept
the deal that you’ve been referencing with regard to hostages.  What’s —
can you sort out what’s true in both of those things?  And can you also
comment on — has it been more difficult to have these talks in Cairo
without an Israeli representative at the table?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I, kind of, sort of, already did it, Jeff, but I’ll — I’ll —
maybe I’ll take it a different way.  There has been, throughout the
process of these many weeks, back and forth between the sides —
proposals, counterproposals, and — and haggling over the details and all
the modalities of how this is going to work in terms of the phasing of
the hostages and how many and the release of Palestinian prisoners and
how many and how that’s all going to take place.   
   
There is now a framework.  There is a deal, as the President said today,
that has been the result of all this back and forth.  So, the back and
forth has happened.  There’s a deal now, and the onus is on Hamas to
accept it.   
   
And you had a second question.   
   
Q    Israel hasn’t been at the table —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Oh, in Cairo.  
   
Q    — since — since Sunday.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I won’t speak to Israel and the presence or — of
their negotiators one w- — they get to speak to that.   
   
But as I said earlier, the Israelis have negotiated in good faith.  They
have agreed to this framework.  Th- — they have taken it right up to the
end, and now it’s up to Hamas.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Kevin.  
   
Q    Given that Hamas has now responded to the — to the deal, and that
they have not agreed to it as written, is it still practically possible
to come up with an agreement by the start of Ramadan?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That — look, the negotiators are working hard on this,
Kevin.  That’s what we — we hope will happen, but we’ll have to see.   
   
Q    So, you — there’s — there is still a belief that that is a
possibility?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I didn’t say a belief.  I said we hope that we can get this
done as soon as possible.   
   
We would have liked to have this done two, three weeks ago, if not
before then.  We are where we are.  And we’re working on this really,
really hard.   
   
Q    And given what the President said about the potential dangerous
situation should an agreement not be reached, what conversations is the
White House having with Israel about, for example, the situation around
the Al-Aqsa Mosque?  What — what are, sort of, the conversations in
advance to try and curb some of the violence that the President is —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t think the Israelis need —  
   
Q    — worried about?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — need to be reminded by the United States that they live in
a tough neighborhood.  And I don’t think they need to be reminded about
the prospect of violence, particularly in a sensitive time like
Ramadan.  They don’t need us to remind them of that.  They’re — they’re
well aware of it.   
   
Again, we’re — we’re going to continue to work with them, as we have, to
help sure — make sure that they can defend themselves against Hamas,
make sure that the Israelis — the Israeli citizens are safe and secure
as much as possible, and that we can try to get this hostage deal in
place.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh.  Go ahead, Joe-Joe.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks, Karine.  John, why isn’t President Biden meeting with
Benny Ga- — Gantz whi- — while he’s in Washington?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Mr. Gantz asked to come to Washington and asked for a series
of meetings with administration officials, and he’s getting those.  He
met with Jake Sullivan yesterday.  He met with the Vice President
yesterday.  Today, he’s met with the Secretary of Defense and the
Secretary of State.  All of these conversations have been constructive
and productive.   
   
And we hope that Mr. Gantz goes home informed by the conversations that
we had and the concerns that we expressed.  
   
Q    I mean, was it a scheduling issue with the President being in Camp
David or was it —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Mr. Gantz had a chance to meet with senior levels all the
way up to the Vice President of the United States.  And — and, you know,
again, we think these — these conversations were constructive and
productive and — and hope that he goes home informed by them.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Andrew.  
   
Q    Thanks.  John, the President and the Vice President — and you, for
that matter — have both said that the situation with getting aid into
Gaza is too difficult.  The Vice President said that Israel needs to
allow more aid in.  “No excuses.”  
   
What is preventing the President from communicating to the Israeli
government that if they don’t allow aid, we will not continue supplying
weapons?  Why is that not a fair trade — no aid, no bombs?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Because the President still believes that it’s important for
Israel to have what it needs to defend itself against a still viable
Hamas threat.  And maybe some people have forgotten what happened on the
7th of October, but President Biden has not.   
   
Q    John, how does keeping aid out of Gaza contribute to Israel’s right
to defend itself?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Keeping aid out of Gaza is not the right thing for any
purpose.  It’s not about — it’s just — it’s just not acceptable on the
face of it, as I told Selina, and that’s why we’re working — more than
any other country, by the way — to increase the flow.  I mean, it is
U.S. aircraft that are dropping these — this food out of the sky in the
last couple of days.   
   
Q    Yes, but you — you keep saying — and you said yesterday — the
holdup — that the problem is the lack of capacity being delivered on the
ground.  And that’s — that’s the Israelis and, to some extent, the
Egyptians, but mostly the Israelis.  How is that — and you said it’s not
acceptable earlier —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  You guys — you’re looking at this as a zero-sum game.  
   
Q    No, I’m not.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, you are, sir.  It’s, “Well, if they’re not doing what
you want, then cut off the aid so they can’t defend themselves.”  That’s
not the way we’re going to do this.  It’s not the way we have done
this.  They have a right to defend themselves.  They need the capa- —
wait, wait, let me finish.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  They need the capabilities to do that.  There’s — there’s
aid that’s desperately in need.  And you know what?  We can do that
too.  We can do both.  Both are important.  And both are going —

Q    Not if the Israelis —

MR. KIRBY:  — to be pursued by this administration.   
   
Q    — don’t let it in, sir.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I know — I know you don’t approve of necessarily the policy
choices that we’ve made, but —  
   
Q    I don’t — I have no opinion on the —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  But —  
   
Q    — policies.  I’m just asking questions, sir.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  But we — and I’m answering them.  
   
We can do both.  We can influence our Israeli counterparts to do more,
to be more careful, to let more aid in, and we can continue to work to
get that aid in ourselves.   
   
Q    And one more follow-up, then.  Israel — according to Israeli media,
the Israeli Defense Forces and industrial base are ramping up or
preparing to ramp up domestic production of weapons that are currently
U.S. supplied — including dumb bombs, firearms, that sort of thing — to
be — to be commenced next year, 2025.   
   
Is the President concerned that this would lower U.S. leverage?  And is
th- — is there a window that’s closing during which the U.S. has the
leverage and influence to get the Israeli government to do certain
things with respect to human rights, for instance, allowing more aid
into Gaza?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President’s concerned, as I’ve said, about Israel being
able to defend itself against a still-viable threat.  We’ll let the
Israelis speak to their defense industrial base plans and intentions.   
   
They’re a sovereign country.  They get to make those decisions, and we
respect that.  They’re also a key ally and a partner, and we respect
that alliance and that partnership as well.  
   
The other thing that’s keeping the President up at night is the
humanitarian assistance and the humanitarian situation on the ground in
Gaza.  And that’s why he has ordered these air drops.  That’s why we
continue to urge — very, very stridently — the Israelis to open up more
crossings on the ground to supplement the — to supplement the aid that’s
already getting in and to try to improve what’s not getting in.   
   
And that’s why, as I said in my opening statement, the President also
has the team looking at maritime options.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Aurelia.   
   
Q    Thank you so much.  I want to ask you about some remarks the French
President, Emmanuel Macron, made today.  So, he urged Ukraine’s allies
not to be cowards, and he also added that he —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Not — not to be what?  
   
Q    Not to be cowards.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Cowards.  
   
Q    Cowards.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Cowards.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Oh, cowards.  
   
Q    Cowards.  Cowards.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Sorry.  
   
Q    Sorry, my accent.  And he added that he fully stood behind those
controversial remarks he made last week about sending troops to
Ukraine.  So, what do you make of this rhetoric?  Do you think the time
has come for stronger language on Ukraine?  Or is this not helpful?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to parse President Macron’s words.  I mean, he
certainly has every right and ability to — to speak for himself and his
views.  All I can do is speak for President Biden, the
Commander-in-Chief.  And the President has been clear: We have been
extraordinarily strong in leading international efforts to support
Ukraine for the last few years.  
   
We need Congress to help right now — pass that supplemental — so we can
continue that strong leadership and support more — a coalition of more
than 50 nations that the United States put together to support
Ukraine.  
   
He’s also been very clear since the very beginning of this war: There’s
not going to be U.S. troops on the ground fighting inside Ukraine.  And
you know what?  President Zelenskyy isn’t asking for that.  He’s just
asking for the tools and capabilities.  He’s never asked for foreign
troops to fight for his country.  He — he and his troops want to do
that.  But they need the tools, and that’s what we need to help with.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  We’re bumping up against the President’s
schedule.  Go ahead.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Sorry.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I have questions on the Indonesian election,
but just to finish up on Gaza.  Is the Gantz meeting with the VP and
also with Jake a signal that the administration is looking forward to a
future Israeli government without Netanyahu?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No.  
   
Q    And maybe this one is for Karine.  Will the President use any part
of his State of the Union Address to acknowledge the anger of American
Arabs and Muslims and progressive Democrats and explain to them why he’s
not imposing conditionalities on Israel?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to go around, and I’ll get to that
question.  Let me just get to a couple more people before we lose the
Admiral.  
   
Q    Okay.  Great.   
   
And so, just on the Indo- — on the Indonesian election.  China, the
United Kingdom, Australia, and several other countries have
congratulated Indonesia’s President-elect, Prabowo Subianto, on his
apparent victory.  Is there a reason why the administration is
waiting?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We congratulate the Indonesian people on a successful
election.  The President looks forward to early engagement with the new
administration and to strengthening our cooperation under what is
already a strategic partnership.  
   
We’re obviously closely following the ongoing vote count, and we
understand that Minister Subianto has a significant lead.  We’ve had
excellent cooperation with him since the time he was Defense Minister. 
And, you know, if he is, in fact, finally elected, then we look forward
to continuing that relationship.  
   
Q    And just to clarify.  The President-elect does have a long track
record of allegations of human rights violations.  He was at one point
the son-in-law of former President Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32
years, and his Vice President-elect is the son of the outgoing
President, Joko Widodo.  Is the administration concerned at all about
democratic backsliding in Indonesia?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re never ba- — we never back away from our concerns about
the need for human rights, civil rights, and all the values of
democratic institutions.  And the President absolutely will not shy away
about expressing our concerns.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Go ahead, Gabe.  
   
Q    Admiral, to ask that question more directly, or one of the other
questions that was just asked: In Israel, the Vice President’s meeting
with Gantz was seen as a snuff to the Netanyahu government.  Was it?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The meeting with Minister Gantz, again, was at his request. 
He is a member of the War Cabinet.  There is a war going on.  And we
believed it would — it was a good opportunity to have a discussion with
the War Cabinet about the way in which we’re supporting Israel and the
things that we want to see Israel do.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    The President was asked this morning how his relationship was with
Netanyahu these days, and he responded, “Like it’s always been,” and
then he smiled.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yep.  (Laughter.)   
   
Q    What was — what do you — what do you make of that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know if I can improve upon that.  
   
Q    What would you add to that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I wouldn’t.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  (Laughter.)  All right.  Let’s —  
   
Q    One question — one question on Haiti.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I still like my job.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We got — we’ve got to —  
   
Q    One question on Haiti.  The administration has provided more than
$126 million in humanitarian aid to Haiti in 2023.  Where has that money
gone?  And is it — has it been affective?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I can get you a — Gabe, I’ll get you — we can get you a
rundown of exactly how that — those funds were allocated.  But we are —
we’re proud of the humanitarian assistance that we have and will
continue to provide Haiti.  
   
But the — right now — man, right now, the focus has got to be on getting
that multinational security element in there to help create the
conditions where the people of Haiti can live free and in security so
that humanitarian assistance can get there more freely and get to the
people that need it.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Last question to the foreign pooler.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, Admiral.  Following up on Aurelia’s
question.  There’s been some pushback on Macron’s comments from the
Germans and also from the Swedes as well.  Is the U.S. worried that
Ukraine’s allies are starting to splinter?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No.  There has been tremendous international support and
unity for Ukraine.  The Pres- — as you know, we met with the Prime
Minister of Italy just last week.  They’ve been strong.  There’s —
there’s incredible unity.  Everybody shares the same concerns that we do
about just letting Putin take Ukraine and what that means for their
safety and security and for the security of — of the NATO Alliance.  
   
No.  No, we’re not concerned about that.  
   
Q    And are you worried about the stalling of this U.S. aid — that it’s
putting more pressure on European Allies and causing fractures on — at
all, in that sense?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re worried that the delay on the national security
supplemental and the assistance coming from the United States is going
to have a detriment- — actually, already is having a detrimental effect
for Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield.  That’s the main concern. 
And the time is way past now to get them the tools that they need to
defend themselves.   
   
Their defensive lines are starting to shift now, going in the wrong
direction, because the Russians continue to push west out of the
Donbas. 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks.  Thanks, Admiral.   
   
All right.  As you know, the President’s event is going to start
shortly.  Zeke, you have anything?

Q    Yeah.  Do you have a, sort of, broad rundown of how the President
spent the last few days at Camp David preparing for the State of the
Union?  Who was with him?  Does he have the final speech text at this
point?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, so, as you know, the President has been working
on, as you just stated in your — in your question to me, the State of
the Union Address for the past several days.  I’m not going to get into
any specifics as to who was with him. 

It’s — you know, it’s — it’s some- — it’s going to be a moment that’s
incredibly important to him.  Obviously, he’s going to be not just
addressing Congress but also millions of Americans who will — going to
be tuning in.  And he’s looking forward to that, to talking about the
accomplish- –accomplishments that he’s made the last three years and
also the vision — the vision that he has for this country, obviously,
for the American people. 

I’m just not going to get into any specifics or details.  We’ll have,
certainly, more to share with you all tomorrow as we get closer.

You know, the State of the Union Address is incredibly important.  He’s
going to be working on it, I believe, until the very last minute so he
gets it just right.  Because it’s going to be an important moment.  But
don’t have anything beyond that.   
   
You heard me talk about the Competition Council, how that is part of the
President talking about wanting to focusing on lowering costs for the
American people.   
   
Obviously, he’s going to talk about our democracy; our freedoms — right?
— fighting — continuing to fight for that; reproductive freedom, how
that’s an issue that the American people truly care about.  You’re going
to hear him talk about that. 

And so, there’s a lot of issues in front — obviously, in front of the
American people that they care and they want to hear directly from the
President about.  And so, that’s what he’s going to focus on.   
   
We’ll certainly have more to share as we get closer to Thursday.

Q    And then, on a different topic.  A bit of a kerfuffle this morning
across Lafayette Park at the Department of Veterans Affairs, running an
effort to ban the display of that i- — that iconic Time Square kiss
photo on — on V-J Day at the end of World War Two. 

Was anyone at the White House consulted in that — in the drafting of the
initial memorandum?  And then, did anyone at the White House call up the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs and say, “Rescind that memo”? 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, just — I want to be really, really clear.  The VA
is not going to be banning this photo from VA facilities.  So, I just
want to be super, super clear about that.  I know, as you just said —
you described it as a “kerfuffle.”  There was, obviously, some reporting
on that.

I can say that — I can definitely say that the memo was not sanctioned. 
And so, it’s not something that we were even aware of until you all
started reporting on it.  But we are not banning that photo.  And I’m
just going to be super clear about that. 

Any specifics about the memo and the process over there, certainly, I
would prefer to the VA.

Q    But once you were made aware of it and after that — after the memo,
sort of, spread on social media, did the White House direct the Veterans
Affairs Secretary to rescind it?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I believe the VA Secretary made a statement on
this, so I’d refer you to the statement —

Q    But did he say it under his  own — of his own volition?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, he did that on his own volition.  But he — I
would refer you to his statement.  And just re- — I’m really reiterating
what the VA said.  The VA Secretary said that it will not be — that
particular photo will not be banned from any facility — VA facility. 
So, I want to be very, very clear about that. 

Okay.  Go ahead.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  President Biden has said a possible endorsement
by Taylor Swift —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)

Q    — is “classified.”  How disappointed is he that she is telling
people to vote but not for him?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Going to very careful.  We’re talking about 2024.  And
so, I can’t comment on what Taylor Swift is saying or not saying.  I
have no idea.  I’m not seen those statements. 

And I’ll just — I’ll just leave it there —

Q    Okay.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — and be mindful.

Q    Different topic.  How is President Biden going to fix the border if
he can go years without talking to the head of Border Patrol?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He was literally just with the head — the Chief of the
Border Patrol just this past Thursday in Brownsville, Texas.  You all
reported it.  You all saw it.  He was with — he was with the Chief —
Chief Owens, I believe.

Q    The Chief who was in charge for two years before that said, “I’ve
never had one conversation with the President or the Vice President.” 
How is that possible?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, one thing I will say about Chief — you’re talking
about Chief Ortiz?

Q    This is Chief Ortiz.  Yeah. 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, he was invited, I believe, to participate in the
President’s first trip — visit to El Paso, which was back in January of
2023, and he did not attend.  He was invited.  He was invited.  He is —
he did not attend. 

What I can say is that you saw — you saw the President with the present
chief, which I think is important, because we are dealing with
challenges at the border, because the President has take- — made that a
priority, worked with the Senate in a bipartisan way to come up with a
way to move forward on the border, on immigration.  Republicans rejected
it because of what the former President, Donald Trump, told them to do. 
He told them to reject that proposal. 

So, the President is going to continue to be steadfast, focus on an
issue that a majority of the American people care about, which is the
border. 

Let’s not forget, if that policy had went into law, it would have been
the toughest and the fairest bipartisan border security agreement in
decades — in decades. 

Q    And last one.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.

Q    Will President Biden publicly address Laken Riley’s murder,
allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was released by law
enforcement multiple times, on Thursday night?  I know he’s put out a
statement.  But what about at the State of the Union?  
      
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You — look, let me — I do want — this is such a tragic
story and, obviously, situation.  This is someone’s life that was lost,
so I do want to always acknowledge and extend our deepest condolences to
— to her family and to her friends and the people who — who loved her. 
And so, want to always be sure to say that and — because it’s so tragic.

Look, I don’t have anything to share about the President’s speech as it
relates to that particular question that you have.  But we — you know,
we want to always — always be sure that we li- — lift up the families
who have lost their loved ones in that way. 

And I would reiterate — you just asked me about the Border Patrol
chief.  The President was just there with the current chief, Owens.  The
President went to the border — obviously, Brownsville, Texas — to lift
up the importance of doing something — of doing something at the
border. 

And I would be remiss if I did not continue to say that Republicans
rejected a bipartisan proposal that came out of the Senate.  And so, if
they truly, truly cared about what was going on at the border; if they
truly cared about this immigration policies and trying to fix that,
trying to move forward in a step, in a way where we have a tough and
fair law, they would work with us on it.  They wouldn’t listen to the
former President, who is clearly telling them to reject — telling
Republicans to reject it for their — for his own political gain.  And
that’s shameful.  That’s truly shameful.  
   
Go ahead, Selina.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Will the President be watching the election
results come in tonight?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, the President is going to be talking
about the Competition Council today.  He is continuing to work,
obviously, on his State of the Union Address, because it’s important to
him, and he knows how important it is for the American people to hear
directly from him.  I don’t have a — I don’t have anything to share. 
I’ve not spoken to him about his plans tonight.   
   
Obviously, he will be kept updated.  And he’ll — he’ll be aware of
what’s going on tonight as — as we see elections happening across the
country.  I just don’t have anything specific on that.   
   
Q    And the Consumer Bankers Association has been very critical of the
Biden administration’s rule to cut the credit card late fees.  They
called it “anything but” a win for consumers and “knowingly putting
consumers’ financial health at risk.”  What’s the administration’s
response to that criticism?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I totally disa- — we totally disagree, obviously. 
The President has always been very, very clear: He’s going to do
everything that he can to make sure that we lower costs for the American
people.  And what we are seeing is that — we’re seeing, you know,
corporations, obviously, not passing along their gains to Americans — to
American consumers.  And we’ve always been very clear about that.  And
so, we want to make sure that we protect — we protect Americans.  We
want to make sure that we, obviously, protect American consumers.   
   
So, we disagree with that sentiment.  We disagree with that statement. 
And the President is always going to put the American people first.  
   
Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    Karine, does the White House have a position or comment on latest
bill in Congress to crack down on Tik Tok — just introduced today, I
believe?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I have not seen the text or had an opportunity to
speak to our Office of Leg Affairs or any — anyone else in — in the — in
the White House Office, so I don’t want to get ahead of myself and speak
to that.  
   
Obviously, we’ll take a look, as we normally do on any legislation, that
believe will — will be beneficial to the American people.  I just can’t
speak to that at this time.   
   
Go ahead, Kevin.  
   
Q    Robert Hur is supposed to testify a week from today.  Has the White
House made a decision on releasing the transcripts of the President’s
interview with him?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the — my colleagues at the White
House Counsel’s Office.  
   
Q    Okay.  And the Dartmouth basketball team has become the first
college sports team to vote to form a union.  Does the White House think
that that’s a good idea?  Is that a smart move for college athletes?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m going to, obviously, let — let teams
make their decisions for themselves.  We’re not going to weigh in on
that.  As you know, the President is a union guy.  We say that all the
time, but I’m not going to comment on any particular team or actions
that they’re taking.  That’s for them to decide.  
   
Q    To the back?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, Senator Sinema just announced that she’s not running for
reelection.  She’s going to retire at the end of this term.  I’m
wondering if the White House has any comment.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I have not seen that.  Obviously, that is news —
news to me.  Look, we have had opportunities to work closely with the
senator on some really key, important bills.  She was leading — one of
the leading negotiators on the border security bill that came out of the
Senate in a bipartisan way.  We appreciated her efforts on that.  And
there are some other, obviously, ways that we’ve worked closely with
her.  
   
Outside of that, I don’t want to get too far ahead.  I — this is the
first time I’m hearing the news.  But she’s been a partner with us on
many critical issues that matter to the American people.  And I think
that’s important.  
   
Q    Is there any — anything you can tell us about the President’s
travel after the State of the Union this weekend and — (a reporter
sneezes) — and into next week?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think the — the —  
   
Q    Excuse me.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Bless you.  
   
I believe the campaign has made some announcements on some travel that
the President will be doing after the State of the Union, so I would
refer you to them.  It is common that after a State of the Union, the
President goes around and — goes around the country to speak directly to
the American people.  You’re going to see the President do the same. 
But I would refer you to the campaign on specific stops that he has
coming up.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, I just wanted to ask about the Meta — the breakdown this
morning — hundreds of thousands of users.  Do you have any more
information on that and whether it’s connected to a cyberattack?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, obviously, we all are aware of what happened from
— for the last couple of hours — the incident.  And so — so, don’t have
anything at this time.  We are — we are not aware of any specific
malicious cyber activity — so, I can say that — or any specific nexus as
it relates to today’s election.  But we would have to refer you to the
individual social — social platforms, obviously, for any more
information on that.   
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.  A quick separate one on the minibus spending
agreement in Congress right now.  It would divert about $45 million in
fees from the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.  So, I’m just
wondering, given the administration’s take on antitrust, is this a
concern that that money would be going away?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as it relates more broadly, you know — well,
I’ll say this: You know, the President obviously strongly supports
funding for antitrust enforcement, which is critical to promoting
competition and lowering cost for consumers.  It’s a — this is a bit
more complicated, so I just want to break this down a little bit.   
   
The antitrust funding proposed in the funding bill is — is a 4 percent
increase over the last year and a 26 percent increase since 2021. 
Because of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, every agency is subject to
budget caps, so preventing us from fully funding programs the way we
want to.   
   
These full-year bills represent a compromise.  Obviously, this is what
has come together with these — with these six different bills.  So, no —
no one got everything they wanted, obviously.  That’s what a compromise
is.  But they fund the government, prevent a damaging shutdown, and
protect our progress.  And that’s what happens when you come with a —
when you come forward with a compromise — a bipartisan compromise.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, is the President aware or have any concern about the number
of Super Tuesday states that have campaigns for uncommitted votes,
ceasefire write-ins — essentially, a vote against the President —
because of his stance on the war in Gaza?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m going to be super, super mindful.  These
are — obviously, people are — are voting right now, and I cannot speak
to any upcoming election or — as voting — as voting is happening.  So,
I’m going to be super, super careful about that.   
   
But what I will say is what I said last time when I was asked about
Michigan specifically: The President thinks it’s important for people —
for Americans to voice their opinions, to have their voices heard.  He
thinks that’s incredibly important.  We understand how painful this
moment is for many Americans, for many communities — obviously, the Arab
and — the Arab community, the Muslim community, more specifically.  And
so, we get that.   
   
But I just want to be super careful and not speak to upcoming — upcoming
election — upcoming voting that — voting that’s happening right now, to
be more specific.   
   
Q    Karine, can I just follow up?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know you had a — I know you had a similar
question.  
   
Q    Is that — is that also the message that the President will be
saying during the State of the Union?  And then I think you mentioned to
my colleague that he will be taking this message around the country
after the address.  Is Michigan one of those destinations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, not going to get into the states.  I know that the
campaign announced a couple of states already that he’s going to be
going to right after Thursday.  So, you can expect the President to be
visiting multiple states across the country the next, obviously, couple
of months.   
   
I’m not going to get into that.  I would refer you to the campaign
specifically on the most upcoming states, the announcements that they’ve
made.   
   
And I just kind of laid out, you know, what the President has been very
clear about, the understanding of how people should have the right to
voice their opinion, to voice their concern, to voice their pain.  And
that’s what the President is going to consistently do.  He’s a president
for all Americans, obviously.  
   
As it relates to the State of the Union, I’m not — I’m just not going to
get ahead of any specifics on what he’s going to say as it relates to
that question.  
   
Go ahead, Ed.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  So, Cookie Monster posted on X that shrinkflation
is making his cookie smaller.  The White House official Twit- — Twitter,
or X, responded that — blaming shrinkflation, basically, on companies. 
So, does the President, again, believe that shrinkflation and inflation
are solely a company problem?  Or do his policies play any role in
that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, also, from my tweet, I believe we said, “C is for
consumers getting ripped off.”  Right?  And — and the President — the
President has called on — on companies to stop — to stop, you know,
taking advantage of Americans.  He’s been very clear about that.   
   
He’s repeatedly called on large corporations, more specifically, to pass
along their savings on to their customers.  We’ve said that.  We’ve been
very consistent about that.  And that includes rip-offs such as
shrinkflation.  We see that.  And — where the size of a product, for
those who don’t know, gets smaller, even as the price stays the same or
increases.  That’s what we’ve been seeing.  
   
And so, it’s giving families less bang for their buck.  And the
President has said — and I’ll quote him — “Tired of being” — the
President said, “Americans are tired of being played for suckers.”   
   
And so, the President is going to have the Amer- — the American people’s
back.  That’s what he’s going to continue to do.  He’s going to talk
about this — not just shrinkflation but other ways that he sees
corporations are ripping off Americans.  You’re going to hear from him
shortly about the — about the — what he’s doing next to — to deal with
junk fees.  And I think that’s really important.  
   
That’s what Americans want to see.  They want to see their president
fighting on their behalf.  
   
Q    And out of that Competition Council, the President is announcing
that strike force.  Why did it take the Cookie Monster to speak up or an
election year for this strike force to go?  Why not do it year- — a
couple years ago when inflation was 9 percent?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t — I disagree with the premise of your question
there.  It did not take the Cookie Monster.  If anything, it feels like
the Cookie Monster is responding to us and what we’ve been saying about
shrinkflation.  (Laughs.)  
   
I can’t believe I’m having a conversation about the Cookie Monster at
the podium.  (Laughter.)  But that is where —  
   
Q    Does the President have full confidence —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But that is — but that is —  
   
Q    — in the Cookie Monster?  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s a good one.  I’m glad you’re awake.  I’m glad
you woke up for me.  I know you were nodding off in the back earlier. 
But —  
   
Q    But why did it take — why did it take so long to announce a strike
force —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look —  
   
Q    — when inflation was 9 percent?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — here’s — we’ll — here’s the thing.  The President’s
Competition Council has been going — going on for some time now. 
Right?  He has taken this very seriously in finding ways to lower costs
for the American people as we are obviously dealing with inflation —
right? — obviously dealing with that because of what we are coming out
of with the — with the pandemic.  
   
So, the President has taken action.  He’s going to continue to do that. 
I would say the strike force is just another way — along of many other
announcement that this President has made — in dealing with large
corporations ripping off Americans — right? — and dealing with how do we
get rid of junk fees.  
   
And so, that’s what you’re going to hear from the Amer- — from the
President.  So, to say that, you know, now, all of the sudden, he cares
about this is not true.  It is a false premise.  It’s a false question,
because the President has been dealing with this for some time now.   
   
And now he’s making a new announcement on — on the strike force, and I
think it’s important.  And so, you’ll hear more from him momentarily.  
   
Q    Yeah.  And one more, if I may.  The President, I noticed, had — had
notecards la- — at the border when he was doing his briefing there.  He
also had notecards last Friday with the Italian Prime Minister.  Why
does the President rely so heavily on notecards?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re upset because the President has notecards? 
You’re —  
   
Q    I’m not upset.  I’m asking you why.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re asking me a question about the President having
notecards?  
   
Q    I’m asking why does he rely so heavily?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President, who has had a — probably one of the
most successful first three years of an adm- –administration than any
modern-day president — he’s done more in the first three years than most
presidents who had two terms.  You’re asking me about notecards?  I
don’t think that’s —  
   
Q    Can you answer —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t think —  
   
Q    — his question?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait.  I’m —  
   
Q    I’m asking you why he — why he relies so heavily.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not speaking to you right now, James.  I’m talking
to — I’m talking to your friend over here, Ed.  So, thank you so much —
but thank you so much for interjecting.  
   
Go ahead, Ed.  
   
Q    I was just asking why he relies so heavily on notecards.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think what’s important here and what the American
people care about is how this President is delivering for — for them. 
And that’s what he’s doing.  And that’s what’s the most important thing
here.  
   
All right.  I’m going to take —  
   
Q    In the back.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to take — go ahead.  Did I call on you
already?  
   
Q    You did.  So, if you want to go to the back and then —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Wait.  No, no, no.  I can’t do that.  
   
     Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    — come up here —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no.  Go ahead, Karen.  Go ahead, Karen.  Go
ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Aleksey Navalny’s widow, Yulia, was invited to the State of the
Union by the White House, but she’s unable to make it.  Did the
President extend that invite personally when he met with her last
month?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, yes, I can — I can confirm that she was indeed
invited to the State of the Union.  She is no longer able to attend.  I
would have to refer you to her and her people as to specifically why. 
But I can confirm that, yes, she was invited.  
   
Q    Did the President extend that invitation —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, the President did.  
   
Q    — when they met?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, the President did.  
   
Q    Karine, first it was Elmo —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  All right.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — now it’s Cookie Monster.  Are there — are there —   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jon.  Go ahead, Jon.   
   
Q    — any other “Sesame Street” characters the President would
consult?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jon.  Jon, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks a lot, Karine.  The President recently said that he’d be
open to meeting with the House Speaker in regards to that Ukraine
funding bill.  Is there anything to report?  Is the President reaching
out to the House Speaker in terms of a one-on-one conversation?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, they just met — the Big Four just met last
week.  They talked about the importance of, obviously, the national
security supplemental, which includes the Ukraine funding.  They talked
about, obviously, avoiding a shutdown, which we are glad to see that
Congress is doing that.   
   
And, as you know, they had a pull-aside, they had a brief meeting
afterwards.  Not going to get into what was discussed.  It was a private
meeting.  But the President has spent some time with the Speaker over —
I mean, just — just last week — literally, they were together just last
week.  
   
I don’t have anything else to share.   
   
All right, guys.  We’re going to wrap it up.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Is the White House concerned about another —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible.)  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Oh, I’m so sorry.  
   
Q    No, no.  No —   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no.  I’m more so teasing.  I’m giving Ed a hard
time.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is the White House concerned about another bank failure after New
York Community Bank showed signs of trouble?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, obviously I want to be super careful,
right?  This is something that is monitored by — by regulators.  And
this is something that we take very — that they take very seriously and
are always monitoring.   
   
I don’t want to get ahead of that.  And we’re always going to keep an
eye on — on that — or they will, more — more specifically, regula- —
regulator- — regulators.  I just don’t have anything else to share
beyond that.   
   
All right.   
   
Q    In the vein of that question about the Speaker —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, yes.  
   
Q    — one of mine was: He did, last week, extend a bipartisan olive
branch to the former President to work with him on border security. 
Beyond saying that rhetorically, has there been any other attempt to
reach him to talk about possibly working together?  Have you heard from
the Trump camp about it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, it — as it relates to the Trump camp or
campaign, that’s something that I would refer you to the campaign on.   
   
Look, the President has been very clear, and I think you’ve seen it in
his action.  The fact that we worked with Republicans to try and get to
a border security proposal — we did that because we believe it needed to
be dealt with in a bipartisan way.   
   
And I would add that when — when we are able to work in a bipartisan
way, in a bi- — in a — on behalf of the American people, we get things
done.  Right?   
   
We see that with the CHIPS and Science Act.  We saw that with the
prevent — gun violence legislation — right? — anti-gun violence
legislation.  You saw that with the infrastructure legislation. 

Remember las- — last time around, during the last four years, of the —
of the last administration, it was a punchline.  Infrastructure, you
know, Week was a punchline.  
   
Q    But beyond saying it last week, there’s been no active attempt to
get the former President —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have —  
   
Q    — on board?  
   
 MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — I am saying to you I don’t have anything to
read out.   
   
But I do want to say, when we work in a bipartisan way, we are able to
get things done on — for the American people.  We just are.  And we see
that.  We see that with historic pieces of legislation that will change
the lives of Americans for generations, which are incredibly important —
issues that a majority of Americans care about.  And I think that’s
important.   
   
I don’t have anything to read out on any outreach.   
   
I would certainly refer you to the campaign on anything specific as it
relates to the Donald Trump campaign.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, guys.  I’ll see you tomorrow.  Thanks,
everybody.
