1:56 P.M. EST  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Good afternoon, everybody.  
   
As you know, over the weekend the U.S. Department of Defense and the
Jordanian Royal Air Force collaborated over the weekend to airdrop
38,000 ready-to-eat meals into Gaza.  This operation saw 66 bundles of
aid offloaded across three C-130 aircraft delivered to people in dire
need of it.  
   
We remain the largest provider of aid to Gaza, having provided now more
than $180 million in humanitarian assistance since the 7th of October. 
And we’ll keep at that job.   
   
Responding to the humanitarian crisis and the needs of the Palestinian
people has been a priority since day one, and as I said, it remains one
today.   
   
But, look, the truth is — and you heard the President talk about this —
that the aid flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough, and it’s not
getting there fast enough.  We all need to do more, and the United
States will do more.  There will be additional airdrops of humanitarian
assistance from U.S. aircraft.  I’m sure you all want to know exactly
when that’s going to be, where that’s going to be, and what’s going to
be on those airplanes, and I am not in a position today to give you
those sorts of operational details.  But there will be more airdrops.  
   
We continue to work to increase the amount of aid that’s flowing through
existing border crossings as well, at Rafah and Kerem Shalom, and to
press the government of Israel to open additional crossings and routes
into Gaza.  
   
As the President said, we are also looking to develop a direct maritime
route to facilitate the delivery of assistance, and we’re confident that
we’ll have a number of international partners who will help us in that
effort.   
   
We’ll also continue to insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and
more routes and more aid to get to more people.  
   
I think as you all know, Benny Gantz, from the Israeli war cabinet, will
be meeting today with the Vice President and with Jake Sullivan and then
tomorrow with Secretary Blinken.  And I can assure you that the issue of
humanitarian assistance will be top on that agenda.  
   
Of course, to really address the urgent needs of the civilian population
in Gaza and to enable our humanitarian partners to more and to better
distribute lifesaving aid, it’s essential to see a temporary ceasefire
as part of this hostage deal.   
   
We call on Hamas to accept the terms that are on the table right now,
whereby the release of vulnerable hostages — the sick, the wounded, the
elderly, women — would help result in an immediate six-week ceasefire
and enable a surge of humanitarian assistance.  
   
Israel has agreed to this framework, and now the onus is on Hamas to do
the same.   
   
And if I could switch to Haiti, if you don’t mind.  
   
We are monitoring Haiti’s rapidly deteriorating security situation with
grave concern.  Through the weekend, senior U.S. government officials
remained in close contact with senior Haitian government officials and
members of the international community to help stabilize the situation
and to move quickly toward an enduring political solution.  
   
We’re working with international partners to provide immediate support
to the Haitian National Police and expedite the deployment of the
Multinational Security Support Mission that will help restore security
urgently.  
   
Violence serves only to delay a democratic transition while destroying
and upending the lives of thousands.  
   
Ultimately, the path forward lies with democratic governance and free
and fair elections, which continue to be a priority in our engagements
with our Haitian partners.  
   
We remain committed to a peaceful transition of power from the current
prime minister to a prime minister that the people select via those free
and fair elections.  Prime Minister Henry has said the same, and we’re
going to hold them to that.  
   
We urge all actors: Put the people of Haiti first to stop the violence
and to make necessary concessions to allow for inclusive governance,
free and fair elections, and the restoration of democracy.  
   
Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Awesome.  And we think we had a sound issue at the
beginning, so Kirby is going to read the first two or so paragraphs that
we think we missed.  We’ll have a transcript at the end, in a few hours,
out online.  So, everyone should be able to reference that in case we
missed anything else.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Gives me a chance to be more eloquent the second time
around.  
   
As you all know, over the weekend the U.S. Department of Defense and the
Jordanian Royal Air Force collaborated to airdrop some 38,000
ready-to-eat meals into Gaza.  And this included 66 bundles of aid
altogether, packed into three C-130 aircraft.   
   
We remain the largest provider of aid to the Gaza response, having
provided more than $180 million in humanitarian assistance since the 7th
of October.  
   
Responding to the humanitarian crisis and needs of the Palestinian
people has been a priority since day one, and it remains one today.  But
the truth is that the aid flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough and
nowhere fast enough.  And you heard that clearly from President Biden. 
We all need to do more, and the United States will do more.   
   
And I know there’s a lot of interest in additional airdrops.  I can
assure you that there will be additional airdrops from U.S. aircraft,
but I am not in a position today to tell you exactly when that’s going
to be, how many aircraft that’s going to include, and what’s going to be
on those aircraft.  But I can assure you that the airdrop over the
weekend was only the first, and we will continue to do that in coming
days to supplement the flow of humanitarian assistance that’s coming in
on the ground.  
   
And speaking of that, we’re also going to continue to work with our
Israeli counterparts to increase the amount of aid that’s flowing
through those existing border crossings at Rafah and Kerem Shalom and to
press the government of Israel to actually open up additional crossings
and routes into Gaza.  
   
I think that takes me right to where I left off.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And thank you all for your patience again for
that.   
   
Our first question will go to Steve with Reuters.  
   
Q    Thank you, John.  For a while there, you were doing 200 truck
deliveries a day into Gaza.  What happened to that?  I mean, why isn’t
Israel allowing more truck deliveries in there?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Steve, the numbers of trucks getting in, I think you know,
has fluctuated almost day to day.  And at the high-water mark, we were
up over 200 trucks for some matter of days.  But it’s not been a level
we’ve been able to sustain in a reliable fashion since the beginning of
the war.  There’s lots of reasons for that.  I mean, it is a war zone. 
And the actual combat operations can combine to make it hard to get
trucks in.  There’s an inspection regime that can at times slow that
process down at both crossings.   
   
And as you — I think you know, we saw in recent weeks some protest
activity at Kerem Shalom, which actually shut down Kerem Shalom for a
few days.  We engaged our Israeli counterparts to do what they could to
allow for peaceful protest but also locate the protesters in such a way
that they were not a hindrance to the flow of aid.   
   
So there has been some obstacles to getting the aid in that are organic
to the fact that we’re talking about a war zone, but also, there have
been some inorganic obstacles thrown up, in some cases by some members
of the Israeli cabinet, that have made it hard to get that aid in.  And
that’s why I think you heard the President so very clearly make certain
on Friday, when he was meeting with Prime Minister Meloni, that this is
not a time for excuses.   
   
We’ve got to get more aid in the ground routes.  Although there are
obstacles and it can be cumbersome, it’s still the best way to get the
most aid in in a quick fashion — or the quickest fashion.  And we’ve got
to do everything we can to make sure that happens.   
   
Q    And the Vice President yesterday called for an immediate ceasefire
in Gaza.  Is there any daylight between what she’s saying and what the
President’s position is on this?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Not at all, Steve.  Not at all.  She made it clear that she
was talking about a six-week ceasefire, a temporary ceasefire, which is
exactly what the President has called for.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Aamer with the
AP.  
   
Q    Hey there.  Can you hear me?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hey, sorry about that.  On the Gantz bit — meeting, how did this
meeting come together?  Was this a Gantz request, or did the White House
invite him?  
   
And Israeli officials have made clear that Gantz doesn’t represent the
Israeli government during this visit, so why host him for such a
high-level meeting when — or meetings — when it’s obviously aggravating
to the current government?  Thank you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Aamer.  This was a request by Mr.  Gantz — Minister
Gantz — to come to the United States and have meetings.  And he’s a
member of the war cabinet.  There is a war going on between Israel and
Hamas.  We have been dealing with all members of the war cabinet,
including Minister Gantz, since the beginning of the war, certainly when
he joined the war cabinet, which was shortly after the 7th of October. 
And we see this as a natural outgrowth of those discussions.   
   
If a member of the war cabinet from Israel wants to come to the United
States, wants to talk to us about the progress of that war, giving us an
opportunity to talk about the importance of getting humanitarian
assistance increased and an opportunity to talk about the importance of
this hostage deal, we’re not going to turn away that sort of
opportunity.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to MJ Lee with CNN.  
   
Q    Hey, John.  Thank you for doing this.  I just wanted to clarify one
thing, if you can, on the hostage talks.  On the call with reporters
yesterday, the senior administration official had said that Israel has
basically accepted a six-week ceasefire proposal but that Hamas needs to
clarify who exactly would be released in that first part of the
vulnerable hostages category.  
   
CNN had reported yesterday that, you know, according to a Hamas source,
that one of their sticking points was Israel agreeing to a permanent
ceasefire or at least a path to a permanent ceasefire, and that without
one of those, Hamas would not release the remaining Israeli hostages. 
Is that a Hamas sticking point, as far as the U.S. is concerned?  I was
just hoping you could help clarify that.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I think, obviously, I’m going to be a little careful
here in speaking about the specific details of the negotiation
process.  
   
I would just say that Israel has put forward a forward-leaning offer,
and that deal is on the table.  And as I said in my opening statement,
we urge Hamas to accept that deal so that we can move forward.   
   
But, obviously, there’s still modalities here that need to be worked
out, and that’s why we’re still engaged in these active conversations.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Andrea Mitchell
with NBC.  
   
Q    Hi, John.  Thanks for doing this.  Just to clarify, I know you
can’t talk about details, but was the offer that you call forward
leaning from Israel, did that include the specificity of the list of
hostages who are still alive?  Or is that a new element that has been
added to the mix?  
   
Does the White House still think it’s possible to get a deal before
Ramadan on or about March 10th?   
   
And has Hamas come forward with a deal that you also think is forward
leaning?  Or is Hamas the major sticking point, from your concern?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, Andrea, I’ll try to take them in turn.   
   
As before — when we did this before, the week-long pause where we got
the first tranche of hostages out, obviously a big part of that is the
list — right? — the list of hostages and a list of Palestinian prisoners
that are going to be exchanged.  That was part of the last deal, and you
can certainly imagine that that’s a part of this deal too.   
   
Now, in this case, we’re talking about more — more of both — over a
longer period of time.  And they would be sequenced; you would see
several tranches of exchanges over the course of what we hope will be
six weeks.  But the list of names is part of that.   
   
We obviously want all the hostages returned to their families, and we
recognize that it’s likely that not all of them are still alive, but
that doesn’t mean that they aren’t still important to their loved ones. 
And so, we’re working our way through all that with Hamas.  
   
Again, what I would draw you to is what I said at the opening, and
that’s that we certainly want an initial focus on the elderly, the sick,
and the wounded, and women.  That’s what our immediate focus is on.  But
that’s the goal, and that’s the approach that we’re taking to it.   
   
And you asked, you know, can we get this done before Ramadan.  I can
tell you we’re certainly trying.  I mean, we would have liked to have
this done yesterday, last week, the week before.  There’s no shortage of
effort that’s being applied here to try to get this done as soon as
possible.   
   
Q    But let me just ask you whether — is it — can you confirm reports
that Israel has not returned, has not sent their teams to Cairo in — for
whatever reasons, particularly because of objection to not knowing the
accounting of the dead?  But in any case, is it true that the technical
teams, or the teams from Israel, are not in Cairo with the other teams
right now?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think I’ll let the Israelis speak for their negotiating
team and where they are.   
   
I would just remind two things.  One, talks do continue, negotiations
are ongoing, and that, as I said earlier, Israel has put a
forward-leaning deal on the table.  They have made an offer here, and
the onus is on Hamas to accept it.   
   
But where their negotiators are, I’ll let them speak to it.   
   
And again, back to your question on Ramadan: We certainly are hopeful. 
And that’s the goal here — is to get this done as soon as possible.  And
certainly, we’d like to see it done before Ramadan begins.   
   
Q    Thank you, John.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think you had — I think I answered your third question
about Hamas being the sticking point.  
   
Q    Well, maybe you didn’t.  I’m sorry.   
   
Have they put forward, quote, a “forward-leaning” proposal as well?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  They have not.  
   
Q    And is it because of the numbers?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to get into the details.  I’m not going to
negotiate in public, Andrea.  I would just tell you that there is a
framework deal on the table, a deal that Israel has put forward.  We
believe it’s forward leaning.  We believe that Hamas should take up that
deal.  And I think I really am going to have to leave it at that.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to JJ with
Bloomberg.  
   
Q    Hey there.  On the apparent intelligence leak from Germany that
Russia is shopping around, kind of claiming that there’s direct Western
involvement in the war in Ukraine, do you think that Berlin needs to do
more to clarify that situation?  And is there any reason to think that
wiretaps are ongoing?  Any evidence that they might be wiretapping other
NATO members?  
   
And then, on a different topic: On Apple and the antitrust fine, is
there anything you can share as far as comment on the Europeans lodging
that fine against Apple?  Thanks.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  On Berlin, I think the Germans have already talked to this. 
They’re investigating how that audio got leaked.  I think I’d refer you
to the German officials on that.  And I won’t speak to the content that
was leaked into the public domain.  That just plays right into the
Russian hands.  
   
I’ll just tell you that this is a bald attempt and a transparent attempt
by the Russians to try to sow discord and to try to sow division and try
to make it look like the West isn’t unified and, hell, that even the
German government is not unified on what they’re doing.  And we’re just
not going to — we’re not going to just bow down to that bald attempt. 
We’re not going to accept the premise of it.  That’s what the Russians
want.   
   
We’re all working together to try to support Ukraine.  And the Germans
have been right there in it, absolutely.  Every nation has to decide for
itself what it’s going to do.  And the Germans have stepped up; they’ve
stepped up in meaningful ways.  And we look forward to continuing to
work with Chancellor Scholz and his government as they continue to find
ways to support Ukraine and as we, here at home, do everything we can to
try to get that supplemental funding passed so we can continue to
support Ukraine.   
   
You asked if there is evidence that they’re wiretapping others in the
Alliance or in Europe.  I wouldn’t have the answer to that for you.  I
can just tell you that we are certainly not unmindful of Russian efforts
to conduct these kinds of activities.  And we take seriously our
responsibility to safeguard our own communications.   
   
On the Apple fine question, JJ, I’m afraid I’m just going to have to
refer you to the EU on that.  That’s about the extent of the comment
that we’re going to be able to have today.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Vivian Salama with
the Wall Street Journal.  
   
Q    Thanks, Sam.  Hey, John.  I wanted to actually follow on Aamer’s
questions from earlier.   
   
With regard to the Gantz visit, you know, the Israeli press is reporting
that Netanyahu is, quote, “enraged” over this.  And so, I’m curious if
the White House had attempted at the time, you know, before Gantz
arrived, to reach out to Bibi, sort of a “Hey, I know you’re enraged,
but I just wanted you to hear it from us” kind of thing.   
   
Like, did you try to reach out to him ahead of the meeting just to let
him know it was happening?  And/or is POTUS or anyone else, Jake or
someone, planning on calling Netanyahu after Gantz leaves just to kind
of keep him apprised of the discussions, or are you just leaving that to
Gantz himself to do?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have any discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu to
speak to today on this.  Again, Minister Gantz is a member of the war
cabinet — a member of the war cabinet in the middle of a war, a war in
which we are trying to help Israel and will continue to help Israel —
and wanted to meet with U.S. officials.  And it was an opportunity not
only to hear from him but also to relay our continued concerns about
humanitarian assistance, about the importance of getting this hostage
deal over the finish line.  And so, we’re going to take advantage of
that opportunity.   
   
Q    Still rather unusual, though, for the Prime Minister to not approve
of a meeting and for it to go ahead anyway.  So can you just kind of
speak to the decision to go ahead with it, regardless of whether, you
know, Bibi’s office kind of gave its blessings?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I mean, I think I — I mean, obviously, we certainly
recognize Prime Minister Netanyahu as the elected prime minister of the
government of Israel, and we will continue to deal with him and with his
entire war cabinet.  Mr. Gantz is a part of that war cabinet.  I think
I’ve kind of already answered that question.  He asked for a set of
meetings while he was here in Washington.  A member of the war cabinet
of a country at war, an ally and a partner.  We weren’t going to just
overlook that opportunity to have that discussion.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Alex Ward of
Politico.  
   
Q    Yep.  Thanks, John.  One quick clarification on Vice President
Harris’s ceasefire comment.  I want to make sure that her main target
for that comment was Hamas when she was talking about the need to agree
to a six-week ceasefire.   
   
And then, secondly, USAID Administrator Power said today, after talking
to aid workers, that, quote, “There’s a need for Israel to do much more
to get aid to those who desperately need it.”  I know the administration
has talked openly — you know, said consistently that more aid needs to
get in, but she’s saying that this is mainly — or this is on Israel.  Is
that the administration’s assessment?  Is she speaking for the
administration on that?  Thanks.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m sorry, Alex, can you repeat the second question?  You
were going really fast there.  I was just trying to keep up with you.  
   
Q    No, fair enough.  The countdown clock had me a little worried
there.   
   
So she said today, after speaking with aid workers, quote, “There’s a
need for Israel to do much more to get aid to those who desperately need
it.”  So just making sure — I know you guys have said more aid needs to
get in; you said it today.  But she’s fingering Israel as the problem
here.  Just making sure that that is, you know, reflective of the
administration’s view that Israel needs to do more to get aid in.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Alex.  So, on your first question, I mean, the short
answer to it is yes.  I mean, she was very clear that there’s a deal on
the table and Hamas needs to take that deal.  So, yes, she was
definitely communicating to Hamas the importance of accepting this deal,
a deal which I have described as forward leaning that the Israelis have
put forward.  So, yes, clearly, that was a strong message to Hamas to
accept this deal and let’s move forward.   
   
And I want to remind everybody again that the six-week ceasefire she was
talking about, the temporary ceasefire she was talking about was in the
context of this hostage deal.  It’s all a package.  You get six weeks of
peace with no fighting.  That allows you to safely and effectively get
all the hostages out.  Again, we’re talking about multiple tranches. 
And there’s physical movement of people that has to be accomplished, and
you can’t do that if it’s a combat zone.   
   
So it’s all part of a package deal that would — again, six weeks of no
fighting: That will certainly help reduce civilian casualties and the
damage to civilian infrastructure, give you the chance to do a
multitiered approach of getting hostages out and not unimportantly — and
this kind of gets to your second question — an increase of humanitarian
assistance in.   
   
And, yes, you heard from the President, when he met with Prime Minister
Meloni on Friday, that we believe Israel can and should do more to allow
humanitarian assistance to get in unimpeded.  This, kind of, gets back
to Steve Holland’s first question right at the beginning of the gaggle
about whether Israel is holding things up and whether they’re
responsible for some delays or obstacles.  And the answer is that there
has been such — there have been such incidents where they have not been
either able or willing, or maybe both, to keep the trucks going at an
increased level.   
   
I mean, clearly, there’s a desperate need for this stuff.  And that’s
why we have now taken on the role of dropping from the air, and we’ll
continue to do that too to supplement.   
   
But honestly, the way to do this in scale, true scale and scope, is on
the ground, through trunk convoys.  You just can’t replicate the volume
and the speed with which you can do this as you can on the ground.  And
that requires a lot of coordination between Israel, obviously other
partners, but including and most especially aid organizations on the
ground.  And just more needs to be done.  And we’ve been, yes, clear
that Israel bears a responsibility here to do more.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Karen DeYoung with
the Washington Post.  Karen, you should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    You said that Israel has agreed to the framework, and the ball is
in Hamas’s court.  When the initial framework came out after the Paris
meetings, both sides responded with additional — with changes and
additional response.  Is what’s on the table now incorporating those
changes in response from both sides, or is it Israel’s side and you’ve
given it to Hamas as a last offer — in other words, take it or leave
it?  
   
Just as one example, the Hamas response demanded more crossings be open,
which is something that the United States has also demanded.  Is that
something that Israel has now agreed to?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, again, I’m going to be careful here, Karen, not to get
into the specific details of the deal.  Nothing is negotiated until
everything is negotiated.  And we’re still, obviously, in that process
right now.   
   
But the short answer to your question is: Yes, there was back-and-forth,
as you know — proposals and counterproposals — between the two sides
over recent weeks.  And we believe that the deal that’s on the table now
reflects the give-and-take through those negotiations — the
back-and-forth, the proposals and counterproposals.  
   
We believe it’s reflective of the concerns that both sides have voiced
and hashed out.  But again, there’s still the details in front of us. 
We believe that the deal on the table does reflect all that negotiation,
and Hamas should take it up.  
   
Q    If I could just — does that include opening more crossings for
aid?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t get into the specifics of the deal, as I said,
Karen, but I also said in my opening statements that we continue to call
on Israel to open up additional ground crossings beyond just Kerem
Shalom and Rafah — or Kerem Shalom, because Rafah is obviously not in
Israel.  
   
But, yes, we are calling on Israel to open up additional ground
crossings.  But that’s not — I don’t want to get into the details of the
deal itself.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Asma Khalid with
NPR.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks, John, for doing this.  I have two quick questions. 
One is around the meeting that Jake is having today with Benny Gantz. 
What is the message that Jake is trying to deliver to him?  And
relatedly, are you all concerned at all about agitating the current
Israeli government?  
   
And then, secondly, what is your understanding of why Hamas has not
agreed to the six-week temporary ceasefire deal?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Hang on.  I’m just writing it all down here.   
   
So, on the meeting between Jake and Benny Gantz, again, we’ll have a
readout for you after that meeting is over.  And as you know, he will
also be meeting with the Vice President.   
   
I think it’s safe to say, before we’ve done readouts in meetings, that
both Jake and the Vice President will talk to Minister Gantz about the
humanitarian situation in Gaza and the need to increase aid.  I think
it’s safe to say that they’ll talk about progress of operations on the
ground.  Certainly they’ll want to get a better sense from the Minister
and the war cabinet where their thinking is with respect to operations
in and around Rafah.   
   
And I think you can expect that they will also talk about the hostage
deal itself.  Separate and aside from humanitarian assistance writ
large, he’ll also want to talk to the Minister about getting this
hostage deal implemented, getting it executed, getting it in place so
that we can get that six weeks of no fighting, get all the hostages out,
as well as, of course, getting opportunities to increase the aid.   
   
But those will be the main topics of discussion.  And, again, we’ll have
a readout for you.   
   
I’ve already dealt with the issue of the Prime Minister stating concerns
about Minister Gantz’s travel.  So I really don’t have anything more to
add on that question.   
   
And I simply won’t negotiate here in public.  You asked me why has Hamas
not signed on to it.  I think that’s a terrific question for Mr.
Sinwar.  It is a forward-leaning proposal.  We believe it’s a solid
proposal.  And we believe that it is in everyone’s best interest,
including Hamas, for them to sign on on this and to move forward with
it.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  I think we have time for one more question, so
we’ll go to Fraser Jackson with France 24.  
   
Q    Hi, Sam.  Thank you, Admiral.  I was late to the call, so sorry if
this has already been asked.  But I wanted to ask about the tape — the
conversation that Russia leaked between top German military officials. 
Russia says that it’s proof that Germany is seeking war with Russia. 
Germany has vehemently denied that.  Is there any U.S. assessment of
this leak and how it was obtained?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s proof that the Russians want to sow division and
discord and try to demonstrate that the West is divided.  And that’s
what it’s proof of.  And obviously, none of that’s true.   
   
I’m not going to speak to the content in this leak.   The Germans are
investigating it, and I think I’d refer you to them.  But as I said
earlier, they have been a key friend, ally, and partner in this effort. 
They have really stepped up to support Ukraine.  We’re grateful for
that.  We’re grateful for Chancellor Scholz’s leadership.  
   
And the last thing I’ll say is: Any validity that anybody gives to this
only makes it easier for Putin to sell this ridiculous narrative that
this is some sort of war between the West and Russia, the U.S. and
Russia, NATO and Russia, or any other way he wants to couch this. 
That’s exactly what he wants people to think, instead of what really
happened here, which is: In February, two years ago, he decided to
attack and invade a neighboring nation that posed no threat to him or
anybody else, for that matter.  So nobody should buy into the rhetoric
here.  That’s it.   
   
Q    Is there any U.S. assessment that Putin is using the hesitancy of
the U.S. to send more Ukraine aid?  Is he trying to weaponize that to
take advantage of it in the war?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, look, I mean, you don’t have to look any further than
the air attacks that he continues to conduct, whether it’s cruise and/or
ballistic missiles and/or drones.  He’s going after military targets in
Ukraine, of course, and he’s going after the defense industrial base. 
But he’s also throwing a hell of a lot of metal into the air so that he
can get the Ukrainians to fire back at it and defend themselves, because
he knows they’re working their way through inventory right now.   
   
So part of this is trying to get them to pare down their inventory
because he knows that the United States is now not able to send a
significant amount of support and aid to Ukraine. So he’s certainly
taking advantage of what he’s seeing happen on Capitol Hill.  And the
dysfunction in our own system up there on Capitol Hill is definitely
giving him an opportunity to place his own military positions at greater
advantage.   
   
And I’ll tell you, look — I mean, again, I talked about this last week
but still true today: He’s not stopping, not on the ground either.  He’s
got Avdiivka.  And over the last few days, he’s taken a couple other
towns and villages to the west of Avdiivka.  He’s moving forward against
Ukrainian defensive lines, defensive lines that they are having a harder
time defending and holding because they’re not getting the support from
the United States that they have been counting on.   
   
So it’s way past time for us to get that national security supplemental
passed, way past time for us to start restocking Ukrainian shelves so
that they can better defend themselves.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And thank you, everyone, again for joining. 
Sorry again for the audio issue at the top.  Again, we’ll have a
transcript out in a few hours.   
   
And if we weren’t able to get to you, feel free to reach out to the NSC
press distro and we’ll try to get back as soon as we can.  Thanks.
