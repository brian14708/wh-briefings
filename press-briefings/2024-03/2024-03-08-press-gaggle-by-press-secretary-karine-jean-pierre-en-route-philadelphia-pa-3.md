En Route Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

3:13 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  So, before we get started,
I wanted to talk about the — the State of the Union last night.   
   
President Biden hit a grand slam, making a strong case to the American
people about the future and his vision for an economy that’s centered on
the middle class, for protecting our freedoms instead of taking — taking
them away, and for making us more secure by acting on the bipartisan
border deal and strengthening our alliances.  
   
Not a dark di- — vision based on dragging American — American into —
America into the past, on passing extreme abortion bans, on an economy
by the rich for the rich, on taking revenge and bowing down to
dictators.  
   
His vision connected, as we keep seeing in front pages across the
country and in the live reactions you all have captured.  Now — now
we’re taking it on the road, as you can see.   
   
I want to share some of the reactions that stood out to us. 
Presidential historian Michael Basch- — Beschloss — pardon me.  He said,
“Biden hit the — hit the ball out of the park tonight.”   
   
Senator and Reverend Raphael Warnock: “That was a sermon tonight.”  
   
Politico Playbook: “It’s hard to imagine how the State of the Union
could have gone much better for Biden.”  
   
Larry Sabato: “Yeah, it’s a homerun.”  
   
Ian Bremmer: “A good night for American democracy.”  
   
Newsweek: “Republicans Complain Joe Biden Had Too Much Energy at
SOTU.”   
   
And coming out of the State of the Union, the President, his Cabinet,
and senior administration officials will fan out across the country to
speak directly to the American people, underscoring the historic
progress we have made thanks to the President’s agenda, as well as the
clear contrast between competing visions for the country.   
    
Today, the President and the First Lady are headed to the — to the
Philadelphia area.  And tomorrow, we’ll be traveling to Atlanta for
political events.   
   
On Monday, the President will travel to Manchester, New Hampshire, and
share how his administration is lowering costs for American families, as
well as — as participate in a political event.  
    
On Tuesday, the President will be at the White House to host both the
President and Prime Minister of Poland and discuss how we have
strengthened the bilateral relationship between our two countries.  
    
On Wednesday, the President will head back out on the road to Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, and then to Michigan on Thursday.  
   
And on Friday, the President will host Taoiseach of Ilan- — of Ireland
at the White House, which will be followed by a St. Patrick’s Day
Celebration at the White House on March 17.   
   
I also want to note that in addition to the President’s
post-State-of-the-Union travel, the Vice President and the Cabinet are
also traveling far and wide to highlight how the President is building
on — an economy from the middle out and bottom up, investing in all of
America to make sure the middle class has a fair shot and we leave no
one behind.  
   
They will al- — also underscore how the President’s investments are
keeping communities safe, protecting and expanding access to healthcare,
rebuilding America’s infrastructure, creating good-paying jobs, and
delivering a future for the American people.  
   
The Vice President is kicking her travel off in Phoenix, Arizona, today
and will visit Las Vegas on Saturday.  And on Tuesday, March 12th, she
will travel on to Denver, Colorado.  
   
There is a lot of traveling happening.  And please hold on, because
someone is going to fall.  (Laughter.)  But hold on.  
   
All right.  What you got, Josh?  
   
Q    From last night’s State of the Union, from the rostrum, the
President had an exchange with Marjorie Taylor Greene about Laken Riley,
and he used the word “illegal” and then later “legals.”  And I was
wondering if you could clarify what he was trying to communicate in that
exchange?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I think he was — he was obviously asked about this
right before getting on — right before getting on Air Force One.   
   
There’s a couple things I do want to lay out, which I think is important
when you look at the entirety of what he said yesterday in his
remarks.   
   
The President spoke to the nation, obviously, last night very clearly
about not demonizing immigrants.  He talked about the story of our
country and families seeking safety and opportunity in a place of
possibilities.   
   
President Biden believes in treating everyone humanely, which is — which
is why he — he stopped his predecessor’s anti-immigration policies, as
you know — all know and have covered back — back in the last
administration.  That is really an important message that he wanted to
make sure was sent during the State of the Union.  
   
In response to what was hurled at him from the House floor, the
President made clear that the murder of Laken Hope Riley was horrific
and expressed sympathy for her family.  And he once again called on
congressional Republicans to stop blocking the toughest, fairest
bipartisan border security legislation in modern history.   
   
Again, he was responding to what was being hurled at him, as you all
covered, and he was responding to that moment and that exchange.  
   
Q    Karine, I just asked him about —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — you know, whether he regrets using the word “illegal,” and he
said, “Technically, he wasn’t supposed to be here.”  I’m just wondering
if you’ve had a chance to sort of speak to him after his speech and
whether he really regrets using the word.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I saw him a couple of times after that.  I saw him
last night after his speech.  That is not what we focused on,
obviously.   
   
Look, what we — I think the bottom line to this is that we should not be
politiciz- —  
   
(A landing alert sound on Air Force One.)  Are you kidding me? 
(Laughter.)  
   
It should not be pol- — pol- — making this a political football.   
   
Congressional Re- — Republicans need to move forward and not reject a
bipartisan bill that came out of the Senate.  It is important to move
forward with this bill.  We can’t politicize this.  That’s what we
cannot do.   
   
It is important, as we move forward, to — to dealing with the border
challenges, as we move forward in buil- — in fixing a broken immigration
system.   
   
The President has sa- — said this.  We need to do this in a humane and
dignified way.  
   
Q    Any — any second guessing among staff about him using that word?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I —  
   
Q    I mean, because it upset a lot of Democrats.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I — I understand.  I — I mean, I hear what you’re
saying, but this is a president who also spent quite a bit of time on
this topic and talked about the importance of doing it in a hu- — when
we’re talking about immigration and dealing with immigration, dealing
with migrants who are coming here, doing it in a humane way and a
respectful way.   
   
He was responding to the engagement that he was having about a young
woman who was murdered.  And that’s what was happening.  That’s what you
saw.  
   
Q    Karine, can I —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — follow on something that happened during the briefing the other
day and you didn’t have a chance to respond?   Kyrsten Sinema’s
announcement about her resignation.  Has the President spoken with her? 
Did he speak with her before that announcement?  And what is their
relationship?  Can you —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I — you know, I don’t have any conver- — a
conversation or a call to read out to all of you.  Look, the President
said — he congratulated Sinema on a career of service of — to the people
of Arizona and the country.  He’s proud of the work that they were able
to — to get together — to get done together.   
   
You heard him talk about the bipartisan negotiation that was able to
happen that came out of the Senate.  She was one of the negotiators on
that.  There’s been other bipartisan bills that the President was able
to get through and with her assistance, and that’s now in law — into
law.  That’s going to change Americans’ lives.   
   
So, there are ways that they were able to work together.  He appreciates
that.  He congr- — congratulates her on her tenure as senator.  
   
Q    Karine, has — there were several members of the Democratic Caucus
last night, including Rashida Tlaib —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — and several others who didn’t applaud at all during the
President’s speech, who didn’t stand at any portion during the
President’s speech.  What’s the President’s message to the members of
his own party who are — they — they heard his message last night; he
spoke about Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there — but who, at the end
of the night, are still not satisfied with what the President is
doing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, I think you can see what the President
has been trying to do over the past several weeks – this past several
months on trying to get that hostage deal.  And what does that mean?  By
—   
   
AIR FORCE ONE CREW MEMBER:  You cannot remain standing.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
AIR FORCE ONE CREW MEMBER:  I’m so sorry.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Sorry, guys.  I got to — we got to go. 
(Laughs.)  
   
Q    Has he met with Rashida Tlaib at all?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I can’t — I can’t —  
   
Q    Has he met with Rashida Tlaib at all?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have —  
   
Q    Has he spoken to her?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a meeting to read out.   
   
Sorry, guys.  We go to land.   
   
Q    (Inaudible) Nikki Haley?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I don’t have anything to read out or — or say — to
speak to on that.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You saw — you saw his text on that.  Sorry, guys.   
   
Thanks.
