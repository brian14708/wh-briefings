James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:31 P.M. EDT  
   
Q    Hey, hey.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hey, hey.   
   
Q    Hi.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi, everybody.  Look at all the cameras.  Oh, my
goodness.  I’m camera shy.   
   
Okay.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Happy Monday.   
   
This week, as House Republicans’ chaos continues to march us toward an
extreme Republican shutdown, we are calling out how a shutdown would
damage our communities, economy, and national security.   
   
And we’re going to hold extreme House Republicans accountable.  We’re
going to hold them accountable for the reckless cuts they are demanding
as a condition — as a condition for keeping the government open.   
   
With that, I’m looking forward to having the Secretary back here again
to give you a laydown of the impacts and to talk about what the extreme
Republicans — what — what they’re about to do is going to really impact
families and Americans across the country.   
   
If you think about it, the risk of vital nutrition assistance for nearly
7 million mothers and young children who count on WIC, prevent farmers
from being able to access new loans, and delay housing loans for rural
families.  And that is what they’re — we’re looking at if this shutdown
— this Republican shutdown occurs.   
   
With that, Mr. Secretary.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Great.  Thank you.   
   
Well, good afternoon, everybody.  It’s certainly a pleasure to be here
today.  I think most of you probably understand and appreciate that the
work of the Department of Agriculture (inaudible) a number of mission
areas.  We are not only responsible for supporting farmers, we also
ensure a stable food supply, and we also provide nutrition assistance —
vital nutrition assistance to millions of Americans.   
   
That’s why it’s so difficult to face where we are today with an extreme
House Republican effort to recklessly steer our government towards a
preventable shutdown that would put many of the critical services that
we care about deeply at USDA at risk.   
   
I know about this firsthand because I was Secretary of Agriculture
during 2013 when we had a shutdown, and I remember then the needless
challenges and disruption that it caused.   
   
So, today, I thought it would be important to highlight some of the
impacts of this extreme Republican shutdown, what impact it would have
on rural Americans, farmers, families in need.   
   
Let me start with WIC.  WIC is a program that impacts and affects over
50 percent of all the newborns in this country.  Nearly 7 million
pregnant moms, new mothers, and young children count on WIC every single
day to receive support — nutrition assistance support.   
   
With a shutdown, what we would see across the United States is a denial
of those benefits and opportunities.  In some cases, it would be
literally within a matter of days after the shutdown.  In some cases, it
may be — in some states, it may be literally in a matter of weeks.    
   
But clearly, during the course of a shutdown, millions of those moms,
babes, and young children would see a lack of nutrition assistance.   
   
And it’s not just the WIC program, as important and significant as that
is.  It’s also about our farm economy.   
   
Now is the time when farmers are harvesting their crops and they’re
seeking marketing loans, which allow them and assist them in ensuring
that they get a decent price for their crop.  When we have a shutdown,
farm service agency offices in virtually every county of this country
shut down and those loans are not available.   
   
It’s not just about farm loans.  It’s about newlyweds who have decided
to purchase their first home in a rural small town.  Perhaps they’re
getting a loan guarantee from a bank that is guaranteed by USDA or
perhaps they’re getting a direct loan from USDA to be able to purchase
that home.  With a shutdown, those loans don’t take place.  And it’s
conceivable in those circumstances not only do they not — are they not
able to close the loan, it’s also conceivable that they may lose the
deal.   
   
So, this is a matter of real consequences when we are faced with a
shutdown.   
   
It’s not just about rural America.  It’s also about our natural
resources.   
   
As you probably know, the USDA is responsible for maintaining 195
million acres of national forests and grasslands.  These are often
places where people go to recreate.  And when they do, they provide
tourism dollars to communities in which they are going and spending
time.   
   
When we have a shutdown, those national forests shut down, and they are
closed.  And so, those family trips don’t take place, and those tourism
dollars are not spent, and the jobs they support are at risk.   
   
It’s not just the services that go to the American public.  It’s also
those who work for USDA.  
   
We anticipate and expect that more than 50,000 of those who work for
USDA will be furloughed.  And when they’re furloughed, it means that
they don’t receive a paycheck.  Because they don’t receive that
paycheck, their local economies get impacted and affected.   
   
And I could go on for some time.  But the reality is that when there is
a shutdown, we’re looking at a significant disruption of the lives of
millions of Americans.   
   
Republicans have called for a CR.  And I’ll just say two things about
that.  It just is basically carrying forward the extreme cuts that we’ve
seen and saw in the budget that was proposed in the House Ag
appropriations committee.   
   
At the time, I said the budget was pathetic, it was punitive, and it was
petty.  And I would say that that also continues to be the case.   
   
Not only do we have the WIC initiative that wouldn’t be funded, but
we’re also looking at the failure to fund the firefighter fix, which
puts at risk the firefighting staff necessary to combat the nearly
44,000 fires that we’ve already experienced in the Western U.S.
today.   
   
So, I’m here today to suggest that there are real consequences to real
people in a real way when there is a shutdown, especially one that ought
not to happen.  And — and I’m hopeful that, at the end of the day, it
doesn’t happen.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, Secretary.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Once there is a shutdown, how long can you keep nutrition
assistance going?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  To make sure I answer your question, the SNAP
program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — will continue
—  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  — at least for the month of October.  Now, if the
shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious
consequences to SNAP.  
   
The WIC program that I talked about today, which is for nearly 7 million
moms and children — that program expires, if you will, or it stops
immediately when the shutdown occurs.   
   
We have a contingency fund at USDA that might continue it for a day or
two.  Some states may have leftover WIC benefits that have not been
spent, which could extend it for a week or so in that state.  But the
vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and
elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance
that’s provided would not be available.   
   
Q    Thank you, sir.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, MJ.  
   
Q    Is there any scenario where if there is no deal and there is a
government shutdown that the administration could explore the
possibility of exercising any authority to extend the funding of the WIC
program past the one or two days that you just mentioned?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  There is no authority.  It’s — it is — unlike the
SNAP program, it doesn’t — we don’t have that capability, at least for a
period of time, with SNAP for — for a month or so.   
   
So, if we have a shutdown, WIC shuts down.  And that means the nutrition
assistance to those moms and young children shuts down.   
   
Q    Thank you.  You mentioned a government shutdown could harm farmers
and prevent them from accessing new loans.  Help us put this into
perspective for Americans.  At the end of the day, what should Americans
expect?  Could this even lead to higher food prices, for instance?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  What it leads to is a tremendous amount of stress
for those farm families.  Just to give you a sense of this, many farm
families require off-farm income to be able to keep the farm.  And
oftentimes, they need that loan — that marketing assistance loan — to be
able to make sure that they maintain the farm.   
   
So, it puts at risk the small- and mid-sized farming operation in terms
of their ability to get credit when they need credit, their ability to
pay their bills when they need to pay their bills, the ability to make
sure that they can harvest their crop.   
   
If they can’t harvest the crop or they don’t get the marketing
assistance loan, then it’s — they’re in a situation where they — they
don’t profit.  And if they don’t profit, they risk losing the farm.   
   
So, it creates a tremendous amount of stress.  For what reason?  There’s
no reason for this shutdown.  At the end of the day, we had a deal — a
deal that the Senate passed with a majority of senators, a deal that
passed the House with a majority of not just Democrats but also
Republicans voting for it.  A deal is a deal.   
   
And, you know, to me, there’s no reason for us to be even having this
conversation.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Weijia.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Over the weekend, the
President mentioned that food safety was also at stake.  So, can you
give us some examples of how, during previous shutdowns, the absence of
food and environmental inspections impacted public health?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, I think you would want to visit with the folks
at FDA.  You need to understand that our food safety responsibilities
are divided.  The USDA has responsibility for meat, poultry, and
processed eggs.  FDA has responsibility for everything else.   
   
I can tell you that in terms of meat, poultry, and processed eggs, we
will continue to have food inspection.  But that may not necessarily be
the case with the FDA.  So, I think you want to talk — talk to the
FDA.  
   
To show you how silly this is: If you order a pepperoni pizza, we’re
guaranteeing the safety of it because there’s meat on that pizza.  If
you order a cheese pizza, you’re looking at FDA.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    So, are not all food inspectors considered essential workers?  Just
ones affiliated with meat and —  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, I can’t speak — I can’t speak to what HHS does
or what FDA does.  That’s why I think you should visit with them.  But
our inspectors will be on- — onsite.   
   
But here’s — here’s where there is a potential problem.  And that is if
there is a situation and circumstance that requires lab analysis — well,
now, that’s a different story.   
   
So, you know, that may impact and affect our ability to detect animal
diseases as quickly as we need to, which, in turn, could affect the
supply of food.   
   
So, it’s complicated, but our food inspectors will be on the job.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible.)  
   
Q    On the potential 50,000 furloughed workers, do you know where those
workers — what programs those would be impacted on?  Do you know who
we’re looking at right now?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  It’s across the board.  It’s every county in the
country.  We have a presence in every county in the country.  So, it’s
going to impact and affect literally every county in the country.   
   
It’s FSA offices.  It’s rural development offices.  It’s NRCS
conservation employees.  It’s some of the Forest Service employees. 
It’s a lot of the researchers and people who work for the Agricultural
Research Service — ARS.   
   
It’s — its administrative staff.  You can have people working on the
job, but if you don’t have the administrative people behind it, the job
doesn’t get done.   
   
It’s incredibly disruptive.  Incredibly disruptive.  
   
Q    And then, on another deadline in Washington, how confident are you
that a new farm bill will be passed by the end of the year?  Or is an
extension more likely?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, I know that — I think that the chair and
ranking members of both committees are working hard to get this done.   
   
I would say this: In order for it to get done, it’s important for them
to understand the importance of using all the tools that would be
available for all of the challenges that they face — not just the farm
bill, but the budget.  When you undercut and underfund the budget as
some are proposing, cutting it by as much as, in some cases, 20, 30
percent, you under- — undermine the ability of any farm bill, regardless
of whether it’s passed or not, to be implemented.   
   
And so, our — our challenge at USDA is to provide technical assistance
and help to get them to — to “yes.”  And that’s what we’re doing.  We’ll
continue to work.   
   
And our hope and belief is that the farm community in rural areas need
certainty and — and consistency.  And we’ll do everything we can to make
sure that this thing gets passed as quickly as it can.  But it’s pretty
tough to do if there is a shutdown.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Niels.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  You can’t do it.   
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  A follow-up on that is: To what extent
would a shutdown affect the ability of your leg affairs folks and — and
maybe negotiations with the Hill on the farm bill?  Could the farm bill
reauthorization be delayed because everyone is — is dealing with the
consequences of a shutdown?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  So, here is how it works.  Some senator or
representative has a great idea about how they might be able to solve
one of the problems they’re trying to solve with farm bir- — bill.  They
call our office for technical assistance.  The phone is not going to get
answered because no one is there.  Why aren’t they there?  Because we’re
in a shutdown.   
   
That’s why it’s so ridiculous for us to even talk about this.  We — we
need to get — the Speaker needs to do his job.  He fought for it.  He —
you know, he — he negotiated for it.  He needs to do the job and get the
job done.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Go ahead, Phil.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Switching gears to a slightly different topic.  Has the
Department of Agriculture seen anything in the purchase of farmland by
Chinese corporations or Chinese nationals that would suggest a threat to
national security or food security?  Or are those concerns that we’ve
increasingly been hearing about — are those overblown?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, I think there is concern, as there was in the
North Dakota circumstance, where the Chinese interest was purchasing a
land near a military installation.  I think there is legitimate concerns
in that space.  And I think that’s one of the reasons why, you know,
we’ve articulated the need, as a department, to be more engaged in the
CFIUS process.   
   
I would also say that I think there is work to be done to give us the
tools to be able to do an even better job of ensuring that we know when
these transactions take place.   
   
It’s complicated.  But every county has their county recorder.  And on
any given day, somebody may walk into that recorder’s office and file a
deed, and there is no way of knowing precisely whether or not that is a
Chinese purchaser.   
   
So, we would — you know, we need to work on how we might be able to
collect the information and be able to analyze that information in a
timely way so that we would determine whether or not a threat exists or
not.   
   
Q    So, it sounds like you’re not confident in the current system as
it’s set up to necessarily monitor?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Well, it’s not that I’m not confident.  It’s that I
think — I think we could be — we could do- — I think we’re confident in
the job we’re doing today, because we are ba- — able to identify
circumstances, as was the case in North Dakota.   
   
I think that — if any — of pe- — if folks are looking for a foolproof
system so that nothing gets through the cracks, then I think there are
ways in which we can be helpful, and — and we can improve that process. 
Being part of CFIUS, I think, is part of it.  Being — being able to
collect information in a way that allows us to go a little bit deeper
and a little quicker would be helpful as well.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re going to wr- — we’re going to wrap it up.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah.  How — so how would the shutdown affect programs that are
used by farmers like crop insurance?  And, you know, as part of the
country is under really extreme drought — drought conditions, do you see
a need for kind of supplemental funding to come in and help folks, you
know, plant their crops?  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK: Well, I think there are certain circumstances where,
notwithstanding the fact that we have a pretty good safety net, that
there are some types of crops that would need a little bit of additional
help.  Florida and Georgia, in particular, I think of two states that —
where there are significant needs and challenges.   
   
Fortunately, the — the shutdown does not impact and affect crop
insurance.  But a failure to — to extend the farm bill or get a farm
bill done could, which is why we don’t want to shut down so they can
work on the farm bill to get it done and we don’t have the disruption to
the WIC program.   
   
The for — firefighters, the for — the farm loans, the home loans — I
could go on.  I could spend all of — and she would probably want me to
do this — (laughter) — to spend all of your time talking about it.   
   
But the point of this is — it’s very simple — there are real impacts. 
There are real impacts to real people on a daily basis when — when
Congress and the House and House Republicans don’t do their job.   
   
And Americans expect — and this is what drives people crazy outside of
Washington: when a deal is not a deal and when the work that you’re
supposed to do doesn’t get done and doesn’t get done on time.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, sir.   
   
SECRETARY VILSACK:  Thank you.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  
   
SECRETARY VILSACK: Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.   
   
Okay.  Just two quick things.  I also wanted to say a note of welcome to
our new employees starting at the White House today: our new deputy
directors of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, Greg Jackson and Rob
Wilcox.  This is all on the heels, as you all know, of this historic
announcement that the President and the Vice President made just on
Friday.  So, we could not be more thrilled to have them on board here
and — and look forward to introducing them to you all very soon as the
Office of Gun Violence Prevention gets up and running.   
   
And one last thing before we opening — open it back up for questions. 
As you all know, today as Jewish communities — Jewish communities in the
United States, Israel, and around the world are observing a sacred
holiday.  So, let me say that the President, the First Lady, and all of
us at the White House are extending our best wishes for an easy fast and
a meaning- — meaningful Yom Kippur.   
   
And with that, Will, you want to kick us off?  
   
Q    Sure.  Thank you.  I have two things.  Why did the White House
choose to have the President take his — his latest COVID booster out of
public view?  Isn’t this a time when, you know, given the promotion of
boosters and how important they are that the public might want to see
the President have one?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, I think you all saw the pr- — the
physician’s memo — his report on Saturday.  So, certainly, if you
haven’t, you should take a look at it.   
   
So, the President got his vaccination.  As you know, he has an
incredibly busy schedule.  He’s got — he got his vaccination as — the
earliest moment that he could.  And that’s what we were able to do —
work — that would work in his schedule.  So that’s what happened last
week.   
   
And certainly, we are — as you just laid out in your question, we are
certainly engaged in a robust campaign.  And it is incredibly important
to us that we encourage the public to get vaccinated.  That has been the
way that we have moved forward when we have moved forward with the — you
know, this comprehensive kind of vaccination program that the President
put forward from the beginning.   
   
And so, you know, we — it doesn’t require a photo op of the President to
— to be — to be doing that — with a presidential photo op, to be more
clear.  So we thought that we needed to get that done, get that on his
schedule.  We did.  And we’re going to — doesn’t stop us for having a
robust engagement with the public to make sure that we get it across —
the importance of folks getting their vaccines — not just the updated
COVID vaccine, but also RSV, and — and also the flu shot.   
   
Q    And the second — second one.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m sorry.   
   
Q    Changing topics.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is the White House working on — with the Senate on — on a clean
CR?  And is there any reason for optimism on that front?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — look, I’m going to be very clear, as I was on
Friday.  As Se- — Secretary Vilsack was very clear just — even before he
walked out of the briefing room, which is: Look, this is something for
House Republic- — House Republicans to get done.  This is a deal that
the President made with — with Republicans back in May.  And a deal is a
deal, as we’ve been saying.  This is something for them to fix.   
   
And so, they have to — they have to get this done — not because of us,
not because — even because of the deal with the President, but because
of the American people.  We just heard the Secretary of — Secretary of
Agriculture lay out what will happen to women and children — 7 million
women and children who are part of the WIC program across the country —
7 million — if this shutdown happens.  
   
And this is indeed a Republican shutdown.  So, they got to get to it. 
They got to fix it.  And they got to stick to the deal that the
President made with them early — earlier in the — in the summer.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  MJ, welcome — welcome back.   
   
Q    Thank you.  It’s good to be back.  I know that you got a number of
questions about Senator Menendez on Friday.  But now that the senator
himself has said that he is not going anywhere and given that President
Biden is the leader of the Democratic Party, does the President believe
that a person who is facing allegations that are as serious as the
allegations confronting the senator that there is any place for somebody
like Senator Menendez in the Democratic Party?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m going to be very clear: This is a serious
matter.  We see this as a serious matter.  I think — and we believe the
senator stepping down from his chairmanship was the right thing to do —
obviously, the right thing to do.  
   
As it relates to anything else, any decision that he has to make, that’s
certainly going to be up to him and the Senate leadership to decide.   
   
But, of course, we see this as a serious matter.  And I’m just going to
leave it there for now.   
   
Q    And just — just quickly on the trip to Detroit tomorrow, what
changed?  Can you give us a sense of what went into the decision for the
President to go stand on the picket line and show that kind of
solidarity with the workers there?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you just laid out, you know, this is something
— well, the President is a union guy.  Right?  You heard him say that
many times.  He is — he is the most pro-union president in modern
times.  That is not something that he’s given him that — himself that
title.  That is something that labor unions have given to him, and he
wears that very proudly.   
   
And, as you all know, the president of the U- — UAW invited him to — to
attend, and he — he accepted.   
   
But, look, this is a president that’s made very, very clear that he
believes that corporate profits should lead to record UAW — a record UAW
contract.   
   
And, you know, before the strike even occurred, he — he made public
announcements about this.  He spoke to the parties on both sides of
this.  He has made it very, very clear that he supports union workers;
he supports the UAW workers.  And tomorrow, what you’re going to see is
— is historic.  Right?  This is going to be a historic visit.   
   
And the President is going to continue to show his support, not just
from the last couple of years, but as he has been in the public eye — as
a senator, as a vice president — his support for — for unions.  And —
and you’ve seen this in the last two years, with his pro-union policies
— making sure that his pro-union policies are indeed pro-workers.   
   
Q    So, should we take from the visit that the President is explicitly
taking the side of the union workers as opposed to the companies?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, he has been very clear.  Right?  He is pro- —
pro-UAW; he is pro-workers.  You know, that is — that is the — that is
the — this president.  Right?  He has said the middle class was built —
the unions built the middle class.  This is something that he said over
and over again.   
   
He’s always been on the side of workers.  He believes that there is an
opportunity here, and he is encouraged and he is pleased by seeing both
sides continue to have that conversation.  It is their negotiation to
make.  Right?  This is why he says he believes in collective
bargaining.  And he believes that this –there could be a win-win
agreement here.  
   
But he’s always going to stand on the side of workers.  Always.  
   
All right, go —  
   
Q    So, just to follow up —  
   
Q    Oh —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, okay.  I’ll come to you after, Joey.  
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Oh, all right.   
   
Q    Did Trump’s decision to visit the UAW workers play into your
decision to go?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Absolutely not.  This is a decision — to visit the
picket line was based off his own desire.  This is what the President
wanted to do to stand — to stand with autoworkers.  That’s what you’re
going to see the President do tomorrow.   
   
And — and he — as you — as you all know, Shawn Fain’s invitation from
last week, he accepted that invitation and was proud — is proud to do
so.   
   
Q    And secondly, does the President endorse the pecif- — specific
terms of the latest proposal by UAW leadership?  Or is there room for
further compromise?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m not going to get into negotiations from here. 
This is for the parties to negotiate.  We’re not going to go — we’re not
going to speak to what’s being put at the table.  
   
What we have said over and over again is that we believe there’s an
opportunity here for a win-win agreement.  We believe with corporate
record — corporations having record — you know, making record, you know,
deals, there should be a — UAW should have a record contract.  And
that’s what the autoworkers deserve.  That’s what workers deserve more
broadly.  
   
Go ahead, Joey.  
   
Q    Yeah, did President Biden reach out to the auto companies bef- — to
notify them that he would be going to join the picket line with UAW?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any readouts of any calls to — that was
been made regarded to this as it’s related to the companies.  
   
As you know, we have made — we have said many times before the he has —
he has spoken to the companies.  He’s spoken to all parties.   
   
As you know, you have — we have — we have two — two members of — Gene
Sperling, a member here of the White House — a White House senior
advisor and also, as you know, the Acting Secretary, Julie Su, have been
in touch — in regular touch with all parties as they are negotiating
this process.   
   
But we are — you know, I don’t have anything to read out, except that
the President was — was pleased to accept the invite that was given to
him, that was provided to him by — by the president of UAW and he is
always going to stand by the side of workers.  
   
Q    And can you provide some more information on the details of the
format of the event?  Is he going to be speaking? Is he going to be —
what exactly will he be doing?  And where in Wayne County, Michigan, is
he going to actually be going?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we don’t have any details — specific details at
this time.  Look, this is going to be a historic — a historic trip
that’s going to underscore the President is the most — indeed — most
pro-union president in history.  And so, that’s what you’re going to
see.  He’s going to be standing — going to join the picket line,
standing in solidarity with the men and women of UAW.  That is important
for the President, he believes, to do.   
   
And as they continue to fight for a fair — a fair share of the value of
— value of — they helped create, if you think about what the — what the
record — record — these corporations, kind of, the — the record profits
that they’ve been able to make, you know, they believe and we believe
that they are owed a fair share of that.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Just to clarify: Since President Biden will be
making this trip, does this mean he supports the 40 percent pay
increase, the 32-hour work week that workers are asking for?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into the details of what’s being
negotiated right now — that on the table with — with — certainly, with
the parties.  
   
What we’re saying is that we support the autoworkers.  That’s what
you’re going to see with the President tomor- — tomorrow.  This is a — a
historic event, a historic trip.  And this continues — continues to show
how, indeed, this President is the most pro-union president in history
and he stands by the side of workers.  This is what you’re going to see
tomorrow.   
   
Q    And, separately, the White House has made it very clear that it’s
on Republicans to avoid the government shutdown, not on the White
House.  But our latest polling shows that a higher percentage of
Americans would actually blame the shutdown on the President and the
Democrats, not on Republicans.  Why do you think that is?  And should
the President be out there speaking more on this issue?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re going to be very clear.  This is — this is —
this will be a Republican shutdown.  Right?  This is extreme House
Republicans who have made it very clear that the chaos that we’re seeing
in the — in the House, they are marching us towards a government
shutdown that shouldn’t be happening.  This shouldn’t be happening.   
   
This is the job of Congress.  One of the basic jobs of Congress is to
keep the government open.   
   
A deal was made.  I mean, I can’t speak to your polling, but what I can
speak is to the facts.  The facts is: A deal is a deal.  It is up to
them to keep the government open.  This is something they can do.  They
know how to fix this.  And it is an extreme — extreme part of the
Republican Party that is holding this — holding this because they want
to ram through extreme policies.  That’s going to hurt the American
people.   
   
So, we’re going to continue to be very clear about this.  We’ve talked
today about the food safety.  You’ve heard me talk about education,
housing, law enforcement, Meals on Wheels, Head Start.  So much more
will be affected by — by — will be affected by this if the shutdown —
this this Republican shutdown happens.   
   
So, we’re going to continue to be very clear about it.  And it is — you
know, it is something that they can fix, they can fix this.   
   
Q    But does it show that the President needs to be messaging more to
the public about this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, the President was very clear early this
summer when he put this deal together — a bipartisan deal — that two
thirds of Republicans voted on.  And that’s what the American people
want to see.  We saw that in the midterms.  Right?  That’s what they
want.  They want to see us continue to work in a bipartisan way.  That’s
what the President did.   
   
Now, we’re going to continue to be very clear: This is a deal that they
all agreed upon not too long ago — just a couple of months ago — and now
they can’t stick to the deal.   
   
So, you know, if we’re going to be asked the question, we’re going to
answer it straightforward.  We’re going to lay out the facts.  But this
is for something for Congress to fix.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re up front today.  
   
Q    Yeah, I am.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    First time in the first seat.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Good to see you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good to see you.  
   
Q    I want to press you a little bit on what you just said.  You said
that the President supports the autoworkers.  Does that mean that the
President is siding with the autoworkers over the auto companies?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What we’re saying is we’re not going to get into
negotiation, right?  This is — when it comes to the negotiation, that is
something for the parties to decide on.  That is something for them to
discuss.   
   
But me saying that the President supports the autoworkers — that’s not
anything new.  When we’re talking about a president who is pro- — the
most pro-union president in history, it is nothing new for the President
to stand by the workers.  That is nothing new for the President to say,
“I’m going to stand by the men and women of UAW, make sure that they get
their fair share, make sure that they get a win-win agreement here.”  
   
We believe this agreement can be a win-win agreement for all.  So — but
we’re not going to get into the — we’re not going to litigate the
specifics of the negotiations.   
   
Q    Following up on that, though, a strike could have potentially huge
impacts for the economy.  According to NBC News polling, 37 percent of
registered voters — just 37 percent approve of the President’s handling
of the economy.  He’s ata 56 percent disapproval — the highest of his
presidency.   
   
And 74 percent of registered voters say they have major or moderate
concerns about the President’s age and mental fitness.  How troubling is
that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Here’s what we’re going to focus on: We’re going to
focus on exactly what you just asked me — right? — with the first
question, which is: How do we — how do we continue to support the
workers?  Right?  We’re not going to get into the litigation of — of the
negotiations here.  But what we’re going to do is continue to show how
much this President is working for American families.   
   
You just heard from Secretary here, who laid out what it means if
there’s a shutdown and why it is so important for Republicans to keep to
their deal.  That’s what we’re going to focus on.   
   
You see the Bidenomics.  I get it.  I get that Americans right now —
they’ve been through a lot, right?  They’ve been through the pandemic —
this global pandemic that we’re coming out of.  They have been through
what we’ve seen because of Rus- — Russia’s war in Ukraine.  And we saw
inflation spike.  We saw — we saw what’s going on with what Americans
are feeling every day.   
   
This is why — this is why this President has been so zeroed in, so
laser-focused on lowering costs for Americans.  And we’ve done that.  
   
And a lot of the — a lot of the policies that the President has put
forward are indeed popular.  I mean, Bidenomics is — has worked so well
that you have Republicans in their own districts, in their own states
taking credit for things that the President pushed forward, policies
that the President has pushed forward, legislation that they didn’t even
vote for, if you think about the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation
Reduction Act.  
   
So, I get — I get the — I get the polling that you’re laying out.  I get
that.  But we — we can’t — we can’t be focused on that.  We also have to
be focused on really speaking directly to the American people.   
   
The next three days, you’re going to see the President go to three
states to do just that.   
   
Q    But 37 percent approve?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I hear you.  I hear you.  But it is — look, our focus
is going to be on — on what we can do to continue to deliver for the
American people.   
   
Polls are polls — right? — they are going to be all over the place. 
They are going to — they’re going to — you know, they don’t tell the
whole story, actually.  And that is just the way a poll is.  
   
What we’re going to focus on is how we can continue to do the job that
the President promised that he would do — is make Americans’ lives a
little bit better, give them that breathing room.   
   
I’m going to go around.  I — I know I always forget to call on this
side, so I’m going to call on you.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  You just said the President doesn’t want to get
into the specifics of the negotiations.  But is he perhaps interfering
in these negotiations by, you know, visiting the picket line tomorrow?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re not going to get into — we never get into — you
know, into the specifics of negotiations — not in public.  We’re not
going to do that.  That is something — and that is something for the
parties to decide on.  When it comes to negotiations, we’ve always been
very clear about that.   
   
They are meeting.  They are negotiating.  And we — we are pleased to see
that.  
   
When it comes to the President going to the picket line, he’s doing it
because he wants to stand in sol- — in solidarity with the workers,
which is something that this President continues to do and has done for
the past several years is stay — stay on the side of workers.   
   
And you see that.  You see that with his policies, and you’ll see that
tomorrow.  
   
Q    And one quick one on COVID.  There are a lot of people who are
struggling to get appointments.  There is confusion about — with
insurance companies.  Is there some sort of concern at the White House
right now that this shift in responsibility to the commercial market
from the federal government has not gone as — as smoothly?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we — so we’re certainly aware of consumers having
experienced unexpected — at least with insurance — coverage, denials at
the point of service.  We’re aware of that.  
   
HHS, as you know, is working with insurance plans and pharmacies to
resolve this quickly.   
   
Look, it’s a top priority for this administration to ensure that
everyone can access this updated vaccine.  And so, HHS is working
through that.  And so, any k- — any specific additional questions about
that, certainly, I would per- — I would refer you to HHS.   
   
But we’re taking this very seriously.  And HHS is working through that —
through that.   
   
Okay, Akayla.  
   
Q    In the back, Karine.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Moody’s warned today that a government shutdown
could have a negative impact on the country’s credit rating.  It’s the
last major credit grader to assign the U.S. a top rating.  Is the
President concerned that the political brinksmanship that we’ve seen
this year is hurting the country’s reputation, specifically on the
economy, on the world stage?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m going to leave all of the economic
analysis to others.  Right?  I’m not going to get into it from here.   
   
But we know that — and I’ve said this already a couple of times — that
what we’re seeing from Republicans in the House, the — especially the
extreme Republicans in the House, what they’re going to do, proten- —
potentially leading us to a shutdown is going to hurt American
people.   
   
And, you know, if you think about it, the 3.5 million jobs that have
been created under this president, the under-4 percent unemployment
rate, I would not understand — we do not understand why they would put
our economy at risk.  That’s what you’re just laying out.  Why would
Republicans in the House put our economy at risk when we have seen the
improvements over the last two years?  
   
So, I’m going to leave the — the ex- — leave it to the experts to speak
about the economy and what that looks like.   
   
But, you know, this is a question for them.  This is something that does
not have to happen.  It does not have to happen.   
   
Q    And a question on student loans.  I know that they’re restarting on
October 1st, potentially the same day that a government shutdown could
start.  Is there any consideration of pushing that date back, or is
there any guidance that you have for borrowers about what they should
expect if workers at the Department of Education won’t be available to
assist them?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  I do want to lay this out.   
   
So, look, when it comes to student loans, it’s obviously a top priority,
especially as we talk about the President’s economic plan and giving
people a little breathing room, especially on their monthly payments.   
   
So, you know, that’s why the President also launched, as you all know,
the most affordable repayment plan ever, which is the SAVE Plan.   
   
So, you know, if — if this happens, if Republicans in — in Congress, you
know, go down this road of shutting down the government, we anticipate
that key activities at Federal Student Aid will continue for a couple of
weeks.  But, however, if it is a prolonged shutdown lasting more than a
few weeks, could substantially disrupt the return to repayment effort
and long-term serving — servicing support for borrowers.   
   
So, the Department of Education will do its best to support borrowers as
they co- — as they return to repayment, as we have been saying for the
past several months.  But an extreme Republican shutdown, if this
occurs, could be disruptive.   
   
And just to — maybe more — I think about more than 28 million federal —
federal student loan borrowers restate \[sic\] payments.  That is what —
restart payments.   
   
So, this is something that does not have to happen.  These are political
games that we see from the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, and it
does not have to happen.  It does not have to happen.   
   
And so, that’s how we foresee this — this moving forward.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I — I wanted to further understand a little bit the
President’s trip tomorrow.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    It seems like by going to stand with workers at a picket line, the
President is literally standing with them and the terms that they’re
seeking in the contract dispute.  But when you’re asked about some of
the specifics of that, you seem to be saying you guys don’t want to get
into the specifics of the dispute.   
   
So, is he not standing with them on the terms with which they’re trying
to negotiate with the —   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, to be very clear: He is standing with them to
make sure that they get a fair share.  That is what he’s standing with
them on.  He is standing with them — and we’ve said this — that — that
they — that we — that they get the record — the record profits mean a
record contract for UAW.  That is why he’s going.  That is what he’s
standing for.   
   
Now, they’re going to negotiate what that looks like for them.  Right? 
That’s what they’re doing right now.  That’s what collective bargaining
is all about.  Right?  They’re going to talk it through what a win-win
agreement looks like.   
   
But what we definitely agree on is that they deserve a fair share. 
Right?  They deserve a fair share of — of the value that they helped
create.  That’s what the President is saying.   
   
But the details — the specifics of what that looks like, what makes both
sides happy or anything in those nego- — at the negotiation table, that
is for them to decide.  That is for them to decide.   
   
Q    But it seems like he’s taking away the past — some past presidents
have been an arbiter between two sides that are in conflict.  It seems
like by going to the picket line, he — he’s not an arbiter between the
two sides.  He’s choosing a side by standing —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But we have said —  
   
Q    — with the union workers.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — we have said over and over again that this is a
president that stands with union workers.  This is —  
   
Q    Right.  That’s why it’s confusing where you’re saying —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  How — there is no —  
   
Q    — like I — we’re not going to —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s not — no, no, no.  
   
Q    — talk about the terms of the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I disagree.  It is not confusing.  What he is saying —
and we’ve been very clear — he stands with union workers.  He stands
with the workers.  He has said and they have said he is the pro- — the
most pro-union president in history.  And that is what he’s doing.  He
is going to stand in solidarity at the picket line with the workers.   
   
Now, they are — they are at the table.  They are at the table trying to
figure out what this agreement is going to look like.  Right?  They are
going to decide the specifics of that agreement.   
   
What the President is saying is — and he always says this.  This is
nothing new.  He always says he stands by union workers, and he is going
to stand with the men and the women of UAW.  That continues to be the
case.   
   
Go ahead, Katie,  
   
Q    So — I’m sor- —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, my goodness.  You’re going to ask the same
question?  
   
Q    But I — I —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to change my answer.   
   
Q    — too am seeking clar- — it’s fine.  I’m going to ask again.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, feel free.   
   
Q    Is he picketing or —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And I’m going to give you the same answer.  
   
Q    — is he visiting the picket line?  Is he standing with them?  Is he
walking in the picket line?  What —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s going to join — he’s going to join the picket
line.  
   
Q    So, does the White House see any political risk in — in —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What the President —  
   
Q    — doing this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What the President understands is that he is — wants
to be on the side and is and has been on the side of workers.  That is
something that he has said over and over and over again.  
   
Q    So, when he asked earlier that — if he’s siding with the workers
over the companies, he is indeed siding —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He is — he is —  
   
Q    — with the workers?  Yes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — standing with the auto workers.  He is standing with
the workers.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   We are not involved in negotiations.  That is
something for them to decide: what is going to work for the parties that
are involved.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But he is standing with the auto workers.  That’s what
the President is doing.  He got the invite from the UAW president.  He
accepted.  And he’s going to go and do — and do what he has said that he
does all the time — right? — which is stand with union — stand with
union workers.  And what you’re going to see is going to be standing
with UAW — men and women of the UAW.  And that is important to the
President.   
   
MS. DALTON:  Fifteen minutes.  
   
Q    Karine.  
   
Q    Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, I just got to go around, guys.  I got to go
around.   
   
Q    Karine, can I follow on that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, go ahead.   
   
Q    You had said —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m trying to call on people I haven’t called on
yet.  
   
Q    You had said earlier that the President had spoken to the
companies.  Presumably, you meant the automakers.  We know he had spoken
to them before his trip to India earlier this month.  Has he had any
more recent —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any —  
   
Q    — conversations with them?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any calls to read out.   
   
Q    Okay.  And —   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any calls to read out.   
   
Q    And have any of the auto companies asked to meet with him tomorrow
when he’s in Michigan?  Would he consider that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just don’t have any — any more details on what the
trip is going to look like tomorrow.  
   
Go ahead, Danny.  
   
Q    Yeah.  On the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, you see thousands of
refugees are leaving the territory at the moment.  How concerned is — is
the President about this?  And Armenia has said that this amounts to
“ethnic cleansing.”  Is that a term that the President would agree
with?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we certainly are — are watching closely the
reports.  This is something that I would have to refer you to my NSC
colleagues to give you any update on.   
   
Certainly, it is concerning.  But this is something that they’re keeping
an eye on closer — closer than we are here.  And so, they’ll — they’ll
give you an update specifically.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, go ahead.  
   
Q    My turn?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I just wanted to ask you about the situation of
the Southwest border.  As we know, some cities are claiming that they
are at breaking point with regards to the humanitarian crisis that is
ongoing down there.  I know that there was an agreement signed with
Mexico over the weekend.  I wonder if the administration is in touch
with the cities down on the border and if there’s any other actions that
the White House is considering to address the issue that is taking place
down at the border.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m going to have to point — point you to the
readout from CBP.  As you just mentioned, they — they issued a readout
of their conversation with the Mexican government over the weekend, so —
so — regarding their engagement.  So, certainly would have you reach out
to them, and they could lay out specifically how that — that engagement
went.  And also refer you to the readouts more specifically as well.  
   
Q    Karine.  
   
Q    Can I have a follow-up on that, Karine?  
   
MS. DALTON:  We’ve got to pre-set for —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  So, in a recent meeting with the prime minister of
South Korea, Xi Jinping expressed his support for resuming annual
trilateral summits with China, Japan, and South Korea.  I was just
wondering if the administration has any comment on that development.   
   
And then, additionally, recently, the Japanese prime minister replaced
both foreign and defense ministers.  Is there any concern that this
could impact the U.S.-ROK-Japan partnership, especially given that it’s
happening so soon after the trilateral summit —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I would —  
   
Q    — at Camp David?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, to your first — to your first question, I
certainly would refer you to Japan and ROK for specifics of their plan
for the trilateral cooperation with the PRC, so that is something that I
would refer you to.   
   
But we here — certainly, the United States respects the ability of
nations to make sovereign decisions in the best interest of their
people, just as the United States takes steps to responsibly manage our
relationship with the PRC and with our — and also with our other
partners and allies.   
   
What was your second question?  This is about the — Japan?  
   
Q    Yes, recently, the Japanese prime minister replaced both his
foreign defense ministers.  I was wondering if there was any concern
about the — how that could impact the U.S.-ROK-Japan partnership.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, first, I would refer you to the government of
Japan on any personnel decisions that they’ve made.   
   
Look, you saw the relationship continue to deepen and grow just a couple
of weeks ago now at Camp David, when there was a trilateral summit,
which was historic and truly important.  And so, we’re going to continue
to work closely with our Japanese counterparts to han- — enhance that
relationship.  So, that certainly has not changed.   
   
MS. DALTON:  We have to go.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sorry, we have to go, guys.   
   
MS. DALTON:  Got to pre-set.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, I’ll take — go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks.   
   
Has President Biden had any engagement with House Republicans about the
shutdown?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any engagements to read out to you.  As I
said last week, we have OMB Director Shalanda Young, who has been in
regular touch with members in Congress.  We have had our Legislative
Affairs Office, who has been in regular touch.  I don’t have anything to
read out on any — any conversation that the President has had
specifically on this.   
   
But as you know, and we say this often, is the President is in regular
contact with congressional members on a — on an array of issues.   
   
But, again, when it comes to this — when it comes to this, this is
something that they can fix.  I mean, when we talk about a Republican
shutdown risking the vital nutrition assistance for nearly 7 million
mothers and young children who count on WIC, prevent farmers from being
able to access new loans, and delay housing loans for rural families.  I
mean, that is something that the Secretary laid out very well and in
detail.  And he’s been there bef- — been at — been in this place before
back in 2013, where he had the same — the same role in the O- —
Obama-Biden administration.   
   
This would be devastating for American families.  This does not have to
happen.  A deal is a deal.  This is a deal that two thirds of
Republicans voted on, and they should move forward.  They can fix
this.   
   
Q    But as you mentioned, the President helped broker this deal, so why
doesn’t he do something to help —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Because he already brokered the deal.  
   
Q    — put it into place?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But he already brokered the deal.  He already brokered
the deal.   
   
They voted on it.  He brokered the deal.  They took it back — McCarthy
took it back to the House; they voted on it.  It went to the Senate;
they voted on it.  Two thirds of Republicans voted on it.  It’s on —
it’s — this is for them.  This is for them to fix.  It was already voted
on.   
   
So, a deal is a deal.  They have to stick to it.   
   
And also, it is one of their number one jobs.  Number one jobs.  One of
their top jobs — right? — is to keep the government open so that
American families don’t have to suffer.   
   
All right, guys.  Thank you.
