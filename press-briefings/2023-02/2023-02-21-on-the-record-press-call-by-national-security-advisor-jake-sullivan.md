Via Teleconference

10:23 A.M. CET  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Good morning, everyone.  This is Sean Savett from the
National Security Council.  Thank you, everyone, for joining this
on-the-record press call today with National Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan, to preview the day and the President’s speech tonight.   
   
Jake, I’ll turn it over to you for some opening remarks.  After that,
we’ll do some moderated Q&A.  And we’ll just ask everyone when you do
have a question to please raise your hand, and we’ll use — we’ll call
you using the “raise hand” on the Zoom function.   
   
Jake, over to you.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Good morning, everyone, here in Warsaw.  This is an
important trip at an important moment as we approach the one-year
anniversary of the invasion by Russia of Ukraine.   
   
And it’s important, of course, for Ukraine and for the Ukrainian people,
but it’s also important for the American people and for the wider world
because what is at stake here is more than just the success and survival
of the nation of Ukraine, but the rules-based international order,
fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the
fundamental values of independence, democracy, freedom that matters so
much to everyday American people.   
   
So, from the President’s perspective, it was really important for him to
come to Europe at this time to be able to stand and speak to these
values, to speak to the stakes, to speak to the moment.  And that’s what
he’s going to do in his speech at the Warsaw Royal Palace later this
evening.   
   
He, of course, was in Kyiv yesterday.  And his fundamental purpose for
going to Kyiv was to be able to stand side by side with President
Zelenskyy and send a powerful and unmistakable message that the United
States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes and also to show
the world that Ukraine is succeeding in defending itself against Russian
aggression and that Russia is failing in an effort to conquer and
destroy Ukraine.   
   
He had the opportunity yesterday, as I said on the press call, to have
an in-depth, detailed conversation with President Zelenskyy on every
facet of the conflict.  And there will be a lot of follow-up work coming
out of that, also in close consultation with our allies and partners.   
   
And speaking of our allies, the other thing that President Biden will
have the opportunity to do today is meet with President Duda and his
team to talk about the continuing work of this larger coalition of
nations that are seeking to support Ukraine with military assistance,
economic assistance, humanitarian assistance, and other forms of
support.   
   
And Poland, of course, has been a critical player in that.  It has been
critical to hosting very large numbers of Ukrainian refugees, it has
been a critical logistics hub for military assistance going into
Ukraine, and it has been a strong voice as part of a unified Western
effort to try to ensure that there are no cracks — that the West and the
larger coalition of nations holds together strongly, again, for as long
as it takes.  
   
So, the President and President Duda will have the opportunity to
discuss, as he did with President Zelenskyy, every facet of the war in
Ukraine.   
   
There are other issues, of course, that he will have the opportunity to
talk to his Polish counterpart about.  There is the larger question of
NATO force posture and the continuing commitment of the United States to
play a critical role in the defense of the eastern flank allies,
including Poland.   
   
And we have taken a number of steps over the course of the past year to
bolster our defense posture here in Poland and along the eastern flank
as part of a larger effort by NATO coming out of the Madrid Summit last
year to strengthen defense and deterrence all along the eastern
flank.   
   
So, the President will have the opportunity to reinforce his fundamental
message from last year that he intends to defend every inch of NATO
territory and that he will do so not just with rhetoric but with the
kinds of actions where we put in place necessary capabilities.   
   
He will also talk about energy issues, including civil nuclear
cooperation.  And, of course, he will speak to issues he speaks to
everywhere he goes: core democratic values, including independent media
and an independent judiciary.   
   
So, that’s his intent with respect to the engagement with President
Duda.   
   
As for the speech tonight, the speech is something he has wanted to do
now for some time, building on the remarks that he gave here in Poland
nearly one year ago.   
   
What he wants to have the opportunity to do is set this — Russia’s war
on Ukraine into a larger context — a context that reminds people where
we were on the eve of this war a year ago, when there were fundamental
questions being asked — being asked of the international order, being
asked of the United States, being asked of the NATO Alliance.  And one
year later, he believes that we have answered those questions about our
unity and resolve, about our commitment to fundamental principles, and
about our willingness to step up — (audio disruption) —  
   
(Addressing the participants on the call.)  If everyone can just go on
mute, that would be great.  
   
So, his remarks will speak specifically to the conflict in Ukraine. 
But, of course, they will also speak to the larger contest at stake
between those aggressors who are trying to destroy fundamental
principles and those democracies who are pulling together to try to
uphold it.   
   
And I think you will hear in this speech a vintage Joe Biden.  The
President has believed passionately in the themes he will discuss
tonight for decades.  And he is applying them at what you have all heard
him described as “an inflection point” today, where the next few years
are going to determine the course of the next few decades.  And those
are the stakes that he’s going to set out in the remarks tonight.   
   
So, I apologize for going on so long.  I think it’s a big moment, coming
off the trip to Kyiv, speaking to the people of Europe and speaking to
the people of the world about America’s commitments, about America’s
staying power, and about America’s follow-through on the values and
principles that we hold so dear and that we are prepared to act upon in
the ways that we have over the course of the past year and that we are
committed to doing in the months and years ahead.   
   
So, let me stop there.  And I’d be happy to take your questions.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Thank you so much, Jake.  And, again, we’d ask everyone, if
you have question, please use the “raise your hand” feature on the
Zoom.   
   
First, we’ll go to Michael Shear of the New York Times.  
   
Q    Great.  Hey, Jake.  Thank you very much for doing this.  Obviously,
the President’s comments today and the messages that you just laid out
are not going to be delivered in a vacuum.   
   
In fact, as we’re speaking, President Putin is delivering his own speech
today.  You know, among the things he’s described is this this sort of
typical rant that he has done in the past about how those to blame in
the war in Ukraine are actually the West, not Russia, et cetera, et
cetera.   
   
I wonder if you could give an early reaction to what you guys have heard
him say so far and let us know how much of the speech that the President
will give later this afternoon is going to be, kind of, directly taking
— taking aim at President Putin.  I mean, how much will he describe this
as a contest between the West and — the U.S. and Putin?  Or will it be
broader than that in — in tone and in detail?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  It will be broader in tone and in detail.  We did not set
the speech up as some kind of head-to-head.  This is not a rhetorical
contest with anyone else.  This is an affirmative statement of values, a
vision for what the world we’re both trying to build and defend should
look like.  And I think that’s what you will hear in the remarks
tonight.   
   
I’m not going to react to the speech before it finishes.  You know, I’ll
wait until we have the opportunity to hear the whole thing and digest
it.   
   
I will say that President Putin has been making the argument for some
time that it is the West and not Russia to blame for the war in
Ukraine.   
   
Well, there’s a simple way to test that proposition.  If Russia stops
fighting the war in Ukraine and goes home, the war ends.  If Ukraine
stops fighting and the United States and the coalition stops helping
them fight, Ukraine disappears from the map.  So, I think that kind of
tells you everything you need to know about who’s responsible for this
war.   
   
This was a war of choice.  Putin chose to fight it.  He could have
chosen not to.  And he can choose even now to end it, to go home.  And
nobody is attacking Russia.  There’s a kind of absurdity in the notion
that Russia was under some form of military threat from Ukraine or
anyone else.   
   
And that’s an argument the President has made for some time.  And he
will very directly make that point in the speech tonight not as a
rebuttal to Putin’s speech today, but rather to lay to rest an argument
that Russia has been making for some time.  And the President will take
that argument on quite directly and emphatically in the way that I just
laid out.   
   
And so, we’ll see, you know, obviously, what Putin says today and, you
know, as he as he continues his remarks.  But the President’s remarks
today are not — you know, are about something larger.   
   
And the — we selected this time, we selected this date not because
President Putin was speaking today — in fact, he moved up the date of
his normal state of the union to put it in this timeframe — but rather
because of the fact that we’re approaching the one-year anniversary of
the conflict and the President wanted to use this opportunity to set a
larger frame.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Thank you.  Next, we’ll go to Peter Nicholas from NBC
News.  
   
Q    Hi, can you hear me?  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Got you, Peter.  
   
Q    Oh, thanks very much.  Thank you, Jake, for doing this.  I just
wanted to follow up by mentioning Kamala Harris’s speech at the Munich
Security Conference where she said that Russia has committed crimes
against humanity and Putin will be held to account.  Do you expect the
President will elaborate on those ideas in his speech today?  Thank
you.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  That was the finding of the U.S. government through a
process.  That was not just a rhetorical flourish.  It was an actual
substantive determination about the actions of the Russian Federation in
Ukraine and the ways in which they have conducted this war: brutally,
with attacks on civilians, with efforts to destroy incidents of the
Ukrainian culture, and with wanton effort to harm women, children,
noncombatants.   
   
So, the State Department ran a process.  The U.S. government reached the
determination that the Russian Federation has committed crimes against
humanity.  Vice President Harris laid that out in the speech in Munich. 
And President Biden will, of course, reiterate the ways in which Russia
has brutally transgressed the basic principles and norms that govern
fundamental — fundamentally decent international behavior.   
   
It will not be a major focus of the speech — the question of crimes
against humanity — but the brutality of Russia’s war effort and the need
for accountability will be a part of it.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Next, we’ll go to Asma Khalid from NPR.   
   
Q    Hey.  Thanks, Jake, for doing this.  You mentioned earlier that the
President intends to build on the remarks from last year.  He believes
that, one year later, many of those questions have been answered.  Will
there be an appeal to the future and looking ahead, or is this largely
going to be a speech that talks about questions that were raised last
year being answered?   
   
And if there are appeals to the future, can you help us just get some
guidance on what those might be?

MR. SULLIVAN:  The speech, as I said before, sets out an affirmative
vision of a world in which the fundamental principles of sovereignty,
territorial integrity, independence, democracy are upheld.  And the
speech will fundamentally make the case that democracies, as he said in
the State of the Union, are growing stronger and more capable of helping
shape a world in which freedom has a greater chance to breathe.

And so, you will definitely hear that in the speech.  He is not going to
— I’m not sure if this is what you were getting at with your question. 
He is not going to sketch out in any kind of specifics a vision of a
diplomatic end to the war, not because we don’t believe that the war
should end on just terms according to the principles of the U.N.
Charter, but rather because, as he said many times, “nothing about
Ukraine without Ukraine,” and the United States is not going to dictate
those terms.

So you won’t hear from him some kind of specific set of proposals or
roadmap or blueprint.  But you will hear him appeal to the — those basic
principles as being the way in which things should proceed from here and
how we should, you know, not just continue to support Ukraine at this
moment in this time, but also how we should try to build a more
sustainable, durable order in which the values and principles that, you
know, we are trying to defend are ultimately upheld.

So, I think you will hear larger themes in the speech, not just narrow
descriptions of, you know, the actions and activities around our support
for Ukraine or the conduct of this war.

MR. SAVETT:  Thank you.  Next, we’ll go to Kevin Liptak from CNN.

Q    Hey, thanks.  First, just quickly, do you know if President Biden
is watching Putin’s speech?   
   
And then secondly, do you have any update on the warnings that you’ve
been giving lately about China potentially providing lethal aid to
Russia?  And do you expect President Biden to mention China at all in
this speech in the context of the Ukraine war?

MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t have any updates this morning.  Obviously,
Secretary Blinken and others have spoken to it.  And, you know, we’ve
had the opportunity to engage directly with the PRC and to consult with
our allies and partners on that issue, and we’ll continue to do so day
by day.  It’s an important issue and one that we’re focused on, but I
don’t have anything to add this morning.

It will not be a major feature of the speech tonight.  I don’t think the
question of PRC support is actually in the remarks at this point, though
I’m hesitant to say whether it will be there or won’t be there because,
as you all know, you know, until the President delivers his remarks,
they can always be subject to his edits and amendments.

And then, on whether or not he’s watching Putin’s speech right now, I
actually am not with him, so I don’t know.  I don’t believe he is, but I
can’t say for sure.

MR. SAVETT:  Thank you.  And for our final question, we’ll do Patsy from
Voice of America.

Q    Hi, thank you for doing this.  I have a really quick question,
Jake.  When you said yesterday that you called Ru- — well, not you, but
the U.S. called Russia about the Kyiv trip for deconfliction purposes,
can you just clarify what that means?  Because obviously, the Russians
are spinning it as them providing a security guarantee for the
President’s visit.  So, if you can clarify that.  Thank you.

MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m sorry, I didn’t see that, Patsy.  The Russians are
saying they provided a security guarantee for the President’s visit?

Q    That’s correct.  Yes.

MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah, they — they did not respond, other than to
acknowledge receipt of the notification.  So, there was no exchange.  It
was mere notification and acknowledgement of receipt.

Q    Okay, and when you say “deconfliction” —

MR. SULLIVAN:  No guarantees given and cer- —

Q    I’m sorry, Jake.  I didn’t mean to cut you off.  When you — when
you say “deconfliction purposes,” if you can just clarify that from the
U.S. side?

MR. SULLIVAN:  When we have a significant movement like this that also
involves a security package, you know, we take the normal steps to
indicate what we are doing, why we are doing it, with what parameters,
on what timeta- — what general timetable.   
   
And we chose to do that with the Russians so that they would understand
what they would be seeing and what President Biden would be doing. 
Simple as that.  Just to let them know he would be there in this time
period and the means by which he was traveling and that he would be out
on this timetable, the means by which he was traveling out.   
   
We conveyed that information.  They acknowledged receipt.  End of story.

Q    Thank you.

MR. SAVETT:  Great.  Thank you so much, Jake.  And that’s all the
questions we have time for.  We really appreciate everyone joining us on
short notice.  And, Jake, thank you for taking the time.  We’ll talk to
everyone soon.
