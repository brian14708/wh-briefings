Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Virginia Beach, Virginia

1:37 P.M. EST

MS. DALTON:  Good morning — afternoon, actually.  As you all know, the
President is traveling to Virginia Beach today to lay out the stakes of
efforts by MAGA Republicans in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care
Act and cut Medicaid.  
   
Virtually every Republican budget in the last decade has tried to repeal
the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid, and it’s important to remember
what that means.  That agenda would raise healthcare costs for seniors,
working families, and Americans with pre-existing conditions, and cause
millions of people to lose their coverage.

It means more than 100 million people with pre-existing health
conditions could lose critical protections, that tens of millions of
people could see their prescription drug coverage scaled back.  Forty
million people’s healthcare insurance coverage would be at risk,
including a million Virginians.  That’s one in eight people in — across
the commonwealth. 

And over 7 million seniors and people with disabilities could receive
worse home care and nursing care.  Millions of people could lose access
to substance use treatment or mental health care.  And over 500 rural
hospitals would be at risk for closure.  
   
That is what Republicans are calling for by putting the ACA and Medicaid
on the chopping block.  And today, the President will call them out for
that.  
   
We also have some late breaking news.  Exciting news.  Today, the
President Bi- — today, the President announced his intent to nominate
Julie Su to serve as Secretary of the Department of Labor.  
   
Julie is a tested and experienced leader who will continue to build a
stronger, more resilient, and more inclusive economy that pres- —
provides Americans a fair return for their work and an equal chance to
get ahead.  
   
Julie has spent her entire life fighting to make sure that everyone has
a fair shot, that no community is overlooked, and that no worker is left
behind.  
   
Over several decades, Julie led the largest state labor department in
the nation, cracked down on wage theft, fought to protect trafficked
workers, increased the minimum wage, created good-paying, high-quality
jobs, and established and enforced workplace safety standards.  
   
Julie is a champion for workers, and she has been a critical partner to
Secretary Wals- — Walsh since the early days of this administration.  
   
She helped avert a national rail shutdown, improved access to good jobs
free from discrimination through the Good Jobs Initiative, and is
ensuring that the jobs we create in critical sectors like semiconductor
manufacturing, broadband, and healthcare are good-paying, stable,
accessible jobs for all.  
   
We urge the Senate to take up her nomination quickly so that we can
finish the job for America’s workers.

And with that, I will take your questions.

Q    Okay.  I have a question about TikTok.  So, I wondered if the
President is encouraging Americans to follow the government’s lead and
take TikTok off the phones.

Could you hear me?

MS. DALTON:  So, we’ve been clear about our concerns about apps like
TikTok.  As you know, there’s a CFIUS review that’s ongoing.

The Biden administration is focused on the challenge of certain
countries, including China, seeking to leverage digital technologies and
Americans’ data in ways that present unacceptable national security
risks.  That’s why we’re taking every step we can within the executive
branch authority, including enacting the first-ever presidential
directive defining additional national security factors for CFIUS to
consider in line with this administration’s national security priorities
like protecting Americans’ sensitive data.

And last year, President Biden put forward an executive order to protect
Americans’ sensitive data from collec- — collection and utilization.

So, we’ll continue to look at other actions that we can take, and
include — that includes how to work with Congress on this issue further.

Q    On student loans, I know that you know that arguments started today
in the Supreme Court.  Many legal experts have said, basically, that if
this plan was released earlier, that it would have a stronger argument
in the courts.  I guess, could you explain why the administration didn’t
release it earlier, even though Biden promised on the campaign trail for
debt cancellation?

MS. DALTON:  Well, look, the bottom line is: We’re confident in our
legal authority, which is why we’ve taken the case all the way to the
Supreme Court on behalf of 40 million Americans who need a little bit
more breathing room, who need an opportunity to get back on their feet
coming out of this pandemic and preparing to restart their loan
payments.

So, you know, we are focused on — on — on that.  We’re focused on and
we’re confident in our legal auth- — authority to carry out this
program, which is why we rolled it out in the first place.  And I think
you heard the administration’s lawyers making a very strong case in the
court today.

Q    But why not release it earlier when we were still in the throes of
the pandemic?

MS. DALTON:  Well, look, I think what’s important to remember is that
the emergency ending doesn’t change the legal justification for the
program.  There was a national emergency.  Millions of borrowers were
nega- — negatively impacted by the pandemic and faced the risk of
default on their student loans due to that emergency.

And, you know, our position is: Congress gave the Secretary of Education
the authority to take steps to prevent that harm, and he’s doing that.

Q    Olivia, should there be — should there be a federal ban on TikTok?

MS. DALTON:  I don’t have anything in addition to what I just shared
with your colleague.

Q    But would the President suppo- — when you say they’re looking at
other actions, what might that entail?

MS. DALTON:  I’m not going to get ahead of anything.  As I just laid
out, you know, we have serious concerns with apps like TikTok.  There’s
a CFIUS review underway.  And we’re looking at what else we might be
able to do, including working with Congress.  
   
Q    Olivia, on the Energy Department analysis about the Wuhan lab leak
theory, is the White House concerned about the leak, meaning the leak of
the information?  And are you doing anything to find out where it came
from?  Because it exposes some disconnect in the administration.  
   
MS. DALTON:  I’d refer you to the White House Counsel’s Office on that. 
I don’t have anything additional to share on this at this time.   
   
I think, as you heard from my colleagues over the last couple of days,
the President has directed the intelligence community to get to — to get
to the bottom of the COVID-19 origins.  He believes it’s critically
important information that Americans need and that we need in order to
prevent future pandemics and ensure we’re all better prepared.  
   
That said, the intelligence community has not come to a consensus, and
he has directed, you know, the intelligence community to continue to
make any additional insights we pick up along the way available to
Congress and the American public.  
   
Q    Has he issued any new direction in the wake of this reports of
Energy?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t have anything new to share on that today.  
   
Q    Olivia, is the President concerned that Senator Fetterman’s health
and absence away from the Hill will complicate Julie Su’s confirmation
process?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, I think, you know, with respect to Senator Fetter- —
Senator Fetterman, I don’t have anything additional to read out in — in
the, you know — in the — you know, in — with respect to conversations
with the senator or her — or his team.   
   
But I would want to reiterate that as the President has — and First Lady
have previously shared, they’re thinking about John, Giselle, and the
entire Fet- — Fetterman family at this moment.   
   
Millions of Americans go untreated with depression every day.  Senator
Fetterman did the right and brave thing by getting the help he needs.  
   
And we’re grateful to Senator Fetterman for leading by example and
taking the time he needs to get healthy.   
   
Q    Just clarifying, he hasn’t spoken to Senator Fetterman since he
checked into Walter Reed?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t have anything to read out for you at this time?  
   
Q    Or Giselle?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I haven’t — I don’t have any conversations to read out to
you at this time.   
   
Q    On the student loans: With the Court at 6-3 conservative bent, are
there contingency plans in place or anything, given the fact that, you
know, it could expire as early as June?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, we’re focused on plan A because we’re confident in
our legal authority to carry out this program, which is why, again, we
initiated it in the first place.  So I think you heard strong arguments
from administration lawyers today in court about our legal authority to
execute the program.  And we’re focused on that.   
   
Q    But if the President is committed to seeing debt cancellation, why
not even consider whether the Supreme Court will shut this down?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Because we’re confident in our legal arguments.  And we’re
really focused on making those arguments in a strong way at the court,
which is exactly what administration lawyers did today.  
   
Q    Is the President aware of these reports that Rupert Murdoch showed
campaign — Biden campaign ads to the Trump White House?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, here’s what I’d say about that: Regardless of any new
revelations about, you know, bias or behavior in the 2020 campaign,
President Biden won the most American — the most votes of any candidate
in American history because he had the vision, message, and record that
put the interests of hardworking Americans first.   
   
And these kinds of revelations aren’t particularly surprising to anyone
who has tuned into Fox News lately.   
   
Q    Does it raise concerns about the upcoming election — the
presidential election, given if — you know, what happened in 2020?  
   
MS. DALTON:  You know, I’m just going to be, out of an abundance of
cautious — caution, very careful about commenting on elections going
forward due to the Hatch Act.   
   
Q    Olivia, two questions.  One, has the President decided whether he’s
going to accept a bill that would overturn the D.C. Council’s action on
the criminal code in the city?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Just a couple of things on that.  I think you might be
aware we issued a statement of administration policy on that.  So I’d
reference — refer you to look at that statement — SAP.   
   
But broadly speaking, the President has been clear that we have to do
more to reduce crime and save lives.  And he has outlined how he
anticipates we should do so in his Safer America plan.   
   
Q    All right.  Second question.  Is there any concern here?  I mean,
the President is going to rail against Republicans today for their plans
that they’ve advocated in the past.  Is there any likelihood that
Senator Schumer would see to it that these bills wind up on the
President’s desk?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Sorry, I didn’t hear the end of that.  
   
Q    Right.  So is there a concern here that somehow Senator Schumer is
going to put these bills on the President’s desk?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I’m sorry, which bills?  
   
Q    The bills the President is going to be railing against today — the
Republican plans.  I mean, there’s no chance they’re going to become a
bill that would wind up passing the Senate, right?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I’m not sure I’m entirely tracking what you’re saying.   
   
But, look, the President is going to outline his plans to continue, you
know, focusing on bringing down medical costs, protecting and
strengthening programs like Medicare and Medicaid today.   
   
And he’s talked about the fact that when he introduces his budget next
week, you’ll see that it will invest in America, lower healthcare costs,
protect and strengshen \[sic\] — strengthen Social Security and
Medicare, and cut the deficit by more than 2 million — 2 trillion
dollars — “T” with tr- — trillion with a “T” — over the next 10 years. 
And he’ll do all of that by — without, you know, having taxes go up by a
single penny for people making under $400,000.   
   
So, you know, he’ll contrast that with Republicans plans.  You know,
they’ve repeatedly put Medi- — Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act on
the chopping block.  And, you know, call on them to put their plan
forward.  You know, they’ve said that they want to balance the budget. 
They’ve also put forward proposals that would blow up the deficit by $3
trillion.  So how do you square the circle?   
   
And if past is prologue, we anticipate seeing Republicans put forward
the same kinds of policies — slashing Medicaid and the Affordable Health
Care Act — and jeopardizing these critical programs that so many
millions of Americans depend on.  And you’ll hear from the President
about that today.  
   
Q    Any plan — any updated travel to Ohio?  Any plans to travel to
Ohio?  
   
MS. DALTON:  No new news for you there.   
   
But as you know, the President has been engaged from the earliest hours
since the derailment.  You see that Administrator Regan is back there
today.  The President has directed his team to stay on top of this, and
they are.  
   
As of last night, 535 families have received direct outreach from
federal response officials on the ground.  So he’s going to stay on top
of this and make sure that his team is too.  
   
Q    Just quickly, Julie Su has faced some criticism over her handling
of unemployment benefits in California during the pandemic.  How is the
administration prepared to defend her on that?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, when the pandemic hit, red and blue states were
dealing with fragile, outdated technology.  And under Julie’s
leadership, California took important steps to process a historic number
of claims — one in five in the entire nation.  
   
Julie believes that our safety nets must be strengthened.  And during
her time at DOL, she has worked with states to set a big-table national
approach to these issues because they are a national problem.  
   
And I’ll add that, since taking office, President Biden has prioritized
combatting potential fraud relief funds just as he did aggressively and
successfully as Vice President.   
   
The President has worked closely with DOL, empowered inspectors’ general
to strongly monitor programs, secured historic funding in the ARP to
strengthen anti-fraud programs, and appointed a chief pandemic
prosecutor at the DOJ to go after fraudsters and help better safeguard
COVID relief money.  
   
Our administration also provided $2 billion in additional UI
administrative funding to detect and prevent fraud, promote equitable
access, and ensure the timely payment of benefits.  
   
Q    I think I know the answer, but any comment on the McCaul
legislation today, specifically the TikTok legislation that would allow
the President to ban TikTok nationwide?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t have anything additional to my previous comments.  
   
All right, thanks, everybody.
