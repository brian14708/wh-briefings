title: "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and National Security Advisor\
  \ Jake Sullivan En Route Anchorage,\_AK"

Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Anchorage, Alaska

2:01 P.M. EDT

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Good afternoon, everyone.  As you know,
we’re on our way to Anchorage, Alaska.  And then from there, we’ll be
heading to, as you all know, to Hiroshima, Japan, where the President is
going to be meeting with the G7 — will be attending the G7 Summit
Leaders.   
   
And as you can see, to my right I have the National Security Advisor,
Jake Sullivan, to talk about the trip and take any questions that you
may all have.   
   
Go ahead, Jake.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Karine.  And thanks, everybody, for taking a
minute today.  As Karine just said, we’re headed off to the G7.  The
President will start his engagements in Hiroshima with a bilateral
meeting with Prime Minister Kishida, where they will review the really
quite extraordinary progress in the alliance over the course of the past
two years, building on the trip that President Kishida made to
Washington in January.  
   
And in every dimension, whether it’s the military dimension of the
alliance, the economic dimension, the recently concluded agreement on
clean energy, the work we’re doing together on economic security, this
alliance, I think, is at a genuine high-water mark from the point of
view not just of recent years, but recent decades.   
   
And the two leaders will not just rest on their laurels, but press the
teams to take the next step on a series of issues.  And we’ll give you a
readout after the bilat concludes this evening.   
   
Then the main event begins with the President’s engagement with G7
leaders.  And, of course, as usual, it’s a packed schedule and a packed
agenda.   
   
A few things that I would just highlight at the outset, and then happy
to take your questions on any specifics.   
   
First, obviously, the war in Ukraine.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
looms large and will be a significant topic of conversation.  There will
be discussions about the state of play on the battlefield.  There will
be discussions about the state of play on sanctions and the steps that
the G7 will collectively commit to on enforcement in particular, making
sure that we are shutting down evasion networks, closing loopholes in
the sanctions so that the impact is amplified and magnified in the — in
the months ahead.  And the U.S. will have a package of sanctions
associated with a G7 statement that will center on this enforcement
issue.   
   
There will also be talk about reconstruction, about economic and
humanitarian support to Ukraine, and about how to set the appropriate
conditions with progress on the battlefield shaping progress at an
eventual negotiating table if and when Ukraine is prepared to do that
down the road.   
   
Obviously, also high on the agenda will be supply chains and clean
energy.  President von der Leyen was in Washington not too long ago to
agree a very far-reaching joint statement between the United States and
the European Union to align our approaches on clean energy.  And now
that alignment will be taken out to the G7 as a whole.   
   
And we believe that the work we will do together in terms of deployment
of capital to ensure clean energy technologies are built out — and not
just in all of our countries, but globally — and the establishment of
diversified, secure, resilient supply chains from critical minerals, to
batteries, electric vehicles, and more — that you will see a degree of
convergence on this that, from our perspective, can continue the
conversion of the Inflation Reduction Act from a source of friction into
a source of cooperation and strength between the United States and our
G7 partners.   
   
Of course, the common concerns and issues associated with the policies
and practices of the People’s Republic of China will come up.  And I
think you will see, coming out of this summit, alignment and convergence
around the fundamental principles of our approach to the People’s
Republic of China.  
   
Of course, each country has its own distinct relationship and its own
distinct approach, but those relationships and approaches are built on a
common basis.  And I think you will see that reflected in the outcomes
of the G7.   
   
And then, the hosts, Japan, have emphasized the importance of economic
security, of making sure that at the intersection of economics,
technology, and national security, the G7 approaches are carefully
coordinated and aligned.  And you will see outcomes reflected on that as
well.   
   
The President will also co-host an event on the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment, where we will review the progress from
last year, including some announcements of new investments and new
deals, as well as a broader buildout of work with the private sector,
including very senior private-sector representatives coming so that
public investment is mobilizing private investment to drive
infrastructure development in the — in the developing world and in
emerging economies.   
   
There will be a host of other things on the agenda to talk about, from
foreign policy, to economic policy, to climate policy.   
   
One last thing that I would — I would just lift up as a substantial
topic of conversation will be artificial intelligence.   
   
The President and the Vice President and the senior team at the White
House recently hosted the leaders of some of the major AI outfits in the
United States.  He will report out on those discussions and on efforts
by the Biden administration to ensure that we are helping facilitate the
opportunities of AI while managing the risks in a responsible way that
is coordinated closely with the advanced democracies of the world.   
   
So lots of other things will happen — bilateral meetings, trilateral
meetings, and the like — but I think those are the main elements that I
wanted to lay out at the outset.   
   
And, with that, I’d be happy to take your questions.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  Just starting at the 30,000-foot level, as we are
here at 30,000-some-odd feet, you all have been saying for weeks now, in
the lead-up to this trip, that the President can be the President
wherever he is.  So could you speak to the President’s decision-making —
why he felt he had to be in Washington and cut this trip short, giving,
you know, the PRC the display of American, you know, inconsistency and
lack of commitment in the region that it has been looking for and, in
that effect, undercutting the very trip the President set out to plan
when he — when — when this trip was announced a few weeks ago?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first of all, I would just point out that this G7
comes after one of the most effective and impactful strings of American
diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific in an incredibly long time.   
   
In January, you had Prime Minister Kishida in Washington, announcing
absolutely historic investments in Japan’s defense capabilities.   
   
In February and March, you had the announcement of Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement sites in the Philippines.  You had the
announcement of an initiative on critical and emerging technologies with
India.   
   
In April, you had a state visit from Korea that led to a historic
Washington Declaration.  You had AUKUS and the President, with the Prime
Minister of both the UK and Australia, in San Diego, announcing a
first-in-60-years defense partnership on nuclear submarines.   
   
So when you look at all of those pieces coming together, we feel
extremely good about where America’s position is in the Indo-Pacific.   
   
And the fact that he has to postpone a trip to Australia and to Papua
New Guinea, when you lay that up against where we are with respect to
our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, we believe this
notion that somehow the PRC is sitting there happy and comfortable about
the situation is a convenient media narrative going into this trip, but
it does not reflect reality in any way.  
   
I would also say that the President felt it was critical that he be at
the G7 because this particular format is so central to getting alignment
and convergence with key countries — including, by the way, the
countries in the Quad, because both Australia and India will be in
Hiroshima, and he will have the opportunity to engage with them there —
that that was a vital part of the trip.   
   
But that the work that we need to do bilaterally with Australia through
the Quad and with the Pacific Islands is work that can be done at a
later date, whereas the final stretch of negotiations over the debt
limit or over the budget cannot be done at a later date, and that
default can’t be postponed, but the trip can be postponed.   
   
So that’s where the President ultimately made his decision that he would
do the first half of the trip and then postpone the second half of the
trip to a later date.   
   
Q    But specifically, just talking about one missing piece, which is
the meeting with the Pacific Island leaders, the strategic goal for that
meeting was to deter those countries to establish closer security ties
with China.  So how will you achieve that goal now that the leaders are
disappointed that the President is not coming?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I would say that I believe that the leaders of the
Pacific Island have longer memories than the — the question that you
pose implies.   
   
The President hosted them not years ago, but months ago — less than a
year ago at the White House in a first-of-its-kind summit of Pacific
Island leaders at the White House last September, where we set out a
road map for cooperation in the Pacific that we are delivering on — new
embassies, new Peace Corps volunteers, new investments in security, new
investments in humanitarian relief, in climate.  And that’s all flowing
now, just in the months that have followed.   
   
So, from our perspective, we see a demand signal for the United States
only growing among the Pacific Islands.  And we see those leaders eager
to ensure that we continue the momentum that we built.  
   
The stop in PNG would have helped that; there’s no doubt about that. 
But we have a lot of momentum behind this.  And the President will have
a chance in 2023 to be with all of the Pacific Island leaders.  That’s
yet to be scheduled.  But we will get it on the books so that we
continue the progress with — with the Pacific Islands.  
   
Q    Can I, sort of, follow up on both of those questions?  Members of
your own administration have said one of the most important things the
United States can do to counter China is to show up.  And you said these
visits are going to be postponed.  I mean, are there any dates yet, even
date ranges?  Because it seems that the partners of the region would
like to see a firm commitment to actually show up.   
   
So, any — I know this is all very recent.  It’s only happened in the
last 24 hours.  But has there been any talk about dates to reschedule
these engagements?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  You know, I do think there’s a kind of remarkable
extrapolation from not going to two countries on a particular date to
“the United States is not showing up in the region.”  And it’s, I think,
completely belied by the actual delivery, both in presidential time of
visits, of hosting of major leaders in Washington — most recently, just
in the span of a week, the presidents of both the Philippines and the
Republic of Korea.   
   
So, I mean, it’s not for me to give you advice on or to make a pitch to
you on how you report things.  But I think there is a degree of fairly
dramatic over-cranking in saying that pushing off a visit to Australia
and PNG speaks to the fundamentals of American diplomacy at this time.  
   
The President spoke with Prime Minister Albanese yesterday and agreed
that we would get the visit to Australia back on the books — we don’t
have a date for that — but also that he would host him in Washington for
a state visit, which — I don’t know when the last time the Prime
Minister of Australia was hosted for a state visit at the White House,
but I think it’s been quite a while.  
   
Q    And just —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we will see that.  And then within this calendar
year, you will see the President convening the leaders of the Pacific
Islands for a major summit, which will be the second time in 12 months
he has done that, which will be the first time ever in history that has
happened.  So I think a little bit of context is required in the overall
thrust of the — of the — the kind of premise that underlies the — the
last three questions.  
   
Q    You’re — you’re calling part of it a media narrative, but they’re
obviously disappointed.  So — and no doubt you heard some of that
disappointment yesterday from them.  Are you concerned about the
credibility question, or is the context that you’re sharing with us
something that you’ve also shared with them?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I do not believe that the Australians doubt America’s
commitment to the alliance.  And one of the reasons I believe that is
because Prime Minister Albanese and President Biden reinforced their
common commitment to the alliance yesterday.   
   
Another reason I believe that is — like, several weeks ago — you know, a
couple months ago, he stood next to the Prime Minister and announced
that we were going to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia,
which is something that they announced back in September of 2021.  Said,
“In 18 months, we’ll have this done.”  And in 17 months and 30 days, we
deliver on the most consequential, significant security agreement
between the U.S. and Australia since the founding of the alliance, bar
none.  
   
So I think — the nature, I think, of these questions does not reflect
the nature of how Australia is talking to us about what they think about
the alliance.  
   
Q    And Papua New Guinea?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  And as far as Papua New Guinea is concerned, I think
they’re obviously disappointed that the President will not be the
first-ever President of the United States to go to Papua New Guinea. 
They are eager to see him there at some point.  But they are also very
mindful of the fact that this President has done more, in terms of his
personal engagement, with the Pacific Islands than any previous
president.  
   
So one of the things that I think is important to keep in mind is all of
the work we do, month in, month out; the credibility we put in the bank
through our actions, through our summits, through our trips, through the
hosting that President Biden does.   
   
That credibility is for moments when we have to make schedule
adjustments so that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea and the Prime
Minister of Australia can know that Joe Biden is someone who, as
President, has their back and that the United States can and will
deliver for them.   
   
And the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we have delivered for
both the Pacific Islands and for Australia in an — in an unprecedented
way over the course of the past two and a half years.  That puts us in a
position to be able to do this, to make these hard calls in balancing
domestic imperatives for the President to be at home to deliver an
outcome — a positive outcome — and also to sustain these relationships
in a positive way.  
   
And I would just argue that all of the gardening, all of the work of the
last two and a half years has led us to a moment where we have the
capacity to make these adjustments without it coming at a cost to our
credibility in a way that, if we were coming in cold — had not done all
the things we have done — people might — that the countries themselves
might be asking the question more full-throatedly than they are now.  
   
Q    Just to quickly clarify, is the President — when you say he
postpones the Australia portion, when he makes that trip, will he also
go to Papua New Guinea?  Or that part is — is canceled?  Because you
just said he will not be the first President to — to make a visit to the
island.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  No, no.  I just said — oh, I don’t know exactly how I
formulated.  I’m saying he’s — the — the Prime Minister is sorry he
won’t this week be the first President.  I wasn’t saying he won’t go. 
As we put out yesterday, he’s postponed both legs of the trip.  
   
Q    And then just to — again, I want to go back to Zeke’s original
question about the President being able to do his job wherever he is. 
Was there a calculation that the negotiations over the budget, the debt
ceiling, were not going well enough that he had — like, I’m just curious
when it changed from “the President can do his job anywhere,” from just
a few days ago, “There’s no…” — you know, “We’re not going to cancel
this trip,” to yesterday morning canceling the trip.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Without getting into the ins and outs of the
negotiations, which I will leave to others, I would just say
negotiations are dynamic, and you have to both look at the substance on
the table and the days until the deadline and then make a determination
about the allocation of the President’s time and energy.  That’s —
that’s something you have to calculate every single day.   
   
And as we were getting prepared to take off on this trip, he took a
final look at that and made the determination that, in the balance of
his time, he needed to be back in Washington for the closing days before
the deadline to ensure that the United States does not go over a cliff
and to ensure that we get a deal that reflects his values and — and the
best interests of the American people.  
   
Q    Jake, when is the President going to be speaking with or next
meeting with President Xi?  He said earlier — he was asked — whether or
not it’s soon, but “we will be meeting.”  And I was just wondering if
you have anything to share with us about when their next meeting or call
is going to be.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t have anything to announce today, but — I mean,
just —  
   
Q    Is the intention that it will be soon?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  What — you said the President said “whether or not it’s
soon…”?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ll leave the President’s words to stand as they are.  
   
Q    Jake, when we — when we get to Japan, the President is going to the
Peace Memorial Park on Friday.  Some people are — are hoping that he’ll
apologize on behalf of the U.S.  Can we expect the President to issue an
apology?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The President won’t be making a statement at the Peace
Memorial Park.  He’ll be participating with the other G7 leaders in a
wreath-laying and a few other events.  But this is not, from his
perspective, a bilateral moment.  This is him, as one of the G7 leaders,
coming to pay respects and — respects both for history but also respects
to Prime Minister Kishida, who of course is from Hiroshima.  
   
Q    That’s a — Jake, that’s a “no”?  He does not — he does not intend
to issue an apology on behalf of the United States for the use of the
atomic bomb?

MR. SULLIVAN:  No.  
   
Q    Jake, what can we expect from the G7 in terms of broader export
bans to Russia, using Russian frozen assets for Ukraine reconstruction? 
And can we expect any kind of engagement between G7 leaders and
President Zelenskyy?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I — I think we are anticipating some kind of engagement
between G7 leaders and President Zelenskyy.  The parameters of that are
still being worked through, so when we have more to share on that, we
will.   
   
I do not anticipate what has been reported, this kind of comprehensive
export ban.  The main focus of sanctions implementation at the summit
will be about enforcement and evasion. 

And on the question of Russian assets, the G7 will speak to that.  But I
don’t — anything further to share today.  
   
Q    Just to follow up on that, there was some reporting that the G7 and
the EU would ban Russian gas imports on routes where Moscow has cut
supplies.  Are you saying that’s not the case?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I will leave that to the EU.  They’re working that
through.  
   
Q    But the G7 piece of that?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  In terms of the —  
   
Q    A joint announcement.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, like I said, I think that — that’s something the EU
is working, and based on how that proceeds, we’ll see what happens with
the G7.  
   
Q    Jake, on the — on the issue of F-16s in Ukraine, acknowledging that
the G7 is primarily an economic forum, but do you expect that issue to
come up with European allies, given it appears there has been some
softening, perhaps, in European capitals toward those jets going to
Kyiv?  And any update on whether the administration’s thinking has
changed over the past few weeks?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I have no update today on F-16s.  
   
Q    Does the U.S. right now assess that Kyiv has begun its
counteroffensive that it has — that it’s been preparing for for months? 
Is that the current state of the battlefield that you were describing
that they would discuss?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I remember extremely vividly when  
Russia declared the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk
People’s Republic as part of Russian territory, and then tanks rolled
into them.  The questions for 24 hours: “Has the — has the invasion
begun?  Has the invasion begun?”  And this has, like, shades of that. 
“Has the counteroffensive begun?  Has the counteroffensive begun?”  
   
As you know, this is not like a D-Day landing on a beach.  These types
of military operations are more dynamic, more layered, more
multifaceted.   
   
So, “has the counteroffensive begun” is in the eye of the beholder, and
I’m not going to pronounce on it.  I’ll let the Ukrainians characterize
and describe what they’re doing.  I would just say intense military
activity is underway in parts of Ukraine, as we have seen recently from
the fighting around Bakhmut.  
   
Q    Jake, can we go back to your meeting with Wang Yi in Vienna?  A
senior administration official who briefed us afterwards said that you
talked about the spy balloon but called it an “unfortunate incident”
that both sides are eager to move forward from.  Should we take this as
the administration thinking that this is an issue to be put to bed with
no consequences to China?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, it’s not an issue to quote, unquote, “be put to
bed,” because, you know, the reality is that the President took down the
balloon to send a clear message that we will not tolerate violations of
U.S. airspace.  And that position is firm and fixed, and something the
President has communicated quite clearly, both publicly and privately.  
   
We feel that having taken the action and having sent the clear message
about U.S. sovereignty, territorial airspace, territorial integrity,
that we have made our point, and that’s where we are right now.  
   
Q    What’s your take on the Turkish election?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, we’ll see what happens in the runoff.  
   
Q    But do you have any kind of further thoughts in terms of, you know,
Turkey’s position as our NATO Ally, as far as what happens in the
election?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I believe that whoever prevails in the election, whether
it’s the incumbent or whether it’s the challenger, that we will continue
to work with Turkey on a range of issues, whether it’s on Ukraine, on
regional issues in the Middle East, or on NA- — on Turkey’s role, as you
said, as a NATO Ally.  So that — that’s going to continue regardless of
who the leader of Turkey is.   
   
You know, what we want to continue to see is, you know, robust democracy
in Turkey.  And they had a first round, they’ll have a second round, and
we will be prepared to work with whoever is the winner of the
election.  
   
Q    On the issue of Chinese economic coercion, are you anticipating the
language in the communiqué is going to be, sort of, a broad agreement
that that should be countered and — or are there going to be specific
steps recommended for member countries to — to take back included in
that document as well?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m not going to get ahead of that communiqué with
respect to the issue of coercion and economic security.  That’s a theme,
an issue that will be addressed in the communiqué.  But on your specific
question, we’ll share with you the results of the negotiations once the
communiqué is finalized.  
   
Q    Jake, can you tell us: Do you expect the President to hold a
trilateral meeting with South Korea and Japan?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  That is basically a matter of scheduling.  There is
goodwill on all three parts to do it, particularly to recognize the real
progress that has been made between the ROK and Japan with U.S. support,
and the stronger bilateral ties between the ROK and Japan mean a
stronger trilateral relationship.  So if we can find time in what is a
very packed schedule, we will try to hold a trilateral.  But we don’t
have anything to confirm yet because we’re still working through a
number of these scheduling pieces.  
   
Q    You — you had a break-in in your home recently.  Can you tell us
how you experienced that and to what extent your faith in the Secret
Service has been challenged by this incident?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t have any comment on the incident.  But I have
total faith in the Secret Service, and they do a remarkable job every
day as professionals protecting me.  
   
Q   Can I ask you one on the —  
   
Q    Can we go back on the Papua New Guinea —  
   
Q    In the bilat with Kishida, does the President plan to raise the
case of — the Alkonis case with Kishida?   
   
And then separately, with regards to Turkey as well, it looked like
there might have been an extension in the Black Sea deal as we were
wheels up, if you have any comment on that.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah, there has been extension to the Black Sea grain
deal, which is good.  Unfortunately, Russia continues, even in a moment
of extension, to rhetorically hold it hostage in various ways, to
suggest its days are numbered and so forth.  And we just think the world
deserves certainty that this corridor for grain will be there on a
sustainable basis so that the world can continue to be fed — and, in
particular, poor countries.   
   
But it’s a good thing that it’s been extended.  We will continue to
support efforts to ensure that grain gets to global markets.   
   
What was your other question?  
   
Q    Alkonis.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, as you know, the President is very focused on all
cases of Americans being detained overseas.  He takes a personal
interest in them.  He also tries to handle them in a way in which we
balance what we say publicly with what we’re doing privately so that we
maximize the chances of getting people home fast.   
   
So, I don’t have anything to share with you publicly about how we are
approaching that particular case, other than it is very much top of mind
for us.  But I’ll leave it at that, on the record.  
   
Q    Just to confirm, on Papua New Guinea, Jake, what about all the
deals that the President was supposed to sign there — the security,
surveillance, climate change with Papua New Guinea?  
   
And do you have any update on the Lombrum Naval Base that Vice President
Mike Pence announced he was going to hel- — or the U.S. was going to
help revamp?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we will certainly be moving forward with a range of
different agreements with Papua New Guinea.  How and when they get
signed is something that we are still working through with them so that
we can maximize the lift that they give.  But from a substantive
perspective, the rescheduling doesn’t disrupt the work that we’re doing
in all of these areas.   
   
I don’t have an update for you on the military base.  
   
Q    Other —  
   
Q    Well, I guess, just one last one — and maybe Karine can speak to
this too.  Can the President guarantee to our allies this week that the
U.S. will avoid default?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, the President is confident that we can avoid default,
but the reason he’s going back is to make sure that that happens.  So,
what he will tell them is he is going home to do what a President does,
which is uphold the relevant parties together to get to a deal that —
that produces a positive outcome.  And he will express confidence to
them that he will be able to do that.  And I’ll leave it at that.   
   
    Q    Thank you, Jake.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thanks, Jake.  
   
Hi.  
   
Q    Take it away.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  I — take it away.  Whoever — you want to go
—  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — Zeke?  
   
Q    First, on this — can you s- — go further into the President’s
decision-making, why he felt — what specifically he felt he needed to do
in Washington that he couldn’t do by phone or by Zoom?   
   
We’ve been — all been through the last three years where we didn’t do a
whole lot of in-person meetings.  You know, did he — did he think about
inviting Kevin McCarthy to Papua New Guinea or to Sydney so he can carry
out these meetings?  You know, why does he feel the need that he has to
be the one to go back to Washington?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So, I think I’m just going reiterate a little
bit of what Jake Sullivan said, which is: As we get to the X-date we
start looking at the President’s time — right? — the — and really
focusing on the allocation of his time.   
   
And we know the X-date, right?  The Treasury — the Treasury Department
has been very clear that it’s coming up.  And so, the President wanted
to make sure that — that the conversation that he wanted to have clearly
continued.  As you know, the — the staff has — has been meeting every
day.  It’s been productive.  He has — he’s optimistic about it.  You
heard him speak about it directly today in the Roosevelt Room before he
took off.   
   
And the President just wants to make sure that — that this gets done. 
Right?   
   
We — we are a country that is — that pays our debt.  We are not a
deadbeat nation.  And so the President has been very clear about that. 
And he needs and wants Congress to do their job.   
   
And so, again, he’s coming back a little bit earlier, as we get closer
to that X-date, to make sure that Congress does its job.  It’s as simple
as that.   
   
And you all had been asking for weeks and weeks and — not weeks and
weeks and weeks, but for some time, that — asking about his schedule. 
And, you know, the President took a look at it, just as Jake said — he
took a look at it.  He looked at the X-date.  He looked at what needed
to be done.  And the President wanted to come back — come back a little
bit early, postpone those two other stops that he was going to make, to
make sure that Congress actually did its job.   
   
And let’s not forget: There’s also the — the budget negotiation that’s
currently happening — the spending, the appropriations, that regular
order of making sure that we get that done as well.  And that is a
bipartisan agreement, a reasonable agreement, that both Republicans and
Democrats in Congress can vote — can vote on and it can get to the
President’s desk.  
   
Q    Do you have a sense of what the schedule of talks will be over the
next couple days?  Can you give us some detail about how that’s going to
play out?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things — and I believe the President
may have said this.  If not, I’ll share this with all of you.  As you
all know, and this is something that you know already, the staff members
— the senior staff members will be meeting regularly.  They — they met
this — I believe they met earlier today.  And so they’ll have those
meetings today.  They’re going to meet tomorrow.  They’re going to meet
the next couple of days.  So that’ll be really important as we continue
these productive conversations.   
   
As it relates to the President, the President is looking forward to
connecting with the leaders later this week via phone and then also
having a meeting with all of them when he gets back overseas.  
   
Q    On the negotiations themselves, one of the biggest hurdles has been
spending caps and how long they should last.  Republicans want 10 years;
Democrats want 2.  Has there been any progress toward narrowing that
gap?  Have they agreed on how long those should last?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m not going to get into negotiations in
public.  As you know, the teams have been meeting.  We feel that it’s
been productive.   
   
The President met with the four leaders yesterday — again, productive,
headed in the right direction.  He’s optimistic.  As you just heard from
the National Security Advisor, the President is confident, which is
something he said himself.   
   
So, we’re going to let those conversations continue.  The President has
been very clear.  We’ve laid out our — our budget on — on March 9th. 
You saw it.  You’ve heard us talk about it multiple times.   
   
It’s a budget that shows spending — a cut in deficit over 10 years by $3
trillion, adding — really continuing the work that the President has
done the last two years and getting — cutting those wasteful spending as
it relates to Big Pharma, as it relates to oil — Big Oil as well.   
   
And so, we’ve been very clear about how we see the values of this
country moving forward, how we see delivering for American families. 
And those conversations are just going to continue.  
   
Q    I know you said the President would be speaking to leaders later
this week for an update.  But is he going to be updated more frequently
on the staff-level talks?  And what are the — what’s the frequency of
that going to be, and who’s going to be updating him?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I would expect that the President will get — will
get updated regularly, daily, maybe multiple times.  This is critical,
right?  This is important, and getting this done.   
   
It — he’ll be — certainly, co- — be updated by senior advisors, as he
has or — for the past — the past couple of days when they — when these
staffers have been — high-level staffers have been having conversations
with members of Congress staff.  
   
Q    Karine, we know that the President was invited by Prime Minister
Albanese to speak in front of Australian Parliament.  What would have
been his message?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I mean, I — I’m not going to get into the
specifics of what the President’s message would have been.  I think you
heard from the National Security Advisor how important that region is,
how important continuing and building on the Indo- — Indo-Pacific
relationship.  That’s why the Quad — that’s why we — the Quad
partnership was just something — as you know, was something that came
out of this administration.  We want to continue that partnership.   
   
And Jake laid out all of the things that we have done as an
administration, as the President has done these past couple of months,
most recently, to continue building on that relationship.  
   
Not going to get into what the President was going to say.  But clearly,
that region is important for many, many reasons.  And again, that — as
Jake said, that — those two stops have been postponed.  And we’ re
looking forward to — to getting that back on the books.  And the Prime
Minister has been invited for official state visit.   
   
And both — both parties in respective governments are going to be — the
staff — the staff level — on the staff level, talking about when we can
lock that in, which is going to be, I think, incredibly important and
will show how important the — this relationship is to this
administration.   
   
Q    Karine, what’s the White House’s message to progressives who are
worried that the White House is going to give away too much to
Republicans in negotiations, especially on work requirements?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, this is a President that they could be
reassured is fighting for clean energy, is fighting for manufacturing,
is fighting for healthcare.  That’s something that the President has
been very clear that he’s fighting for.   
   
And, look, you know, Republicans have put proposals — a proposal on the
table that increases poverty, that cuts healthcare for millions of
people.  And some of those proposals doesn’t cut much — much money at
all.  Right?  
   
And so, look, the President is going to continue to fight for these —
for these incredibly important things that American families truly need
— healthcare, as I just relayed it, and fighting against increasing
poverty.   
   
So, look, that is something I — that I think progressives in Congress
could take away with and understand the President is fighting for the
American people.  And you see that; you see that in the budget that he
put forward.  
   
Q    What is acceptable, in terms of work requirements, to the
President?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not — I’m just not going to negotiate from
here.  The President spoke — I think he was asked this question twice
today and answered it — and answered it.   
   
And so, I’m just going to leave it to what the President said.  I’m just
not going to get into it.   
   
Q    Karine, on Ukraine, there’s some concern that the — the aid package
that Congress approved in December could dry up this summer.  Is there
any discussions at the White House of a new package?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything to share on any
conversations with Congress or any conversation about aid.  I think one
thing you can take away — and I know many Americans have — is this past
year you’ve seen our commitment to the Ukrainian people with the aid
packages that we have either drawdown or — or given to Ukraine, because
we believe the importance of the Ukrainian people be — having the
ability to fight for their freedom, for their territorial integrity.   
   
And, look, at the end of the day — and you’ve heard us say this over and
over again, which is: This war can end today.  This is a war that was
started by Russia.  This is Russia’s aggression against a democratic
country, and it could end today.  The fighting, the bloodshed — all of
it could end today if Russia would leave Ukraine.   
   
Q    Karine, I know the President spoke to Prime Minister Albanese
yesterday.  Why hasn’t he spoken to the Prime Minister of Papua New
Guinea?  Does he intend to have a personal conversation there?  Why did
the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea not get the same courtesy that
the Prime Minister — Prime Minister of Australia did?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, it’s a very good question.  I think in my
statement I stated that senior — senior staffers from NSC spoke with —
spoke with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea.   
   
I don’t have a call to read out to you.  But I’m sure there’ll be a
conversation at some point — the President will have a conversation at
some point with the Prime Minister.  
   
Q    Just to follow up on that question, though, Karine, Xi Jinping has
been to Papua New Guinea three times.  And this would be the first time
the President — an American President came and he cancelled.  And he’s
not even calling?  (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I want to be very, very clear: not canceled,
postponed.   
   
And Jake just — just said to all of you that we are hoping and planning
at some point — we don’t have a date locked in — to get the President
there.  It is, like, this week he will not be the first President to —
U.S. President to visit Papua New Guinea.  But again, we have postponed
the trip, and the hope is that we’ll get the President there at some
point.   
   
Q    What’s your — this is a kind of a political-ish question.  What’s
your take on the Republican criticism of President Biden leaving the
country at all right now when these talks are happening?  There’s —
there’s been some from Speaker McCarthy and others that would suggest
that it’s irresponsible for Biden to be leaving at all.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as you know, he’s attending the G7 Summit
Leaders in — in Japan.  And one of the responsibilities that an American
President has is our leadership on the global stage, which is incredibly
important and critical.   
   
And we’re talking about global economy — right? –strengthening the
global economy.  We’re talking about climate change.  We’re talking
about Ukraine, and how these countries are going to continue to work
together to provide assistance — security assistance, humanitarian aid
to a country that is fighting — where the people are fighting for their
freedom.   
   
That is important.  That is an important part of the job of a President.
 Those are — there are critical issues, yes, domestically, but also
internationally that the President has to take on.   
   
And so, look, it goes back to the President — I think it goes back to
your — your first question, Zeke, that the President, indeed, could be a
president anywhere.   
   
But this is an important — an important group of leaders, if you think
about it, G7, the — the largest economies — right? — world economies
across the country.  And we have to continue to have these conversations
on those pieces as I just laid out.  Okay?  
   
Q    Doesn’t — doesn’t it — I mean, doesn’t it make the President look
like he’s caving to Republican demands by making this last-second
decision to cancel it after this criticism from Republicans had come up,
instead of making a proactive decision to do it a few days ago, or just
continuing on with the trip and telling Kevin McCarthy, you know, “Call
me with an update”?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, the Speaker — the Speaker put us in this
position.  Right?  Let’s not forget.  He put us in a position where he
is taking the American economy hostage.  
   
We are — we are looking at a situation where America could potentially
default on their — on paying their bills, which is something that we
have never done before, which is something — would be the first time
ever.  And you’ve heard me say these stats over and over again: We’ve
done this 78 times since 1960.   
   
So, I get the question, but Speaker McCarthy and MAGA Republicans got us
here.  They are the ones who got — we can — they can actually take care
of this or could have taken care of this months ago, weeks ago, by just
doing their constitutional duty and dealing with the debt limit.   
   
Again, last three — three times in — in the Trump administration,
Democrats put — put to the side their political disagreements with the
Republican Party, met them — met them in the middle, and were able to
put forth and actually deal with the debt limit.   
   
So, what’s — “what’s different now?” is the question to them.   
   
Q    Karine, following up on that, do you — do you believe that the
Speaker, by putting the President in this situation, has endangered
national security by not allowing the President to continue on the rest
of this trip, by forcing him to truncate it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I can’t — I can’t speak to that.  What I can
speak to — I — I’ll just say: don’t believe that is the case.  Right? 
What we believe is that the — there are critical issues, domestically
and internationally, that the President has to deal with at all times,
and he’s going to deal with them.   
   
And — and it’s important that Congress does their job and deal with the
debt limit as they have done, again, 78 times since 1960s, as they’ve
done three times in the past administration.   
   
And the President wants to go back to regular order and — as we have
been doing in these budget negotiations and talking about how we’re
going to move forward with the economy for the American people.   
   
Q    Kevin McCarthy, right before we left, said that there was a big
obstacle in the White House toward a deal, which sort of conflicted with
some of the good vibes coming out of the meeting yesterday.  Any — I
guess, any idea why he would say that?  Or does the deal seem farther
off than the sort of end-of-week hope that was expressed yesterday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m not Speaker McCarthy’s press secretary,
so I can’t speak for why — what he said and what he doesn’t say.  That’s
up to him and his people to speak to.   
   
What I can speak to is what the President has said.  He’s confident. 
He’s optimistic.  It has been a productive conversation.  Last —
yesterday was a productive conversation.  The staff-level meetings have
been productive.  So, I will leave it there.   
   
Of course — of course, as it relates to the budget negotiation, we want
to get this done as soon as possible.  As it relates to the debt
limit, Congress needs to act.  We’ve held the line.  We’ve been very
clear on that.  They need to get this done as soon as possible.  
   
Q    Not to beat around the bush, Karine, but President Biden is the
third Democratic President who had to cancel a foreign trip because of
budget negotiations and our debt ceiling, after President Clinton and
President Obama.  What does this say about the dynamic between a
Democratic White House and a Republican Congress on —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Honestly, that’s for Republicans in Congress to speak
to.  That is for them to speak to.  They have to answer that question: 
Why is it — why is this happening now?  That’s something for them to
answer.   
   
All right.   
   
Q    Karine, after the — the veto override in North Carolina last night,
has the President talked to Governor Cooper?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have a call to read out to you.  I — what
I can say: It is so out of touch that — what — what we saw occur with
that bill and just how extreme the — this abortion bill is and what
we’ve been seeing across the country on the attacks on women’s
healthcare, women’s reproductive rights that we’ve seen from
Republicans.  Again, out of touch with where North Carolina — where
North Carolinians are.   
   
And the President and this administration has been very clear that we’re
going to continue to fight for women’s healthcare, women’s reproductive
act — women reproductive rights, and that we’re going to continue to
call on Congress to make Roe the — the law of the land.  
   
Thanks, everybody.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.
