James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:18 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, what’s going on?  Good afternoon.   
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I hear comments.  
   
Okay, here we go.  So, yesterday, Secretary Yellen estimated that
without action by Congress, we could be unable to meet our obligations. 
In other words, default as early as June 1st.  
   
The updated projection should be a wake-up call to Congress.  It is time
for the Speaker and the MAGA Republicans to stop the brinksmanship and
act to prevent default, which would have devastating consequences on our
economy and the American people.  
   
It is Congress’s constitutional obligation to act, not hold the full
faith and credit of the United States hostage unless we allow them to
make cuts to programs hardworking Americans rely upon.  
   
Threatening to default and crash the economy unless the President agrees
with Speaker McCarthy’s entire agenda isn’t just unreasonable, it’s
dangerous.  
   
That’s why the President called each of the four leaders yesterday and
asked that they come to the White House on May 9th to discuss the
urgency and importance of avoiding default.  
   
In his calls, he was clear: It is Congress’s constitutional duty to
prevent default.  This is not an issue that we will negi- — negotiate
on.  The debt limit was increased three times under President Trump.  It
should be no different this time.  
   
Given the limited time Congress now has, it is clear that — that the
only practical path to avoid default is for Congress to suspend the debt
limit without conditions.   
   
During his meeting with the leaders, the President will discuss
initiating a separate process to address the budget and appropriations,
because we have long said we welcome a conversation about spending
priorities.   
   
But it’s — but let’s be clear about the — about what House Republicans’
Default on America Act does.  It makes a series of deeply devastating
and unpopular cuts to things like veterans’ health benefits.  There is
no constituency in this nation that supporting — that supports
threatening to kill millions of jobs unless the VA is gutted, except
apparently extreme MAGA Republicans — House Republicans, to be even more
specific.  
   
Their bill would cut 81,000 jobs from the VA, reducing outpatient visits
by 30 million, and increase the disability claims backlog by an
estimated 134,000.  More than two dozen veterans’ organizations publicly
pleaded with House Republicans to protect veterans from general budget
cuts.  Republicans refused.  Republicans made last-minute changes to
protect special interests, but they refuse to include veterans in those
protections.  
   
Sadly, Republicans are now attacking the very veterans group who raised
alarm bells about these draconian cuts to the programs veterans and
families rely on.  
   
And that’s not only — that’s not only the — that’s not the only thing
that they’re doing.  
   
After pushing to repeal literal — literally dozens of clean energy tax
credits, House Republicans are going out of their way to profess their
loyalty to big oil.  Their Default in America Act would be a boon for
big oil, preserving $31 billion in subsidies for companies that are
already posting record profits to the tune of tens of billions of
dollars.  And they’d be doing that at the expense of our nation’s
veterans, our schoolteachers, our police, our border patrol.  
   
President — President Biden will not allow that to happen.  
   
With that, Seung Min, you want to take — kick us off?  
   
Q    Sure.  I have two “news of the day” topics.  The first one: Why was
the mayor of Prospect Park barred from attending the White House’s Eid
celebration last night?  
   
    MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just first say this is under the
purview of the Secret Service.  What I will say more broadly is that —
and I can say this; I was in the room — the President was very proud to
welcome nearly 400 Muslim Americans to the White House to celebrate Eid
yesterday.  It was a meaningful event and opportunity to celebrate along
Muslim leaders from across the country who were here — as I said, nearly
400.   
   
This particular situation is under the purview of Secret Service, and so
I will leave it to them to speak to directly.  
   
Q    Can you say if the mayor is on the FBI’s Terrorist Screening data
set and that’s the reason why he was barred?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, this is under the purview of Secret Service. 
And I would refer you to them.  
   
Q    And he has said in interviews, as of this morning, that the White
House nor Service has told him why he was barred.  So I get that you
can’t talk about it, but doesn’t he at a minimum deserve an explanation
as to why he was blocked?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All I can tell you, Seung Min, is that this is under
the purview of Secret Service.  
   
Q    Okay.  And another topic.  On the troops announcement from DOD that
is coming, or has come, or will come in 40 minutes.  (Laughter.)   
   
So, obviously, President Biden has been a big critic of former President
Donald Trump’s immigration policies.  But isn’t this — sending troops to
the border — another example of where President Biden has taken
President Trump’s policies on immigration?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, to your point, my colleagues at the Pentagon are
going to brief on this in — at two o’clock, in less than 40 minutes.  So
— so, clearly, I would definitely make sure that you all take a listen
and hear what they have to say.  
   
What I will say more broadly is DOD personnel have been supporting CBP
at the border for almost two decades now.  So, this is a — this is a
common practice, if you will.   
   
These personnel will be performing administrative tasks, like data entry
and warehouse support.  They will not be performing law enforcement
functions or interacting with immigrants or migrants.   
   
This will free up Border Patrol agents to perform their critical law
enforcement duties.   
   
I will also add that this would not be necessary if Congress would act. 
As you know, on the first day of walking into the White House, of his
administration, the President put forth a comprehensive immigration
legislation and — so that we could have resources and so that we could
be able to help the men and women of Border Patrol — Patrol to do their
jobs.  
   
And so if Congress would act and exac- — again, do their jobs and meet
us halfway and do this in a bipartisan way, we would not have to do
this.  
   
Q    All right.  And I know you said they won’t be performing law
enforcement tasks.  But broadly, as the administration prepares for the
expected increase in the coming weeks, can you offer assurances that
what — that the migrants who adri- — arrive at the border will be
treated humanely?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s the President’s goal.  The President
understands that we need a system, an immigration system, that meet —
that needs to meet the moment, that’s modernized.   
   
And one of the things that he has been very clear about: He wants to do
this in a humane way and — and do it differently than it — certainly
than it was done in the last administration.  
   
So that is certainly part of the President’s goal.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On the debt ceiling, can you just walk us through the decision by
the President to reach out to the leaders and hold this meeting now? 
And you’ve made it very clear that his position hasn’t changed.  So what
changed his mind to now hold this meeting?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  And I — and as you just
stated, Karen, the President has been very clear: He’s not going to
negotiate over avoiding default.  This is Congress’s constitutional
duty.  We’ll continue to be very clear about that, as we have in the
last several months.   
   
But he will have a conversation on the budget and appropriations.  The
President, as you know, put his budget out on March 9th, showed where
his values were and what he believes — how he sees the country moving
forward as it relates to the economy and his budget.  House Republicans
didn’t put out their proposal until April 9th — the 19th, to be exact. 
And they passed it just this past — this last week, I believe last —
last Wednesday.  So we can’t have a conversation on the budget and
spending without a proposal from each side.   
   
We — they put forth their vision, their values for the American people. 
So just a few days after the House Republicans passed their proposal,
the President called the four congressional leaders to invite them to a
meeting once the House is back in session.   
   
And we have said over and over again this past week that we were
analyzing what they put forth.  And we’ve been very clear and also
criticizing their budget, as I did at the top here.  But now — now
there’s a — now, after a couple of days, the President reached out and —
after analyzing what they put forth, and we’re going to have — the
President is going to have a meeting with them next week.  
   
Q    But if he’s not willing to negotiate, what is this meeting?  Like,
what is he coming to the table with?  And does he see this as a
conversation that’s only about the debt ceiling and then there’s a
separate meeting later that’s about the budget?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President — well, I —  
   
Q    Or when Kevin McCarthy comes and wants to talk about all of it, how
— what are the mechanics of this meeting?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean — I —  
   
Q    And can you do those two things at the same time —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well —  
   
Q    — over the coming weeks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sorry, I was —  
   
Q    Sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — trying to wait to see where the question was going
to end.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I apologize.  My bad.  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Look, he’s going to be — he’s going to make it very
clear, in this meeting that they’re going to have next week, how it is
Congress’s constitutional duty to act.  He is not going to negotiate on
the debt ceiling.  Been very clear.  That is not going to change.  
   
Now, we — I have said, as I said from the top here, that he’s willing to
have a separate conversation about their spending: what they want to do
with the budget, how they see the appropriations process moving forward,
what they see with their spending, as we’ve seen from this vision plan
that they put forward just — just on March — on April 19th, as I
stated.  
   
So, look, he’s going to continue to make very clear that this is up to
Congress to act when it comes to the debt ceiling.  This is a question
for them: What are you going to do and how are you going to — to — to
let the American people know that you’re not going to hold the American
economy hostage?   
   
Q    And I don’t mean to, like, belabor, but when you say a “separate
conversation,” is that, again, only after the debt ceiling is raised? 
Or is he going to have that separate conversation on May 9th at the same
time, when they’re all sitting at that table together next week?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the President’s going to make it clear to
them how it is not that they have to avoid a default; it is their
constitutional duty for Congress to do this.  It is their constitutional
duty to the American people for them to do their job.  
   
And he will always — he will always — he will also say, you know, we
will have a conversation about — about the budget and appropriations. 
And that is something that he will be very clear about: We can have a
conversation about that, but it is important to not default.   
   
We are not a deadbeat nation, as you heard directly from the President
just yesterday in the Rose Garden.  He’s going to be really clear about
this.  We have been able to do this — make sure that we pay our debt as
a nation — for the past several decades.  
   
And so the President is going to continue to make that clear.  He’s
going to bring them here, have that conversation.  And we certainly will
have more to share as we get closer.  
   
Q    Just continuing on on the debt ceiling.  Real quickly,  so did the
President decide to offer this meeting this coming week after he knew
about the June 1st deadline?  Like, when — when did he decide to call
the meeting?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I don’t have a — a date on when he decided or time
— specific time on the timeline on when he decided to offer the
meeting.  What I can say is they passed their budget, their — this House
— this House vision — MAGA vision that they put forward that we’ve been
talking about for some time now, since April 19th.  They passed it.  We
said we would analyze it.  I have said this from this podium.  We did. 
We — we analyzed it, and a few days later, the President decided that he
would call them and invite them to the White House to have a very
critical conversation that’s important to the American people.  
   
Again, this is a — this is something that is — that — that is a
constitutional duty of Congress, and they need to act immediately.  
   
Q    Can I just ask you about First Republic?  We’ve seen a huge
response in the market today.  Regional bank shares are down pretty
significantly, 20 percent — over 20 percent.  Is there a sense that
you’ve misjudged how serious the situation is?  First Republic was
deemed to be not systemic, but the market does seem to be thinking there
is systemic risk.  You know, is there something that you could do now
with the President?  Would it make — would it — would it — are you
considering having the President come out and speak about what’s
happened —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —  
   
Q    — to try to, you know, reassure markets and people?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, the — the President spoke for — look, I’m not
going to speak to the markets.  I’m not going to do that from here, as
you could understand why, Andrea.   
   
The President spoke to the actions that this administration took.  Just
yesterday, again, at the Rose Garden, he spoke to this.  He spoke to the
— the debt ceiling as well.   
   
What I can say is that, you know — I think we went back and forth on
this just last Thursday, and I mentioned how, you know, this is
something that the — that the FDIC is monitoring; this is under their
purview.   
   
We have the tools necessary to keep our banking system safe and protect
depositors.  That is the objective, right?  That is the — the objective
that the President wants his team to lead with to make sure that we keep
taxpayers safe, depositors protected.  And we stand ready to use those
tools if needed, as we have in the past several weeks.   
   
And so, look, we — this administration has had a decisive and forceful —
taken decisive and forceful actions and — and to make sure that the U.S.
banking system continues to — to have access to resources and to meet
the depositors demand.  Again, we have those tools at our disposal.  
   
We’ll continue — FDIC is going to continue to monitor this.  And, you
know, I’ll leave it there.  This is something that we do indeed — the
President does indeed take very seriously.   
   
I also mentioned that he was — he’s been regularly kept abreast by his
economic team.   
   
And again, we have the tools that we need.  And we’re — and FDIC is
going to continue to monitor.  
   
Q    Just — just very quickly on the — this — what happened over Sunday
night when this auction kind of came to a head.  At what point was the
President told that the largest bank in America was going to purchase
First Republic and therefore become a little bit larger?  You know, was
that something that was, you know, apparent to him before he went to
sleep?  Did he wake up in the morning and find out, you know, Jamie
Dimon just got a bit — a little bit bigger?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, again, I could tell you that the President has
been regularly kept — kept updated on the situation.  
   
As it relates to JPMorgan, FDIC has the statu- — statutory obligation to
choose the path that is least cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and
that’s what they did here.  It was necessary to ensure continued
resilience of the banking system and to do so at no cost to tax- —
taxpayers.   
   
And that is something, again, that the President has been very clear
with his economic team as they’ve moved forward with this process.  
   
Q    So you’re not going to say when he was briefed?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I am not going to give a specific time on the cal- —
again, on the timeline on when the President has been briefed on that.  
   
On — on your JPMorgan question, what I can say: He’s been regularly kept
updated by his economic team.  And that is something that’s going to
certainly continue.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Two quick follow-ups, and then one more.  You
explicitly said that given the urgency of the moment and the timeline,
in terms of the debt limit, that suspension of the debt limit was what
needed to be pursued.  Is it the view of the White House right now that
suspension is really the only viable option, not raising by a particular
number?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into specifics.  I — I — I hear
you, Phil.  What I’m going to say is we’ve been very clear: It needs to
be done without condition.  This is their constitutional duty to deal
with the debt limit, as they did three times with the last — the last
President — Republican President, as we all know.  
   
We have never been a deadbeat nation, as the President has said; I’ve
repeated this yesterday as well.   
   
And they need to take action.  Congress needs to act.  And that’s what
the President is going to continue to make clear even in the — in the
meeting next week that he’ll have with the four leaders.  
   
Q    On the mayor, I understand Service is leading.  Did the White House
have any role or any consult to — consultations when it came to that
decision-making at all?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have to be very, very clear here.  This is under the
purview of Secret Service.  And I just would have to refer you there.   
   
Q    And then, last one.  When the President looks through the lens of
budget approps in these discussions next week, is the White House
weighing any proposals in terms of a formal process outside of the
normal formal process that may entice Republicans in terms of moving
towards a clean debt ceiling increase?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Any — any specific process you’re thinking about?  
   
Q    No, that’s what I was asking you about.  (Laughter.)   
   
No, I’m trying to pick through kind of what a deal-making process would
look like if you’re going just through that path, beyond — I mean, there
is an appropriations process that is normal.  Is there anything
different that you guys would want to put on the table?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Are you — and are you speaking dir- –about the
appropriation process?   
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So, as it relates to the budget, the spending,
appropriations process — look, that is something — a conversation that
the President is happy to have with Speaker McCarthy and other — and the
other leaders — the other — the other three, obviously, to have this
discussion on how to move forward and what we value — what we see our
values are for the American people and how we move forward with our
economy.   
   
That is always — he — we’ve always been very clear about that when it
comes to, again, appropriations and budget.   
   
But again, I just have to say this very clearly: When it comes to the
debt, Congress must act.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Back on the New Jersey mayor.  Was anyone else
turned away from the celebration or was he the only one?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I can tell you this.  We had nearly 400
attendees — leaders in — in the community attend — attend the event.  It
was — it was lively.  It was a — you see — you felt the affection in the
room for the President and his record and what he’s done for the
community.   
   
So, it was a celebration that was — you know, that was — I was in the
room.  And it — if you guys watched, there was a lot of back-and-forth. 
There was a lot of excitement for the President.  And I will leave it
there.  
   
As it relates to this particular issue, I would have to leave it to the
Secret Service.   
   
Q    He also says that he suspects that he was turned away because of
profiling because of his background.  Would — do you want to respond to
that at all?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just going to leave it to the Secret Service to
speak to this directly.

Go ahead, Ed.

Q    Yeah, thanks, Karine.  So, on the JOLTS report today, the economic
news.  So the number of layoffs and discharges rose to 1.8 million, and
that’s the highest level since December of 2020.  You know, how many
layoffs is the President comfortable with without a growing concern
about the number of companies that are shedding jobs?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let me just look at the JOLTS and give the JOLTS
openings report just a more broad- — broader scope here so we can give
the American people an understanding of what the — what the — what the —
what the report showed. 

So the job openings data, the JOLTS, showed the kind of labor market
easing that we want to see, so that is incredibly important.  The number
of unfilled job openings have declined toward historic levels, even as
lab- — layoffs remain low.  And a lot of this, if you look at more
broadly to the President’s economic — economic agenda, the Invest in
America agenda, our economy is indeed growing, and employers are hir- —
hiring.  And you have to look at it in its full scope here. 

More than 1 million jobs added last quarter for 12.6 million created
since President Biden took office; 3.5 percent unemployment, near- —
near a 50-year low; and below 4 percent for more than a year.  Real
wages are higher than any — any — than they were just nine months ago. 
More than $435 billion in private sector investments since the President
took office.

Businesses might be removing job openings, but they are not laying off
existing workers.  And that’s — that’s the cooldown that we — you hear
our economists talk about that we want to see.  And that is indeed part
of that transition from stable and steady growth. 

So you got to look at the whole thing.  And it’s — in a broad
perspective here, really lay out what — what the — what the jobs — job
opening data shows. 

And so we just want to make sure the — the American people know this.

Q    But the layoffs have been increasing as — from companies — from a
wide range of companies.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But, look, I just laid out the data, what we’ve seen. 
Even as layoffs remain low — it still remains low — we want to see a jo-
— a market that is actually going — transitioning into stable and steady
growth.  And that’s what we’re seeing. 

We’re seeing — we’re seeing the 12-point — more than 12.6 million jobs
have been created.  We’re seeing unemployment under 4 percent, which has
been like that for a year now, which is also important.  We’re seeing
real wages — real wages and — are higher than they were just nine months
ago. 

So you have to actually look at all the data points to see where we are
more broadly as an economy. 

I’m going to move around.   
   
Q    Just one quick one on banking, if I could.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to move around.

Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Q    I’d like to ask you about Sudan.  The U.N. estimates that about
100,000 people have already fled the country — I’m talking about
Sudanese people — and they’re warning that an extra 800,000 possibly
could flee the country. 

What is the U.S. doing to help with what is increasingly looking like a
massive refugee crisis in a region that’s already struggling with that?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, very good question.  Look, we remain gravely
concerned about the unfolding humanitarian situation in Sudan, including
rapidly deteriorating humanitarian condition. 

This widespread violence compounds an already dire situation.  The SAF
and also the RSF must follow safe access for humanitarian agencies and
their workers to support the Sudanese people, for Sudanese medical
workers to access hospitals and receive vital medical supplies, for the
civilians to access vital resources as well. 

USAID — USAID announced the deployment of a Disaster Assistance Response
Team — DART, as it’s also called — to Nairobi, Kenya, to lead the U.S.
government disaster response there.  In areas where security conditions
permit, U.S. government partners are providing some limited life-saving
activities in Sudan. 

The U.S. government continues to work with partners to assess their
ability to safely provide critical humanitarian assistance at the
security situation permits — as the security situation permits.

As access and security permit, U.S.-funded humanitarian partners are
present on the borders and working with local authorities to provide
services to those in need, including access to emergency food, water,
and medical support. 

We are planning to use all available means, including using the
pre-positioned medical and food supplies, to ensure that humanitarian
assistance can resume once security conditions are — permit. 

Again, we are — we are, certainly, gravely concerned.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Does President Biden have any reaction to CIA
Director William Burns meeting with Jeffrey Epstein in 2014?  This
obviously was after Epstein had served time for a sex crime and was
registered as a sex offender.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to comment on that from here.

Q    Okay.  And can you also — how does — you know, President Biden says
that he’s the most pro-union President in history.  How do you square
that with the fact that he is not openly offering support to the
striking writers in Hollywood?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, because it’s an ongoing strike.  And you’ve
heard us say many times before, we don’t speak to an ongoing strike.   
   
But more broadly, and I said this yesterday, the Pres- — President Biden
is a strong supporter of workers’ rights to strike. 

We’ve said this over and over again, as we’ve been asked when different
entities and you see workers strike in those different entities.  We’ve
been very clear. 

He has worked to bolster workers’ rights, including through appointing a
strong leadership team at the L- — NLRB and through his efforts to
advance the PRO A- — the PRO Act.

Again, we encourage both sides to stay at the table.  But we are always
very mindful.

Q    Why can’t you speak about an ongoing strike?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, we —

Q    Is that a — why is a policy?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I — look, this is something that we’ve done
continuously now.  This is nothing new that has been said from this
podium.  But this is a President who strongly supports workers’ right to
strike.  We’ve said that over and over and over again. 

You see that in his record.  This is someone who supports labor — labor
unions. 

Again, this is — all you have to do is look at his record as a senator,
look at his record as a Vice President, and certainly as a record of —
as President.

Go ahead, Mike.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  I want to follow up on the question of the timing
of this invitation, because as recently as Friday and into the weekend,
officials here in this building had been saying there were no plans to
invite Speaker McCarthy.  It felt like a rather abrupt shift then to
this “big four” invitation going out Monday.

Was the White House caught off guard at all by the timing of the new “X
date,” as it’s known, which seemed to be earlier than even some analysts
had been forecasting?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we knew Secretary Yellen’s letter would be
released yesterday, and the President thought it was a good opportunity
to remind congressional leaders of the urgency of preventing default. 
So we were aware of the letter.  The timing is up to the Department of
Treasury.  That is something for them to decide. 

But, again, the President thought it would be — it would be a good
opportunity, again, to remind congressional leaders that we must not
default.  It is their constitutional duty.  Congress must act.  And that
is something that we’ve been very, very clear about and very repetitive
about, as you know, from here.  
   
Q    In 2011, Vice President Biden had to delay a foreign trip because
he was, at the time, involved in the debt ceiling negotiations as well. 
We saw President Obama also had to postpone a foreign trip during
another fiscal showdown with Republicans.  The President is scheduled to
travel a very long way for quite a bit of time during this month.  Is
there any even notional discussion in the building of curtailing that
trip?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have any changes to share to his schedule
or anything to announce at this time.  The President — as you know, Mike
— is President wherever he is.  And the economy — as it relates to the
American economy, that is always a priority — a top priority for him.  
   
I don’t have anything else to share.  But it is their constitutional
duty — Congress’s constitutional duty to take action.  
   
Q    Would he delegate somebody like the Vice President to step in to
handle some of these in-person negotiations while he’s traveling
abroad?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I don’t have any changes to announce.  I get
your question.  We still believe very strongly that it is Congress’s
duty to act.  It is their con- — it is their constitutional duty to do
just that.  And I’ll just leave it there.  
   
Q    And quickly, on another matter.  Yesterday, there was an
announcement related to vaccine requirements, testing requirements that
will no longer be in effect, tied to the end of the public health
emergency on May 11th.  Can you update us on some of the protocols here
in the White House?  Is there any change that might, especially for
staff who interact with the President, as it relates to those rules?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as we said yesterday when we made the
announcement, we’ll have more details to share about these requirements
in the upcoming days.  Nothing — nothing at this time new or ahead of
the May 11th — May 11th kind of changes that you’ll see — that we’re
going to see.   
   
Let me go to the back, and then I’ll come back down.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Given Senator Feinstein’s critical vote in any
chance of passing a clean debt limit hike, as the President has said he
would like, is he concerned about her prolonged absence further
hindering Democrats in the Senate now that it’s been two months?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we wish — we wish the senator a speedy
recovery.  I don’t have anything else to share beyond that.  I’ve talked
about the close relationship that he has had with Senator Feinstein and
the work that they’ve done over the years, not just him — him as a
President, but also when he was a senator.  He appreciates her, thinks
that she has — you know, has really helped change — change a lot of
important, critical policies to the American people.  
   
I don’t have — I don’t have anything to say specifically about when
she’s coming back or what that looks like.  But we certainly wish her a
speedy recovery.  
   
Q    And then, just one more.  Last week, the President signed an
executive order authorizing the use of the National Guard at the
southern border in support of counternarcotics efforts.  Can you
explain: Was that a precursor to today’s announcement on the troops?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to — I’m not going to get into the
timeline of it.  As you know, we’ve been making preparations ahead of
the lifting of Title 42.  We’ve been very clear about that.  You’ve
heard from the Department of State, DHS as well, on what they’re — they
had a press conference to lay out what that’s going to look like.  
   
So there’s been many processes and plans that have been put into place. 
I don’t have any specifics to — to any — any timeline that you’re
asking.  
   
Okay, I’m trying to call on somebody I haven’t.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  If the President’s priority is to treat the
immigrants humanely, like you’ve said, wouldn’t he be sending social
workers, psychologists, judges, lawyers to the border instead of sending
active military personnel?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — and I want to be clear — the active
military, as I just explained to one of your colleagues here, is — it’s
been done for more than two — almost two decades now.  It is personnel
that’s performing administrative tasks and — like data entry and
warehouse support.  That’s what they’re going to do so they can — so it
can help free up the CBP, the Border Patrol agents, to perform some
critical law enforcement duties.   
   
And so, that is their function.  That’s what the active duty is going to
do.  They’re not going to interact with migrants.  
   
Look, yes, we would love to be able to have more resources at the border
to do the critical work that is needed.  But this — the reason why we’re
moving in this direction — and, of course, my DOD colleagues will speak
more on this — is because Congress has not acted.  
   
As you know, Christina, this is something that the President has taken
very seriously, putting forth a comprehensive — comprehensive
immigration reform legislation on his first day to deal with DACA, to
deal with migrants, to make sure that we fix the system, make it more
modernized — right? — do it in a humane way.  That is something that the
President wants to do.   
   
But, you know, we are using the tools that we have in front of us, in
our toolbelt, to deal — to deal with what we’re seeing currently at the
border.  But, of course, yes, we would love to have more resources at
the border for sure.  
   
Go ahead, Anita.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  First of all, on Sudan, we’ve just seen news
that the combatant leaders have declared a seven-day ceasefire and that
they’re open to talks.  First of all, just the White House reaction to
this.   
   
And does the White House or does the U.S. government anticipate having a
role in these talks?  What are your objectives?  And are you going to
use this time, these seven days, to either get in humanitarian supplies
or get out American citizens?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I have not seen those reports, so I want to
be super mindful.  
   
But, look, we remain in close contact with the Sudanese military and
civilian leaders to see what we can to help them identify path to a — to
reach a sustainable cessa- — cessation — pardon me — of hostilities that
include humanitarian arrangements, and we are engaged at the highest
levels regularly.   
   
I had said this yesterday; I’ll say this again: The President’s senior —
the senior level of the President’s national security team has been in
direct contact with SAF and RSF leadership.  And we have called for — to
continue the ceasefire.  We have called to — to bring down — to stop
what we’ve been seeing: the violence there.  We’ve been doing that for
the past week and being very vocal on that.   
   
But, again, there are conversations happening.  We’ll continue those
conversations from the highest levels here to — to SAF and RSF
leadership.  And that’s what we’re going to continue to do, at the
President’s direction.   
   
Q    And then just looking ahead to the G7, there — we’ve seen reports
that the President is going to sign an EO limiting some American
investment in key sectors of China’s economy.  Does he plan to sign that
before the G7?  And what — you know, what’s the thinking behind that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’ll have more to share on what the agenda, what
the trip is going to look like.  I don’t have anything to confirm at
this time.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  
   
(A White House staffer sneezes.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Bless you.  (Laughter.)  Phil.  
   
Q    It wasn’t me!  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sorry, was it — was it you?  
   
Q    It wasn’t me!  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Who was it?  
   
Q    Oh.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m so sorry.  (Laughter.)  Here I am calling you
out, and it wasn’t even you.  
   
Gesundheit.  Bless you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Allergies are bad this year.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh my gosh, the pollen is quite something.   
   
Q    Thank you for the question.  So, Governor Greg Abbott has said that
he will continue sending migrants to Democrat-run cities after Title 42
expires.  The mayors of Chicago and New York have already responded
saying they simply do not have space.  What is the administration doing
to help state and local governments prepare ahead of the expected influx
of migrants?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, it’s unfortunate that Governor Abbott
continues to play politics with migrants and with the American people. 
Because what he’s doing — that’s what it looks like.  It looks like a
political stunts, instead of — instead of trying to address the
situation or maybe get the congressional members and senators that are
in his state to actually ask them to work with us on truly dealing with
a problem — with — with trying to figure out how do we deal with
immigration reform.  Instead of doing that, he wants to play
politics.   
   
So that’s what we’ve seen from the governor.  It’s not surprising. 
That’s what he’s continued to do.   
   
Our administration has been in touch with mayors and local government to
see how we can be helpful to them — that has continued over the last
several months — because Republicans continue to play politics here to
put — to put political stunts in head of — ahead of actually doing —
making change.   
   
And if you think about what we’ve put together, if you think about
wanting to — us to protect — put protections for DREAMers and
farmworkers, more immigration judges and asylum officers, more funding
for border security, and all of this, which is part of the President’s —
the President’s legislation, and what we’ve been urging Congress to act
on.  
   
What we saw just earlier this week is over 430 business groups wrote to
members of Congress, calling on them to get this done.  Four hundred and
thirty businesses have called on Congress to get this done.  So this is
getting support out there.  American people want to see this. 
Businesses want — want us to act as well — want Congress to act.  And
so, we’re going to continue to do that and to call on Congress.  
   
But Republicans are in the way.  And Republicans in Congress are getting
in the way.  And what Abbott is doing does not help the situation.   
   
Q    I hear what you’re saying about immigration reform.  I’m not
hearing specifics about how you’re providing resources to state and
local governments to handle the expected influx.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And I have said that we have been in touch with state
and local governments to help them in any way that we can.  We have done
that the past several — this past several months.  Whether it is
Chicago, whether it’s New York City, we have had extensive conversations
— even with the DC mayor — on how we can help moving forward.   
   
And, again, we’re in constant communication — whether it’s the White
House, whether it’s DHS, whether it’s FEMA even — in how we can help
cities.  Every city has their own specific need that they — that they
need to address to this issue.   
   
And so we’ve been in constant communication.  That has happened, and
I’ve talked about it multiple times whether — whichever mayor is asking
for assistance from the federal government.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then quickly on the meeting on May 9th, is that purely a
scheduling decision?  Given the urgency of the situation, why wait a
week before meeting with the leaders?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, look, as you know, Speaker — Speaker McCarthy is
out of the country currently.  And I have no idea when he’s coming back,
but he’s out of the country.  So that clearly has pushed this meeting a
little further down a couple of days.  And we want to make sure we got —
we had all four of them here.   
   
As for who’s attending, I would — no one has asked me that yet, but I
know people are probably curious who’s attending.  I would certainly ask
their respective offices to see if they accepted the President’s offer. 
But again, you know, this is — we want to make sure all four of them
were able to make it.   
   
And we’re looking forward — the President is looking forward to hosting
them here and having a real, important conversation about our American
economy and how we’re going to move forward for the American people.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I wonder if the President would support a
short-term extension to the debt limit so that conversations about
budget and debt limit can continue, potentially to September or for any
other period of time?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I can tell you is the President believes that it
is the Cong- — is it — it is Congress’s duty to get this done.  It is
their duty to — to make sure that we move forward with dealing with the
debt ceiling.   
   
But certainly, we’re not going to negotiate in public.  And our position
is going to be very clear that Congress needs to avoid a default — and
I’ll leave it there — without conditions.  
   
Q    But is an extension on the table at all?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — we won’t negotiate in public on the — on any of
this.   
   
What we will be very clear about is that it is — and our position hasn’t
changed.  Right?  Congress needs to avoid a default.   
   
Q    And just one more question.  Speaker McCarthy reaffirmed a
commitment to Ukraine yesterday — to continue to send aid.  Did the
President have a response to that at all?  Did he know that he was going
to make that commitment?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’re glad to hear that Speaker McCarthy
agrees it is vital to keep supporting Ukraine.  It is — it is — it was
good to hear him push back on the propaganda put forth by Russian state
news outlets, as we have seen, over the past year.   
   
President Biden has rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine
as they defend their territory against Russia — Russian aggression.  
   
The widespread bipartisan support that we’ve seen in Congress for
Ukraine has received — has been critical to those efforts.  And we agree
that it is important for that support to continue.  And we’re glad to
hear that coming from Speaker McCarthy, for sure.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I wanted to ask about the trial going on in
Arkansas with Hunter Biden and the child support.  Are the President and
First Lady monitoring that?  And how come they haven’t acknowledged the
seventh grandchild?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to speak to that from here.  
   
Q    Why not?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Karine, what is happening with the COVID-19 Task Force after May
11th?  Would Dr. Jha depart with the — with that remaining staff?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’ll have more to share on that in the — in the
upcoming weeks.  
   
Q    Thank you.  If the border is secure, as the administration has
said, then why would we need to send 1,500 active-duty U.S. troops down
there?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Because we need more work.  We need — more work needs
to be done, Peter.  We put forth a comprehensive immigration
legislation, and Congress — Republicans in Congress refuse to act.   
   
And so, the President has used the tools that he has in front of him to
— to prepare ahead of Title 42 lifting.  As you know, that is happening
in the next couple of days.   
   
And so we are putting — DHS, Department of State is putting forth
process — processes to deal — to deal with the changes that are going to
be ahead of us.  And so that is what’s important here, and that’s what
you’ve been seeing for the past several months.  You’ve heard from DHS,
you’ve heard from the State Department on what we’re putting in place to
deal with — to deal with the border once Title 42 lifts.  
   
Q    You said yesterday that, when it comes to illegal migration, you’ve
seen it come down by more than 90 percent.  Where did that number come
from?  Because —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It was — I was speaking —  
   
Q    — CBP is telling us the number is —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I hear you.  I’m about to answer.  
   
Q    — 136,000 people —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m about — I’m about to answer you —  
   
Q    — more this fiscal year so far.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  If you — if you — if the dramatics could come down
just a little bit —  
   
Q    I — you know —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  If the dramatics could come down a little bit.  
   
Q    What’s dramatic about asking a question about —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  I’m going — I’m going to answer.   
   
So I was speaking to the parolee program.  As you know, the President
put in place a parolee program to deal with — to deal with certain
countries on — on ways that we can limit illegal migration.  And we have
seen — the data has shown us that it has gone down by more than 90
percent.  That was what I was speaking to.  
   
Q    And just to follow up really quick —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I’m — we’re going to go.  We’re going to move.  
   
Q    The President talks a lot how much —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  We’re moving, Peter.  Let’s go.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Just two quick follow-ups on the meeting next
week.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not sure who’s speaking.  
   
Q    Sorry.  
   
Q    It was me.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, one more on the vaccine mandate being lifted on May 11th.  Do
you guys plan to rehire anyone who was fired or voluntarily resigned
under that policy?  Would they get any sort of compensation, backpay, or
anything like that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — we’ll have more to share, more details to share in
the upcoming days on requirements.  I don’t have anything new to share
on that at the time.  
   
Q    And one more on the — on the debt ceiling.  You’ve talked about
“this is Congress’s duty, we’re not a deadbeat nation,” all that kind of
stuff.  But what’s the President’s plan to convince McCarthy of this? 
What do you plan to do to get him over to your side and convince him to
— to see things that way?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I — the question is to M- — to Speaker
McCarthy.  What has changed?  The question to  
Speaker McCarthy is: In the last administration, he voted three times —
three times — to deal with the debt ceiling.  So the question is to
him.  What’s changed under this administration?  
   
Okay, we’re going to keep going.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Still on the debt ceiling, if I can just zoom out.  Ultimately,
what is the President’s priority?  Is it to avoid this thing of linking
debt ceilings from — from now forever to budget negotiations, which he
doesn’t want?  Or is it to avoid a debt default?  Because I know — I
know he wants both things, but what’s his ultimate priority?  Because it
— like in the game of chicken, at some point, yeah, you can wait for the
car, you can wait for the car, but you might have to jump out the
way.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — and I said this earlier — the President
thought it would be a good opportunity to remind congressional leaders
of the urgency of preventing default when the letter — when Secretary
Yellen’s letter came out.  So that is incredibly important.  
   
We cannot default as a country.  We cannot.  It is not good for the
American people, it will hurt taxpayers, it will hurt veterans, it will
hurt seniors.  We’re talking about 6 million — 6 million jobs here.  We
cannot allow that to happen.  
   
The President is going to make — continue to fight and speak out about
that.  And we’re going to be very clear: Congress needs to act. 
Congress needs to act.   
   
So that, of course, is going to be a priority of that conversation.  It
is going to be important for — for the President to make clear to
Speaker McCarthy and also to MAGA Republicans, as we have been for the
past several months.  We’ve been very clear; the President said
yesterday: We are not a deadbeat nation.   
   
And what’s different here?  What is different here?  They were able to
do it with — Democrats and Republicans were able to do it in the last
administration.  So what’s different here?  
   
Q    Okay.  But (inaudible) the “playing chicken” analogy, you know, he
— he might not have a choice to think about this too much at some
point.  You know, if the — if the proverbial car is like, you know,
about a couple of inches away, he’s got to dive out the way.  Does that
mean he accepts what they say and avoids default, if it comes down to
that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The question is for Congress.  It really is.  What has
changed?  Why were they able to do this three times?  Why were
Republicans willing to come together with Democrats three times to deal
with something that is their constitutional duty?  That’s their — that’s
the question for them.  Really, guys — it’s the question for them.   
   
They were able to do this, again, three times.  And now, under this
administration, they refuse to do it.  
   
Let’s not forget what we’re talking about.  This is — this is debt. 
More than 90 percent of that debt came before the President came into
office.  
   
Q    A press freedom question?  
   
Q    Karine?  
   
AIDE:  We have time for one or two more.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Can you explain the decision a little bit on
why you decided to invite all four congressional leaders to this meeting
instead of just Speaker McCarthy?  The standoff has largely been between
the President and the House Speaker, so do you all now see a role for
the Senate, possibly a leading role, in them getting this debt ceiling
resolved?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, the President thought it would be important to
get the four leaders here to talk about an incredible, critical issue —
right? — which is — which is how we’re going to move our economy
forward.  He wanted to have the four leaders here.  
   
This is certainly a continuation of conversations that happened in
February.  And so I wouldn’t read too much into it.  He wants to bring
them here, have a conversation — an important conversation that is
critical to the American people, critical to American families.  And
that’s how I would view this meeting.  
   
Q    And today, House Democrats began the groundwork to try to force a
vote on the debt limit and go around McCarthy through a discharge
petition.  Was this idea brought up during the President’s call during
these —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s something for House Republicans to speak to and
Speaker McCarthy to speak to.  I’m just not going to speak to the
mechanics of — of what’s happening on the other side of Pennsylvania. 

Go ahead.  I know I tried to call on you —

Q    That’s okay.  Two quick just follow-ups.  So given what you said
about Congress’s role in the debt limit, is it then the position of the
White House that there is no legal alternative to congressional action? 
There’s nothing else that can be done to raise or suspend the debt limit
or prevent a default in any way absent action from Congress?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Can you — do you mean legal action from us?

Q    Is there — there’s no executive order or any sort of executive
action that could be taken, either through the Treasury or the
President, to avoid a default?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Con- — again, I’m going to sound like a broken
record, as I have been for the past several months: Congress must act. 
We will not entertain scenarios where Congress compromises the full
faith and credit of the United States.

Q    So that means that — that the administration does not believe
there’s any power —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Republicans —

Q    — it has?  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Republicans and Democrats have prevented default 78
times since 1960, including three times — as I’ve mentioned over and
over in this pa- — in this specific briefing — under Trump.  And so,
they have to do that again. 

So, that’s where I’m going to leave that for you.

Q    And one more, if I may, and apologies if you sort of answered it in
an earlier question.  But is the administration playing any role at all
in the WGA strike negotiations?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No. 

All right.  Thanks, everybody.  I’ll see you tomorrow.

2:05 P.M. EDT
