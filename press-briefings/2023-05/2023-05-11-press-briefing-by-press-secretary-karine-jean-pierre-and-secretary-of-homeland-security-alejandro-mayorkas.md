James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:10 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Good afternoon, everybody.

Q    Good afternoon.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re good?  Okay.  No losing pens.

All right.  Today, the COVID-19 public health emergency ends, and I want
to take just a moment to talk about the important work that has happened
under this administration to prepare the nation for the next phase of
our response to COVID-19.

To date, the administration has taken significant steps to ensure
Americans have continued access to life-saving protections such as
vaccines, treatments, and tests, following the expiration of the public
health emergency.

Under this President, we launched the largest adult vaccination program
in U.S. history, with over 270 million Americans receiving at least one
shot of COVID-19 vaccine. 

And as you all know, our efforts have not been limited to the United
States alone.  Our government has been the largest single donor of
vaccines, having shared nearly 700 million doses with 117 countries
around the world.

Since January 20, 2021, COVID-19 deaths have declined by 95 percent. 
New COVID-19 hospitalizations are down nearly 90 percent.  And COVID-19
deaths globally are at their lowest levels.

But I want to be clear: This administration takes the threat of future
surges or pandemics very seriously, which is why access to vaccine,
tests, and treatments will remain widely available after today.  We’re
protecting millions of people who are uninsured by providing them with
the tools they need to stay protected from COVID-19. 

Projects like Next Gen, run out of — run out of HHS, will invest at
least $5 billion to accelerate the rapid development of next generation
vaccine and treatments.

We’re working to tackle the effects of long COVID and ensure people who
are experiencing it have the help that they need.

We’re working to stand up the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and
Response here at the White House.  And we’re calling on Congress,
through the President’s budget, to invest in our nation’s ability to
prepare and respond to future threats.

So the work won’t stop, but — won’t stop today, but the nation is well
prepared to manage the risk of COVID-19 going forward.   
   
And the continued availability of vaccinations, tests, and treatments,
and programs that provide equitable access to these tools has put the
nation and the world in a strong position as the po- — public health
emergency for COVID-19 ends and we move into the next phase of our
response.

This morning, you all saw, we continued progress on our efforts to bring
inflation down.  The official measure of inflation for producers of
goods and services fell to 2.3 percent.  That’s the average rate of
producer price inflation in 2018 and 2019, and the lowest level in more
than two years.  And it follows news we received yesterday showing that
consumer inflation declined for 10 month in a row.  That includes a
second month of falling grocery prices. 

So while there is more work to do to level — to lower costs for
families, we are making important progress at a time when our job market
remains historically strong.

Unemployment is at its lowest level in more than 50 years.  The share of
working-age Americans in the workforce is the highest in 15 years.  And
unemployment for African Americans at — is at the lowest that we’ve ever
seen.

Our historic recovery and falling inflation is thanks to — in part
because of the President’s work and what he’s done over the last two
years, including lowering costs for prescription drugs, insulin, energy
bills, and gas.

With that, thank you for your time.  I’d like to introduce, as we have
promised, Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, to provide
you all with — with the update on the — our robust work underway as
Title 42 lifts later today.

Secretary, the podium is yours.

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Thank you very much, Karine.  And good afternoon.

Tonight at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, the pandemic-era Title 42 public
health order will end.

Starting at midnight, people who arrive at our southern border will be
subject to our immigration enforcement authorities under Title 8 of the
United States Code.

Here is what that means:

If anyone arrives at our southern border after midnight tonight, they
will be presumed ineligible for asylum and subject to steeper
consequences for unlawful entry, including a minimum five-year ban on
reentry and potential criminal prosecution.

The transition to Title 8 processing will be swift and immediate.  We
have surged 24,000 Border Patrol agents and officers; thousands of
troops, contractors; and over a thousand asylum officers and judges to
see this through.

We are clear-eyed about the challenges we are likely to face in the days
and weeks ahead, and we are ready to meet them. 

We expected to see large numbers of encounters initially.  We are
already seeing high numbers of encounters in certain sectors.

This places an incredible strain on our personnel, our facilities, and
our communities with whom we partner closely.

We prepared for this moment for almost two years, and our plan will
deliver results.  It will take time for those results to be fully
realized.  And it is essential that we all take this into account.

Our current situation is the outcome of Congress leaving a broken,
outdated immigration system in place for over two decades, despite
unanimous agreement that we desperately need legislative reform.  It is
also the result of Congress’s decision not to provide us with the
resources we need and that we requested.  
   
Our efforts within the constraints of our broken immigration system are
focused on ensuring that the process is safe, orderly, and humane, all
while protecting our dedicated workforce and our communities.  
   
I want to be very clear: Our borders are not open.  People who cross our
border unlawfully and without a legal basis to remain will be promptly
processed and removed.   
   
An individual who was removed under Title 8 is subject to at least a
five-year ban on reentry into the United States and can face criminal
prosecution if they attempt to cross again.  
   
Smugglers have been long hard at work, spreading false information that
the border will be open.  They are lying.  
   
To people who are thinking of making the journey to our southern border,
know this: Smugglers care only about profits, not people.  Do not risk
your life and your life savings only to be removed from the United
States if and when you arrive here.  
   
Our approach to build lawful, safe, and orderly pathways for people to
come to the United States and to impose tougher consequences on those
who choose not to use those pathways works.  
   
President Biden has led the largest expansion of lawful pathways in
decades.  People from Cuba, Haiti, Venezua- — Venezuela, and Nicaragua
have arrived through lawfully available pathways.  And we reduced border
encounters from these groups by 90 percent between December of last year
and March of this year.  
   
We are launching new and expanded family reunification parole processes
for nationals of Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and
Honduras and are increasing use of the CBP One mobile app for
individuals to schedule appointments at our ports of entry.  
   
To those who do not use our available lawful pathways, we will deliver
tougher consequences using our immigration law authorities.   
   
The new rule finalized yesterday presumes that those who do not use
lawful pathways to enter the United States are ineligible for asylum. 
It allows us, the United States, to remove individuals who do not
establish a reasonable fear of persecution.  
   
We announced that eligible families will be placed in expedited removal
proceedings, and those that receive a final negative credible fear
determination will generally be removed within 30 days of being placed
in those proceedings.  
   
We began planning in 2021 for the end of Title 42.  Just a few
highlights:  
   
In addition to securing the first increase in Border Patrol agent hiring
in more than a decade, we are in the process of surging personnel to the
border, including over 1,400 DHS personnel, 1,000 processing
coordinators, and an additional 1,500 Department of Defense
personnel.   
   
We are delivering tougher consequences for unlawful entry.  During the
first half of this fiscal year, we returned, removed, and expelled more
than 665,000 people.  We are conducting dozens of removal flights each
week, and we continue to increase them.  Just yesterday, we worked with
the Mexican government to expel nearly 1,000 Venezuelans who did not
take advantage of our available lawful pathways to enter the United
States.  
   
We are bolstering the capacity of local governments and NGOs.  Last
week, we announced the distribution of an additional $332 million to
support communities along the south — southern border and in the
interior of our country.  
   
And we are going after the smugglers, leading an unprecedented law
enforcement disruption campaign that has led to the arrest of more than
10,000 smugglers who mislead and profit from vulnerable migrants.  
   
The United States is also working closely with regional partners to
impose stiffer consequences at our border, expand lawful pathways for
orderly migration, and coordinate enforcement efforts.   
   
This includes Mexico announcing for the first time ever that they will
accept the returns under Title 8 authorities of nationals of Cuba,
Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela so that we can continue the parole
processes that have been so successful in reducing migration from those
countries.  
   
It includes working with Colombia and Panama to launch a historic
anti-smuggling campaign in the Darién to target criminal networks that
prey on migrants.  
   
And it includes dramatically scaling up the number of removal flights we
can operate to countries throughout the hemisphere, including Colombia,
Peru, and Ecuador.  
   
We are — we are a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.  We are
doing everything possible to enforce those laws in a safe, orderly, and
humane way.   
   
We are working with countries throughout the region, addressing a
regional challenge with regional solutions.  
   
We again, yet again, call on Congress to pass desperately needed
immigration reform and deliver the resources, clear authorities, and
modernize processes that we need.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay.  Sorry, just making sure.  Hi, Secretary Mayorkas.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Good afternoon.  
   
Q    I have two questions.  One is: How do you decide which
nationalities are going to be able to use the legal pathways, for
example, with the Venezuelans and the Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans? 
How did you decide who is allowed to avail themselves of legal pathways
and who isn’t, on that particular track?  
   
And then I have a —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  For the parole programs —  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  — that — yes.  So what we did is we met the need
with the parole programs.  That was the demographic that was causing us
the greatest challenge at our southern border, and we tailored our
parole processes accordingly.  
   
Q    So is it possible that those nationalities could shift as you see
shifting nationalities at the border?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So we have shifted our programs according to the
needs that we need to meet.  So you’ll recall perhaps that in November
we developed the parole process for Venezuelans.  That was then the most
significant challenge.  We pivoted in January to not only expand the
program for Venezuelans but also expand it for Cubans, Haitians, and
Nicaraguans.  So we will meet the moment.  
   
Q    And then, on overcrowding.  If the Border Patrol facilities are
overcrowded and some migrants have to be released, does that send the
very message you’re trying to avoid, which is that people will be
released into the interior?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So I have to say two things in response.  Number
one: We cannot overstate the extraordinary talent and heroism of the
United States Border Patrol and the personnel of the Department of
Homeland Security that are managing through an extraordinary challenge
and doing so successfully.  Number one.  
   
Number two: It is very important to understand that the great majority
of people will be removed if they do not qualify for relief under the
laws of the United States.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nancy.  
   
Q    Thank you very much, Secretary Mayorkas.  You talked about all the
personnel that you’re surging to the border.  You didn’t mention FEMA
personnel.  And the mayors and county judges in border towns that we’ve
spoken to say that what they really need is not just FEMA dollars but
FEMA personnel themselves to house and feed these migrants as your
department releases them.  
   
Why not send FEMA personnel to the border the way you would in any other
emergency?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Well, the — the deployment of FEMA personnel is
specific to a particular type of emergency, an emergent event.  This is
an ongoing challenge that, quite frankly, has vexed this country for
decades, because this country has been unable — Congress has been unable
to pass immigration reform that everyone agrees and understands is
desperately needed.  
   
We are working with an immigration system that was last reformed in the
1990s.  Migration has changed dramatically since then, and we need our
laws updated.  
   
Q    So are you saying that basically your hands are tied and you can’t
send FEMA personnel even if you wanted to?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  No, I’m — I’m not saying that at all.  And, as a
matter of fact, our FEMA personnel are coordinating with local
communities and cities across the country to provide them with the
information they need.  And FEMA is going to be playing a pivotal role
in our Shelter and Services Program that is poised to distribute $363
million to cities and communities in need of funding.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, JJ.  
   
Q    I’m wondering about your communications with foreign countries. 
Have you had conversations in the last couple days or so with any
foreign government officials ahead of this lifting?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So I should take a step back and say: When I speak
of the fact that it is a regional challenge for which reas- — regional
solutions are needed, let me — let me put a finer point on that.   
   
There are approximately 20 million displaced people throughout our
hemisphere.  The challenge that we are encountering at our southern
border is by no means unique to the southern border of the United
States.  And I have learned that powerfully, not only through the
information and analysis that we undertake in the United States
government but in our conversations with our foreign partners.  
   
Just this week, I spoke with the foreign secretary of Panama.  Last
week, I spoke with the President of Guatemala.  Three weeks ago, I was
in Panama to speak with the Panamanian foreign minister and the
Colombian foreign minister.   
   
We are engaged and, of course, Secrede- — Secretary Blinken is leading
the diplomatic engagements.  
   
Diplomacy is a key pillar of our effort.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, April.  And then I’ll come to you.  
   
Q    My question is — I want to — I want to focus in on Black migrants
from Africa and the Caribbean nations.  Nana Gyamfi, who has met with
President Biden on this issue, and other civil rights leaders said that
the lifting of Title 42 suppresses Black asylum seekers who are required
to ask for asylum in countries they transit through.  Many of those
countries are too dangerous for Black migrants to request asylum.  And
she gives the example of the African Americans who traveled to Mexico. 
Some were killed.  They were thought to be Haitian migrants.   
   
What do you say to that?  And what is an eff- — is there an effort?  And
what will you do to safety net or safeguard some of these Black migrants
who are trying to come now for asylum who are in countries or transiting
through countries where they cannot ask for asylum through — under the
laws that the Biden administration has put in place?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So let me — let me share with you one way in which
migration has changed dramatically over the years.  It is no longer the
case that individuals can on their own reach the southern border of the
United States.  They have to place their lives and their life savings in
the hands of ruthless smugglers that exploit them, and ruthlessly do
so.  And we have not only a security obligation but a humanitarian
obligation to cut those smugglers out.  And that is indeed what we are
doing. 

And this President, President Biden, has rebuilt our refugee processing
capabilities and has committed to a large number of refugee admissions
to the United States. 

Our President, President Biden, has expanded lawful pathways for
migrants like no other president past.

And what we are doing is we are extending an out- — outstretched arm of
humanitarian relief to reach people where they are so they do not have
to place their lives in the hands of those smuggling organizations.

Q    But the southern border — but the so- — the southern border is not
just Mexicans, it is Haitians, it’s Africans, as we — as we’ve seen,
particularly with that issue with the Haitians being whipped with the
reins on the horses.  What is there —

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Well, let me just correct you right there, because
—

Q    Please correct me.

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Act- — actually, the investigation concluded that
the whipping did not occur.

Q    I’m sorry, I saw it differently.  They were whipped with something
from the horse — reins from a horse.  I — I — maybe the video or the
picture was fixed, but what I saw was totally different.  I’m sorry —

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Yeah, I’m going to leave you as —

Q    Yes, I know.  But —

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  — corrected.

Q    But what happened — again, the Mexican border is not just Mexicans;
it’s Africans and Haitians.  What is there in place, as you hear from
people who are advocates for immigrants, like Nana Gyamfi, to help those
who are trying to seek asylum in place — from places like Haiti that has
gangs?  They can’t even have an election because things — the atrocities
there are just so great.

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, a few — a few responses.   
   
Number one, we have set up the CBP One app to enable people to make
appointments and arrive at ports of entry safely if they qualify for
exceptions under the public health authority of Title 42, which, of
course is set to expire at 11:59 p.m.

We have admitted approximately 740 people through that CBP One app per
day.  The majority of the individuals admitted have been Haitian.  We
are expanding that CBP One app to reach as many as a thousand people a
day.   
   
And we are setting up regional processing centers throughout the region,
working very closely with countries to the south, working with Colombia
and others.  And we expect to set up as many as 100 or more of those
processing centers that will be open to people of all nationalities to
obtain humanitarian relief.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jeremy.

Q    Thank you.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here.  The President
said this week that the situation on the southern border is going to be
chaotic for a while.  Given the fact that you’ve had nearly two years to
prepare for this moment, how can chaos be the expectation?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Well, I have said for months and months that the
challenge at the border is and is going to be very difficult.  And we
have spoken repeatedly about the fact that that difficulty may actually
only increase at this time of transition.

It is going to take a period of time for our approach to actually gain
traction and show results.  And I’ve been very clear about that.

The fundamental reason — the fundamental reason why we have a challenge
at our border and we’ve had this challenge many a time before is because
we are working within the constraints of a broken — a fundamentally
broken immigration system.  And we also are operating on resources that
are far less than those that we need and that we’ve requested.

Q    But some of the — some of the measures that you have been talking
about to put in place to mitigate this surge, some of those aren’t even
in place yet.  It was — it wasn’t until two weeks ago that you announced
these plans to open these regional processing centers.  As far as I’m
aware, they’re not open yet.  Of the 1,500 troops that the President
deployed, only 550 are actually on the ground. 

So, given how long you have known that Title 42 is ending on May 11th,
why aren’t all these measures already in place?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, we have implemented measures well before those
few that you identify.  Our parole processes would be an example.  While
we deployed 1,500 additional Department of Defense personnel, we’ve had
2,500 Department of Defense personnel well in place already.

We have surged resources of all types over months and months, not just
personnel but transportation facilities, technology, additional bed
space.  So we have been, in fact, not —

Q    You’re confident you’ve done all you can at this point?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We have done all we can with the resources that we
have and within the system that we are operating under.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Peter, go ahead.

Q    I’ll ask a couple questions, Mr. Secretary.  Thanks for being
here.   
   
First, on the CBP One app that you were speaking about right now. 
Migrants that are speaking to journalists, including our reporters on
the ground, have indicated a series of frustrations.  They say they’re
having trouble logging on.  They’re having trouble getting
appointments.  They’re having trouble with language barriers; perhaps
they speak Indigenous languages or others.  And they’re seeing technical
glitches right now.  
So what specifically is being done to fix that right now?  And does that
app provide false hope to these migrants coming that will only lead to
future frustration and surges, like we saw from Venezuelans only a
matter of months ago?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, we have seen a tremendous acceptance of the CBP
One app.  We are utilizing it very effectively, as I referenced earlier
in response to the reporter’s prior question — that 740 people per day
are reaching our port of entry.  Those, by the way, are not individuals
who’ve only made appointments, but actually a fraction of the people who
have made appointments using the CBP One app.  It has proven
successful.  
   
We have identified glitches, and we’ve done so not unilaterally,
exclusively, but also by speaking with individuals who have used the
app, by speaking with migrants here in the United States who have
reached the United States, as well as actually going into Mexico and
meeting with migrants to understand the challenges.  
   
If I may — so, we have addressed the challenges of which we are
aware.   
   
The greatest challenge with respect to the CBP One app is not a
technological challenge but rather the fact that we have many more
migrants than we have the capacity to make appointments for.   
   
The greatest level of frustration is actually being able to make the
appointment, not the utility of the CBP One app itself.  That is, again,
another example of a broken immigration system.  
   
Q    If I could follow up on a foreign policy question, though, very
broadly — just quickly.  The U.S. sanctions — the U.S. has sanctions
right now on a series of foreign nations: on Cuba, on Venezuela, on
Nicaragua.  So, does the Biden administration’s foreign policy make this
situation worse?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, I’m going to leave that to our foreign policy
specialists.  But I will — I will say this: The predicate of those
principles are separate and apart from the immigration challenge that
we’re confronting.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Terry.  And we’re going to try and get around.  Terry,
go ahead.  And then I’ll go to the back.  
   
Q    Given the time you say this is going to take and based on what
you’re seeing now at the southern border and beyond in Mexico, I wonder
if you could offer some details, paint a picture.  What should Americans
in those border communities and beyond expect in the coming days and
weeks?  What’s this going to look like for them?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We could see very crowded — as we are now — we
could see very crowded Border Patrol facilities.  I cannot overstate the
strain on our personnel and our facilities.   
   
But we know how to manage through such strain.  As difficult as it will
be, I have tremendous confidence and pride in our personnel.   
   
Let me share with you an example of how we manage through a very
difficult situation.  
   
In El Paso, Texas, we saw individuals on the street.  We engaged in a
very sensitive and humane law enforcement operation to address that
challenge.  And we successfully have done so to the praise of the city
of El Paso.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Michael?  
   
Q    And can I just follow up?  Our teams in El Paso say that there are
hundreds of migrants now in the open, in shelter with very limited
access to food and water and bathrooms for days.  Why aren’t they being
processed?  Is that what we can expect?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, we are working very closely with nonprofit
organizations, with community groups to really deli- — deliver a
community response to the challenge.  
   
I cannot understate — I’m sorry, I cannot overstate how much of a
challenge it is going to be and how we all have to deal with it as one
administration and one country.  
   
Fundamentally — fundamentally, we need Congress to act.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Michael.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for doing this.  Is this
exclusively a challenge at the land border, or are you also seeing an
increase in irregular migration by sea to Florida and to California, for
that matter?  
   
And then secondly, on the regional processing centers, I know that your
staff has said that you’ll have more announcements on exactly where
those will be in the coming days.  But just to echo my colleague’s
point, you know, did you want those to be ready ahead of the expiration
of Title 42?  And can you give any details on exactly where those
processing centers will be?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, with respect to maritime migration: A number of
months ago, we were experiencing pressure in the maritime environment,
and we responded to that pressure with increased resources.  
   
It is incredibly perilous for individuals to take to the seas.  The
search and rescue operations that the United States Coast Guard has to
undertake all too often to rescue people — those seas are rough, and the
vessels that they use are extraordinarily flimsy, and we see death on
the high seas.  
   
And so, we — we plussed up our resources — our Coast Guard resources. 
We also activated more robustly the reunification programs that give a
lawful pathway for individuals to reach a country of safety.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Brian.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  There was a second part to that question.  Sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m so sorry.  I’m sorry, Michael.  Trying to get
as many —  
   
Q    No, I know.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — people as I can.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Oh, the regional processing centers.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sorry about that.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  I apologize.  
   
So, the regional processing centers — that’s not something that the
United States can set up unilaterally within a matter of weeks.  This is
a — this is a subject that requires a diplomacy.  We rely on our foreign
partners, and it takes a great deal of partnering not only with the
partners themselves but also with the international organizations that
are part of the fabric of international human- — humanitarian relief:
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International
Organization for Migration, and others.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Brian.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  A bus of migrants from Texas
arrived in front of the Vice President’s office this morning — the Vice
President’s house this morning.  What’s your response to — to that — to
more buses of migrants being sent from Texas to Washington, D.C.?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  It is a both sad and tragic day when a government
official uses migrants as a pawn for political purposes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here.  On
the memo that the U.S. Border Patrol chief sent to sector chiefs last
night allowing for parole releases if overcrowding becomes an issue —
that’s not Title 8, like you said would happen.  I mean, these migrants
don’t get an alien registration number that would be used to track
them.  They don’t get a court date.  They’re instead asked to
self-report to ICE within 60 days.   
   
You said at the beginning that you’ve prepared for this moment for
almost two years.  So why is part of that plan an honor system?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Oh, it is — it is not an honor system.  What we —
what we do is we use the resources that we have to meet the challenges
that we confront.  This is a tool that has been used in the past.  The
vast majority of individuals will indeed be placed in expedited removal
and, if they do not qualify, will be removed in a matter of days, if not
weeks, from the United States.   
   
When we — when we encounter a volume of individuals for which we need to
address in a different way, we do so.  If those individuals do not honor
their commitment to surrender to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement
Officer to be able to be placed in enforcement proceedings, they are a
subject of our apprehension efforts.    
   
Q    You said that it would be a fraction of migrants that this happens
with.  How many is a fraction when you’ve had almost 6 million illegal
crossings under this administration?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We, last year, removed, returned, and expelled
approximately 1.4 million individuals.  That is the most in any one
year.   
   
Q    Will you be on shaky legal ground though with mass releases?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Well, first of all —  
   
Q    Or will this be on a case-by-case basis?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  First of all, your — your question has a factual
predicate with which I would disagree about mass releases, number
one.   
   
But releases of individuals subject to immigration enforcement
proceedings is not something particular to this administration.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) on a case-by-case —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We got to keep — we got to —  
   
Q    — basis, and this would not be on a case-by-case basis.   
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We — we implement our operations in conjunction
with the Department of Justice, and we have confidence in the lawfulness
of our actions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Mr. Secretary, are you concerned that the new asylum
regulations will encourage more children to leave their families since
unaccompanied kids are exempt?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  No.  No, we are — no, we are not.  It is an
obligation for us to address the needs of unaccompanied children.  So,
we are — we do not have that concern.   
   
And what we are driving to — what we are fundamentally driving to is to
build lawful pathways so people do not have to take — have to make those
difficult decisions, and they don’t have to take the dangerous journey
in the first place.   
   
And we are expanding lawful pathways to an unprecedented degree under
the President’s leadership.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Mr. Secretary, just one more.  What is your assessment of Mexico’s
enforcement of the border?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We are working very closely with the government of
Mexico.  The President has spoken with the President of Mexico as
recently as earlier this week.  They have corresponded last week.   
   
And Mexico is taking very important enforcement measures that we greatly
appreciate and that were taken in coordination with us.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Peter.  
   
Q    Yeah, so, Mr. Secretary, how is the administration redirecting the
immigration judges to prioritize new arrivals?  And will that affect the
backlog that’s already there for previous arrivals?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So — so, Peter, your — your question, if I may,
just to hit this point once again — your question speaks of an
immigration court backlog that is — exceeds 2 million cases.  What a
powerful example of a broken immigration system.   
   
Not only are we surging asylum officers — about a thousand asylum
officers — to conduct credible fear screenings in the context of
expedited removal, but the Department of Justice is surging immigration
judges alongside us.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Steven.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Sir, if I could ask you about the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sorry, Peter.   
   
Q    It’s all right.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m trying to get — sorry, go ahead.  
   
Q    The Title 8 enforcement you’re talking about — you’re trying to
send a message.  Your — the critics of the administration would argue
this is a message that you could and probably should have sent earlier
on in the administration.  Can you walk us through the deliberation? 
How did you arrive at the idea that there should be a presumption of
ineligibility and why was that policy not announced earlier?   
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, in response to your precise question, we sought
to end Title 42, the public health authority earlier.  We sought to roll
out our immigration enforcement authorities under Title 8 of the United
States Code earlier.  We were enjoined from doing so by a court.  
   
Q    But specifically, the asylum policy, the presumption of
inadmissibility — why not come out with that sooner?  You’re trying to
send a message now.  And —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  It’s not a — it’s not a message.  We — we don’t
promulgate a regulation.  We don’t promulgate a law to send a message. 
We promulgate a law to achieve a policy and operational outcome.   
   
And the outcome that we seek to achieve through this regulation is to
incentivize people to take the lawful pathways and disincentivize them
to place their lives in the hands of ruthless smugglers.  
   
Q    But, respectfully, sir, it’s on the screen behind you as
deterrence: “New regulation directing migrants…”  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  That’s not a — that’s not a message.  That’s a —
that’s an impact on human behavior.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  We got to — go ahead.  Go ahead.  I’ll go to
the back.  Right here.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank — thank you, Secretary.  First, have you ruled
out family detention as an option?   
   
And then, two, you said that you have many more migrants than you have
appointments for, so is there any effort to try to expand the
appointments?  And do you have numbers for how many appointments are
confirmed per day?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, we are indeed expanding the use of CBP One app
from approximately 740 arrivals at our ports of entry along the southern
border to 1,000 a day.  And we w- — are exploring what other
capabilities we can add to that.  
   
And the first part of your question was family detention.  This
administration ended family detention in March of 2021.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    And so you’re not going to bring it back at all?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We’ve made — we’ve made it clear that families who
are in immigration enforcement proceedings — including in expedited
removal proceedings, a more accelerated immigration enforcement process
— will be on alternatives to detention.  The conditions of alternatives
to detention may be increased as the situation warrants.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Increased to — to what?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, for example, we could place heads of household
under curfews so that we are better able to monitor their activities
and, I should say, their compliance with our restrictions and
obligations to appear in court.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, (inaudible).  
   
Q    Me?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Secretary —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Can you orient me?  Sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  VOA, and then we’ll keep going to the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Mr. Secretary, can you describe how you will be
treating any differently migrants at the border that come from countries
where we don’t have close working relationship?  For example, we’ve seen
reporting of migrants coming as far from China, Russia, Syria.  
   
And then my second question, I’m going to try to ask Peter’s question a
different way.  With some Democrats urging that President Biden end
sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela, do you support that?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, the — you speak of different demographics
arriving at our — our southern border.  This speaks to the fact that the
challenge of migration is not exclusive to the southern border and is,
in fact, not exclusive to the Western Hemisphere.   
   
It — we are seeing a global displacement of people that is the greatest
since at least World War Two.   
   
The challenge of encountering individuals from countries that are — to
which it’s not easy to remove people has been a longstanding challenge
that our immigration laws have run into.  
   
Q    So what do you do with those people actually now, people who are
coming from Russia and China and so on?  What do you do with them?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, we place them in — in immigration enforcement
proceedings.  And they make a cl- — if they make a claim for relief, we
adjudicate those claims.  And if in fact those claims are granted, then
they have, under our laws, a basis on which to stay in the United
States.  If they do not, then we work with foreign governments to
address the enforcement actions that we think are appropriate.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Way in the back.  
   
Q    And do you support any sanctions?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  That is a little bit outside the remit of today’s
discussion.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Way in the back, in the fuchsia.  
   
Q    Secretary, thank you.  So you’re talking about Congress needing to
act on this.  Any reaction to the immigration package that House
Republicans are looking to vote on today?   
   
And second question, on the processing centers: Was it a mistake to not
have them ready to prevent a surge?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Can you repeat the second part of that question? 
And I would say the President — President Biden presented Congress with
a legislative package on day one of this administration, now about 28
months ago, and we are hopeful that sensible and needed legislative
reform will be passed by Congress, and we do not concur with the bill
that was presented today.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    So, on the processing centers specifically, though, was it a
mistake to not have them ready in time to prevent a surge?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  As — as I have said, the development of those
processing centers is a complex undertaking that requires the work of
our foreign partners, international organizations, and the like, and
we’ve moved very swiftly.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Franco.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you, Secretary.  Republicans repeatedly
seek to paint the administration as being unable to secure the border. 
I wanted to ask: Do you see this as a test?  Does the administration see
this as a test or possibly an opportunity to show the American people
that the administration does have the ability to manage the border under
difficult circumstances?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We — we view this as a challenge, a challenge that
we will meet.  
   
Q    May I also ask, in regards to the overcrowding and some of these
difficult conditions, how long are we talking that this chaotic-ness
will be?  Are we talking weeks, months, years before things take
traction and you get more of a handle on it?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We are working as hard as we can to make sure that
that time it takes is as little as possible.  Let me say an additional
thing in — in response to your — your first question.   
   
This is a challenge, and we’re — we’re going to meet this challenge. 
We’re going to meet it within a broken immigration system while adhering
to our values.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Go ahead, Sabrina.  
   
Q    Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Last year, there were some
estimates from DHS officials putting the highest level of migrants
coming across the border each day at about 18,000 if Title 42 is
revoked.  Is that still the estimate or do you have a clearer number of
what you’re anticipating?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, let me clarify the numbers — the number that —
to which you refer.  Those weren’t predictions.  It is our
responsibility in the Department of Homeland Security and across the
administration to plan for different scenarios.  That’s what we do.  And
so, what we developed was, in fact, different scenarios to which we
plan.  And so, we have done so and we continue to do so.  
   
Q    And then, you know, you’ve talked about this being a challenging
transition period, but how long do you expect a potential surge to
last?  Are we talking weeks, months, longer?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We have confidence in the approach that we are
taking, which is to — to really present lawful pathways for individuals
to take advantage of and to disincentivize individuals from — from
really placing their lives in the hands of smugglers.  
   
And let me s- — let me share with you that the parole processes that we
announced and implemented on January 5th for Cubans, Haitians,
Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans are a proof point of the success of our
approach.  We saw a tremendous demand to access those lawful pathways
and we saw a 90 — over 90 percent drop in the number of encounters of
individuals from those four countries at our southern border.  And we
saw that very, very quickly.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  A couple more.  Go ahead, Phil.  
   
Q    Republicans have challenged you on this point on Capitol Hill, and
I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond.  You know, they point to
Border Patrol’s own numbers, which show that, going back to October of
last year, there were more than a million apprehensions, but then there
were also more than 530,000 “got-aways.”  That’s roughly the size of the
population of the city of Baltimore.  How can you say that the border is
not open?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, we removed, returned, and expelled 1.4 million
people last year.  Ask those 1.4 million people if — if they think the
border is open.  Our apprehension rate at the border is consistent with
the appreha- — apprehension rate in prior years —  
   
Q    And then, in El Paso, they’ve declared a state of emer- —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  — thanks to the extraordinary work of the United
States Border Patrol.  
   
Q    Thank you.  And in Palso \[sic\] — in El Paso, they’ve declared a
state of emergency, but we’ve also seen this in other cities like New
York and Chicago.  I’m wondering, while so much of the focus is on the
southern border itself, can you tell us more about the steps that DHS is
taking to support those cities elsewhere as, you know, this surge
affects not just that geography but other cities and states across the
country?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  I would say the — a number of things.  Number one,
we’re grateful to Leader Schumer and Congress for the Emergency Food and
Shelter Program funding in the omnibus this past December of $800
million.  That’s a significant increase over the prior year’s funding of
$150 million. 

We’re working very closely with cities and communities along the border
and in the interior of the United States.  We need the system fixed.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Toluse.

Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Back to the question of mass
releases.  I know you’ve pushed back against that, but the Florida
attorney general has filed a lawsuit against you, alleging that you are
about to conduct a policy of mass releases with the news that was
released yesterday. 

What’s your response to that?  And more broadly, what’s your message to
the judicial branch, who is playing a role in this process as well?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Well, I don’t — I don’t send messages to the
judicial branch.  The judges make the decisions that they believe are
warranted under the facts and laws before them. 

But I will say this: It is — it is interesting to see some of the tools
that we employ that are successful or operationally needed to be
challenged at the — in — in the courts.

So, for example, the parole process that we announced and implemented on
January 5th for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. 
Immediately, that demonstrated a reduction in the number of those
individuals arriving at our southern border of over 95 percent.  And
yet, it’s been challenged in a court. 

And so our parole authority, when we use it to release a fraction of the
people whom we encounter and that is challenged, I question the motives
of the plaintiffs.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Following up on the Emergency Food and Shelter
Program that you just mentioned.  Groups in El Paso that are helping to
feed and house this influx of migrants, they say this program has a
problem in that the funding can only be used to help migrants who have
encountered DHS and been processed.  Is that requirement realistic to
the situation that these communities are facing?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  It is — it is necessary.  And I should say, this
past Friday, under the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, we
distributed $332 million, primarily to border communities.  We now have
— under the new structure that the omnibus that Congress equipped us
with, we now have the Shelter and Services Program that we in the
Department of Homeland Security will control.  That will prove, I think,
more nimble.  And we, I think, have 363 —

Q    But that still will have that same restriction, that it has to be —
can only be used for migrants who have been processed.  So what about
those that have not been processed?  Is that not — is there no way to
help with addressing the humanitarian need there?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, to — just to finish my thought, I think we have
about $363 million to distribute through the Shelter and Services
Program.  And I believe that nongovernmental organizations in the cities
address the needs of individuals who have not been processed.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Three more.  Go ahead.

Q    Thank you so much, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible.)

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  If you could raise your hand so I can orient —  
   
Q    Sorry.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I was pointing to you, (inaudible), but go ahead,
Raquel.

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  — orient visually.

Oh, yeah.  Thank you.

Q    Thank you so much, Karine and Mr. Secretary.  So they were saying
here that Republicans have changed — (inaudible) the administration — on
the border.  But at the same time, some Democrats are saying that
President Biden broke his promise of having a more humane immigration
system and that he is finishing Trump’s job. 

So, I ask you: How is it more humane to expel people and penalize them,
people who are fleeing violence and poverty?  You were just saying that
the number of the deportation was the highest last year of any year.

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So let me just — the words have legal
significance.  So an expulsion is what happens under the public health
authority of Title 42.  We sought to end the application of Title 42
some time ago.  
This administration stands markedly different than the prior
administration.  Markedly different. 

We have, in fact, a Family Reunification Task Force that has now
reunified, I think, more than 700 families that were cruelly separated. 
We have — by the prior administration.

We have rescinded the public charge rule that punishes individuals
who’ve migrated to the United States just for accessing public resources
to which they are entitled.

We have granted temporary protected status to quite a number of
countries.

This President has led the unprecedented expansion of lawful pathways. 
We stand markedly different than the prior administration.  We do not
resemble it at all. 

What we do — and, by the way, we have rebuilt an asylum system that was
dismantled in the prior administration.   
   
We have resumed refugee processing ar- — all around the world.  And
these regional processing centers are going to accelerate the — (coughs)
— pardon me — the refugee process in an unprecedented way. 

We are a nation of immigrants, and we are a nation of laws.  And those
laws provide that if one qualifies for humanitarian relief, then one has
established the basis to remain in the United States.  And if one has
not, then one is to be removed.  And that is exactly what is going to
happen.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, Ed.  (Inaudible.)

(Cross-talk.)

We got- — we got to go.  We’re — we’re out of time.  Go ahead, Ed.

Q    So — so, you talked about cost.  What’s the rough cost to American
taxpayers since the roughly 4 million people have come into this country
illegally, since January of 2021?  As those people show up in community
hospitals, as they enter the school system, as they get other government
help — do you have a taxpayer cost?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Let me turn that question around a little bit,
because I’m going to turn it around to match the question that an
international partner asked of me.  And the question that the
international partner asked of me is, “What is the economic cost of your
broken immigration system?”  Since there are businesses around this
country that are desperate for workers, there are desperate workers
looking for jobs in — desperate workers in foreign countries that are
looking for jobs in the United States where they can earn money lawfully
and send much-needed remittances back home.  What is the cost of a
broken immigration system?  That is the question that I am asked, and
that is the question that I pose to Congress, because it is
extraordinary.  
   
Q    But do you have — do you have the cost that the taxpayers are
paying now?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  I — I believe I have addressed your question.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, final two.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    I wanted to ask one more on the regional processing centers.  I
know you said it takes a ton of coordination, but can you give any more
detail as to what’s standing in between these actually being stood up? 
Is it a personnel thing?  Is it a matter of nailing down location,
working out agreements with international partners?  Just a little bit
more on that.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Yes.   
   
Q    All of them?  (Laughter.)  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:    Yes.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Yes.  It — it — it — there are a lot of moving
pieces.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Me?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  So I just wanted to ask about messaging,
because, for years, the administration has said that the border is
closed, and migrant crossings continue to notch records.  And you just
said that your message to migrants who are traveling unlawfully is: Do
not spend your life savings coming here only to be apprehended if and
when you arrive here.  But I’m wondering what you think it will take for
that message to land.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  The question is a very important one because it
speaks of two things.  One is, of course, the efforts we make.  But the
second is a phenomenon that we are confronting, and that is the
smuggling organizations that spread disinformation to vulnerable
migrants.  They lie to migrants.   
   
And as a matter of fact, when I was in Panama, speaking to my
counterpart — the Foreign Secretary in Panama and the Secretary — the
Minister of Security — they were speaking of the fact that smugglers in
that region of the world, before the migrants enter the Darién, an
incredibly treacherous terrain, they are deceived into thinking that
they are going to be on a two-day tour.   
   
And so, the smuggling organizations prey on the vulnerability of
migrants and exploit that vulnerability solely for profit.   
   
We are communicating to migrants in country to communicate the truth,
the dangers of the journey, the exploitation of the smugglers.  And just
yesterday, we announced an extraordinary digital campaign to amplify
that messaging, which is so vital.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Final — final question right there.   
   
Q    I was just wondering if you could put some specifics on this plan. 
Let’s say Border Patrol catches 10,000 migrants tomorrow.  Of those, how
many are going to be detained?  How many will be caught and released? 
And how many will be removed and returned within 72 hours?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So let me — let me share with you that we have
already encountered 10,000 individuals in a single day.  You know, so we
already have proven that we can manage through that.  We have surged
resources — not just the Department of Homeland Security, but the
Department of Justice in bringing immigration judges to work alongside
asylum officers — to address the expedited removal process.  We have
surged the resources that we have, given the resources that we have been
given by Congress, which is less than what we need and less than what we
requested, to meet the challenge to the best of our abilities.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, sir.  Appreciate it.   
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Thank you very much, Karine.  Thank you all.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.   
   
Q    Mr. Secretary, would you call it a crisis?  
   
Q    Are you going to the border anytime soon?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, guys, we are way over time.  So even our amazing
cleaning crew has come in a couple times.  (Laughter.)  So I can take a
couple of questions, but we have to — we really have to wrap up.  We’ve
been going for almost I think about an hour, if not close.   
   
Okay.  Yeah.  
   
Q    Karine?   
   
Q    Karine, in the back, please?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It has to be somebody I haven’t called on yet.   
   
Q    Yeah, right back.  Right here.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  Way — way in the back.  Right there.   
   
Q    Thank you so much.  New Hampshire’s Michael Delaney was not among
the stalled nominees the Judiciary Committee voted on today, with
Senator Dianne Feinstein back in Washington.  Does President Biden still
support him among apparent concerns from some Democrats?  And what is
the White House doing to get him over the finish line?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we take our — our nominees very seriously. 
The President clearly puts forth nominees that he believes are — are
ready and equipped for the job.  And so, of course, we’re always going
to be — make sure that we do everything that we can — having
conversations with the senators and their staff — to try to move our
nominees through.  So we are committed, for certain.  
   
You had another question in there.  It was — oh, and then you mentioned
Senator Fein- — Feinstein.  We’re — we’re glad to see her back.   
   
As you know, she is a longtime friend of — of the President.  And — and
we’re — we’ve been — he’s been wishing her a speedy recovery and is glad
to see her back — back in — back in the Senate.  And I’ll leave that
there.  
   
I’m trying to figure out who — go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Has the President reached out to Senator Manchin
after he said he’ll vote against the EPA nominees?  Or what’s the plan
to get these nominees through if not?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I don’t have anything more to say than what
I shared yesterday on the — on Senator Manchin’s comments.   
   
Look, Senator Manchin is a friend.  We’ve been able to do really
historic — move forward some historic pieces of legislation with Senator
Manchin, including the Inflation Reduction Act and other bipartisan
infrastructure bills and — law now — and other pieces of legislation.  
   
So we are going to continue to have conversations with him.  We’re going
to continue to have a good relationship.  I just don’t have anything
more than what I shared yesterday.  
   
Go ahead, Aurelia.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  Can you update on the talks about the debt
ceiling?   
   
And related to this, Donald Trump yesterday said that Republicans should
actually trigger default if they don’t get spending cuts.  Does that
make a default more likely?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I would remind you all what he said in
2019.   
   
And first, I got to be super, super careful.  Let me just say that
first.  We respect the rule of law.  He is a — we know — a presidential
candidate.   
   
But what I will say more broadly and focus on what — what he said in
2019, how — I’m paraphrasing here — how defaulting is not something that
we should be doing.  And so, the question is: What has changed?  What
has changed now from 2019 to today?  
   
Look, we’ve been very clear that Congress needs to do their job.  They
must do their job.  It’s their constitutional duty to get this done. 
We’ve done it three times under the last administration.  We’ve done it
78 times since 1960.  
   
But also, like I said, want to be very careful because he is a — he is a
presidential candidate.  But I can speak to 2019 and his comments about
the importance of — of making sure that we do not default and we’re not
a deadbeat nation.   
   
Okay.  Let me see.  Go ahead, (inaudible).  I haven’t called on you.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I have another question on the situation at the
southern border.  So, even ahead of the chaos of this week, morale
amongst Border Patrol agents is low.  They’ve been through a lot with
the ongoing surge of people coming across the border.  And according to
the Acting Deputy Commissioner of the CBP, 36 agents died by suicide in
the last three years alone.  So what is President Biden doing to show
America’s frontline police that he hears them and that he cares about
the unprecedented issues they’re facing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And so, look, our hearts go out to those families of —
of those law enforcement members who, as you just stated, took their
lives.  
   
So, look, Secretary Mayorkas spoke to this.  He actually lifted up the —
the CBP and said the work that they’re doing is truly trem- —
tremendous.   
   
This is why the President has taken this so seriously, making sure that
we have troops that go down to the border so that they can give some
relief to the CBP — the patrol, the law enforcement — and be able — so
that they can be able to do their jobs.  Right?  And so that’s why we
put that — we put forth.  
   
And what we have seen on our end is — you’ve seen House Republicans who
have voted to fire 2,000 law enforcement, those C- — those same CBP
members.  They voted to fire at least 2,000, voted against giving —
giving resources for folks who are at the border, for DHS, for these law
enforcement officers.  
   
And so, the President is doing everything that he can with the tools
that he has in front of him.  That’s why he asked Congress on his first
day: Please, we have a comprehensive plan in front of you, we want you
to — we want you to take a look at this, we want to fix a system that
has been broken for decades — you heard the Secretary said since
1990s.  
   
And so, it is time to get to work.  The President is doing everything
that he can.  We understand there is a challenge at the border, but we
have — are going to continue to put forth a robust multi-agency process
to deal with an issue that has been around for decades and decades.   
   
I’m trying to see who I have not called.  Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Do you have updates on when the President and
congressional leaders will meet tomorrow, how much time the President is
allotting for that meeting?  And can you give us an update on the staff
meeting that took place since that principals meeting?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I —  
   
Q    And how would you characterize that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Absolutely.  So, I don’t have any updates for you yet
for tomorrow.  
   
As you know, the President asked the four leaders, the congressional
leaders, to come together again tomorrow to follow up on a conversation
that they had just a couple of days ago.  
   
As you know, we don’t read out private conversations and we certainly
don’t negotiate in public.  But I can confirm, as you all have been
reporting, that the staff met yesterday to follow up on the
conversation, to talk about congressional leaders, to — the four
congressional leaders — and how they saw moving forward on budget and
spending.   
   
That’s regular order.  That is something that has been done year after
year, to talk about appropriations.   
   
And so, the staff are meeting again today, and don’t have anything
further beyond that, but certainly we will share once we have a time and
more information and logistics to share on tomorrow’s meeting.  
   
Q    And just — just another quick one on the visit of the Spanish
president tomorrow.  Is there a two-and-two press conference that’s been
added for that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a press conference to read out to you. 
As you know, we are — the President is very much looking forward to
speaking w- — to speaking with the leader.  I just don’t have anything
more to share.  I’m sure NSC will be holding some sort of background
call and more information to share with all of you.  
   
Q    Karine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  I’m going to take one more.  Go ahead,
Courtney.  I’m just trying to call — guys, I’m trying to call on people
that I have not called on today.  
   
Q    You’ve not called on me.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, go ahead, Courtney.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You started at the top talking about the end of COVID
emergency.  Have you at this point — or has the President put in place
the plan for the White House pandemic team?  I know you don’t have a
pandemic preparedness office up yet.   
   
Dr. Jha hasn’t said if he’s leaving, but I know his team is unwinding. 
Dr. Walensky is leaving.  Can you talk a little bit about the leadership
that’s going to be in charge of the — of COVID moving forward,
especially if the tools that we have that you’ve been discussing don’t
work at a certain point or don’t work as well?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I — I don’t have anything to share.  I know you
just asked me about the COVID team.  We did — as I mentioned at the top,
we are — we do have an Office of Pandemic Preparedness, as I’ve
mentioned multiple times.  It was in the omnibus budget package for
fiscal year 2023.  So it’s — Congress called on us to establish this
office.   
   
So, we are working through that.  And once we have more information, we
will share that with all of you.  
   
I will be back tomorrow, everybody, and I will take — we’ll take more
information.  
   
Q    Howard University?  Howard University Saturday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll — I’ll be back tomorrow, guys.  Thanks,
everybody.
