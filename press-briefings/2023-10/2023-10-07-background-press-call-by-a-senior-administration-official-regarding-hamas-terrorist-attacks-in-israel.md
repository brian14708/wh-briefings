title: "Background Press Call by a Senior Administration Official Regarding Hamas\
  \ Terrorist Attacks in\_Israel"
---
 
5:20 P.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Great.  Sorry.  Apologies for the delay, everyone.  Good
evening.  And thanks, everyone, for your patience and joining our call. 
Thanks for joining this call on Hamas’s terrorist attack in Israel.  
   
As a reminder, this call will be on background, attributable to a
“senior administration official.”  For your awareness, as you heard —
not for reporting — on the line is \[senior administration official\]. 
As a reminder, the contents of this call are embargoed unto the call —
until the call concludes.  
   
With that, I’ll hand it over to \[senior administration official\], and
we’ll take Qs and As after.   
   
Over to you, \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, everybody, for joining this
call.  I just wanted to — we wanted to provide some, really, background
about — about activity and kind of flesh out some of what the President
discussed during his — during his phone call.  
   
Last night around — really, 2:30 in the morning, we were alerted to the
rocket attacks in Israel and were engaged, really, throughout the
evening with our Israeli counterparts and regional counterparts to try
to determine precisely what was unfolding.  
   
This morning at 7:00 a.m., Jake Sullivan spoke with his Israeli
counterpart.  And then shortly thereafter, around 7:30, Jake convened a
call with his national security team, including Secretary Blinken and
others.   
   
Shortly after that, around 8:15 or so, there was a call — the President
convened a call with his national security team — with Jake Sullivan,
Tony Blinken, Lloyd Austin, Bill Burns, and others.  Throughout that
call, the President received a full briefing on the situation and
developments, directed full engagement with Israeli counterparts and
with regional counterparts.  
   
Immediately after that call — right at when that call ended, the
President called Prime Minister Netanyahu.  The Prime Minister, on that
call, made very clear this was an unprecedented day for Israel.  As he
said publicly, Israel is at war.   
   
The President offered his full support for Israel and emphasized the
close coordination ongoing between our military and intelligence teams,
noted that Secretary Austin would soon be speaking with his
counterpart.  And the President and the Prime Minister agreed to remain
in regular contact, both between the two of them as leaders and also,
obviously, through our teams.  
   
Shortly thereafter, Secretary Austin discussed the situation with his
counterpart, the Minister of Defense, Gallant, in Israel — again, full
support for Israel’s military right to defend itself.  And the Secretary
issued a read-out after that call, which I’m sure you’ve seen.  
   
President Biden later called King Abdullah of Jordan.  Of course, the
President has known these two leaders for decades.  And he called the
King of Jordan in between receiving regular briefings from his — from
his team.  The King and the President also agreed to stay in regular
contact, including through our respective national security teams.   
   
Also, throughout the day, Secretary Blinken, who is here at the White
House, spoke with Israel President Herzog.  He spoke with the President
of the Palestine Authority, President Abbas; the Israeli foreign
minister; and his counterparts from Turkey, from Egypt, from Jordan,
from Saudi Arabia — (audio drops) — Italy, and others.  
   
Needless to say, Jake, Brett McGurk, Jon Finer have been in touch with
counterparts throughout the day.  State Department — Victoria Nuland,
Barbara Leaf — engaged throughout the day regional counterparts, G7,
European, and Lebanese.  
   
We remain deeply engaged as of, truly, this very moment, and one reason
I was a little late getting on the call.  This is ongoing and
continuous, likely to continue for some time.  
   
The bottom line, as the President said, the United States stands with
Israel.  The United States unequivocally condemns the appalling assault
against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza.  We have made it
absolutely clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu, but to Israeli officials
up and down, across the political spectrum and their national security
spectrum, that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support
to the government and people of Israel.  
   
And Israel has a right to defend itself and its people.  Full stop.  
   
So, how this plays out over the coming days and weeks, again, I’m not
going to speculate on this call.  But we wanted to give you just some of
the backdrop of activity here — including, obviously, the President’s
engagement from early this morning, together with his team — as this
terrible day has unfolded.  
   
So, with that, I will take some — some questions and answers.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\].  We’ll go
first to Yuna from Channel 12 from Israel.  
   
Q    Hi, \[senior administration official\].  Hi, everyone.  Was there
in the talks any specifics about aid, military aid, some numbers —
requests from Israel or anything that was discussed about that?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, again, thanks so much for your
question.  There has been a — (audio drops) — engagement with his
counterpart, but General Kurilla has been engaged with General Halevi. 
Really, up and down our military chains, just regular coordination about
some of the needs that Israel anticipates.  
   
And I am not going to get ahead of that process, nor would I likely talk
about it in any event.  But I would say that that is very much — very
much under way.  And we might have more to say about it as early as
tomorrow.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’ll go next to Steve from Reuters.  
   
Q    Hey.  Thank you.  \[Senior administration official\], did the U.S.
have any inkling that this was going to unfold?  This is being called a
massive intelligence failure in Israel.  Did we know about this and the
impact this might have on the talks toward a normalization deal?  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, Steve.  I would just say
I’m obviously not going to comment on specifics of any intelligence or
intelligence sharing.   
   
We will continue to provide Israel with support during this critical
time, including close — close, deep intelligence sharing.   
   
We have a very close partnership with Israel.  And we always share
timely intelligence about threats in the region with Israel and other
partners, but in particular with Israel.  
   
Again, the President directed his team to ensure we’re providing all
that support for Israel that it needs now.  And as this unfolds, I’m
just — I’m not going to get into any specific intelligence.  Obviously,
the Israelis, in particular, will be looking at this very closely, and
I’m not going to get ahead of that.  
   
I would just say on other things going on in the region — look, we’ve
said that we are obviously engaged in the process of normalization
between Saudi Arabia and Israel.  We’ve also said that process has a
ways to travel.  I think it’s really premature to speculate as to say —
say the impact.  
   
I would say for certain, Hamas — terrorist groups like Hamas will not
derail any such outcome, should they be possible.  I think that’s —
that’s quite certain.  But that process has a — has a ways to go, as we
have said a number of times.  
   
I would just come back to the first — the first question, I just want to
point out: When it comes to Israel’s military needs, I mean this is
something we’ve been focused on from day one of our administration. 
You’ll recall the billion-dollar allocation for Patriot interceptor
replenishment following the first Gaza war — the first time Hamas
launched a war here in 2021 — the first time in the Biden administration
— the billion-dollar replenishment for the Patriots.   
   
The Jerusalem declaration the President signed with Prime Minister Lapid
when he was in Israel talks about the full commitment to our MOU and
making sure that Israel has everything it needs to protect their
citizens and defend themselves.  
   
So, that has been an ongoing, continuous commitment that was reaffirmed
today, and we are in deep talks with the Israelis about some of their
particular needs as they respond to this terrible assault on the Israeli
state and the Israeli people.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’ll go next to Nadia from Al Arabiya.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you.  Thank you for doing this call.  \[Senior
administration official\], you mentioned that you talked also with the
Lebanese during these calls.  Do you have any assurances that the
Lebanese government will restrain Hezbollah from opening another
northern front with Israel?   
   
Also, Prime Minister Netanyahu called on Gazans to leave.  The question
is, to where?  How can the U.S. protect civilians in Gaza who will
endure collective punishment and who not necessarily agree with Hamas?  
   
And just, finally, on the — (audio drops) — people talk about a
diplomatic failure by not focusing on the heart of the matter, which is
the Palestine conflict and the rush to expand the Abraham Accords.  How
do you respond to that?  Thank you so much.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  First, on the Lebanese, I think we made
very clear — the President made very clear that anyone, any — any party
that’s hostile to Israel, seeking to take advantage of this situation,
we’d strongly warn against that.  
   
Obviously, we — you know, similar to other conflicts in Gaza — will work
with parties throughout the region to try to contain the situation in
Gaza and not spread elsewhere.  But these are decisions that will be
very important.  
   
Obviously, this was one of the topics in discussions with the Lebanese
and others — and others throughout the day.  
   
In terms of our — I think your third question, I would just say we have
been, you know, very deep — look, yes, we do not have a final outcome or
resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  But let me say: We have
been in deep, deep discussions with the Palestinians — talking to them
almost every day, every week — and the Israelis.  We brought the
Israelis and the Palestinians together in face-to-face talks twice —
really for the first time in almost a decade — in Aqaba and Sharm, and
have been working to find some rules of the road.  
   
And particularly — when it comes to security and other issues,
particularly in the West Bank and also in Gaza, working with the
Egyptian, the Qataris, and others.  So, we have really been all over
this.   
   
This was an unprovoked assault by a terrorist group, Hamas.  And that’s
what this was, and that is how — and that is also going to influence the
scope and significance of the Israeli response and, of course, our
support for Israel in that response.  
   
But that does not take away from our focus on the fundamental issue,
which you said.  That’s one reason why Secretary Blinken called
President Abbas today, had a very good call.  And needless to say, we
have been in touch with other Palestinian officials across the board
throughout the day.  
   
What was your second question, Nadia?  I’m sorry.  
   
Q    On Netanyahu calling on Gazans to leave.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  
   
Q    To where?  (Inaudible.)  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’m just — I’m not — yes, I’m not — I
actually haven’t seen that specific statement.   
   
Again, I think that the Israelis are in deep consultations about
specifically how they’re going to respond.  I think it is obviously one
of the horrific aspects of this day.  
   
We have a number of hostages that have been taken.  These are families
taken from their homes, taken off the street.  Some of them are being
held hostage in some of these Israeli towns.  Some of them we believe
have been taken to Gaza.  So, this is obviously being taken into deep
consideration by the Israelis.  
   
But, again, I’m not — I’m just not going to parse that statement, and I
haven’t seen it.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’ll go to Felicia from Financial Times.  
   
Q    Thanks, \[senior administration official\].  Just in terms of
Iran’s involvement or role in encouraging this, do you have any early
indications of what role they’re playing?   
   
And then on the question of security assistance and the Iron Dome, if
Congress needs to pass legislation to do that, does the dysfunction or
lack of a Speaker get in the way of that?  And if so, do you have any
sort of workaround?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  On you second, it’s a great question. 
It’s actually something we were discussing today, because there probably
is a role for Congress here.  And without a Speaker of the House, that
is a unique situation we’re going to have to work through.  So, I don’t
have a — an answer to you, but it is something that we have been — we
have been discussing.  
   
There’s also an important role for the Senate.  We have an Israeli —
Jack Lew is our nominee to be ambassador to Israel.  Obviously, it would
be great to have him on the ground in Israel.  And though I’ll say that
our chargé, Stephanie Hallett, is doing a superb — really superb job
throughout this crisis and in the many months before.  
   
On Iran’s involvement, I mean, look, specifically about what happened
today, it’s too early — too early to say whether, you know, the state of
Iran was directly involved or planning and supporting.  I’m not going to
get ahead of that.  We are going to be looking at that very closely.   
   
That said, there’s no doubt — look, Hamas is funded, equipped, armed by
Iran and others.  And so, that’s why we have taken action throughout
this administration to hold Iran accountable.  We’ve imposed sanctions
on Iran for support to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.  That is
going to continue — believe me.   
   
And Hamas is a terrorist group.  Full stop.  And this is — they launched
a war in 2021 through rocket attacks.  They tried again in 2022.   
   
What we’ve seen today is really an unprecedented assault, particularly
these incursions into Israeli cities and literally murdering people,
including families in their homes, taking hostages — including, we
believe, children — out of their homes.  It is just unspeakable, and we
will treat Hamas for what they are.  They are an international terrorist
organization, and I think that is really what we’re focused on right
now.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’ll go next to Ben, Haaretz.    
   
Q    Hello?  
   
MODERATOR:  We’ll go next to Ben from Haaretz.  
   
Q    Hey there.  Can you hear me?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I got you.  Yeah, I got you.  
   
Q    Good.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, so just to kind of circle back to
the point that you were making about the Sharm and Aqaba summits.  You
know, this is the worst attack in at least 50 years and possibly in
Israel’s history.  So, you know, does that not make you kind of — does
it not bring some sort of introspection about maybe the track that the
administration has been on to date is not necessarily working?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Again, this was an attack by Hamas
against the state and people of Israel.  Hamas launched a war in 2021. 
They tried to launch war in 2022.  And today, we have seen this
unprecedented response.   
   
Again, we walked into office with a situation where we have basically
severed ties entirely from the Palestinians, and we have worked to
restore that and to be — try to begin a process.  I think that’s going
to continue, but Hamas is never a part of that process.  Hamas is in
charge of Gaza, and that is a situation that we’ve been dealing with.   
   
And I think what we’re really focused on right now is trying to ensure —
and a number of ways that we’re working on this — that this does not
spread to the West Bank.  We want to try to make sure this is contained
in Gaza, as terrible as the situation in Gaza is.  But this is an attack
by Hamas.  And so even in that process, Hamas is not a part of that. 
And so, you know, I think the situation in Gaza has been unique — how we
deal with it through the Israelis, through the Qataris, through the
Egyptians, and others.   
   
But given that Gaza is controlled by a terrorist organization, it’s just
a situation we work with — through and with the Israelis and others.   
   
But I really — the focus today is on the response to this terrible —
(audio drops) — Israel and the people of Israel, and ensuring the
Israelis have what they need here to respond appropriately.  
   
MODERATOR:  Great.  Thank you.  We’ll go next to Asma Khalid from NPR.  
   
Asma?  Okay, can’t hear Asma.   
   
We’ll go next to Barak from Axios.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you.  Two questions.  First, Israeli officials said that
Prime Minister Netanyahu asked President Biden during their call for
some sort of an emergency funding for Iron Dome interceptors.  Did the
President agree?  Did the President get — ordered some sort of an
emergency funding?  
   
And second question, it seems that the Israeli Cabinet is about to
approve an all-out ground operation in Gaza.  Does the U.S. support an
Israeli ground operation in Gaza?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, Barak, on your first question, I’ll
say that — that level of detail was not specifically discussed on the
President’s call, as I recall, so I’m not sure where you got that
from.   
   
There was a discussion about ensuring, as I — as I conveyed in my
opening — ensuring knew that the Israelis had all the support they
needed and that our Secretary of Defense would shortly and almost
immediately after the call be discussing the situation with his
counterpart and General Kurilla and others, and then the leaders would
circle back up.   
   
But I think, as you saw in 2021 with the billion-dollar supplemental for
Patriot interceptor replenishment, to the extent systems have to be
replenished, that’s something we have always been committed to.  And I
think we’d be committed to it here.  But I just don’t want to go into
any — any specifics.   
   
I also am not going to comment on what the Israelis might do, might not
do, should do, should not do.  That’s just not my writ here on this
call, so I hope you can understand that.  And I’m just not going to get
into that tonight.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.  We’ll try Asma from NPR one more
time.   
   
Q    Hi.  Sorry about that.  Can you all hear me okay?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Good.  
   
Q    Great.  Thank you.  Thanks so much for doing that.  And sorry about
the tech difficulties a moment ago.  I had two questions for you,
\[senior administration official\].  One is: Can you talk a little bit
about the confidence you have in a bipartisan response, given some of
the initial response that we’ve seen from Republicans trying to
attribute this to President Biden’s actions as they related to a recent
prisoner swap in Iran?   
   
And then the second question I wanted to ask is kind of piggybacking on
an earlier question about Netanyahu’s comments on Gazans should leave
the area.  Are there or will the U.S. work with any allies in the region
to potentially offer solutions for Gazans — civilian Gazans to exit or
enter the area?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, you asked one questions which I’m
not — I’m not going to delve into the (inaudible) — the political
dimension of it.  I would certainly hope that there would be a united —
a U.S.-stands-with-Israel response here when Israel is under assault by
a terrorist group.  Those of us working on this here in the White House,
working in SCIFs and elsewhere, did not see some of that.  But I —
(audio drop) — about it.   
   
I mean, I cannot think of a more irresponsible claim to make in such a
situation.  This is about the hostage deal.  And it’s also completely
false.  And it’s just unfortunate that, you know, we have to spend our
time responding to total lies based on either a complete
misunderstanding or just a complete mischaracterization and
disinformation of facts.   
   
I think, as our Treasury Department had to put out today — just to
clarify — first of all, the agreement to secure the freedom of five U.S.
citizens from Iran in September obviously had nothing whatsoever to do
with today.  That is just factual, provable.  None of the funds that
were part of that deal have even been spent — not a single cent — or
accessed by Iran   
   
And in fact, as you know, for anyone who’s actually covered this deal,
none of those funds will ever be accessed by Iran.  They can only be
used, when they are used — and none have been used to date — to pay
vetted, third-party, non-Iranian vendors for a limited category of
humanitarian trade: food, agricultural products, medicine, medical
supplies.  That’s it.   
   
So, nobody in Iran will ever touch a single dinar or cent or rial from
those funds.  Period.  So, it’s just a total ridiculous charge, and it’s
had nothing to do with what happened today.   
   
And with such a horrific day like this, it’s just really — (audio drops)
— to spread disinformation, but we’re fully prepared, obviously, to
respond to it.  But it would be nice not to have to respond to just
totally ridiculous lies like that.   
   
Again, on this — on the Gaza statement from the prime minister: I have
to say, I have not seen that.   
   
I also — we will be working through — with the Israelis and others —
contingency scenarios.  Working with Egyptians — I’m sure — and others
about the come — what’s going to unfold over the coming days and
weeks.   
   
So, again, I’m sorry, I’m just not going to get into the speculate about
what exactly, precisely that means.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We have time for maybe one or two more.  So
we’ll go next to Hiba from Asharq News.  
   
Q    Thanks, \[senior administration official\], for doing that.  I go
back to Lebanon.  Hezbollah warned that if there’s a ground operation in
Gaza, they will start attacking from the northern borders.  What
information do you have on the situation on the northern borders?  And
did you convey a message to the Lebanese leaders about that?  
   
And my second question — on the Iranian factor.  I understand that you
said that it — it’s too early to tell if they are — to what extent they
are involved.  And you acknowledged that they are supporting Hamas.  But
would that impact any kind of talk between Biden administration and the
Iranian after this attack?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Again, on that question, what I said:
We don’t have anything to indicate Iran was involved in this specific —
what is unfolding now.   
   
But in terms of Iran’s full support for Hamas — and Hamas would not
exist without that support over many, many years and decades. 
Obviously, that is a fact.  And that is why we continue to hold Iran
accountable for its support for terrorist groups, whether Hamas or
Lebanese Hezbollah.   
   
And I will say, and I think it connects to both points: We have clearly
conveyed messages and our clear position to all relevant parties,
including partners and anyone who might seek to take advantage in any
way — which would be a huge mistake — of this situation.  So, I’m not
going to speculate on what Hassan Nasrallah or Lebanese Hezbollah might
do.  
   
But I will say, I think our position is very clear.  And one reason
we’ve been engaged throughout the region with everybody — and as I
outlined at the beginning of my call — is to make sure — (audio drop) —
about where we stand in this.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And our last question we’ll go to Vivian from
the Wall Street Journal.   
   
Q    Hello, guys.  Thanks for doing this.  All the important questions
have been touched upon.  But \[senior administration official\] — but
you only mentioned the Egyptians once in passing, and so I figured I
would ask.  The Egyptians say that they — you know, there had been
reports and also officials that we’ve talked to have said that they’ve
actually had a lot of the intelligence related to potential Hamas
attack, also a potential Hezbollah attack on the northern front.   
   
And so, I wanted to ask: Have they conveyed it to you?  Because a number
of Egyptian officials are now saying that they had informed the
Israelis, the U.S., even the Russians about a potential attack.  What
were those conversations like?  And is there any reason that we haven’t
seen a POTUS-Sisi — (audio drops) — call, as we did with the King of
Jordan, for example.  The Egyptians were obviously key to brokering a
deal in 2021.  And so I’m wondering why we haven’t seen more intensive
engagement besides just the Secretary of State, the foreign minister
level.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Vivian.  I should of — no,
we’ve been intensively engaged with the Egyptians.  Jake spoke with
Abbas Kamel earlier today.  I think we’ve had a couple of touches with
Abbas Kamel, who really is the key — the key point of contact in these
situations.  And I’m sure there will be a discussion with Sisi here at
some point.   
   
I can’t speak to what Egyptians are saying there, but I — I don’t want
to characterize the intelligence, and I don’t want to get ahead of also
what the Israelis will be looking at.   
   
But if the allegation is that we had some specific warning or indicator
from another country, it’s certainly not something that we’ve seen.  So,
I think that’s really not — not accurate, other than just general
concern — as we have had concern — about obviously rising tensions,
particularly in the West Bank, which we’ve been working very hard on.   
   
But in terms of the level of sophistication of what transpired overnight
here and what continues to transpire, that’s a very different — a
different issue.  And I have not seen anything to support that.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks, everyone for joining today’s call.   
   
As a reminder, the call today was on background, attributable to a
“senior administration official.”  The embargo is now lifted.  That is
all.   
   
Thank you very much.  Have a good evening.
