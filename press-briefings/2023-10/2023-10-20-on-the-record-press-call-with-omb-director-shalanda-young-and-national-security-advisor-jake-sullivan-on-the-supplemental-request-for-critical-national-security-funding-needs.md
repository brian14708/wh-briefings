9:31 A.M. EDT  
   
MS. WAGENSELLER:  Hey, everyone.  Thanks for joining us for an
on-the-record call to discuss critical national security needs Congress
must address for the American people. 

As a reminder, this call is on the record and embargoed until 10:30 a.m.
Eastern Time today.  

We’re joined today by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young. 
Director Young and the National Security Advisor will make a few brief
comments at the top, and then we’ll leave some time for questions at the
end.  
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Director Young.  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Hi, everyone.  Thanks for joining us today.  
   
The administration is transmitting to Congress a supplemental funding
request, which addresses critical national security needs for fiscal
year 2024.   
   
Over the coming weeks, the administration looks forward to continued
engagement with members of both parties to reach a comprehensive,
bipartisan agreement to fund the government and invest in critical
national priorities.  
   
As part of this process, Congress has an opportunity and obligation to
advance our national security by addressing these needs, which should
earn bipartisan support.  
   
This request reflects how under President Biden’s leadership, the U.S.
has rallied the world, building a coalition of more than 50 countries to
respond to Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and we are now coming to
the aid of our ally, Israel.  
   
This supplemental request invests over $50 billion in the American
defense industrial base, ensuring our military continues to be the most
ready, capable, and best-equipped fighting force the world has ever
seen.  
   
The funding will expand production lines, strengthen the American
economy, keep us safe, and create new American jobs.  
   
This request also addresses the global humanitarian impacts of Russia’s
brutal invasion of Ukraine and of Hamas’s horrific attacks on Israel,
including by extending humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza.  
   
It provides resources to ensure we can compete with China by offering
developing countries a better value proposition, and it supports U.S.
capabilities and initiatives that bolster security and stability in the
Indo-Pacific.  
   
And finally, it provides the resources our law enforcement personnel
need to keep the southwest border secure and stop the flow of fentanyl
into our country.   
   
Specifically, it includes funding for an additional 1,300 Border Patrol
agents, 375 immigration judge teams, and 1,600 asylum officers; over 100
cutting-edge detection machines to help detect fentanyl at our southwest
border ports of entry;  
and an additional 1,000 law enforcement personnel, as well as
investigative capabilities, to prevent cartels from moving fentanyl into
the country.  
   
Let me be clear: Some in Congress have said a lot about doing something
on border security while refusing to take up the $4 billion request we
sent in August to Congress.   
   
We will not be lectured by those who refuse to act.  As we’ve said
repeatedly, Congress needs to take action to provide sufficient
resources for the border.  
   
The world is watching, and the American people rightly expect their
leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities.  And I urge
Congress to address them as part of a comprehensive, bipartisan
agreement in the weeks ahead.  
   
I’ll now turn it over to Jake to walk through pieces of the request in
more detail.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you.  Thank you, Shalanda.  And thanks, everybody,
for joining this call.  
   
Last night, as you all saw, President Biden gave an important speech
about the indispensable role of American leadership on the world
stage.   
   
As you all know, his remarks last night and this budget request today
come amid a global inflection point, following Hamas’s horrific
terrorist attacks against our ally, Israel, which took the lives of more
than 1,300 people, including 31 Americans, and as the people of Ukraine
continue to fight every day for their freedom and independence against
Russian brutality.  
   
As President Biden said, these conflicts can seem far away, but the
outcome of these fights for democracy against terrorism and tyranny are
vital to the safety and security of the American people.   
   
The President made a compelling case for why we need Congress to
urgently pass a budget that meets America’s national security needs and
those of our critical partners.  
   
Starting first with further aid to Israel: Like all of you, President
Biden was horrified by the terrorist attacks we saw Hamas commit.  The
President directed his team to take immediate action to do everything we
could to ensure the government of Israel has what it needs to defend its
nation and its people.   
   
Using previously approved congressional authorities, we’ve delivered
military aid, including munitions and interceptors for the Iron Dome
system, which is protecting people every day from Hamas rockets.   
   
To build on that support, the administration is now requesting funding
to invest in Israel’s defense against terrorists, including by
strengthening its air and missile defense systems.   
   
We are requesting an increase in security assistance for Israel to help
it protect its people as well as the many Americans who live in Israel
and travel to Israel.   
   
At the same time, we are also requesting support to provide lifesaving
humanitarian assistance for civilians impacted by the war in Gaza who
have nothing to do with Hamas and are suffering greatly as well.   
   
This budget request will also help the Amer- — the administration
enhance embassy security in Israel and for neighboring embassies as we
stay vigilant against threats to our personnel who serve our country
every day overseas.   
   
Second, on Ukraine: As the President spoke about last night, we have to
continue to stand up to tyranny and aggression and defend Ukraine
against this brutal Russian invasion.   
   
We know from history that if we walk away and let someone like Vladimir
Putin erase Ukraine’s independence, he will not stop there and would-be
aggressors around the world would be emboldened.   
   
We have to send the unmistakable message that in the 21st century, a
dictator cannot be allowed to conquer or carve up his neighbor.   
   
And President Biden made a very important point in his speech last night
when he said that President Putin — reflecting on the possibility that
America would stop providing assistance to Ukraine, President Putin said
that Ukraine would have one week to live — one week to live.   
   
Putin is betting that the United States will walk away from defending
its democratic partner, Ukraine; walk away from the coalition of
countries it has built over the last 18 months.  
   
And Joe Biden and the American people are going to prove Vladimir Putin
wrong, and we’re asking Congress to join us in that.  
   
The weapons and military aid the United States and our allies and
partners have provided Ukraine over the past two years have made a
tremendous difference, helping Ukraine win the battles for Kyiv,
Kherson, and Kharkiv.  And we can see the impacts of what we’re
providing Ukraine every day as Ukraine fights for its sovereign
territory and defends against continuing Russian efforts to take more
Ukrainian territory.  
   
However, the funding and authorities the Congress previously approved
overwhelmingly has nearly run out, and we need congressional action to
ensure that we can continue to meet Ukraine’s battlefield needs and
protect its people while they’re under attack.  
   
So, as Ukrainians wage a tough counteroffensive, as it defends against a
new Russian offensive, and as winter fast approaches, the world is
closely watching what Congress does next.  That includes both the people
of Ukraine as they fight for their country and those in the Kremlin who
seek to erase it.  
   
Third, it’s critically important that we maintain our focus on
strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and supporting key allies
and partners as part of our efforts to maintain peace and stability.  
   
Our allies and partners in the region need our support more than ever,
and this request provides significant new resources to help them build
the capabilities necessary to meet emerging challenges.  
   
The budget request makes notable, strategic investments, including by
strengthening our submarine industrial base, a key component to making
our AUKUS agreement a success; and by improving our infrastructure and
adding capacity to meet U.S. military requirements.  
   
We would also expand development finance to the countries hard hit by
the spillovers of Russia’s war through funding for the World Bank and
provide alternatives to coercive and unsustainable financing for
developing countries around the world.  
   
Finally, I would note that this budget request also invests in America
as a critical component of President Biden’s foreign policy for the
middle class. It will allow us to have more weapons and equipment that
defend America to be made in America.  
   
As the President spoke about last night, the work we’re doing to
increase our military industrial base by manufacturing more artillery
shells, Patriot missiles, and more is supporting jobs across the country
and serving the cause of freedom.   
   
Taken together, this budget request is critical to advancing America’s
national security and ensuring the safety of the American people.  
   
And with that, I’ll turn it back to Shalanda.  
   
MS. WAGENSELLER:  Great.  Moderator, I think we’re ready to take some
questions.  
   
Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks for holding this call.  Obviously, currently,
there’s no Speaker of the House.  I noticed the letter is addressed to
Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry.  Do you anticipate that if the Speaker
battle continues to stretch out that this will cause any problems for
the supplemental security request?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Look, you know I worked in the House a very long time,
and I now work for President Biden.  That is a matter for the House to
work out.   
   
What I will tell you — as you heard the National Security Advisor lay
out, you heard the President lay out last night what’s at stake here —
it is the President’s job, our jobs to make clear to Congress what the
needs are and what happens if this critical funding is not delivered. 
So, we’re doing our job here by letting Congress know what the critical
needs are, and we expect them to act and act swiftly.  
   
Q    Hi, this is Bryant Harris with Defense News.  Thank you for doing
this.  One quick question, and then — so, first, the $2 billion for
Indo-Pacific FMS.  I’m wondering if that’s all for Taiwan or is that for
partners throughout the region?  
   
And two, the conventional arms transfer policy the Biden administration
announced earlier this year, you know, said if it’s more likely than not
that weapons we send will be used in violation of international law, we
won’t send them.   
   
There have been concerns about Israel’s use of the PGMs we’re sending in
Gaza with regards to civilian casualties.  So, can you talk about how
you’re squaring that with your conventional arms transfer policy?   
   
Thank you.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  It’s Jake.  I think I heard the two questions.  
On the first one, the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing
that’s included in the Indo-Pacific portion of the supplemental request
is for multiple partners in the region to strengthen deterrence and
enhance peace and stability across the entire Indo-Pacific region.   
   
As for the second question, the President has been clear from the
earliest days, following the heinous terrorist attacks and assault by
Hamas, that the United States and Israel, as fellow democracies, have a
commitment to the rule of law and the law of war.   
   
All of our arms transfers, including arms transfers to Israel, are
rooted in the basic proposition that they will be used consistent with
law of armed conflict.  There is no exception here and no difference
here from any of our other arms transfers.  
   
And the President’s expectations in this regard are entirely clear, and
he has stated them repeatedly, including stating them directly in his
public remarks as well as privately to counterparts in the Israeli
government.

Q    Hi.  Good morning.  The materials say that there will be $9.15
billion allocated to humanitarian assistance for needs in Israel,
Ukraine, Gaza, and other areas.  I’m wondering if you could elaborate
how that’s broken down across regions.  How much of that is specifically
earmarked for Gaza, for instance?

DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Yeah, I’m happy to take that.  This is Director Young. 
There’s $10 billion for humanitarian — that’s State and USAID programs. 
Humanitarian is always flexible.  The world is — things happen we need
to be able to respond to.  So, that is a flexible pot of money that
allows us to respond. 

But you’ve already seen a commitment from this administration in making
sure humanitarian aid gets to those in Gaza.  So, we imagine that aid
will continue robustly as Congress funds more humanitarian aid. 

But that account has flexibility to allow State and USAID to assess what
is happening on the ground around the globe and respond with critical
dollars to ensure that people have the things that they need to survive
these conflicts and other scenarios across the globe.

MS. WAGENSELLER:  Moderator, I think we have time for one more question.

Q    Hi, I have a question about support for Israel.  I see $10.6
billion for air and missile defense support.  Can you be more specific
on what weapons the U.S. is providing Israel this time?  Is it purely
defensive weapons or are there offensive weapons?  What are we talking
about there?

And along those same lines, are there new weapons being provided to
Ukraine that have not been provided before — different types of weapons?

MR. SULLIVAN:  So, with respect to Ukraine, for starters, the request
does not specifically elaborate which weapons systems will be provided. 
And, as you know, over the course of the war that Russia has perpetrated
against Ukraine, we have added new weapon systems over time. 

The President has the discretion based on circumstances of the conflict,
the situation on the ground, consultations with allies to make
determinations about whether he will provide weapons systems to Ukraine
that we have not previously provided. 

And there are also constant developments in technology and capacity. 
And we have contracted for certain types of weapons systems that have
yet to be delivered because they’re still in production.  And we expect
them to be delivered in the coming months. 

So, this supplemental does not specifically answer the question as to
which weapon systems will be provided to Ukraine in terms of additional
capacities that haven’t been provided, but we’ll stay closely aligned
with the Congress and consult with them as we always do if indeed we
introduce a new capability in Ukraine. 

With respect to Israel, the way the funding request works is that it
will allow for us to acquire and provide more air and missile defense
support to make necessary industrial base investments to increase our
capacity to generate the types of systems that Ukraine ne- — Israel
needs to defend itself and also to replenish DOD stocks for munitions
that we have provided them. 

I will refer you to DOD to kind of talk through the specific munitions
that they have provided and are providing now that will get
replenished.  I will just say that the way this budget request is
structured is not specific — like with Ukraine, it is not specific to a
particular munition.  It is about making the investments we need to
produce, the funding we need to replenish DOD stocks for things we’re
taking out of stocks to give to them, and then funding for them to be
able to enhance their air and missile defense capabilities. 

And I don’t know if Shalanda has anything to add, but that’s what I’ve
got on that question.

MS. WAGENSELLER:  Great.  Well, thank you all again for joining.  As a
reminder, the materials you received prior to the call and the contents
of this call are embargoed until 10:30am today.   
   
If you have any additional follow-up questions, feel free to reach out
to me directly at OMB. 

Thanks, again.  And have a great day.
