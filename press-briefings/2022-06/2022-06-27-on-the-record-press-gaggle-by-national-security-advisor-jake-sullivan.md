12:55 P.M. CEST  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  All right.  Well, first, I want to make maximum use of
your time, so the only thing I’d say at the top is the President had a
productive set of sessions yesterday at the G7 this morning.    
   
     He had opportunity to hear from President Zelenskyy and then to
spend two hours with his fellow G7 leaders and President Zelenskyy,
talking about the way forward in Ukraine.    
   
     It was a good session — very detailed and substantive across all
the major lines of effort, including military, economic, humanitarian
assistance, sanctions, and other steps we’re taking to support the
Ukrainians and hold Russia accountable.  
   
     And I’ll just leave it there at the top and open it up for
questions on the session this morning or really on anything else that’s
on your guys’ minds.   
   
     Q    Can you talk to the new military assistance that is being
confirmed by an administration official?  
      
     MR. SULLIVAN:  So I’ve seen the reports of specific details around
advanced air defense capabilities that the United States is preparing to
provide to the Ukrainians.  I can confirm that we are, in fact, in the
process of finalizing a package that includes advanced air defense
capabilities.  I won’t get into the details of the system.  I’ll wait
until the contract actually gets done.   
   
     But this week, as the President told his fellow G7 leaders — and as
he told President Zelenskyy — we do intend to finalize a package that
includes advanced medium- and long-range air defense capabilities for
the Ukrainians, along with some other items that are of urgent need,
including ammunition for artillery and counterbattery radar systems.  
   
     Q    I was asking more about the conversation with President
Zelenskyy this morning with the G7 leaders.  Did President Zelenskyy
have any specific requests of them?  Did the President and the other G7
leaders have a particular message for President Zelenskyy?  What was the
nature of that conversation?  
   
     MR. SULLIVAN:  So, he did have some specific requests.  His first
request in the presentation he made was for further air defense
systems.  In particular, at the top of his mind was the set of missile
strikes that took place in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine, and his
desire to get additional air defense capabilities that could shoot down
Russian missiles out in sky.   
   
     So, the President was able to be positively responsive to him on
that.   
   
     He had some other requests relating to economic assistance to
ensure that Ukraine’s economy can remain basically stable and afloat. 
And President Biden and other G7 leaders were able to explain to him the
assistance that we’re providing on a monthly basis to the tune of a
total of $7.5 billion in economic assistance from the United States.   
   
     But the bulk of the conversation was not about asks and gives; it
was really about the way forward and how President Zelenskyy sees the
course of the war and is trying to assimilate and incorporate all of the
assistance he’s been given to maximize Ukraine’s capacity both to resist
Russian advances and to pursue counterattacks where possible.   
   
     A lot of it was detailed and sensitive.  It was a real conversation
about strategy.  And so, I’m not going to go further in terms of public
characterizations of it, because this was genuinely an opportunity for
the G7 leaders plus Zelenskyy to really talk turkey about how to help
Ukraine achieve its objectives and how to help deny Russia its
objectives.  And I think a lot came out of it that we can collectively
follow up on.    
     Q    Do you have a sense of how the security package that you’re
putting together — like what it would tangibly mean on the ground in
Ukraine, like how it would help?   

   MR. SULLIVAN:  So it’s a little difficult for me to talk about the
specific practical impact of the air defense capability without
frontrunning the announcement of that capability.    
   
     So what I will tell you is this: that by the end of this week,
we’ll make sure that you get some expert military briefers who can walk
through what it will actually mean tangibly, in terms of the defense of
Ukrainian airspace and particularly population centers.   
   
     The other pieces of it — artillery, ammunition — is self-evident. 
This is an artillery battle in the East.  We’ve provided now well more
than 100 howitzers, tubes of M777 artillery.  And that artillery needs a
constant supply of ammunition to continue to be effective, and we’re
providing that on an ongoing basis.   
   
     And then the counterbattery radars are really about helping give
the Ukrainians an advantage in an artillery fight because it helps them
have better visibility into what they’re up against.    
   
     So what we’re trying to do at this point is tailor our military
assistance to the particular immediate needs of the Ukrainians on the
battlefield at a given point in time.  Months ago, that was really about
anti-tank and anti-air systems like Stingers.  Then it became about
artillery.  Now, increasingly, it’s about some of these sophisticated
systems like counterbattery radar and the HIMARS.  And of course, we’ve
announced two tranches of those, along with the very sophisticated
munitions that go along with them.   
   
     So, we’ll continue to do that as we go forward.  I have an open
channel with my counterpart, and General Milley has an open channel with
his.  And oftentimes, the four of us speak, just so that we level-set
both around what the strategic picture looks like and then, tactically,
what the Ukrainians need.  And we use those conversations as the basis
to formulate these packages.   
   
     Q    Jake, I was just going to ask: We have quoted some European
officials saying that Zelenskyy made clear that he wants the war to end
this year, that it would be difficult to go into the winter.  Can you
say something about whether the winter poses a particular danger?  And
can you characterize, you know, what Zelenskyy told the leaders about
the —  
   
     MR. SULLIVAN:  I want to be very careful about characterizing his
remarks.  I think he should speak for himself on this.  What I will say
is that Zelenskyy was very much focused on trying to ensure that Ukraine
is in as advantageous a position on the battlefield as possible in the
next months as opposed to the next years because he believes that a
grinding conflict is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people, for
obvious reasons.    
   
     So he would like to see his military and those in the West who are
supporting his military make maximum use of the next few months to put
the Ukrainians in as good a position as they can possibly be in with
respect to the situation on the ground in both the East and the South. 
And that’s consistent with the American approach of trying to flow in
the necessary materiel and equipment to put the Ukrainians in an
advantageous position on the battlefield.  But that’s really what he was
focused on.   
   
     I think, from his perspective, pushing the pace of both assistance
and operations on the battlefield is an important part of Ukrainian
strategy, as opposed to letting things just drag out indefinitely.  
   
     Q    On the oil price cap that we know you guys are announcing
tomorrow, or on that process of it, can you talk a little bit about why
there wasn’t more success in getting closer to an agreement in
principle?  Who are the holdouts?  What’s the dynamics there?   
   
     And given that this is one of the main revenue streams for funding
his war — Putin’s war — did this come up in the Zelenskyy conversation? 
Is this at all something that he’s pushing the leaders to, you know, get
to an agreement sooner rather than later?  
   
     MR. SULLIVAN:  Zelenskyy didn’t specifically raise the price cap. 
What he did raise was denying Putin revenues from oil sales.  And I
think the characterization that there are holdouts in this conversation
isn’t quite correct.  If I take a step back, there is absolute consensus
across the G7 that the purpose of our energy sanctions on Russia should
ultimately be to deny revenue to Russia while at the same time ensuring
a stable global energy market.   
   
     There is also consensus emerging — although there continue to be
discussions around it, so I don’t want to get ahead of the leaders on
this — that the price cap is a serious method to achieve that
outcome.    
   
     So then the question becomes: How do you implement it working with
consuming countries and with the private sector?  What are the details? 
What are the methods of execution?  That requires technical work that
has to be done by ministers — energy ministers and finance ministers —
in order to develop an actual executable cap that then goes into
effect.  
   
     So the leaders can’t design every element of the program here at
Elmau.  What they can do is give direction to ministers to design such a
program and then come back to leaders to bless it and have it be
implemented.

Nothing is finalized yet, but we think that the trend is looking good
towards leaders coming together around the idea that this is one of the
options available to achieve the goal of driving down Putin’s revenues
from oil while maintaining stable oil — energy markets.  
  
     Q    Jake, just on that, can you tell us: Has the President been
sort of personally lobbying the other leaders on the idea of the price
cap?  And what have you all had to convince them of?  Are they worried
that it won’t work?  Are they there might be sort of bad effects to it? 
Like, what’s been the holdup?  
  
     MR. SULLIVAN:  I think the single biggest factor here is that this
is not something that can be pulled off the shelf as a tried-and-true
method that has repeated historical precedent and therefore can simply
be taken as a standing option and implemented.   
  
     It is a new kind of concept to deal with a particularly novel
challenge, which is how to effectively deal with a country that’s
selling millions of barrels of oil a day and try to deprive it of some
of the revenues that they’re getting from the sale of that oil.  
  
     And so, this has been less about having to break down particular
resistance and more about a process of consultation, education, thinking
through all of the puts and takes.  
  
And so I wouldn’t describe what the President has been doing here as
lobbying so much as posing the problem, which is: If you merely try to
reduce flows and not reduce price, you have certain impacts on the
energy market that are averse, whereas if you reduce price — if you
focus on price more than flows, you might be able to actually maximize
your overall objectives of both depriving revenues to Putin and keeping
energy market stable. 

So, in a way, this conversation — starting at the expert working level,
then ministers, now leaders — has been one of the G7 countries puzzling
through a difficult challenge together and arriving at a point, we
believe, where there is convergence around really trying to pursue
this.   
  
And the President has been at the center of that over the course of the
past 24 hours, talking it through with leaders, both one on one and then
in group settings.  
  
And we’ll see where things land.  You know, I’m not announcing some
deal.  I’m just saying I think it’s headed in the right direction
because everybody sees the logic and merit of tasking ministers to
really try to develop a — an affirmative proposal on this score.   
  
Q    What is the realistic timeframe, though, for this given — you know,
you just said, Zelenskyy really wants to move things along, not have
this drag out into years.  This isn’t going to happen over this — you
know, at the summit.  How long is realistic to see something like this
take shape and take effect?   
  
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first of all, if we do get an agreement to task
ministers, if that actually happens, I think  
you guys can obviously look at that and say, “Okay, we don’t have a
price cap in effect” on Wednesday of this week.  I look at that as a
pretty dramatic step forward and one that would be a — looking back over
the course of the last several years, one of the more significant
outcomes of a G7 summit.   
  
Then, in terms of the actual timetables and modalities, it’s hard for me
to say.  There is no reason, though, that if leaders come together
around this, that there couldn’t be relatively rapid work done on it,
but I’m not going to put a timetable on it.  
  
Q    You can’t say whether that’s — “rapid” is weeks or months or —  
  
MR. SULLIVAN:  Just in the interest of not having you guys come back to
me and read a particular timetable prediction, I’ll just say I think it
can be done relatively quickly.    
  
Q    Back to the “months, not years” from President Zelenskyy — or
request from President Zelenskyy for urgent support.  Does that stem, in
fact — how does that — does that stem from sort of the assessment that
Russia is having difficulty resupplying its forces, backfilling
casualties, and that by flowing in Allied resources now that it can sort
of provide Ukraine, there’s a window of opportunity for Ukraine to
launch a counteroffensive in some places before Russia can sort of
bolster and rearm and resupply its forces?  Is that — is there a window
of opportunity here?  
  
MR. SULLIVAN:  President Zelenskyy wasn’t explicit on that point.  I
think it’s fair to say that that battlefield analysis is one
consideration.  I think another really important consideration is just
the sense of suffering of the Ukrainian people with each day and week
that this goes on.   
  
And so, he’s got an urgency to try to show his people that Ukraine is,
first of all, holding fast against the Russian onslaught and, secondly,
making some progress in areas where they feel that they can, in fact,
push back against the Russians.  
  
So, I should probably leave it there because I think, in terms of
Zelenskyy’s logic for this, I’d rather have him speak to it himself than
me speak for him.   
  
Q    Can you speak about the U.S. assessment of Russian — of the
degradation of Russia’s military capacity now as it sort of seems to be
on the cusp of taking Luhansk and maybe can’t go much further beyond
that?  That — you know, what — is Russia running out of resources,
running out of people to throw into this fight?  
  
MR. SULLIVAN:  I would put it this way: Russia faces limitations in
terms of its ability to resupply and to fill out its battalion tactical
groups.  Those limitations are real.  They have an impact on Russia’s
capacity to achieve its ultimate strategic aims in this conflict, which
we do not believe are limited to the Donbas, certainly are not limited
to Luhansk.  
  
But I will leave it to the Pentagon to characterize more specifically
the question you’re posing about — you know,  
whether or not they have enough munitions or whether or not they
literally have enough people to be able to keep going over the next
several months.   
  
     I would just say that the limitations — the operational,
logistical, manpower, and munition limitations on them are a constraint
on their capacity to achieve what they want to achieve.   
  
Q    Jake, as we get to the very end, I want to ask you quickly whether
you think that there could be possibility for bilateral discussion for
the President with President Erdoğan.    
  
And also, on the Iran missile strike, just if you could say a word or
two about the prospects for — your assessment of that situation with
Iran and the missile strike and the possibility of moving forward.

     MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, on the question of meeting with President
Erdoğan, nothing is scheduled at the moment, but they may very well have
the opportunity to see one another at the NATO Summit.  Let’s see how
the next 24 hours unfold.

     There is a flurry of diplomatic activity occurring.  Today, the
Swedish Prime Minister will be in Brussels making a statement. 
Tomorrow, we understand that there will be further engagements among the
Turks, Finns, Swedes, and the NATO Secretary General.  And so we want to
see how that unfolds as we head into Madrid.

     The President is following this very closely.  His team is working
it with the Finns, Swedes, and Turks, and I’m on the phone daily with my
counterparts from all three countries.  So let’s — let’s see how things
go, I guess is the — the answer to your question.

     On Iran, the United States’ view is straightforward and has been
now for quite some time, which is that we’re determined to ensure that
Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.  We think a diplomatic agreement
is the best way to do that.  We think a mutual return to the JCPOA is in
the interest of the United States and our partners.  And there is a deal
available on the table to Iran, and it’s up to Iran to decide whether or
not it wants to take it.

     MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Last question.

     Q    On that flurry of activity with the Finns and Swedes and the
Turks, are they — we aren’t expecting, like, action at this NATO
Summit, or are we?  Or is it moving in that direction that they could be
added to NATO this quickly?

     MR. SULLIVAN:  I think the goal is to create as much positive
momentum as we can behind the candidacies of Finland and Sweden.  I am
not sitting here today suggesting that all issues will be resolved by
Madrid, but we’re going to try and resolve as many of them as possible
so that Madrid gives a boost to their candidacies, even if there remains
some concerns on the part of Turkey that need to be worked out.

     Q    Jake, can I ask one more on China —

     MR. SULLIVAN:  Sure, one more.

     Q    — since we’re also expecting language on that that you guys
tell us is very strong — stronger than last year’s. 

     Obviously, we’re expecting a call and potential meeting between the
President and the President of China.  Is this — to what extent is this
an opportunity to sort of brief the G7 leaders?

     And then, should we expect on, you know, the U.S. policies and, you
know, announcements that you have forthcoming?  And then should we
expect a call with Xi shortly after this meeting, given — I don’t know
what you need to schedule it; sort of, the dynamics on that one.

     MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, the President has already had the
opportunity to have a discussion with his fellow leaders on China and,
in particular, in briefing them on the U.S. approach to China and some
of his recent conversations, as well as my own and others’ conversations
with Chinese counterparts.

 We do expect that the President and President Xi will have the
opportunity to engage over the course of the next few weeks.  I can’t
put a particular timeframe on it.  It’s not going to be immediately
after the G7.   
  
And we do think that there is increasing convergence, both at the G7 and
at NATO, around the challenge China poses and around the need — the
urgent need for consultation and especially alignment among the world’s
leading market democracies to deal with some of those challenges — in
particular, China’s non-market economic practices, its approach to debt,
and its approach to human rights.

     And I think you can expect that the G7 statement will speak to all
of those, and then I think you can expect that the NATO Strategic
Concept will also speak in ways that are unprecedented about the
challenge that China poses.

     But in both contexts, it’s important to underscore something the
President says to all of his fellow leaders and which they all agree,
and it’s: Competition does not mean confrontation or conflict.  We’re
not looking for a Cold War, and we’re not looking to divide the world
into rival blocs and make every country choose.

     We want to stand for a set of principles, rules of the road that
are fair and understood and agreed by everybody.  And we want to ensure
that we’re working with like-minded partners to hold China accountable
to adhere to those rules.  And that’s the spirit and the message that I
think will emerge both from Elmau and from Madrid.
