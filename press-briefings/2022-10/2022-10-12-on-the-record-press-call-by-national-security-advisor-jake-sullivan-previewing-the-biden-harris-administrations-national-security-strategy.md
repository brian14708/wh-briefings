Via Teleconference

9:34 A.M. EDT

MS. SHARMA:  Great.  Thank you.  And thanks, everyone, for joining.   
   
So, as a reminder, this press call is on the record.  Our speaker on the
call is National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.  And the contents of
the call are embargoed until today, 12:00 p.m. Eastern.   
   
You should have the factsheet and that strategy in your inboxes — also
embargoed.  If you didn’t get it, just let me know.    
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to Jake to get us started.  And then we’ll
take as many questions as we can.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thanks, Saloni.  Thanks, everybody.  I’ll try to be brief
because I’m giving remarks on this later today, and we’ll go into more
detail on the strategy and the elements of the strategy.   
   
But just to make a few points here at the top: As Saloni said, today we
are releasing the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy. 
And as the President has said from the earliest days of his
administration, the world is at an inflection point and the choices we
make today will set the terms on how we are set up to deal with the
significant challenges and the significant opportunities we face in the
years ahead.  That’s really what this National Security Strategy is all
about.  
   
The fundamental premise of the strategy is that we have entered a
decisive decade with respect to two fundamental strategic challenges. 
The first is the competition between the major powers to shape the
future of the international order.  And the second is that while this
competition is underway, we need to deal with a set of transnational
challenges that are affecting people everywhere, including here in the
United States — from climate change to food insecurity, to communicable
diseases, to terrorism, to the energy transition, to inflation.  
   
And this strategy makes clear that these shared challenges are not
marginal issues, they are not secondary to geopolitics, but they operate
on a plane alongside the competition — the geopolitical competition with
major powers.  
   
Now, of course, there are tensions between trying to rally cooperation
to solve these shared challenges and trying to position ourselves
effectively to prevail in strategic competition.  But there are also
ways in which these are reinforcing.  And we believe fundamentally that
the core elements of what the United States must do in the years ahead
is — are the same for both sets of challenges.   
   
Specifically, we need to invest in the underlying sources and tools of
American power and influence, especially our strength here at home, both
for the purpose of effective competition and for the purpose of being
set up to rally the world to solve shared challenges.  
   
Second, we need to build the strongest possible coalition of nations to
enhance our collective influence, both to shape the global strategic
environment and to address these transnational threats that require
cooperation to succeed.  And finally, we need to set the rules of the
road for the 21st century in critical areas — from emerging technologies
in cyberspace, to trade, economics, investment, and more — both so that
the international order continues to reflect our values and our
interests and so that the international order is better designed to be
able to take on the challenges ahead.   
   
So this decisive decade is critical both for defining the terms of
competition, particularly with the PRC, and for getting ahead of massive
challenges that if we lose the time in this decade, we will not be able
to keep pace with most notably the climate crisis, but other challenges
as well.  
   
The strategy is not a detailed accounting of every single challenge and
opportunity America faces.  It touches on our plans in every region of
the world, but it tries to take a broader brush at how we intend to
seize this decisive decade to advance America’s vital interests and to
put ourselves in a position of strength vis-à-vis these two strategic
challenges that I’ve just laid out.  
   
Just a few more points I would set out at the outset, which really are
kind of hallmarks of the strategy and hallmarks of the way that
President Biden has pursued his foreign policy and national security
from the beginning of this administration.   
   
One, we’ve broken down the dividing line between foreign policy and
domestic policy to make far-reaching investments here at home in our
industrial and innovation base that will increase our competitiveness
and better position us to deal with everything from climate to global
health, to food security, to energy.  
   
Second, we have put alliances at the core of this strategy, and, in
particular, our alliances in Europe with NATO, in the Indo-Pacific with
our treaty allies.  And then the G7, having been revitalized as an
organization that had lost some of its clarity of purpose in recent
years, has now been restored as a sort of steering committee for the
free world on critical issues.  
   
The President speaks often about the contest in the world between
democracy and autocracy.  And our democratic allies in Europe, in Asia,
and other parts of the world are core to the vision behind the
strategy.  But as the President said at the U.N. General Assembly, we
are prepared to work with any nation that will stand behind the
principles and the terms of the U.N. Charter, including principles
relative to sovereignty and territorial integrity, to freedom of
navigation and overflight. And we will work with non-democracies in
service of defending these principles, as well as working with countries
of every stripe when it comes to challenges like climate change that
affect us all.  
   
Next, we recognize that in the geopolitical space, the PRC represents
America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge.  And while that
will play out in the Indo-Pacific to a significant extent, there are
global dimensions to the challenge as well.   
   
But the strategy also makes clear that we avoid seeing the world solely
through the prism of strategic competition.  And we will not try to
divide the world into rigid blocks.  We are not seeking to have
competition tip over into confrontation or a new Cold War.  And we are
not engaging each country as simply a proxy battleground.  We’re going
to engage countries on their own terms and pursue an affirmative agenda
to advance common interests and to promote stability and prosperity.  
   
Next, the strategy indicates that we have to turn the page on the
traditional formula for trade and adopt a new model of economics,
investment, and trade that is fit for purpose for the coming decades of
the 21st century on everything that has been laid bare in the last few
years — supply chains, the energy transition, new standards for labor,
the environment, as well as the increasing role of technology and
digitization in the global economy.  
   
And then, finally, I would just say that this notion of trying to
preserve and increase international cooperation in an age of competition
requires a dual track approach.  
   
On one track, we’ll cooperate with any country, including our
geopolitical rivals, that is willing to work constructively on shared
challenges.  And then on the other track, we’re going to deepen and
sharpen our cooperation with likeminded democracies.  And we believe
that we can accomplish both of these as we move forward.  
   
So those are some of the key elements and highlights from the document,
which you can read in full.  The document identifies key priority areas,
it walks through the various lines of effort I’ve just talked about, and
then it applies to strategy region by region in the final chapter so
that you can see how this plays out in every part of the world.  
   
And with that, I’ll stop and would be happy to take questions.  
   
Q: Jake, thanks very much.  Obviously, we were supposed to have this
conversation months ago.  So could I just ask a broad question: how the
war in Ukraine has changed your worldview and the team’s worldview, if
at all, and this document in specific, including the nuclear threat.  
   
And I know we’re keeping this broad, but I do obviously want to ask
about Saudi and the Middle East.  You know, how fundamental are you
considering a strategic (inaudible) with an alliance, obviously, that’s
lasted more than 75 years?  Thanks.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, the President was clear yesterday that we are
reevaluating the relationship with Saudi, and this is a relationship, as
you just said, that has existed over decades.  And it’s been built on a
basis of bipartisan understanding.  And the President wants to make sure
that he is consulting closely with the Congress on a bipartisan basis as
he reevaluates.  
   
And so, he looks forward to engaging the Congress when they return.  He
will make his decisions about how we proceed with respect to the
relationship on his timetable, having had the level of consultation and
reflection that he is keen to have, because these are, of course,
consequential decisions.  And he was clear yesterday that he has
embarked on that process, and he’s doing so with purpose of looking out
for U.S. interests and values as we think about the future of the
U.S.-Saudi relationship.  
   
With respect to the war in Ukraine, one of the reasons that we did not
move out with the National Security Strategy in the spring is because we
thought it would be imprudent in such a fast-moving and consequential
moment where it was really unclear exactly what direction that war would
take to go out with the strategy.  
   
And, frankly, in February, there were a whole lot of people who thought
the war would be over rapidly and Russia would be in a much better
position than it is in today.  And so, we think what has actually
unfolded over the last six months, which has defied many of the
expectations and conventional wisdom, is a vindication of taking our
time and being methodical in putting forward the strategy.   
   
I don’t believe that the war in Ukraine has fundamentally altered Joe
Biden’s approach to foreign policy, which long predates his presidency
and has only been reinforced and amplified over the course of his time
in office.  But I do believe that it presents in living color the key
elements of our approach: the emphasis on allies, the importance of
strengthening the hand of the democratic world and standing up for our
fellow democracies and for democratic values.  
   
The fact that we need to bring to bear all of the tools of national
power at our disposal — support to Ukraine in terms of military
equipment; economic assistance; sanctions and export controls on Russia
to squeeze their capabilities; the diplomatic weight of trying to get
strong votes in the U.N. General Assembly, first on the invasion and now
this week on the purported annexation that is a complete violation of
the U.N. Charter.  
   
So I think what you see in the strategy is the broad-based themes that
are applied in practice in the very specific case of Ukraine.  
   
I think what the nuclear threats and saber rattling we’ve seen from
Russia remind us of is just what a significant and seriously dangerous
adversary Russia is — not just to the United States but to a world that
is seeking peace and stability, and now has seen that flagrantly
disrupted by this invasion and now by all of the saber rattling.  
   
So, being able to watch how Ukraine unfolded, have the terms of
geopolitical competition sharpened up over the course of the past few
months, and also being able to put on display how our strategy works in
practice — I think all of those serve a good purpose in terms of giving
life to the document that we’re releasing today.  
   
Q: Thank you very much.  Thank you, Jake, for doing this.  Let me follow
up and ask: When you look at the National Security Strategy and your
emphasis on (inaudible) democracies, does that propel you, in addition
to oil, toward perhaps reverting to the President’s campaign rhetoric
about Saudi Arabia?   
   
But how do you balance that against an increasingly aggressive Iran and
other shared security interests with the Saudis and any hope you might
have of fostering whatever progress the current Iranian protests might
have towards moving towards a change in their leadership?  What’s your
evaluations there, if you could speak to it?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, on Iran, it has been remarkable to see the
fearlessness, the bravery, the principle, and the principled courage of
women and girls and their allies on the streets in Iran — workers
striking, students marching, and people demanding their basic rights and
dignity.  
   
And the President spoke from the well of the General Assembly about
this.  He has put out very strong statements on this.  His
administration — the Secretary of State, myself, others have spoken very
clearly and emphatically about our strong support for the basic vision
and principles that these protesters are putting forward.  
   
And we’re also trying to take action that shows where we stand on this:
imposing costs on Iran’s morality police and others involved in the
repression and brutality in attempting to silence the voices of these
brave Iranians; steps that the Treasury Department took to try to
facilitate access to communication so that Iranians could talk to one
another and to the world about what they are doing and what they are
seeing.  
   
So, we will continue to do that.  And we can’t make any predictions
about where this goes.  All we can do is stand on principle and try to
be very clear about who side we’re on and that is what we will continue
to do.  
   
With respect to Saudi Arabia, obviously, as the President has said from
when he came into office, there is a range of interests and values that
are implicated in our relationship with that country and countries
across that region and around the world.  And, you know, the President
will examine all of that.  But one question he’s going to ask is: Is the
nature of the relationships serving the interests and values of the
United States?  And what changes would make it better serve those
interests and values?  
   
And the step that OPEC+ took last week with respect to energy that
helped Russia raises real questions.  And you’ve heard not just from the
President, but from members of Congress of both parties on this.   
   
And so, I’m not going to get ahead of where he will end up on this
because, as he said yesterday, he wants to be able to engage and consult
with Congress when they return.  He wants to be able to reevaluate in a
methodical, strategic, effective way.  And then he will, at a time and
place of his choosing, lay out how he intends to proceed with respect to
the relationship.

This is responsible, it’s prudent, it’s rooted in his fundamental
interest in making sure that the relationship the United States has with
Saudi Arabia serves the American people effectively.  That’s what he’s
intending to work through.   
   
And I know that, you know, the questions will keep coming fast and
furious — what exactly what that look like, when, how, et cetera.  The
President will act and operate according to, you know, what he sees as
the necessary period to consult and engage, and then he will lay out the
course ahead.  
   
Q: Hi.  Thanks, Jake, for doing this.  I appreciate it.  I had two
questions.  One is: Earlier on trade, you had  
discussed the need to turn the page on a new formula for trade.  I think
many of us were expecting some sort of announcement on China tariffs
earlier this summer, and I just wondered if you could fill us in
specifically on where we are on that.   
   
And then, secondly, I wanted to get some clarity from you all on —
again, on Saudi Arabia.  I know you mentioned that the President wants
to wait until Congress returns, and then he’ll begin speaking with
them.  And I’m just curious, you know: Can he not start talking to them
now?  They’re just — I feel like there’s this sense of urgency among
some members of Congress to do things more immediately, and would the
President support things like pausing arm sales in the interim until he
actually makes a permanent review decision?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, again, the President isn’t going to wait to
engage.  He is going to look to engage, you know, with a range of
stakeholders in this relationship and has already begun to do so.  He
said yesterday he is in the process of reevaluating.  But some of these
steps require a more full-throated engagement with the Congress and to
be able to sit down with members of both parties in person to go through
that.    
   
So, this will be — this isn’t a process where we’ve hit the pause button
and then we pick it up again in a month.  This is a process that has
begun.  It’s underway.  It will involve some engagement with members
even now, before voi — you know, voices who have spoken out loudly and
clearly.  And then, it will continue when Congress returns.  
   
You know, I can’t put a date or a time on when the President will
announce any given step, it’s — some could happen sooner, some could
happen over a more extended time period.   
   
All I will say right now is that the President is in the process of
reevaluation.  He is going to proceed strategically, methodically.  He’s
going to look at every aspect of this.  He’s going to consult widely. 
And then, when he is prepared to do so, he will lay out how he intends
to proceed.  
   
That may happen, as I said, in a range of different ways through a
number of different vehicles.  I’m not suggesting this is all going to
be tied up in some neat package in a bow.  But I am going to give the
President space and the flexibility to make his own determinations for
how he wants to lay things out as we go forward.  
   
When it comes to arm sales, I would just point out that nothing is
moving imminently, so there is not an imminent decision that has to be
made on the question of arm sales.  But that is something that he will
be looking at, along with everything else in the relationship.  
   
MS. SHARMA:  Oh, sorry.  I think Asma had also asked about trade.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Oh, I’m sorry.  Yeah.  On China trade, the U.S. Trade
Representative has actually initiated a review of the 301 tariffs — the
formal review that’s called the “four-year review,” looking at it
through the particular prism of, you know, what ultimately is going to
strengthen the hand of the U.S. industrial innovation base and our
workforce here in the United States.  
   
They’re in the process of working through that, looking at the lines of
tariffs, looking at what their impact has been, and then looking at ways
that the U.S. can more effectively approach our trade policy with China
to ensure that we are achieving the strategic priorities the President
has laid out, which is  
the strongest possible American industrial and innovation base and a
level playing field for American workers.   
   
So, that’s the process that was launched a few weeks ago.  It will
continue over the coming months, and it will produce outcomes and
recommendations to the President about a way forward.  
   
Q: Thanks, Jake, for doing this fascinating document.  I want to ask you
about two military-related things that you have in the document.  The
first is, you have a line that I recall from the Obama-era national
security strategies and that Obama frequently used about reducing the
role of nuclear weapons in American strategy, but then you’ve also got
indications that the Nuclear Posture Review, excerpts of which we’ve
already seen, basically holds on to the Triad.  And there’s not a whole
lot that I have seen in the doctrine here that would move you to a
reduction at a moment that, of course, we’re newly focused on this.   
   
And I also wonder if you could describe in a little more detail the
President’s vision about modernizing the military, because I have —
there seems to be a little bit of dissonance between what was in the
document and what’s in the budget.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So we don’t see dissonance between what’s in the document
and what’s in the budget.  And I think what I would say more generally
about both of your questions is that putting out the National Security
Strategy will be the foundation upon which you’ll see the public release
of the National Defense Strategy that includes the Nuclear Posture
Review and the Missile Defense Review.   
   
And you’ll see, with respect to the Nuclear Posture Review, that, in
fact, it does depart from some of the Trump-era formulas, and in doing
so, we believe displays a step forward towards the reduction of the role
of nuclear weapons in American strategy.   
   
But I will — you know, I think your question can be more fully answered
once we have laid out the public-facing elements of the Nuclear Posture
Review, which is integrated into the National Defense Strategy.   
   
I mean, among other things, you’ve seen us step back from certain
nuclear systems and platforms, but there are other.  And the declaratory
policy in the Nuclear Posture Review, as it comes out, is different from
the declaratory policy — you know, it’s — it is something that is closer
to the Obama-era laydown.  
   
On the budget and on modernizing the military, I would suggest that in a
range of different areas, the Defense budget put forward by the
administration is very consistent with both the NSS and the NDS in its
emphasis on how to both modernize the fighting force itself — the men
and women who make up this military — and how to modernize the systems,
platforms, and technologies that they rely upon in every domain — in
space, in cyberspace, land, sea, air, undersea.   
   
So I think when you see all of these documents come together in their
totality, the — you’ll see kind of where the overall issue of nuclear
posture and the role of nuclear weapons fits in.  And you will see the
ways in which we have tried to fit together the broad National Security
Strategy with a National Defense Strategy built on the notion of
integrated deterrence and on this notion of modernizing.  
   
The last thing I would say is: Reducing the role of nuclear weapons was
also in the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance from earlier
this year.  So this is not a new proposition.  It has guided our work
from the beginning of the Biden administration when we put out that
interim guidance, you know, within the first weeks of the
administration.  
   
Q: Hey, thanks a lot.  Jake, is foreign policy for the middle class
still a major aspect of the President’s foreign policy?  And if so, how
is the administration factoring in the war in Ukraine?  It’s obviously a
challenge that has broad sympathies in the West but, practically
speaking, has increased energy prices and inflation in ways that have
hurt the middle class.  So I’m just curious about the — how you guys
think about that and communicate that.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So it is still an important feature of how the President
approaches the whole question of foreign policy and national security. 
You know, how do we make sure that what we are doing, in terms of our
investments and our policies in the world, makes life better for
middle-class working people in America.  And you see that across a range
of dimensions of the strategy, including the intersection I talked about
between foreign policy and domestic policy.   
   
The President is very focused on securing supply chains, on making the
investments in our industrial and innovation base that will create
good-paying jobs for the long-term future; on an energy transition that
does sustain stability in the energy markets while also moving us to a
clean energy future that will bring down energy costs and also ensure
more security and reliability over time while it also helps us deal with
the climate crisis.  
   
On pandemics that — you know, one of the biggest threats facing families
in America today are these communicable diseases that, in this case,
would wi- — you know, and COVID-19 wiped out more than — you know,
caused — took the lives of more than a million people in the United
States.  So — so, yes, he is still very much focused on this.  
   
With respect to the war in Ukraine, the President has made clear from
the beginning that the cause of the ripple effects to the global economy
and to the American economy from the war is not our response.  It is
Russia’s invasion in the first instance.   
   
And even in the way that we’ve designed our sanctions, we have done so
with particular attention to trying to maintain energy supply on the
market.  And that important proposition is really about making sure that
we’re looking out for families in the United States.   
   
We have worked hard, as we have pushed back against Russian aggression
in Ukraine, to also pay — be very attentive to the steps necessary to
bring down energy costs — release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
and other steps the President has taken over the last six months — and
to build more resilient supply chains so that the supply chain side of
the inflation problem is abated and alleviated over time.   
   
And then, finally, the President doesn’t think that foreign policy for
the middle class just is strictly about pocketbook issues.  It’s also
about how American families, working people in this country feel safe,
secure, respected, and are able to live out their values.  And that
means that when there is a brutal aggressor marauding across borders in
Europe, history has told us that the United States stepping up to help
push back against that will serve the long-term health and vitality of
the United States of America across the board economically, socially,
just in terms of basic security.   
   
So he doesn’t see this as kind of a strict divide between what are our
economic interests and then what are our national security interests. 
He sees the two things as very much linked and tied to one another.   
   
And the case he’s made to the American people from the beginning is:
Standing up to Putin in Ukraine is fundamentally important to sustaining
the health and vitality of the free world and the way of life of the
United States, in addition to these other steps that he’s taken to try
and moderate, manage, and mitigate the impacts of the war on the
economic livelihoods of the American people.  
   
MS. SHARMA:  All right, I think that’s all the time we have.  So thanks,
Jake.  And thanks, everyone, for joining us today.  
   
As a reminder, this call is embargoed until 12:00 p.m., Eastern today. 
And then Jake will be speaking at Georgetown later, and I can send
everyone more information on that if you haven’t gotten that already. 
Thanks, everyone.
