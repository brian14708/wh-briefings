  \ Maritime\_Agreement"

Via Teleconference

12:02 P.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Good afternoon, everyone.  This call will be on background
for attribution to “senior administration officials.”   
   
For your awareness, not for reporting, on the line are \[senior
administration official\] and \[senior administration official\].  
   
The contents of the call will be embargoed until the conclusion of the
call.  
   
\[Senior administration official\] and \[senior administration
official\], I’ll hand it over to you to get started.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  This is senior official
number one.  I’m going do a very quick topper, and then I have to head
out to something else.  And I’ll leave you with senior official number
two, who was involved in these negotiations for many months and,
frankly, for many years, if you go back to the Obama-Biden
administration.  
   
I just want to briefly point out President Biden’s policy for the Middle
East region — a more stable, prosperous, integrated region — and how
that kind of manifests itself.  
   
It manifests itself through broad energy deals connecting Iraq’s
electricity grid to Jordan to the GCC.  
   
It manifests itself through using persistent diplomacy to do our best to
try to wind down and end conflicts — including the war in Yemen and even
just persistent disputes, such as a Red Sea island dispute which we
resolved over the course of the President’s visit, Israeli (inaudible)
of Saudi airspace.   
   
And this very important — what we think is a truly historic breakthrough
— really the first agreement of its time between Israel and Lebanon
mediated by the United States — two countries that are technically in a
state of war.   
   
So I want to turn it over to \[senior administration official\] but just
emphasize at the top: This is something that Vice President Biden
identified a decade ago as a real opportunity.  And the diplomacy began
back then, it continued through now three administrations, and it led to
the historic breakthrough today thanks to who I’ll now turn it over to,
senior official number two.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  Today, after really months of U.S. mediation, specifically
the new phase of these negotiations that started in late 2021 into early
2022, the government of Israel and government of Lebanon have agreed to
formally end their maritime boundary dispute and establish a permanent
maritime boundary between them.   
   
This is a long-running dispute of multiple decades.  And negotiations
that started mediation on this issue started over 10 years ago with no
conclusion and, in 2020, took a turn where both parties essentially
stopped negotiating.   
   
At that point in the fall of 2021 and early 2022, we restarted the
negotiations under seeking for a different — seeking a paradigm shift
that would allow for a breakthrough.   
   
That breakthrough happened over the last few weeks.  And over a very
intensive last several days and very long nights, the governments of
Israel and Lebanon agreed — individually and separately agreed with the
United States — to end this dispute.   
   
Earlier today, just a short while ago, President Biden spoke with Prime
Minister of Israel Yair Lapid and the President of Lebanon, Michel Aoun,
and confirmed the United States’ congratulations — extended the United
States’ congratulations on reaching this milestone and the U.S.
commitment and President Biden’s administration’s commitment to continue
supporting both countries as we move forward into implementation.   
   
Both leaders confirmed their readiness to move forward after this
breakthrough and to begin discussing implementation.   
   
So, today’s — I’ll just add and I’ll open it up to questions: The
importance of this is that both parties get what is really critically
important for them.   
   
Lebanon has been suffering through a significant economic crisis that is
— covers all sectors of the economy.  But without addressing the energy
crisis and the electricity crisis within it, it is impossible to see any
hope for economic recovery.   
   
Most Lebanese people have less than two hours of electricity per day. 
It is impossible to run hospitals, critical infrastructure, and homes
and heat and water and food without the access to electricity.   
   
This agreement will provide Lebanon with a fresh potential for foreign
direct investment — investment specifically in the energy sector; begin
their exploration for hydrocarbon resources in the Mediterranean as the
only country in the Mediterranean that has not done so yet; and will,
over time, improve the energy conditions in the country and perhaps have
an immediate response to the electricity crisis long before these fields
are discovered and developed.   
   
Most importantly, this gives the country and the people of Lebanon hope
— something that is desperately needed.  
   
So, we are grateful for the leadership of President Aoun, Speaker Nabih
Berri, and Prime Minister Mikati for this remarkable breakthrough.  
   
On the Israeli side, Israel already had significant gas resources,
hydrocarbon resources in the Mediterranean.  It has been very successful
in developing them.  This will provide Israel with a kind of security
and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean necessary to continue to rely
on those waters for the lion’s share of the electricity in the country
and for the ability to export and be part of the solution for the global
and European energy crisis.   
   
Israel has been — has achi- — maintained all the security mechanisms and
infrastructure that they need in order to make sure that the — that
their shoreline and their country is protected.  Israel will also ensure
that they have — through separate agreements, will be able to be
compensated for any share of hydrocarbons that is on their side of the —
of the newly formed boundary.  
   
Let me be clear: We do not know if there are hydrocarbons in this area. 
We don’t know — if there are, we don’t know how large they are or where
they are.  So any — any headlines on valuation of gain or loss are — are
premature at best.   
   
This has not been an easy negotiation, but the agreement is historic. 
And I — we expect that there may be other difficult moments as we
implement this agreement moving forward.  The United States continues
and will continue to offer its help in facilitating any discussions in
the future that — where diplomatic efforts are useful.   
   
I will end it there and happy to take any questions.  
   
Q    Thanks for doing this.  Could you comment on whether the agreement
relates to Hezbollah threats in Karish, if you’re concerned?  Can Israel
go ahead and start exploring gas there despite the threats made by
Hassan Nasrallah?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:   The Karish field was not in the
disputed area.  And I — Israel already began testing on that field. 
That field is not — my understanding — is not yet ready for
development.  But once this — I don’t see any threat to the Karish field
being developed.   
   
I think that the — these negotiations were not held under — under
threats or, rather, the threats are not — were not what drove these
negotiations.  What drove them was the need to secure the entire coast
for Israel and to provide economic interests for Lebanon.   
   
In that context, the United States always supported Israel’s right to
develop Karish, and we are — we are satisfied and happy that Lebanon
will now be able to develop the fields — the one that everybody is
talking about, as well as other fields in those waters.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks for doing this.  I just wanted to ask: Is there any
concern that the governments of each or either of the two countries
could potentially not approve this deal, seeing that it still needs
government approval?  What’s — what’s the sense that you’ve gotten from
your talks with — with both sides?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, I think that we — we’ve been
negotiating intensively of late the last several days. The governments
in both sides are aware of their political — the political reality that
they — that they live in.  And I have every expectation that this
agreement is going to be signed and put into force as quickly as
possible.   
   
And I think, at the end of the day, that will happen because this
agreement is such critical — delivers such critical wins for both
sides.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks for doing the call today.  Can you explain in a bit
more detail how the compensation for Qana and other potential — other
potential developments would work?  Like, does Total need to sign a new
agreement with Israel?  To what extent has Lebanon, you know, had to
modify its agreements with Total; when all of that (inaudible) would be
finalized?  
   
And then also, does this make it easier for the Arab Gas Pipeline
agreement to move forward?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So I’m not going to get into the
details of specifically the parts where both the governments Israel and
the government of Lebanon.  I leave it to them to address the details of
the agreements, specifically on commercial terms.  That is for them to
do.   
   
As far as the Arab Gas Pipeline: Look, I think I’ve been — we, the
United States, have been fairly clear that we think that importing gas
from Egypt through Jordan, all the way to Lebanon, is a positive
development for Lebanon.  We would like to see that happen.  There are
some steps that Lebanon still needs to take.  And there are steps that
the World Bank will then take.  
   
We have been very clear that subject to the — those two things
happening, we will do a final review in the United States to ensure that
it is in line with U.S. sanctions.  But I am confident, based on what I
know, that we can get gas flowing to Lebanon on a fairly quick basis if
these reform steps that Lebanon has committed to taking will actually be
taken.  
   
Q    Thank you so much for this talk.  So first of all, how critical is
the timing issue here?  What happens if Israel doesn’t approve this
until the upcoming election?  
   
And the second question is: This is such a political debate in Israel. 
These negotiations have been going on for years, as you said.  It’s been
suggested in Israel that the agreement now was very different
(inaudible) one been discussed before (inaudible).  If you can comment
on that.  And what is the big difference?  What happened now that didn’t
happen before?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, I think that the — as I said
before, this negotiation has been taking place over years.  I think it’s
important to — when it comes to matters of such significance to when you
can reach an agreement when the opportunity is there, and there’s a
pathway towards an agreement, that is — then that momentum should be
taken advantage of, and the agreement should be — and we should sign
these agreements.  That is what happened here.   
   
This agreement is historic for a number of reasons.  One, it is the
first boundary demarcation by a group — by mutual agreement between
Israel and Lebanon.   
   
It provides security and safety for Israel.  It provides economic
opportunity and hope for Lebanon.  It means that the Lebanese waters
could soon very well see rigs and infrastructure — physical
infrastructure there, just as there is to the south in Israeli waters. 
And I think we’ve — there are several steps that have been taken here to
address security guarantees for Israel.   
   
Therefore, we believe that the government of Israel will do what it
needs to do from a legal perspective.  That is something for them to
make.  Those decisions that are for the government of Israel to make.  
   
But I think it’s important for the people of Israel and the people of
Lebanon that we are able to take advantage of this opportunity — one
that most would not have expected between Israel and Lebanon — and
ensure that this opportunity is taken advantage of.   
   
No one can guarantee where the future lies, but — and therefore no one
can guarantee that opportunities for the future of Israel, for the
security of Israel, and for the economic prosperity of Lebanon will
still be there at a different time.   
   
Again, many people have said over the last several days that a better
deal could have been done for one side or the other.  Others have
claimed that they could have negotiated a better deal — some from the
region, some from the United States.  They were in power; they did not
reach a better deal.  And when those better — so-called “better terms,”
either — for either side were on the table, they ended up not reaching
and not concluding an agreement.   
   
This agreement is not a win-lose agreement.  The parties are not getting
more than the other, because they get different things.  
   
The win for Israel is around security, stability, and economic — and
economic gain.  The win for Lebanon is economic prosperity, economic
development, foreign direct investment, and hope for an economic
recovery.  
   
Q    Thank you so much for doing this.  If you can just sketch out the
details of this agreement in terms of who gets what, especially with
regards to these two disputed oil fields that we were just talking
about.  
   
And then secondly, on the — going back to the Hezbollah threat, is there
any language packed into this agreement or any guarantees that — you
know, what might happen if conflict resumes or how Lebanon might
constrain Hezbollah from acting on their threat?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, one, there is a gas field called
Karish on the Israeli side that was not part of the disputed territory. 
The initial claim lines were north of that.  And Israel is doing what it
needs to do, working with the company — the European company that is
developing it.  
   
I don’t have much to say about what they’re doing.  It has not been —
that is not a factor in these negotiations.  
   
There is a field that transcends from what was the un- — the dis- —
within the disputed zone, it was — transcends from undisputed Lebanese
waters to undisputed Israeli waters.  It has never been drilled.  It has
been discovered, but not drilled.  So it is unclear how much and where
the deposits of gas are.   
   
That’s something that now can be — now that we have this agreement, that
can be discovered, it can be developed, and Lebanon can benefit from
it.  
   
As far as the question that you asked about conflict — future conflict —
when President Biden spoke to Prime Minister Lapid and then spoke with
President Aoun, the one thing that is clear is no one wants conflict.  
   
This is — and that is what — that’s the importance of this agreement: It
prevents conflict and puts in place incentives for each side to develop
its interests side by side.   
   
This is not a direct bilateral agreement.  It is through the United
States.  But it is marking a boundary that will allow both countries to
pursue their economic interests without conflict.  That’s the goal.  
   
And if there’s any questions in the future of disagreement — not of
conflict, which I do not expect, but of disagreement — the United States
has assured both parties that it would use its best efforts through
diplomatic means to see if it could help facilitate.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  It’s Nadia Bilbassy with Al Arabiya TV. 
Actually, my question was asked, but I wanted to follow again on
Hezbollah.   
   
Did the White House get any guarantees from the Lebanese government,
from President Aoun himself, that Hezbollah would not sabotage the deal
at any stage, and whether this is dependent on the relations with Iran —
between Iran and the West, and whether they gave instruction to
Hezbollah at any stage to mess up this deal?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The negotiations that were carried out
by — through U.S. mediation did not include discussions with Hezbollah. 
This is with the sovereign leadership of Lebanon.  We held meetings with
the — with the president, the prime minister, and the speaker.  And I
have every assurance that the government of Lebanon intends  
to keep its end of this agreement, as I have on the Israeli side.  So
that’s really all I can say on that.  
   
Q    Hey, \[senior administration official\].  Thank you so much for
doing this.  I know you briefly mentioned this before, but I was
wondering if you could just discuss a little bit more some of the
concerns that have been raised by former officials in the U.S.
administration who have insisted that, you know, previous deals were
much more “even handed” in the way that they framed it.  You know,
specifically people like former Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and
former State Department official David Schenker, both, you know, said
that from what they understand, that the deal that was reached was much
less favorable to Israel, in their eyes.  
   
Could you respond to that maybe a little more, explain what changed over
the last couple of years?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me — let me repeat what I said
before.  Let me be very clear: There were no previous deals.  
   
We had previous discussions about what deals could look like that were
not accepted by one side or by the other side.  
   
So there is — it’s hard to answer a question about comparing this deal
to another one.  This is the only deal that has been reached between
these two countries this year, this decade, or previous decades.   
   
So, comparing proposals that may or may not have given additional
benefits to either side.  And I can tell you that there have been
several proposals for better terms — so-called better terms for one side
or the other.  But since they were not agreed to, they were just
proposals and the threat for insecurity, violence, and conflict
continued to rise.   
   
This agreement, being the only one that actually was reached, is
therefore the one that has the best terms for Israel and, in fact, the
best terms for Lebanon.  And the reason for that is because once it is
executed, it will actually provide for security guarantees and
assurances for Israel, it will provide for economic guarantees and hope
for Lebanon that can actually be accomplished and put into force.   
   
Previous pieces of paper are just that.  
   
Q    Hi.  Yeah, thank you for doing this.  I would like to ask —
regarding Netanyahu’s statements today, even, and even the day before,
saying that it’s not an historic agreement, it’s a tyrannic agreement —
I wonder if you would like to comment on this and also to relate for the
timing of the approval of this agreement, just several days before the
Israel elections.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  A variety of politicians in both
countries, particularly from the opposition in both countries, have made
a variety of — a myriad of statements about it.  I urge them to review
the agreement, get briefed by their governments on the details.  And I
think that anyone who looks at this from a nonpolitical, nonpartisan,
but from a substantive perspective will reach the inescapable conclusion
that both countries here have — have done very well and have achieved
their most important goals.   
   
The — Israel has strengthened its security and stability.  And stability
in the waters of the Mediterranean are more important for Israel’s
security and economic prosperity than ever before.  The more gas
discoveries are made, the more gas is used — that gas is used for
electricity and manufacturing and spurring and allowing at a time of a
global energy crisis — and in Israel is one of the only countries in the
world not to suffer from a natural gas crisis because of its discovery —
it is important to secure those areas.  And the government of Israel has
achieved through this agreement the ability to secure those waters not
only now, but for a very long period as we go into the foreseeable
future.   
   
And for the government of Lebanon to actually be able to finally join
Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Greece in developing resources in the Eastern
Mediterranean, that is a big win for the Lebanese people who are
suffering.  
   
Having a prosperous Israel side by side a prosperous Lebanon is the best
security guarantee for both countries.  Israel only benefits from a
prosperous Lebanon.   
   
So, this agreement, despite what politicians in Lebanon or politicians
in Israel who are not part of the negotiations — despite what they have
said, this agreement, we are confident, will provide the kind of
security that both countries need.   
   
The United States’ commitment to Israel’s security has always been
ironclad.  And under President Biden, it continues to be ironclad as he
has been committed to Israel’s security his entire career in the Senate,
as Vice President, and now as President, and has demonstrated during his
recent trip to Israel.  
   
This agreement is within line of the commitment for Israel’s security. 
And our — part of that commitment to security is ensuring that the
entire Middle East region is prosperous, stable, and at peace.   
   
And that is what we are striving to do with this agreement.  That is why
President Biden has been laser-focused on the Eastern Mediterranean,
from the time he was the Vice President until today.  He began this
process of negotiations with Lebanon and, under his presidency, it now
concluded with an agreement — a historic agreement at that.  
   
Thank you all very much.
