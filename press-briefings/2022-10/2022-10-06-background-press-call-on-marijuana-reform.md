Via Teleconference

2:48 P.M. EDT  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Hi, everybody.  This is Kevin Munoz.  Thank you
for joining today’s press call on short notice.  
   
As a reminder, this call will be on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials,” and it will be embargoed until 3:01 p.m.
Eastern.  We will also have a few embargoed materials in the next couple
of minutes that will be embargoed at the same time.   
   
On today’s call, we have \[senior administration official\] and \[senior
administration official\].  And with that, I will hand it over to
\[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Kevin.  Hello, everyone. 
Thanks for being with us.  Today, the President will announce in a video
and statement that he is taking steps to end our failed approach to
marijuana.   
   
As he has often said, no one should be in jail for marijuana use or
possession alone.  It has upended too many lives and incarcerated people
for conduct that is legal in many states.  And while white, Black, and
brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people are
disproportionately in jail for it.   
   
Members of Congress have been working on this issue with one significant
bill passing the House, but that effort has stalled, and we are almost
at the end of this Congress.   
   
So, today, the President is taking executive action to address the
country’s failed approach to marijuana.  He will announce three
steps.   
   
One, the President is pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple
marijuana possession.  This pardon applies to all persons convicted of
simple possession of marijuana under District of Columbia law as
well.   
   
There are thousands of people with prior federal convictions for
marijuana possession who may be denied housing, employment, or
educational opportunities as a result.  This pardon will help relieve
those collateral consequences.   
   
The President has directed the Attorney General to develop an
administrative process to issue certificates of pardon to eligible
individuals.   
   
Second, the President is urging all governors to do the same with regard
to state offenses of simple possession of marijuana.  Just as no one
should be in federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana,
no one should be in a local jail or a state prison for that reason
either.  
   
Third, the President is asking the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney
General to review expeditiously how marijuana is scheduled under federal
law.  Federal law currently classifies marijuana in Schedule I of the
Controlled Substances Act as the same schedule as for heroin and LSD,
and it’s even higher than the classification for fentanyl and
methamphetamine — the drugs that are driving our overdose epidemic.  
   
And the President will make clear today that even as federal and state
marijuana law changes, important limitations on trafficking, marketing,
and underage sales should stay in place.   
   
With that, I’ll open it up for questions.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, thank you.  First question, let’s go to Chris
Megerian at the Associated Press.  
   
Q    Hi, everybody.  Can you say specifically what charges are being
pardoned?  What are the actual categories of charges?  And will they
take place immediately?  So, do people get — or will they be released
from prison immediately?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, the category — this is \[senior
administration official\].  The category of charges are for “simple
possession” of marijuana, and that is both under federal law and the
D.C. code.  There is a particular statute.   
   
In terms of the administration of the pardons, the Justice Department
will create an administrative process for pardoned individuals to obtain
a certificate of pardon so that they will have documentation that they
can show to law enforcement employers and others as needed.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, let’s go to Kaitlan Collins at CNN.  
   
Q    Thanks so much for doing this.  Two questions.  One, how many
people do you estimate will be affected by this?  And, two, can you
speak to why you’re doing this now and the timing behind it?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We estimate that over 6,500 people with
prior federal convictions for simple possession of marijuana and
thousands of such convictions under D.C. law could benefit from this
relief.  
   
As \[senior administration official\] said, the pardon will relieve
barriers to opportunity that these marijuana possession convictions have
posed for years to housing, educational opportunities, and employment.  
   
And this is important, as the vast — and also, you know, we can’t do it
alone.  The President is calling on governors to take this action as
well.  This is important, as the vast majority of marijuana possession
convictions are state convictions.   
   
This is something that the President has talked about, and he is — he is
following through on his campaign commitment.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, I’ll just add on the question
about timing: I mean, the President has been clear that our marijuana
laws are not working.  
   
As I mentioned up top, members of Congress have been working on this
issue, but that effort has stalled, and we’re almost at the end of the
Congress.  So the President has been considering his options, and he’s
now taking executive action to address the country’s failed approach to
marijuana.  
   
I’ll also just note that today’s pardons build on the President’s
historic grants of clemency in April when he announced 75 commutations
and three pardons, which was an earlier exercise of the clemency power
than each of the five presidents who preceded him.  So at that time, he
said that he would take further action on clemency, and today he has.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thank you.  Let’s go to Nancy Cordes at CBS.  
   
Q    Thank you.  So, my question is: You mentioned that this is going to
affect thousands of people.  Can you be any more specific about how many
people are serving time for federal marijuana possession?  You know, any
figures on how many people are going to be affected here.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, so we know that over 6,500 U.S.
citizens over — from 1992 to 2021 were convicted of simple possession of
marijuana under federal law.  And as we said, there are thousands of
more who were convicted or (inaudible) from — under D.C. code.  
   
So there are no individuals currently in federal prison solely for
simple possession of marijuana.  And again, the President is calling on
governors to take this action as well, because it’s important because
most of the marijuana possession convictions are happening at the state
level.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, let’s go to Nate Weixel at The Hill.   
   
Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I’m just looking for some more
information on the timing of de-scheduling.  You know, you said the HHS
Secretary is going to review expeditiously.  Is there a deadline to make
a decision?  And how quickly are you looking to do that?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, and let me just emphasize: The
President is asking him to undertake a review, not to de-schedule or any
particular schedule.  He has asked him to undertake the review to assess
where — what — how marijuana should be classified.  
   
In terms of the time, the process will take some time because it must be
based on a careful consideration of all of the available evidence,
including scientifical — scientific and medical information that’s
available.  
   
That said, the President is calling on the Secretary of HHS and the AG
to conduct the review expeditiously.  This is meant to proceed swiftly. 
But, you know, this has to be a serious and considerate review of the
available evidence.  So, he’s not setting an artificial timeline, but he
is saying this needs to be expeditious.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Eugene Daniels at Politico.   
   
Q    Hey there, everyone.  Thanks for doing this.  My question is: If,
you know, the de-scheduling is going to take a long time or take some
time, what happens to the people who are arrested tomorrow for these
same crimes?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Senior administration official\], I
guess I can start on this, if you want to jump in though.  
   
The pardon applies to anyone who’s committed the offense of simple
possession of marijuana.  So, anyone who has committed that offense
could not be prosecuted federally, at this point, based on that
conduct.  
   
\[Senior administration official\], anything you want to add?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I would add — look, there is a
proclamation and it is as of today’s date.  So, if the conduct occurred
prior to today, then that would — even if the person has not been
charged or convicted, the pardon does cover that conduct.  So, I will
add that.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, let’s go to Kelly O’Donnell at NBC.  
   
Q    Hi there.  Can you hear me?  Yes, thank you so much.  For a policy
matter of this significance, is there a reason why the President is
doing this on video?  And has he had any direct contact with any
specific clemency requests from people who might benefit from this
directly?  And when I say “on video,” I mean a video you’re handing out
and not an event where the press could ask him questions about this.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Senior administration official\], do
you want to take that?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, I don’t have an answer to — I
don’t have any — there’s no — I don’t think anything should be drawn
from the fact that it’s — it’s a video as opposed to some other
context.  
   
This is an important announcement.  It’s important that it be widely
disseminated.  He wants to speak directly to the American people, and
this is going to be distributed widely.  This is a significant
development, and it is — or significant announcement that delivers on
the President’s campaign commitments.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Yes, of course.  I know, obviously, we’ll maintain
significant reach on social channels, which is important for this
announcement.  
   
Last question, let’s go to Malaika Jabali at Essence Magazine.  
   
Q    Hi there.  So, according to the announcement, he’s going to be
working with governors on urging them to also review this pardon policy
in their own states.  What does that process look like?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Again, right now he is calling on
governors to follow his lead.  In terms of the next steps, those have
not been — we have nothing further to say at this point.  But part of
calling on governors is because a lot of the convictions are being
driven at the state level.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us.  
   
A reminder this call embargo will be lifted in one minute.  So, thank
you.  Bye.
