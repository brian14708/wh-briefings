James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:23 P.M. EDT    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi, hi, hi.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Happy
Monday.  Okay.

This morning, another shooting — another school shooting — this time in
St. Louis, Missouri — has reportedly left at least three people dead,
including the shooting suspect, and injured several others.

Our hearts go out to everyone impacted by today’s senseless violence,
particularly those injured and killed, their families, as well as the
first respondents.

In the wake of Newtown, Parkland, Buffalo, Uvalde, and countless other
shootings in communities across the country, we need additional action
to stop the scourge of gun violence.

Every day that the Senate fails to send assault weapons ban to the
President’s desk or waits to take another — other commonsense actions is
a day too late for our families and communities impacted by gun
violence.

Today in South Africa, African Union-led talks kicked off to address the
conflict in northern Ethiopia.  We commend those — we commend South
Africa for hosting the talks and stand ready to support African Union
High Representative Obasanjo and E- — AU panel members, former South
African Deputy President Mlambo-Ngcuka and former Kenyan President
Kenyatta, in facilivating \[sic\] — in facilitating an agreement.

As President Biden told the U.N. General Assembly last month, a peace
process is needed to end the fighting in Ethiopia and restore security
for all its people.

The United States has been intensely involved diplomatically in
supporting the launch of this — of this mediation effort.

Our Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, Ambassador Mike Hammer, has
been in the region the past several weeks and will be participating as
well.

After nearly two years of conflict, the crisis in northern Ethiopia is
one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.  With humanitarian
access largely blocked since August, emergency nutrition and — and
health supplies have completely run out in many areas and severely
malnourished populations, particularly children under five, will start
dying at alarming rates without immediate additional supplies.

There is no military solution to this conflict.  We call on the
government of Ethiopia and the Ti- — Tigrayan authorities to engage
seriously in the AU-led talks to achieve an immediate cessation of
hostilities, unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to all
Ethiopians in need, prevention of further human rights abuses and
atrocities, and Eritrea’s withdrawal from Northern Ethiopia.  
The United States urges the parties to resolve their differences through
dialogue and prevent further human rights abuses.  And as we have made
clear directly to the relevant parties in recent days, those who commit
atrocities will be held accountable.

Now, with respect to the news from the United Kingdom today, as you all
know, it’s protocol for the President to wait until after an incoming
British prime minister has met with the monarch and been invited to form
a new government to offer his congratulations.  But President Biden
looks forward to speaking with Minister Suno- — Sunak in the upcoming
days and — and to our continued close cooperation with the United
Kingdom.

I wanted to also give a quick update on the work the President is doing
to lower prices and give hardworking Americans a bit more breathing
room.

The Biden administration is continuing to charge full speed ahead in
implementing the student debt relief plan in compliance with — with the
Eighth Circuit’s order.

As I said on Friday, the temporary order does not prevent — does not
prevent borrowers from applying for student loan relief at
StudentAid.gov.  Again, that’s StudentAid.gov.

The order also does not reverse the lower court’s dismissal of the case
or suggest that the case has any merit at all.  It merely prevents debt
from being discharged until the court makes a decision.

The Department of Education will continue reviewing appli- —
applications and preparing them for transmission to loan services.  As
of Friday, 22 million student borrowers have already applied for this
game-changing relief.

The President’s message to borrowers is to apply for student debt relief
at stu- — again, at StudentAid.gov if they haven’t already.  He will
continue to fight efforts by Republican officials to block relief from
getting to middle-class families.

We’ve also been — we’ve also seen continued progress bringing down
prices at the pump.  Gas prices are declining for a third week, with
prices coming down in every state across the country.

Nationally, prices are down by $1.22 per gallon since their June peak. 
That is saving American families with two cars about 130 bucks a month
on average.  According to an industry analyst, the most common price at
gas stations across the country is now $3.49 per gallon.

Some states that saw increases in recent weeks are now experiencing
steep declines.  For instance, the price of gas fell by 31 cents in
California over the past week.  In Oregon and Washington, it has come
down by about a quarter per gallon.  Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan have
also seen prices drop by 13 to 15 cents per gallon over this past week
alone.

The President will continue to do everything he can to lower prices.  At
the same time, energy companies who are taking in these record profits,
as you all know, also need to pass on their lower costs to consumers at
the pump.  And that is something that the President is going to continue
to call on.

Finally, we wish a happy Diwale — Diwali to the millions of Americans
who celebrate.  This evening, the President and the First Lady will host
a Diwali reception at the White House.  They will be joined by the Vice
President, who is, of course, the first-ever South Asian American Vice
President in history.

The President is looking forward to celebrating this Festival of Lights
here at the White House along with millions of Americans who observe
this sacred holiday and who have made it an important part of American
culture.

With that, Colleen, you want to take — take the first question?

Q    Thanks, Karine.  So, you mentioned the St. Louis shooting.  And the
President, just a little while ago, was talking about how he’d like to
pass an assault weapons ban.  What’s the way forward if the Democrats
don’t control the House?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let’s not forget, the President was able to do
something just this past couple of months that hadn’t been done in 30
years, which is passing a bipartisan bill on getting — getting to that
next step of dealing with gun violence.  So, that is something, because
of the President’s leadership, that he was able to do.  And so, he’s
going to continue to work on that.

You have to remember, 30 years ago, he was — he was — he was one of the
leaders to ban assault weapons.  So he knows what it means to get it
done.  He knows the work that needs to get that done as well.

But, look, I think this is part of — you know, you ask us all the time,
every time — you ask me here at the podium, “What is the President’s
message to Americans?”  The — his message to Americans is: There’s a
choice.  There is going to be a choice that Americans are going to have
to make, without me getting into elections or getting into politics from
here.

But it’s very clear: If you think about what Democrats want to do, when
— if you think about what congressional Democrats and this President
have already done — lower costs; if you think about what we’re — what
we’re doing with our economic policies — creating jobs, making an
economy that is — that doesn’t leave anybody behind but builds it from
the bottom up and the middle out, that is so incredibly important.  And
what congressional Republicans want to do is take that all away.

But there’s also: How do we look at the future?  How do we look at the
things that we want to continue to do?  And that’s one of them — right?
— banning — banning assault weapons.  How do we look at how we’re going
to protect women’s health — right? — women’s — women’s right to choose? 
That is making sure we codify Roe.

What the Republican — congressional Republicans want to do is they want
to go ahead and codify Dobbs.  Right?  They want to make that a national
ban.  They want to make abortion a national ban, which means that it
doesn’t matter if you’re in a red or blue state.  That is — that right
is going to be taken away from you.  
Q    One other question.  How concerned is the administration about
security around elections this — this upcoming cycle?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s a very good question, and that is something
that, clearly, we’re monitoring very closely.  Just a couple of things
that we want to share with all of you on this is that the federal
government is committed to working with our state and local partners to
ensure the security of our — our election system from voter registration
all the way to vote tabulation.

Recently, FBI and CISA issued a joint PSA focusing on America’s election
security and preparedness.  They assessed that any attempts by cyber
actors to compromise election infrastructure are unlikely to result in
large-scale disruptions or prevent voting.

As of that — as — as of the date of October 4th, the FBI and CISA had no
reporting to cyberactivity has ever prevented a registered voter from
casting a ballot; comp- — comprised — comprised the integrity —
compromised the integrity of any bal- — any ballot cast; or affected the
accuracy of voter registration information.

Any attempts tracked by FBI have remained localized and were blocked or
successfully mitigated with minimal or no disruption to election
process.

That said, we will continue, as I said, monitor any threats to our
elections if they arise and work as a cohesive, coherent interagency to
get relevant information to the election officials and workers on the
ground.

Go ahead.

Q    Thank you.  You just mentioned that 22 million people have applied
to have their student loans forgiven.  They are expecting to have some
or all of their debt cleared.  You called it “game-changing.”  How
confident is the White House in your authority to actually clear this
debt?  And do you have any concern that you may be giving millions of
Americans false hope?  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, the President was very clear that — what he was
trying to do.  He was trying to make sure that we give — we gave middle
class Americans who were fe- — feeling a tight squeeze, especially
coming out of — come — dealing with this pandemic, an opportunity to be
able to take away the student debt that really holds people down, if you
think about it, in order to start a family, in order to put money down
on a house.  
   
And so, the President is going to do everything that he can to make sure
that we — we get this done.  Again, I mentioned 22 million people have
signed up.  But this could help up to 40 million people.  This is what
this can do: give almost 40 million people an opportunity.  Ninety
percent of them make 70- — less than $75,000.  That is a big deal.  That
is a gamechanger.   
   
So, we’re going to continue to work and make sure that people continue
to apply.  And — and, you know, I’ll leave the legal process over to our
Counsel’s Office and the col- — — the DOJ, actually.  
   
And — but, again, we’re not — it’s not going to stop our message.  We
know that there are — are opponents out there who don’t want us to help
middle-class Americans.  But that’s — but it’s not going to stop us.  
   
Q    And, you know, this legal fight could drag out for some time.  Is
there any chance that the President is considering extending the pause
on federal student loan payments, which are set to expire in January? 
Or is that off the table?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we’re not going to — I’m not going to get into
hypotheticals.  We have to see — let the process play out and see where
the — where the process goes.  So we’re not going to get ahead of
ourselves from here.  
   
It is a tempor- —  
   
Q    So he’s not ruling it out?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It is a temporary order, right?  That’s — so, just
want to make sure — don’t want to get ahead of any of this.  It does not
reverse the fact that a lower court — the court dismissed the case. 
Let’s not forget that or suggest that the case has any merit at all.  
   
As I was saying at the top of the briefing, we will continue to move
full speed ahead in our preparations in compliance with this order, of
course.  And we’ll continue to urge borrowers to apply at
StudentAid.gov.   
   
Again, we’re not going to get ahead of it.  It’s a temporary order.  And
so, we’re just going to let the process play out.  
   
Q    But is that even on the table — considering extending it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to announce if anything is on
the table on extending the pause.  
   
What I can say: It’s a temporary order, and we’re going to do everything
that we can to continue to do our outreach and make sure that people
apply.   
   
But again, it’s a temporary order.  It does not — it’s not — it is — it
does — it doesn’t have — doesn’t suggest that it has any merit.  And so,
again, we’re just going to continue moving spee- — straight ahead.   
   
Q    Karine, over the weekend, the Chinese president won a third term. 
What does this mean for U.S.-Chinese relations?  And will they meet at
the G20 in Bali?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have any — to take your first question
last — your last question first, sorry — don’t have any — any, you know,
meetings or anything to preview to you at this time with the president —
the president of China.   
   
But we — you know, as we have said many times, we’re not going to
comment on internal party politics of the PRC.  
   
President Biden and our administration are focused on responsibly
managing our competition with China while cooperating on areas where our
and the world’s interests align, which is important to us, from climate
change to health security.   
   
We continue our efforts to keep lines of communication open, including
at the leader level, as we have.  We’ve — we’ve had about five calls
with President Xi, as we have announced to all of you, in the past 20
months.  
   
As you’ve seen, President Biden has spoken to Xi again, as I’ve said,
several times.  And we believe it is important to keep those
conversations ongoing, and we will continue to do that.  
   
As far as a meeting at the G20, I don’t have anything to share at this
time.   
   
Q    And just to follow-up: Today, the U.S. Justice Department says four
Chinese nationals, including three intelligence officials, are charged
in a spy recruitment campaign.  Is there any reaction from the White
House to this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, we — DOJ has a standard process, as I’ve
mentioned many times, for notification of law enforcement actions.  And
I can check to see if there’s anything else that we can share for you at
this moment.  With this — their announcement today, just moments ago, I
would refer you to Department of — DOJ.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The results of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress are in, and they show serious setbacks in math and
reading for fourth and eighth graders.   
   
The government mobilized a whole-of-government effort and — including
legislation — to respond to the economic consequences of the coronavirus
pandemic.  Are there any plans to mount a similarly widespread,
wide-ranging, and comprehensive effort to respond to the educational
consequences of this pandemic?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you all know, from when the President walked
into this administration, it was a top priority for him to safely reopen
schools.  And he did that, especially for our kids — right? — across the
country — millions of kids.   
   
And let’s not forget, when he walked into this administration, the COVID
response was incredibly mismanaged by the former administration.  And
could — and he understood because — just because it was mismanaged, it
could not — that action could not come at the expense of our
children.   
   
So, he said he’d get to work.  And the first step was reopening schools,
which he did.  It was about 46 percent of schools were open.  And in a
short period of time, we were able to open schools fully in just a few
months after the President walked into the administration.   
   
Look, we understand, as Secretary Cardona said this morning, the results
of this data are unacceptable.  That is something that the President
believes and you heard straight –directly from Secretary Cardona
today.  
   
So we always knew that getting schools open would not be enough.  That’s
why it was the first thing that we had to do.  A once-in-a-generation
virus has had profound impacts on our students, as we’ve seen from the
data.   
   
And thankfully, the American Rescue Plan — to your point, that was an
all-of- — that was a government approach to make sure that it provided
essential funds to help students catch up academically and address the
pandemic’s impact on their mental health.   
   
And let’s not forget that the American Rescue Plan was something only
Democrats voted for.  None of — no congressional Republicans voted for
that piece of legislation, which was critical to getting our economy
back up, including opening up schools.   
   
So we’re focused on ensuring schools across the country to use the
American Rescue Plan funds to help students recover.  And we have
already launched nationwide efforts to get students recovered with
efforts we know that work: to hire more high-quality educators and
expand tutoring, summer, and afterschool programs bolstered by these
very, very funds that the — the first, you know, major piece of
legislation that this President was able to pass when he walked into the
administration.   
   
Q    And then the President said last week that he’s gotten 16 to 18
requests to campaign in these closing weeks.  But other than a trip to
Pennsylvania, he’s got no campaign travel scheduled for this week.   
   
So, I’m wondering: With two weeks ago, does the President feel like he’s
doing everything he possibly can to get Democrats across the finish line
in these midterm elections?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, you just heard the President just moments
ago, at the DNC.  Of course, I have to be careful of what I say, because
we do respect the Hatch Act here in this administration.   
   
And, look, when the President speaks, it is — he has a large bully
pulpit.  And he has been able, in the past several weeks, to — to set
that national conversation — right? — to be able to talk about what’s at
stake, what the choices that the American people have to — have to kind
of decide on, if you will.  
   
And he’s talked about student — student debt relief.  He’s talked about
the economy.  He’s talked about infrastructure.  He’s talked about
abortion — what it means to make sure that women have — to be able to
make a decision on their health.  Right?  Abortion rights.   
   
And so, every — almost every day — almost every day, you have seen the
President in front of the American people, talking exactly to that: what
is at stake.   
   
And let’s not forget: You know, we are actually laying out issues and
policies that are very popular with the American people, that are issues
that the American people want to see when you think about lowering
costs.   
   
And you have congressional Republicans who want to take that away, who
do — who do not want to see Americans have lower healthcare costs, who
do not want to see Americans have lower energy costs.   
   
The first thing that they said that they would do is repeal the
Inflation Reduction Act — which, by the way, pieces of that, if you look
at it in its parts, every part of that is popular with the American
people.  
   
Q    But as it relates to travel, are there any plans for the President
to ramp up his travel?  I mean, we have —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well —  
   
Q    — just two — two weeks and a day left.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get ahead of the President.  There
will be more travel that we certainly will be announcing.   
   
As you — as you mentioned, he’s going to go to Pennsylvania this week. 
We announced that he’s going to be doing the DNC — I shouldn’t say “we”
— the DNC announced that he’s going to be doing a rally on November 1st
in Florida.  And I would say, “Stay tuned.”  
   
Q    With the Israeli President coming for a visit, it comes at a time
when there has been a notable uptick in some prominent antisemitism and
some questions about how Republicans are responding to that, how the
culture is responding to that.   
   
What is the President’s view of how that might even influence the visit
or be a subject of the visit or how he believes the country should be
responding to that?  Kanye West has been a part of it.  Others have been
asked to respond to the corporate side of those sort of notable
instances.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I could — I could just speak for the President and
how he feels.  And he feels that our administration and himself should
respond to this.   
   
Let’s not forget the President ran on — on healing — on healing the soul
of our nation — right? — after years of — of just years of division,
years of hatred.   
   
And so, he’s very, very — been very clear on that and how important it
is to make sure that he does that in this administration.  
   
So, when racism or antisemitism rears its ugly head, he is going to call
that out.  And he has called it out.  We should not allow that
conversation to be existing — not just in the political discourse but in
our — in our everyday lives.   
   
And so, that is something that we’re going to continue to — to call out,
that the President is going to call out.  It is ugly.  It is dangerous. 
It is despicable.   
   
And he believes that — that we should con- — we should, as leaders —
leaders in the political party, leaders — it doesn’t matter if you’re —
which side of the aisle that you sit in, you should — we should be
calling this out.  And that is something that, again, he’s going to
condemn.  And he’s going to be very, very clear to call this out in the
strongest terms.  
   
Q    Does he think others have been timid in that area?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’ve talked about this before, when we saw the
situation in Los Angeles and I was asked about the city council members,
specifically in Los Angeles.  And they were Democrats, and we were very
clear: It doesn’t matter if there’s a “D” or an “R” after your name, but
that we should call this out.   
   
And what is sad about this is you see Republicans — Republicans in
Congress who — who make these horrific — and not just in Congress, but,
you know, across — across the — across the spectrum, make these really
vile and dismi- — despicable comments about racism and antisemitism. 
And they don’t call — they don’t call it out.   
   
And that — and that is going to be — that is not going to be how the
President is going to handle situations like this.  He is going to call
it out, regardless of what side of the aisle you sit on, regardless of,
again, if there’s a “D” or an “R” after your name.  
   
There is no place — no place at all for that type of vile belief or
language in our political discourse.  
   
Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
Q    On student loan forgiveness —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll come back to you.    
   
Q    Oh, okay.  Sorry.  
   
Q    It’s all right.  
   
Q    No, no, it’s (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s hard.  It’s hard.  
   
Q    In regards to students loans: If the legal challenges are resolved,
do you expect that anyone would get their loans forgiven before the
midterms?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Before — be- —  
   
Q    Before the midterm elections?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I — look, we’re not doing this — that’s not our
goal here is to get this done before the midterms.  That’s not — that’s
not something — just want to make sure — clear that up.   
   
We want to make sure that we give American borrowers who are — who are
able to get this benefit of this program — the President’s program —
relief as soon as possible.   
   
Clearly, there is this — this case before us.  And so, what we’re going
to do is continue to do outreach to make sure folks apply online and to
make sure that they are — they know if they are eligible to get — to get
this — to get this relief.   
   
Again, this is not about the — for us, for this President, this is not
about the midterms; this is a campaign promise that he has kept.  This
is another way to make sure that we are giving Americans a little bit
more of a breathing room.  This is another way, as we’re dealing with
high costs — as Americans are dealing with high cost, that they have an
opportunity in this regard with student debt relief to give, again, a
little bit more of space to breathe and a little bit more opportunity to
get things done for their families.  
   
Q    And very quickly, we saw the First Lady in a Phillies t-shirt
yesterday.  Should we expect that they’re going to go to the World
Series?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to announce.  But I — as you
know, the First Lady is a — is very excited about her team going to the
World Series.  I don’t have any scheduling to announce.   
   
Q    She could throw out the pitch — the first pitch?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t know.  I don’t have anything to share at this
time.  But clearly, there is some excitement in the Biden household.  
   
Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Today, the President seemed to be countering some
of this GOP messaging on the economy.  And he told people that
Republicans like to call Democrats “big spenders,” and people should
“look at the facts.”  But the facts don’t seem to be exactly how he’s
painting it on some of these issues.   
   
He has claimed repeatedly that the administration reduced the deficit. 
But if you break it down, you know, spending was high because of the
pandemic.  Those programs expired, and that brought down the deficit. 
And then that deficit reduction was spent on canceling student loans.   
   
And then, on the jobs claims that he made, he said that President Trump
was the first since Hoover to lose jobs during his administration.  But
— and he claimed that he had created 10 million new jobs.  But in
reality, those jobs have mostly been added back.  And the Bureau of
Labor Statistics says only about 514,000 jobs have been newly
created.   
   
So, how are people supposed to take this kind of messaging on their most
important issue seriously when some of this feels like smoke and
mirrors?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let me tell you what the American people should
take very, very seriously.  Let me remind you of the Trump tax cut of
2017: $2 trillion that was not paid for — not paid for.  So I want to be
very clear about that.   
   
And let me also remind the American people of what was happening in
January of 2020 — January 20th of — or 21 of 2020 — 2021, which was that
American businesses, small businesses were shutting down.  I just talked
about schools; only 46 percent of schools were shut down.  There was not
a real, comprehensive COVID response and making sure that people got
shots in their arms.   
   
And because of the American Rescue Plan, which is something that
Republicans refused — refused to work on, refused to vote on — you know,
the American Rescue Plan got those schools open, got those small
businesses open again, and really made — made — made us — and put us in
a place where the economy turned back on.   
   
And we saw historic — I mean, don’t — don’t listen to us.  You’re giving
me data, but there’s also data that shows that unemployment is the
lowest that it’s been in 50 — in 50 years.  
   
Q    So then why not —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It also shows that — what we were able to do, even
with the strong labor market, that was because of the plan, the economic
policies that the President put forth.  So, he put in the work.   
   
And here’s the thing — and I’ll add more, and I’m happy to hear your
next question — Congressional Republicans have been very, very clear on
what they want to do.  And this is the choice that the President talks
about that Americans have to decide on — they have to make.   
   
They have said that the first thing that they’re going to repeal is the
Inflation Reduction Act, which actually lowers costs for American
people.  They have said that if they are not able to put Medicare and
Social Security on the chopping blocks — right? — they’re going to
essentially hold us hostage.  If that doesn’t happen, they’re going to
shut down the government.   
   
That does not hurt any- — that does not help inflation; that makes it
worse.  That does not help the economy; that makes it worse.   
   
And so, that is the stark difference here of what we are talking about —
about what congressional Democrats and this President want to do.  
   
Q    So why not use — why doesn’t he lean more on some of that language
than continuing to repeat this “we reduced the deficit” thing that feels
like, sort of, irrelevant when —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, the “reduce the deficit” is real — $1.4 trillion. 
That’s what he talked about just last week.  And that is historic as
well.  In the — in one year, that’s what we — the President has been
able to do.  Those are real numbers that matter, as we talk about
inflation —  
   
Q    None of his programs —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — as we talk about the economy.  
   
Q    — have actually reduced the deficit.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, but is —  
   
Q    It just happened on its own.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, but it is actually the policies that he has taken
that has helped reduce the deficit.   
   
Let’s not forget: Trump 20- — 2017 with the $2 trillion that — that
Republicans were very happy to vote on and pay — were not — was not paid
for.   
   
So, there is a difference here in how we approach the economy, how we
approach what Americans are going through right now, how we approach
dealing with middle-class families that you are not seeing currently —
you’re not seeing currently from Republicans.  
   
I got to move on, because we don’t have a lot of space.  
   
Q    What is one thing he did that reduced the deficit?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What — no, wait — what?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    What is one program?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  So, as the President talked about his economic
policies on Friday and today, in the context of the midterms, he — he
said he thought there would be a “shift” for the Democrats.  Can you
provide any clarity about what he meant by “shift”?  Shift from what to
what?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, when I — because I also have to be very careful
here in talking about elections or politics.  
   
Look, you know, there’s going to be many, many polls in the short term
that we have left in these next couple of weeks.  I’m not going to get
ahead of them.   
   
And as we know, polls go up, polls go down.  It’s a roller coaster. 
Roller coaster.  And so, I don’t want to get ahead of that.  I’ll just
let his word stand because, again, he was talking about the midterms, so
I don’t want to dive too much into it.   
   
But again, you know, there’s going to be a lot — a lot of movement in
the next couple of weeks.  And I think that’s what he was speaking to.  
   
Q    Okay, I have a question about the war as well.  Secretary Blinken
has already said that the U.S. believes that Russia’s claims that
Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb are false claims.  Does the
U.S. have any reason to believe that the accusations are a signal that
Russia is preparing a false-flag attack?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just get on the record on a couple of
things — basically, just kind of reiterating what the Secretary said.  
   
We reject Russia’s transparently false allegation that Ukraine is
preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory.  Just today, you saw
Foreign Minister Kuleba of Ukraine put out a statement about his call
with Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency — IAEA. 
The foreign minister officially invited the IAEA to send experts to
study the peaceful facilities in Ukraine, countering Russia’s false
claims.  
   
The IAEA has agreed to do so.  We welcome this commitment to
transparency and the assurance it will provide the international
community — to the international community.  The world will see through
any Russian attempt to use this allegation as pretext for escalation.   
   
So, obviously, to your question, Weijia — and welcome back.  I’m so
sorry.  I should have said, “Welcome back.”  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Thank you.  It’s great to be back.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Welcome back.  And congratulations to you and your
growing family.   
   
But, obviously, we are concerned about the false allegation being used
as a pretext for further escalation.  And we’ve made clear we reject
these allegations.  
   
And so, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own, for example,
nuclear posture, nor do we have indication that Russia is preparing to
use nuclear weapons.  But obviously, we are going to condemn — condemn
what we’re hearing and call it out.  
   
Go ahead, Steven.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Late Friday, the Department of Homeland Security
released the latest numbers on border interactions with the Border
Patrol.  They show that over the course of fiscal year 2022, 2.4 million
encounters happened on the southern border.  That’s the most ever on
record.  Republicans have their arguments about that.  What’s the White
House’s explanation as to what happened and why?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ve said this before and at this podium in the
briefing room: What we’re seeing — this new migration challenge — is
driven by people who are fleeing falling regimes and economic collapse,
as you know, in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and also Cuba.  It’s impacting the
entire Western Hemisphere — what we’re seeing currently.  The number of
individuals arriving from Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba was up 245
percent from September of last year.

Okay, there you go.  (A chart is displayed on the television.)  As you
know, we love charts.  
   
And meanwhile, the number of —

Q    Convenient.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — a number of — meanwhile, the number of migrants from
Mexico and northern Central American — America is down nearly a quarter
compared to just last year.  So, we’re seeing, again, a different
challenge ahead of us that we’re dealing with.

But, you know — and we’ve talked about this: While we’re trying to deal
with the challenges, as you all know, you have Republican governors who
are using these migrants, using these folks who are trying to flee
communism, falling regimes, and economic collapses, as I just mentioned
— they’re using them as a political pawn, which you’ve heard us call out
many times from here, and you’ve heard the President call out.  
   
We — we are hard at work in driving toward a regional solution to manage
this new challenge.  As you have heard from us, on October 12th, we — we
announced — the Department of Homeland Security announced a series of
actions with Mexico to provide an orderly and limited way for
Venezuelans nationals to arrive in the United States and encourage them
to stop putting their lives in the hands of smugglers.   
   
So, since the launch of this joint enforce- — enforcement actions, we
have seen the number of Venezuelans attempting to — to cross the
southern border decrease sharply by more than 85 percent.  So, we are
doing the work every day to make sure that we deal with what we’re
seeing in the southern border.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I’ve got two questions for you.  Earlier today,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people inside the Saudi
government, essentially saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman regularly mocks the President in private, making fun of his
gaffes and questioning his mental acuity.  The report also noted that
MBS preferred former President Trump to President Biden.  I wonder if
you had any reaction to that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any comments on that.  
   
Q    I’ve got another question about the economic message that we’ve
been hearing from the President.  He obviously is talking about the
stark choice that the country faces between allowing Democrats to remain
in power and putting Republicans in power.  He’s talked about how
Republicans will crash the economy, they’ll shut down the government, go
after Medicare and Social Security.

It’s a pretty stark choice that he’s laid out.  And I wonder if this
President — who’s talked about how he can work across the aisle, work in
a bipartisan manner, work with Republicans — believes that if we get to
a point of divided government, if it’s just going to be chaos or if he
actually thinks that things could — could actually work between a
Democratic President and a Republican Congress.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let me — actually, let me say something about your
first question.  I’m not going to comment about, you know, kind of
ridiculous statements.  I’m not going to comment on that.   
   
But I’ll be very clear: The President has been very clear from the
beginning of this administration that we needed to review our
relationship with Saudi Arabia.  And so that is something that we are
going to continue to — to review.  And once we have something to share,
we certainly are going to share that.  
   
The decisions that OPEC+ made recently, we saw it as them aligning to —
with Russia.  And that is going to hurt many, many economies across the
globe.   
   
And so, you know, the President is going to have to — have more to say
on that.  And when he does, you’ll hear directly from him.  
   
On your second —  
   
Q    Which statements are ridiculous?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — your sec- — I’m not going to give it anymore light. 
I’m just saying that more broadly.   
   
And on the second — on your second question, look, it’s not — don’t take
my word from it — from — of it, what they’re going to do the econ- — to
the economy.   
   
The congressional Republicans have been very, very clear.  They have
said, if — you know, that they want to put Medicare and Social Security
on the chopping blocks.  They have said that.  That is their plan.  And
if they do that, that is going to hurt Americans.  
   
And if they don’t get that, they said that they would shut down the
government.  That is what Republicans have said.   
   
They also have said that they were going to repeal Inflation Reduction
Act.  Again, that’s going to — if they do that, it will take away the
power that Medicare has to negotiate — that they now have to negotiate
prices for seniors to lower those — lower prescription drug prices. 
They would take that away in a — in a time when middle class families
are dealing with inflation.  They want to take that away.  
   
This is also a plan, as you know, that deals with climate change in a
real way, and they want to take that away.  So that — that’s them.  That
is them saying that — that we are laying down the choice between
congressional Democrats and congressional Republicans.  
   
Okay.  
   
Q    Is the President ruling out any budget cuts, including
discretionary spending cuts or just Social Security and Medicare?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t — I don’t have anything else to share on — on
any policy updates.  
   
Q    And then on deficit reduction, the fact that the White House is
celebrating deficit reduction — to build on Jacqui’s question — does
that mean the President thinks that the deficit should be reduced even
further next year?  Would more deficit reduction be economically good at
this point?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So he’s going to do everything that we can to continue
to reduce the deficit.  I don’t have any number to share, but he’s going
to do everything that he possibly can.  
   
Q    Karine, back on the China meeting, I know you guys are still
working through that and you don’t want to weigh in on internal politics
there, but can you say, from your point of view, if this meeting is to
occur, given what we’ve just seen play out in Beijing, what kind of
goals do you have going into that, given that the Chinese leader seems
to be doubling down on a lot of isolationist policies?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of the — of the
President and what — a meeting that could potentially happen or not
happen, and what the agenda would be.  
   
As you know, the President has talked to President Xi several times. 
We’ve given a readout of that conversation of how the conversation has
gone and what has been the agenda on those several conversations.  I’m
not going to get ahead of the President on this.  
   
Q    Can you just say, right now, given — you know, following the Pelosi
visit, China shut down a lot of channels of communication.  Are you
confident right now that you have enough channels open to actually plan
this meeting and make sure that you convey exactly what you’re trying to
get out of it and hear the Chinese side?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Like I said, we continue our efforts to keep lines of
communication open with lea- — with — including at the leader level.  So
that is something that we have been doing for some time now, and we’re
going to continue to make that happen.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Two questions.  First, it’s been tradition for
Presidents of both parties, the day after the midterms, to hold a news
conference to talk about what the voters in America have decided the
night before.  Can you commit that the President will do that this time
around?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to read out to you or to lay out
on the schedule for the President post — post-election.  I’m certainly
not going to get ahead of him or ahead of any announcement that we’re
going to make.  
   
Q    Okay.  And on another matter: Earlier today, a group of 30 House
liberals sent a letter to the White House, urging the President to shift
his strategy on the Ukraine war, saying that more direct negotiation,
direct contact with Russia was needed.  That’s something the White House
to this point has not done, being deferential to the Ukrainians.

So, my two questions on that were: Does the White House plan to shift
course?  And secondly, is the White House concerned that there may be
some fracturing here of Democratic support for the war effort?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’ve been very clear: Nothing about Ukraine
without Ukraine.  Like, we’ve been very, very clear.  Like, this is a
decision that President Zelenskyy is going to have to make when it comes
to any type of conversation with Russia, any type of negotiation.  That
is something that Ukrainians need to make.  
   
We will continue to support them as long as — as long as it takes.  And,
you know, again, this is — and I’ve said this many times — this is a war
— unprovoked war, a brutal war that President Putin has started, has
created.  He can end this war at any time.  He can end it today if he
wishes.  
   
And we are going to continue to support the brave Ukrainians who are
fighting every day for their freedom and who are fighting every day for
their sovereignty.  
   
Again, that is up to President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people.  
   
Q    Is there any concern though about this being the first time that a
group of Democrats is questioning the White House’s strategy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ve not seen this letter.  I will say this: that
we are — we’re certainly very thankful of the bipartisan support that we
have seen over the past several months during — during this war, from
Congress.  And we’re going to continue to keep those lines of
communications open and continue to have conversations with members of
Congress.  I don’t have a direct response at this time to the letter.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Two questions on COVID.  Can you give us a preview
of what the President is going to say in his remarks tomorrow when he
gets his updated shot?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I do have something for you all for tomorrow.  
   
So, the — for the President, it’s important for him to publicly receive
his updated COVID vaccine tomorrow.  As you all know, it’s the right
time for him to get it after his infection this summer.  And he wants to
send a signal to the American people that the vaccine is safe,
effective, widely available, and also free.  
   
Ahead of the winter — ahead of the winter, and as more subvariants
arise, there is a real urgency to getting the updated vaccine right
now.  And you can expect him to — to make that point very clearly to all
of you tomorrow.  And, fortunately, the vaccines we’ve invested in, tar-
— targeted BA.5 and will be effective against these types of subvariants
that we see thus far.  
   
We’ll have more detail to preview ahead of his shot and remarks, but
what I can say is that we’re continuing to see encouraging trends in
vaccinations.  For example, in the first three weeks, we saw about 7.5
million shots.  In the last three weeks, we’ve seen almost 12 million;
that’s a nearly 60 percent increase.  That’s important progress.  And we
know numbers are higher after the weekend.  
   
The big administration focus is on reaching those at the highest risk,
particularly our seniors.  And there’s good progress there.  Half of
shots have gone to seniors, and that means almost 10 million seniors,
nearly one in five seniors, have already gotten their updated vaccine.  
   
We’re doing outreach on the ground, using existing funds for targeted
paid media, and continue to push every — everyone with a platform to
spread the word, which will be a portion of tomorrow’s event as well.  
   
Q    Can I follow up on COVID?  
   
Q    Karine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Going back to the President’s meeting coming up
this week with the President of Israel, can you give us some sense about
what topics are on the agenda?  What is the President’s goal for this —
for this bilateral?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, the President is looking forward to hosting the
President of Israel.  I don’t have anything specific to share on what’s
going to be on the agenda — agenda or what’s going to be discussed.   
   
But again, we’re looking to — he’s looking forward to that — that
meeting.  And as we get closer, we’ll share more to all of you, for
sure.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  There have been some slightly conflicting reports
about Elon Musk, because on one side there’s been a report that he might
be subjected to some kind of national security review.  There’s been
these — he’s been kind of trolling on Twitter, communicating with
Medvedev on Twitter.  So there’s been a little bit of confusion about
what his role is there.  
   
And on the other side, there’s been reports that he’s in discussions or
the government is in discussions with him about providing Starlink to
Iran, or to the people protesting in Iran.   
   
So could you give an overview of like — what’s the administration’s
dealings with Elon Musk, who’s obviously not somebody — you know, he’s
an important person.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I — I know there’s a lot of interest in this. 
We’ve — we’ve heard those reportings.  Those reportings are not true. 
So we’ll — we’ll leave that there. The national security review, that is
not true.   
   
And I really don’t have more to say on that piece, as well — on the Elon
Musk and what he’s choosing to do and not to do.  I’m not going to say
more from here.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Two questions.  One pertains UK.  What kinds of
relationship the President wants to have with the new British prime
minister?  And does the President think that the British democracy is in
turmoil right now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the United States and the United Kingdom are
strong allies and have an enduring friendship, and that fact will never
change.  And so, we know they will continue to be reliable partners on a
range of issues, including holding Russia accountable for its aggression
against Ukraine.  And we will — we will be working very closely, we
believe, with the new prime — with the new prime minister.  
   
Q    One on the Diwali celebrations by the President this afternoon. 
When did the President — the President has a strong relationship with
the Indian American community.  He has spoken about it in the past.  Do
you remember when the President celebrated Diwali for the first time? 
And when was that — with whom?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  With whom and when was that?  I don’t have anything to
share.  
   
As you know, when he was Vice President, he would hold these receptions
and events at the res- — at the Vice President Residence.  And so — but
as far as how early that started, I don’t have anything to share.  We’re
happy to — happy to check in with folks.  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, happy to — happy to do that.  Happy to do
that.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, go ahead.  
   
Q    On the event tomorrow with the vaccines, is the White House
shifting at all in its ask for additional COVID funding now that this
rollout has begun?  Has the — is there sort of a reassessment of what
may be needed?  
   
And to that point, is there any sort of light with Congress that you
guys see on the way forward to get that funding before the midterms,
after the midterms —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we believe —  
   
Q    — sort of a lame duck?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Mm-hmm.  We believe getting that additional funding is
going to be critical.  
   
Q    But is it still at 22?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s still — it’s still the same at $22 billion, and
we are going to continue to have those conversation with Congress.  That
has not — that has not ended; we’re going to continue to make sure we
get that additional funding.  
   
As we know, in order — we made this a priority to make sure that this
new vaccine — the bivalent — was — we had funding for that and — going
into the winter months, because we understood how critical it was to
make sure that people got vaccinated.  But in doing so, as you all know,
we had to really pull money away, from exam- — example — from folks
getting free tests.  
   
And so we’ve been very clear with Congress for the past several months
on how critical it is to continue this funding, to have our — to have
our front foot, if you will, on making sure that we have new vaccines
and making sure that we have the treatment — continued treatment to
offer that to people for free.  
   
And so we’re going to continue to have those conversations again, keep
those lines of communication open.  We believe it’s incredibly
important.  
   
What we are doing right now — this campaign that we’re doing for this
bivalent vaccine — is for the winter months.   
   
And after that, there is — there is no funding available.  And so we
have to make sure that we — you know, that Congress acts.  Congress
needs to act on getting more — more funding for — for COVID.  
   
Q    Can I follow up on COVID?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, we —  
   
Q    Karine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, I’ll take one last one.   
   
Go ahead, Phil.   
   
Q    Thank you.  There’s reporting out of Forbes that TikTok’s
China-based parent company, ByteDance, planned to use the TikTok app to
track the physical location of specific Americans.  My question is: Does
the administration still believe that it’s safe for Americans to use
TikTok?  And does the White House believe that TikTok presents a
security threat to upcoming elections, given that they are partnering
with organizations like the Federal Voting Assistance Program to provide
information about elections?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’ll say this: I haven’t seen those reportings, but
I’ll say this more broadly — that the President is concerned about the
power large social media platforms have over our everyday lives, and has
long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for the harms
that they cause.  And so the President has been very consistent on
that.  And the President has long been a supporter of fundamental
reforms to achieve that goal, including reforming Section 230, as you’ve
heard us say many times.  
   
His stance on Section 230 is not new, and it’s something he made clear
on the campaign trail as, one, this continues to be his position.   
   
On that specific story, I can’t comment from that — from here.  But —
and so I’ll leave it there as how he sees social media more broadly.  
   
Q    Well, then to follow up, I understand that there are these concerns
about big tech and social media, but the TikTok and national security
implications seem to be unique.  And this isn’t the first time that
TikTok’s ties to China have been scrutinized.  I know the administration
has made use of TikTok several times over the course of the last two
years.  
   
Will the President and the White House continue to make use of this
platform given that there are serious red flags?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, again, let me talk to the national security — the
National Security Council team on that specific report that you are
laying out this — at this time.  And then we’ll — we’ll respond.  
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thanks, everybody.   
   
Q    Karine, are you concerned that a lack of —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll see you guys tomorrow.  
   
Q    — presidential press conferences has led to misinformation or
contributed to misinformation?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll see you guys tomorrow.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.
