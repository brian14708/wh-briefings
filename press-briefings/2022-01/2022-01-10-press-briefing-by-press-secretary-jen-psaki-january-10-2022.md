James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:13 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay, just one item for all of you at the
top.  And I just have a hard out at five of, but I think we can get
around to everybody in the room.

Today, the President spoke with the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, to
express his heartfelt condolences and offer his support following
yesterday’s devastating fire at a Bronx apartment building, which took
the lives of at least 19 people.  
   
In the wake of this terrible tragedy, the President wanted to reach out
to offer comfort and also offer support in case there’s anything the
mayor needs.  
   
Our hearts go out to everyone who was impacted, and we are — we are very
appreciative of the heroic work of the first responders who were on the
scene so quickly.  
   
I know some of you have asked about assistance.  I’m not aware of any
requests for federal assistance.  But, of course, we will let you know
if there’s anything to share.  And we will remain in close contact with
leaders there as well.  
   
With that, Zeke, why don’t you kick us off?

Q    Thanks, Jen.  Starting with the talks in Geneva right now, has the
President been briefed on the — on the rounds of negotiations over the
past couple of days?  And what is the current U.S. government assessment
of Russian intentions when it comes to Eastern Ukraine?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President meets, as you know, regularly with his
national security team — members of his national security team, as he
did this morning.  I don’t mean a formal NSC meeting; I mean the regular
PDB meeting where he is — receives regular updates.

As you know, those talks just ended late this morning.  I think you
probably have all seen Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman did a
briefing following the conclusion of those as well.

I would just reiterate some of the points that she made, of course: that
these talks were frank, that — and forthright, and there was a
discussion from the United — from the U.S. side of what our expectations
are, and a reiteration of what you’ve heard the President say and what
you’ve heard many officials from the United States say, which is that
there are two paths for Russia to take at this point — for President
Putin to take. 

He can take the path to diplomacy — there’s two more rounds of talks
this week; we’ve seen them as a package of three, which I think they
also reiterated from their side — or there’s a path of escalation.  We
are certainly hopeful that the path of diplomacy is the path that they
will take.

There are, of course, a range of topics discussed during that meeting,
including a reiteration of what is at stake should they decide to move
forward and invade Ukraine.

In terms of an assessment of where they stand, I would really leave that
to the Russians to articulate.  We can’t give an assessment of that from
here, and Deputy Secretary Sherman did not as well.

Q    And what would it look like for the Russians to choose the
diplomatic path?  Is that just — does that mean they have to withdraw
some of their forward deployed forces on the border with Ukraine in
order to have that more sustained engagement, or it just not invading
further would keep the diplomatic pathway — conversation alive?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, Zeke, there are 100,000 troops at the border now. 
Obviously, returning those troops to the barracks — returning troops to
the barracks, conveying to us their intention of doing that is certainly
— would be easy ways to show de-escalation.

As I noted a little bit earlier, we see this as a path — as a — as a set
of three rounds of conversations that will occur this week.

As you’ve heard many of our national security officials state, but I
will reiterate from here: No talks without — about Europe without
Europe, no talks without — about Ukraine without Ukraine.  And that is
certainly our mentality. 

So, we are moving forward with the other two rounds of talks and
discussions here.  But, absolutely, the aggressive action, the bellicose
rhetoric came from the Russians, so they have the ability and the power
to de-escalate.  
   
Q    And turning to the President’s trip tomorrow to Atlanta — Karine
got this question on the plane on Friday, but a number of advocates for
voting rights and other issues down there have said the President should
not come down unless he has a plan to actually pass voting rights
legislation.  What is the President’s plan to — is it past that, or is
he going down there without a plan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, his plan is to sign voting rights legislation into
law.  That requires a majority of senators to support it, even if there
are changes to the — the Senate rules, which is something the President
has expressed an openness to.

But let me give you a little bit of a preview of what people can expect
to hear from him tomorrow.  I would just note that the backdrop of where
he’s going is vitally important here, as we were planning the trip.  In
a — it’s in a place with profound civil rights history — the Atlanta
University Center Consortium on the grounds of Clark Atlanta University
and Morehouse College in Atlanta.   
   
The President will forcefully advocate for protecting the most bedrock
American right: the right to vote and have your voice counted in a free,
fair, and secure election that is not taited \[sic\] — taintend \[sic\]
— tainted by partisan manipulation.

He’ll make clear, in the former district of the late Congressman John
Lewis, that the only way to do that are for the Senate to pass the
Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.

He will follow his remarks from last week, on the anniversary of January
6th — where he did touch on voting rights and that fundamental
importance of protecting that right — when an unprecedented insurrection
sought to violently overturn the outcome of what the Trump
administration’s top election security officials confirmed was the most
secure election in history, by saying that he will stand in the breach
and keep fighting for the soul of America. 

And he’ll also describe this as one of the rare moments in a country’s
history when time stops and the essential is immediately ripped away
from the trivial, and that we have to ensure January 6th doesn’t mark
the end of democracy but the beginning of a renaissance for our
democracy where we stand up for the right to vote and have that vote
counted fairly, not undermined by partisans afraid of who you voted for
or try to reverse an outcome.

I would also note one other piece I think you can — you will hear more
from him on tomorrow: is he’s quite focused on how — ensuring the
American people understand what is at stake here. 

Sometimes we all are — we all shorthand legislation or shorthand what
we’re talking about, and protecting the fundamental right to vote means
he’s going to also talk about what the changes have meant in states like
Georgia across the country, what is at stake for voters in Georgia and
other states across the country, and why this is so imperative it move
forward.  
   
Q    And just, lastly, Senator Schumer set a deadline of a week from now
for the Senate to pass this legislation or change Senate rules.  Is the
President optimistic that that can happen on that timeframe?  Or does he
think that that is maybe too ambitious?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he’s going to continue to work in lockstep with Leader
Schumer on moving this vote forward.  But beyond that, we’re taking it
day by day to press for the vote to happen and to be successful.  
   
Go ahead.

Q    Just following up on some of those questions.  So, on Atlanta, will
Stacey Abrams be joining the President during any of these remarks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Andrea, I know we’ll have a list — there will be a number of
elected officials joining us, traveling and also there.  I think we’re
still finalizing that list.  And we will venture to get you that as soon
as possible.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then just — our favorite topic is the Fed nominations
that we were expecting in December.  Are you — can you give us any kind
of guidance on when we could expect those?

MS. PSAKI:  We — we hope —

Q    A little bit more specific than “soon”?

MS. PSAKI:  I wish I had something more specific to deliver to you
today.  But I can just continue to reiterate we — the President looks
forward to announcing those soon.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, just on the Fed issue, Elizabeth Warren has spoken
out about reports that indicate that Governor Clarida made some
purchases and sales, and is calling for greater transparency.  Is this
an issue that the President is engaged on?  And do you think it’s time
for a — kind of a more serious look at what is — you know, what the
rules are that govern the Federal Reserve’s actions and — of its top
officials?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the — we and the President deeply respect the
independence of the Federal Reserve.  And we’re not going to comment on
recent developments.

But I can say, broadly speaking, the President believes that all
government agencies and officials — including the Federal Reserve,
including independent agencies — should be held to the highest ethical
standards, including the avoidance of any suggestions of conflict —
conflicts of indrest \[sic\] — of interest. 

The Fed is obviously an independent agency, as I’ve stated a few times;
it has its own ethics rules and requirements, including new rules issued
in October to address conflicts.  And so we defer to that agency about
any specific follow-ups.  
   
Q    And just to follow up on the issue — on that issue with the Fed:
So, I understand it’s an independent agency, but, you know, if an
independent agency is — if officials at an independent agency are not
following the rules to the letter or if those rules don’t seem like
they’re covering the whole thing, is it time to take a closer look, even
beyond what happened in October?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, Andrea, I think the President respects the
independence of the Federal Reserve.  I just noted that they have their
own ethics rules and requirements.  They put new rules in place in
October.  I’d point you to them.

But the President’s expectation that all government agencies and
officials, including independent agencies, are held to a high standard,
a high ethical — with high ethical standards, avoiding conflict of
interest speaks for itself.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then just one more question on COVID.  So, we know that
the — we know that the rapid test — you know, contracts have gone out,
but they’ve gone to companies that basically procure materials as
opposed to companies that are manufacturing the tests.  Are you
satisfied that there’s adequate testing of — you know, manufacturing
capability in place and going to procure the tests?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me give you a little bit of an update on, kind of,
a couple of timelines — or updates on timelines, I should say, on where
things stand. We’re working closely with manufacturers and distributors
to understand what they can ship and by when, as well as actively
working through the timelines for distribution.  
   
As you kind of touched on there in your question, there are several
components of this.  So, we want to ensure that there’s not only the
physical tests, but the ability to distribute them, which is what we’re
working through right now.     
   
We expect that the contracts are structured in a way to require that
significant amounts are delivered on an aggressive timeline, the first
of which should be arriving early next week.  We expect to have all
contracts awarded over the next two weeks, and then Americans will begin
being able to order these tests online later this month.   
   
We also expect to have details on the website as well as a hotline later
this week.   
   
So, these are all components that we’re working through and working to
expedite as quickly as possible.   
   
Q  And on the hospitalizations, which are now at a record level, are you
— is there anything that the federal government can do to augment the
capacity of hospitals, which are now having to cancel selective
surgeries, I think, in something like more than half of U.S. states?  Is
that something where DOD could come in with mobile field hospitals
perhaps to just offer additional capacity?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we actually have deployed a number of resources from —
to surge resources over the course of the last several months.  We will
continue to do that.  And we’re working with local health authorities,
state leaders, local leaders to determine where there are the greatest
needs.   
   
But we have deployed a range of resources — many of them through FEMA —
to ensure that local communities who have high — higher surges or diff-
— needs in different ways, I should say, have resources from the federal
government.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On the kind of nascent bipartisan talks related to, kind of, a more
scaled-back, targeted approach on the Electoral Count Act, your
colleague, Mr. Bates, was quite definitive that that wasn’t really an
option the White House was pursuing right now.  “It certainly is no
substitute,” I think to use his words.  Is part of the reason for being
so definitive on that is that you don’t want an off-ramp for two
Democratic senators, in particular, to point to instead of considering a
rules change to the Senate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ve always known my colleague, Mr. Bates, to be
definitive.  I don’t know if you all experienced that as well.   
   
But I think what — what our position is from here and what the position
of many advocates for voting rights and many Democrats on the Hill is,
is that it is not a substitute.  And we should not treat it like a
substitute, because the two bills that the President will talk about
tomorrow have essential components of them that will protect people’s
fundamental rights, expand access, ensure that people know that when
they vote, it will count and not be overturned.  And we want to be very
clear with the public that it is not a replacement or a substitute.  
   
Q    Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has declared war on this
effort over the course of the last several weeks on the Senate floor. 
His office put out a lengthy memo last night that said, in part,
Democrats will try to use, quote, “fake hysteria to break the Senate and
silence millions of Americans’ voices so they can take over elections.” 
The President has been a little sharper towards Republicans.  Do you
have a response to that memo and Leader McConnell?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — it is pretty ironic.  If making it more difficult to
vote is not silencing the voices of people — words that Senator
McConnell used — I don’t know what is.   
   
I also think it’s important to note here: If you look back at Leader
McConnell’s record from the past, he has a pretty strong record of
supporting voting rights.  And what has changed?  That’s a question for
him, less for us.  But I will — I will give you a few examples:  
   
2004, Leader McConnell: “I cannot think of any reason why anyone on
either side of the aisle would oppose the protection of the franchise of
all Americans.”  
   
2006: “The Voting Rights Act of 1965 represents one of this country’s
greatest steps forward.  Obviously, I rise today in support of its
reauthorization.”  
   
Again, 2006: He wrote in his memoir that he was “overwhelmed to witness
such a moment in history” when the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965.   
   
So, I use those examples to remind people that this should not be a
partisan issue — protecting people’s fundamental voting rights; that
people should be protecting them and standing up for Americans of all
political stripes.  That is what we are working to do.   
   
And what we’re talking about here is fighting against the Big Lie that
was perpetuated after January 6th in — around January 6th, I should say
— by many — far too many Republicans in Congress, and it has resulted in
states across the country putting in place more laws that are making it
more difficult for people to exercise their rights.   
   
We don’t think that is right.  We don’t think that is a political issue;
it is a fundamental right in this country, and it should be.  
   
Q    One more — just on Build Back Better, because I have to ask about
that at the press briefing.  Look, I understand you guys can walk and
chew gum at the same time.  But in talking to Democrats in both chambers
— some over here as well — there’s just not a lot of sense that the
conversations you guys have said are ongoing right now are going at a
pretty significant clip or are substantive at this point.  So, where are
you guys?  And what are the next steps here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our conversations are continuing behind the scenes at
a staff level.  And I can assure you that — and assure the American
people — that the President is going to continue to press to get Build
Back Better done to ensure that we are lowering costs for Americans
across the country, most importantly, to ensure we are lowering costs
for Americans across the country on childcare, on eldercare, on
healthcare; addressing the climate crisis.   
   
We know that we were — we need 50 votes in order to get that legislation
done.  And we need to figure out what that looks like to get that
legislation done.   
   
But those conversations are happening behind the scenes, and the
President remains absolutely committed to getting –lowering costs for
the American people.  
   
Go ahead, Kelly.  
   
Q  On voting rights: When you do hear the criticism from some advocates
about “don’t come without the plan,” or others who say the President has
not been personally enough involved — as he heads to this, does he feel
he has the political influence to be the tipping point this week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Kelly, it’s a hard question to answer because, really,
what we’re talking about is whether we can get enough votes in Congress
to get this done.  And that’s why I think it’s important to note that
the President will talk about this as a fundamental right for all
Americans, something that there has been a history of supporting from
both sides of the aisle, something that the public should expect and
demand from their elected officials to support.   
   
I think we would dispute the notion that the President hasn’t been
active or vocal.  He’s given a range of speeches.  He’s advocated for
voting rights to pass.  He said it is a fundamental priority for his
presidency.  And he has agreed with his Vice President that she would
lead this effort.   
   
We understand the frustration by many advocates that this is not passed
into law yet.  He would love to have signed this into law himself.  But
tomorrow is an opportunity to speak about what the path forward looks
like to advocate for — for this moving forward in the Senate.   
   
Q    Can you speak to the role of the Vice President tomorrow and what
she will be talking about, and how that relates to the President’s
message?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  The Vice President, of course, has an important
role to play here as the person who is leading this effort and will
continue to lead this effort from the administration.  She has worked to
date to help build a groundswell of support — something that many
grassroots advocates have been working on for many years now, but she
has met with a number of these advocates, she has engaged, and she is
going to continue to speak about voting rights across the country.   
   
In terms of the preview of her remarks, we’re not quite there yet. 
Maybe we’ll have some more to say about hers and the President’s later
this evening.  We’ll see.  
   
Q    And as the President has heard feedback from Geneva on the state of
the negotiations or conversations there, is he giving any sort of
incremental instructions to Wendy Sherman and the team about things he
would like introduced into the talks, or is he leaving that to be an
on-the-ground, sort of, discussion for those who are in the room and
handling it physically there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he is in regular touch with members of his national
security team, and they are in touch with team members on the ground. 
So, I would say we are looking, again, at this week as a set of
conversations.  And we will see and be able to assess where things stand
better at the end of that.   
   
I will note a couple of things that — as you’re looking at this: We are
preparing ourself for the possibility and likelihood — no one should be
surprised, I should say, if Russia spreads disinformation about
commitments that have not been made, or if it goes even further and
instigates something as a pretext for further destabilizing activity. 
And so, we would continue to urge everyone not to fall for any attempts
to push disinformation out there.   
   
But the — for the President, the most important thing to convey and that
he’s conveying to his team is that no talks without — no talks about
Europe without Europe, no talks about Ukraine without Ukraine.   
   
We had these discussions with the Russians today.  They are important
conversations that will be happening on the 12th in Brussels and the
13th in Vienna.  And this is just one part of a three-set series of
discussions happening this week.  
   
Go ahead.  Oh, sorry, Peter — I’ll come back to you.  I’m sorry.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you very much.  Can I ask you for the latest on the Chicago
schools closure dispute?  The governor announced over the weekend the
availability of tests.  He’d previously sought the administration’s help
in procuring tests.  Can you say whether the 350,000 they procured
involved federal involvement at all and whether those talks are
ongoing?   
   
And broadly, do you have any message to both the Chicago Teachers Union
and the mayor of Chicago on what you hope to see there in the coming
days?  This, of course, is the fourth day in a row without any school
there.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say first that we are in regular touch with
the governor and his team and the mayor as well, so we can continue to
convey — have those conversations behind the scenes.   
   
We have been very clear, publicly and privately, that we want to see
schools open; that the President fought for additional assistance in the
American Rescue Plan — $130 billion, including $5 billion that went to
Illinois, $10 billion that went to testing across the country — to
ensure we were prepared and had resources needed to address whatever may
come up in the pandemic.   
   
But we are having these conversations.  We are in regular touch with
them — both the mayor and the governor.  And we’ll continue to see how
we can assist from here.  
   
Q    Given the mayor is a prominent member of the President’s party, has
he spoken to her directly?  I mean, does he feel the need to intervene
here?  It seems like it’s sort of an exceptional case in Chicago when so
many other cities are reopening that it’s bucking a trend in some
ways.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to obviously speak for the mayor, but I
think the mayor has also conveyed what her view is here as well.   
   
The President’s view is to — that schools should be open across the
country, and more than 95 percent are across the country; that the
mental health impact on kids of not having schools open is very harsh
and hard, and he does not want to see schools closed across the
country.   
   
So, that — there’s no secret about that.  That continues to be what he
states.  That’s why he fought for funding.  And we will continue to be
in touch with local leaders in Chicago to work to get their schools
open.  
   
Q    And Jake Sullivan had a statement over the weekend with regards to
Iran and sanctions —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — and he alluded to the threats against American officials.  Should
we interpret from that that the U.S.’s intelligence — that there have
been threats, in particular against Trump officials who were involved in
the Soleimani strike?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to get into intelligence here, from the
podium.  But we’ve certainly seen concerning public rhetoric from
Iranian officials about individuals from previous administrations, even
before sanctions from this weekend, and that’s unacceptable.  
   
As the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, said in his statement
over the weekend that you just referenced: As Americans, we have our
disagreements on politics…on Iran policy,” and other issues, of course. 
“But we are united in our resolve against threats and provocations. 
We’re united in the defense of our people.”  And we’re going to protect
and defend our own people.   
   
But I’m not going to get into more specifics.  Obviously, they announced
the sanctioning of more than 50 individuals and have made public
comments in addition that are certainly available to anyone.   
   
Q    If I —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.   
   
Q    Sorry, sorry.  One more.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  You’re fine.  You’re fine.  We’re good.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Speaker Pelosi opened the door to maybe some sort of virus aid
measure coming through.  Do you have any new update on whether the White
House is involved in any talks towards that — for instance, restaurants,
of course, has had some traction in the Senate of a potential top-up of
that fund?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we — we certainly agree with Speaker Pelosi on a lot
of things, but on the fact that — on what she said this weekend, which
is that we’re not going to let a lack of resources get in the way of
fighting the pandemic.  
   
We have been in constant conversation with leaders and with the Hill and
members about what may be needed, whether that’s more to address COVID
or small businesses and help keep them afloat.  I don’t have anything
specific at this point in time, but we’re going to continue to assess
what the needs are and stay in close touch with them about that.   
   
Q    Thank you.

MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I was home all last week isolating.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Welcome back.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I was isolating with COVID after a positive test, like
a lot of people watching.  And — a lot of time in front of the TV.  
   
I heard the President say —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Did you watch Fox the whole time, or other things?  
   
Q    I have exhausted the full catalogue of Guy Fieri content.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oo-kay.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    And obviously, a lot of Fox.  
   
But I heard the President say, “Google ‘COVID test near me.’”  So,
somebody isolating with COVID, I did that.  And the appointments
everywhere were completely jammed.  So, why is it that you guys were so
unprepared for the need for testing after the holidays?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Peter, I’m happy to see you back and well.  I would,
second, say that there has been a massive surge in cases, as you know
and were part of, in D.C. and New York.  And there’s been an
unprecedented — and other parts of the country as well.  There’s been an
unprecedented demand for tests.   
   
So what we have done over the course of the last few weeks, even before
that, is the President quadrupled our testing capacity since the summer,
we opened 20,000 sites across the country, and we have also opened
additional federal sites, including one in D.C. only recently.   
   
He’s also provided — we’ve — also in the process of sending 50 million
tests out to community health centers and rural health centers.  And now
we’ve just — we’re in the process of finalizing contracts for 500
million tests.  
   
Q    But —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But what — can I make one more point and then you can go
next?  I would just note where we have come from.  If you look to a year
ago, there were no tests — or maybe one, depending on the timeline —
that was available on the market.  Now we have nine.  If you look to
about a year ago, there was about 900,000, or maybe slightly higher,
tests that were being issued every day.  Now we’re at about 10 or 11
million.  Three hundred million tests are done in this country every
month.  
   
So there’s enormous progress being made, but we needed to make sure the
market was growing — that’s what we’ve been working on — and increase
our access to supply, and that’s what we’ve been doing.  
   
Q    The test you’re talking about, though, require people to go
somewhere and either make an appointment or wait in line.  The CDC’s
guidance is: If you think you have COVID, you’re supposed to stay home. 
You guys said you were going to mail free tests to people that need
them.  The President is there, on television, talking about a “winter of
severe illness and death.”  
   
While he’s saying that publicly, why weren’t you guys doing more to
prepare for the winter?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Peter, everyone decides where they’re going to go get
a test.  And we make a range of options available.  You can also
purchase tests online.  Later today, we’ll have more details on how 150
million Americans who have health insurance can get reimbursed for
tests.  So, we’ll have more details on that later.  
   
The 500 million tests I noted — and I gave you a little bit of an update
on the timeline — we’ll have more on the website later this week.  
   
So our steps and our process from the beginning has been expanding
access to free tests, to make it easy and more accessible for
Americans.  And we’re continuing to build on what we’ve done to date.  
   
Q    But the President talked about a “winter of severe illness and
death.”  At the rate you guys are going, these tests are not going to be
available until spring.  So will you admit that these free tests you
guys promised are not going to be ready until after the Omicron surge?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think I gave an update earlier that we’ll have — start to
have tests out the door in the coming weeks — very soon.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And again, that’s not the only place people can get tests. 
There are a range of ways people can get tests online.  Again, you’ll
know more about how you can be reimbursed for those tests from here.  Go
to different sites — there are federal sites opening up all around the
country.  
   
Q    And we understand that you guys plan to rely on the Postal Service
to send out these free tests whenever they’re ready.  But the Postal
Service says they’re going to have a staffing shortage because of your
vaccine mandate.  So, would you pull back on the vaccine mandate if it
meant getting people these free tests sooner?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The Postal Service also delivered 98 — 99 percent of
packages on time in advance of Christmas.  And they also — their leaders
have also said they’re eager to take on this challenge.  So, we welcome
that, and we’re looking forward to working with them to get these tests
out to the public.  
   
Q    And I understand that the science says that vaccines prevent
death.  But I’m triple vaxxed, still got COVID.  You’re triple vaxxed,
still got COVID.  Why is the President still referring to this as a
“pandemic of the unvaccinated”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, Peter, there’s a significant difference
between — and you just — you just experienced this.  And not to expose
your public health experience —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — but I can speak to mo- — mine as well.  I had been triple
vaxxed.  I had minor symptoms.  There is a huge difference between that
and being unvaccinated.  You are 17 times more likely to go to the
hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die.  And
those are significant, serious statistics.  So, yes, the impact for
people who are unvaccinated is far more dire than those who are
vaccinated.   
   
Q    Will the President update his language at some time to be more
reflective of the fact that people who are triple vaccinated are
catching and spreading COVID?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think peo- — the President has said — as have we, a number
of times that there will be breakthrough cases.  There will be people
who get COVID here, at different media organizations, at companies
around the world, around the country who have been vaccinated.  But
there is a significant difference between being hospitalized or dying,
and being vaccinated with more mild symptoms.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, last one: You guys have been very aggressive
countering COVID misinformation.  So, what do you guys think about COVID
misinformation coming from the Supreme Court and Sonia Sotomayor’s false
claim that over 100,000 children are in “serious condition and many on
ventilators”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to speak to Supreme Court arguments or
statements made in those arguments.  But I will tell you that what is at
stake here is our effort to protect health workers and, most
importantly, protect patients with the CMS rule and also to make work
places safer with the OSHA rule, which we have confidence in our legal
argument for.  So, I will leave it to them to decide.  But that’s what’s
being argued now.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I know getting ahead of the President before a major speech is one
of your favorite things to do, and, that being said, I’m going to try
this question anyway.  You mentioned that, over the past year, President
Biden has expressed more openness about taking a look at filibuster
rules, especially when it comes to voting rights.  Is that a topic you
expect him to directly address tomorrow and get into?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Is there an announcement in terms of whether it will be more
forceful or whether he’ll have any specific thing to say other than “I’m
open to the idea”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, the President has spoken to this issue a number of
times, as I’ve said before, including as recently as December, where he
said that if that is how we get this done, “I’m open to that.”  But
again, he’s working on his speech.  You’ll have to tune in tomorrow and
see what he has to say.  
   
Q    Has he had any specific conversations with senators about this
legislation, about a rules change in the past couple of weeks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re in regular touch at a range of levels with senators. 
I’m not going to detail those further.  
   
Q    And then, the last question: Any response to a recent statement
from Senator Sinema’s office indicating she would not be in favor of
changing the rules and dealing with these two pieces of legislation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Look, I think that everyone is going to have to take a hard
look at where they want to be at this moment in history, as we’re
looking at efforts across the country to prevent people from being able
to exercise their fundamental rights.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, in previewing the President’s speech earlier today, you said
that he will “forcefully advocate” for the voting rights.  Last week’s
speech on January 6th, the President’s speech then was — was viewed as
pointed and forceful.  In terms of the tone of tomorrow’s speech, should
we expect something along those lines?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that the President will certainly be clear
about what is at stake here and how important it is to protect people’s
fundamental rights across the country.   
   
He felt that a speaking to this warranted a moment where he was going to
give a full speech on it.  That’s exactly why he’s going to Georgia, a
place with enormous history on civil rights issue, unfortunately
enormous recent history on efforts to suppress the vote.  So, that is
why he’s going there.   
   
But January 6th — it’s all connected in his view — was certainly a day
where he needed to speak very clearly about the role of his
predecessor.  
   
Q    And just one on COVID.  Could you expand just a little bit about —
on what the President said last Friday when he was asked about
controlling COVID?  When he mentioned the “new normal,” was he moving
away from his campaign pledge of shutting down the virus or changing the
messaging at all about COVID-19?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What he’s referring to is the fact that we have — now, we’re
in a different place than we were a year ago: More than 200 million
Americans are vaccinated, and more than 71 percent are fully
vaccinated.  More than 80 percent, or a little higher than that, have
had a first dose.  We have a range of tools at our disposal, including
antivirals and other treatments.  So, we’re going to continue to expand
that, but we are in a different place than we were a year ago.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Does the President feel that forceful speech that he gave last week
— does that raise the bar for getting something done?  I mean, he’s been
talking about this for months.  He had a speech in July in
Philadelphia.  Nothing’s happened.  Has he basically raised expectations
here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  About giving good speeches or about — (laughter).  
   
Q    No, about — about the voting reform.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think he believes the stakes should be raised.  He
wouldn’t be going to Georgia tomorrow — a place where there is enormous
history of — from — of civil rights leaders, of his — of his friend John
Lewis — advocating for fundamental rights, including voting rights — if
he wasn’t ready and prepared to elevate this issue and continue to fight
for it.  
   
Q    The administration has said that schools have the resources to
remain open, yet they’re — we’re seeing closures, including Chicago. 
There are still a lot of teachers staying away due to illness or fears —
other school personnel.  So, what is the White House prepared to do in
the event of other school closures due to the lack of personnel?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s important to note that more than 95
percent of schools across the country are open and, in part, because of
the resources that they were able to receive from the American Rescue
Plan.  It enabled them to hire more bus drivers, maybe hire more
teachers, put in place additional mitigation measures.  Many — many
secured testing contracts to ensure that there could be regular testing
at their schools.  
   
There are some parts of the country where all of those resources haven’t
been deployed yet.  Of course, the Department of Education will continue
to work with them.  And our Department of Education has also taken steps
far in advance of the last few weeks to work with states on anticipating
and preparing for labor shortages.   
   
So, we are in touch at every level.  What our position continues to be
is that schools need to be open.  We err on the side of schools being
open.  We believe that there are the mitigation measures, the steps, and
the resources to do exactly that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  About those mitigation efforts: One way in which
to reduce the spread of COVID is through the use of masks.  And health
officials have said that these cloth masks are virtually useless.  You
need to use, they say, a KN95, a K95 mask.   
   
And as I travel — I travel around the country — I see very few people,
oftentimes, wearing these types of masks — the KN95 mask.   
   
Any my question is: Is there a federal effort to make certain that these
types of masks are available in the inner city, in rural America for
people just getting on an airplane?  Because this is a better type of
mask, as Dr. Fauci has said, than a cloth mask.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would just note that the CDC guidance continues to
be: A well-fit mask is the best mask to be wearing.  They haven’t
changed that guidance as of now.   
   
In terms of how these resources — if we talk about schools and keeping
schools open — can be used, the purchase of masks certainly could be a
part of that.  It’s up to school districts and local school districts to
make those decisions.   
   
We also, of course, work with community health centers, rural health
centers, local health leaders on what they feel their needs are and how
resources from the American Rescue Plan and COVID packages in the past
should be spent.  But the guidance has not changed from the CDC.  But we
do listen to local health leaders on what their needs are and how the
resources that have already been approved can be effectively deployed.  
   
Q    So, there’s no money then that could be taken from the American
Rescue Plan devoted towards this federal effort?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think that’s what I said.  I think —  
   
Q    I’m asking you.  I’m asking you that question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, $130 billion of the Rescue Plan was for
schools.  That can be used in a range of ways.  And so, some of that
money has not even been spent yet.  It’s — it is all in states, but I
think there is an allowance for that.  But I can certainly check if
there is more specific measures.  I just think it’s important to note
that the CDC has not changed their guidance on masks.  
   
Q    And then on those talks that took place in Geneva today between the
U.S and Russia: The last time that President Putin spoke about this
impasse that exists was during his end-of-the-year press conference. 
And during that end-of-the-year press conference, President Putin said
“the ball is in the U.S. court” on this particular issue, which is
different than what you said when I asked you that same question in
early December.  Do you disagree with that contention that “the ball in
the U.S. court” here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s not just about me disagreeing.  The facts
disagree with that.  Russia and President Putin has built up a troop
presence of 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine.  They have used
bellicose rhetoric.  It is up to them to determine if they are going to
deescalate.  There is a diplomatic path forward.  That is a path forward
that remains open.  But certainly, it’s up to President Putin to make
this choice.   
   
I just want to get to everyone, so let me try to jump around to everyone
before I have to go.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Just two quick questions.  I wondered: A group of
congressional Democrats wrote to the White House, urging the President
to use executive power to, essentially, use the Defense Production Act
to manufacture enough rapid tests so that Americans could each take one
test per week.  I wonder if the White House had any response to that and
if they think that is, you know, an achievable goal — something that
they would shoot for — in response to that letter.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve seen that letter.  The good news is that we
agree and we’re already doing most of what’s in that letter.  So, we use
the Defense Production Act to drive production of these tests, and we’ll
do so again when it can accelerate production delivery of these tests. 
We used — deployed $3 billion for procurement of tests.  We used $3
billion to procure tests, which was — which became a major driver in
increase and expanding the market for tests.   
   
And the President’s plan to procure and distribute 500 million tests to
all Americans is, in and of itself, providing a major stimb- — stimulus
for global production of these tests.  We agree.  That’s why we’ve
already used the Defense Production Act.  
   
I know they referenced the hotline.  There’ll be more details on that
this week.   
   
Our objective here is to expand access to free public testing, as is
referenced there.  We’re already in the process of sending 50 million
rapid antigen tests directly to Federally Qualified Health Centers — I
know they referenced that — and to rural health clinics.  And we’re
publishing guidance.  As I noted, we’ll have more details later today on
that.   
   
So, the good news is that we agree with what — a lot of what they’re
saying.  And we — we have already taken steps to put in place a number
of measures.   
   
Q    And just one other one: You mentioned — to follow up on the Chicago
schools issue — you mentioned that the administration has been in touch
with the mayor and the governor.  Has anybody from the administration
been in touch directly with the teachers union?  And if not, why not?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are in touch regularly with the teachers union and have
certainly been, but I don’t have any more details.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  A couple quick questions here.  I know you don’t want
to weigh in on ongoing litigation before the Supreme Court, but not long
ago, in this room, the Surgeon General told us that COVID misinformation
was a public health threat.  I’m wondering if the White House is at all
concerned, given Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor’s remarks about the
Omicron variant, that maybe the danger is being overhyped and your
message is not getting out.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think I just addressed this.  Didn’t I answer this
question?  
   
Q    You answered it.  But are you worried that there is misinformation
that is being spread, so much so that even a sitting Supreme Court
justice has an inaccurate picture of things?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I’m just not going to weigh in on a specific legal
argument made in the Court.   
   
Q    And then, I know you’ve been asked several times about Chicago. 
You said it here, you said it before, you know, that the President
clearly wants schools to be open.  There’s been money that’s been
allocated.  Can we expect that the President will be more aggressive and
use the bully pulpit to tell teachers unions in Chicago to get back in
the classroom?  I mean, this is the third — the nation’s third-largest
school district.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I would note the President has been very clear,
as we have been clear: We are on the side of schools being open.  That
is why he advocated for funding in the American Rescue Plan.  And we
will continue to convey that clearly, because he believes the mental
health impact on kids is — could be dire and it is imperative that kids
are in the classroom.   
   
More than 95 percent of schools across the country are doing exactly
that, and we’re hopeful that will continue to increase.   
   
Q    And then, one more —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — quickly.  In December, you and I talked about the Afghan women
who had been honored here at the State Department.  Sources are telling
us right now, currently, that some of these women are being told that
before they can apply for refugee status, they need to leave the
country.  And if they do that, though, you know, the odds are good that
their bank account will be seized and that that process is a
two-year-long process.   
   
Are there any additional resources that are going to them currently?  I
know it’s a challenging situation and it’s in flux.  But is there
anything more you can tell us about trying to get those (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me check on more specific details.  Obviously, the State
Department is overseeing all of our programs and we’re continuing to
work to get more people out, but I will see if there’s more details on
this and I’ll ask them specifically.  
   
Go ahead, in the way back.   
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask you about India-U.S. relationship. 
What is on the President’s agenda for this year when it comes to the
world’s two largest democracies, India and the U.S.?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you know, back in September, the President hosted
President Modi at the White House, and their meeting was about launching
a new chapter in the history of the U.S.-India relationship.   
   
At that time, the two leaders laid out their shared vision for the
U.S.-India relationship and we’ll continue to work closely this year.   
   
You can expect our governments will move — be moving forward on a
wide-ranging set of initiatives, from cooperating to fight the pandemic,
scaling up action to address climate change, working bilaterally and
through the Quad, expanding our cooperation and trading investments,
cyber and in new and emerging technologies, and continuing to talk about
— and, as always, we are focused on strengthening the deep ties between
our people and our shared democratic values that underpin the
relationship.  But, obviously, we’re going to continue to build from
here.  
   
Q    One, quickly, on China’s aggressive behavior on its border with
India.  Does this come into your talks with the Chinese?  And is the
U.S. sending any message to the Chinese on this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we continue to closely monitor the situation, and we
continue to support dialogue and peaceful resolution of these border
disputes.  We’ve been pretty clear how we view Beijing’s behavior in the
region and around the world.  We believe it can be destabilizing.  And
we’re concerned by the PRC’s attempt to intimidate its neighbors.   
   
We’ll continue to stand with our partners on that.  
   
Last one.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Goldman Sachs is saying that there’s going to be four rate hikes
this year; the Federal Reserve indicated maybe three.  If they move a
quarter of a point, the Committee for federal — Responsible Federal
Budget says that three hikes would add an additional $175 billion a year
to a debt payment alone.  So, does this change the thinking of the White
House in terms of how much spending the President wants to do, as the
rate hikes start to come in?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I always like to say monetary policy is the
purview of the Federal Reserve, and we respect their independence.   
   
Interest rates have been, kind of, as you touched on there, at
historically low levels during the pandemic.  We always knew that as the
economy recovered and gained strength, interest rates would rise to more
historically typical levels.   
   
The President is committed — as you talk about spending — to fiscal
responsibility and ensuring that our long-term investments are fully
paid for.  That’s why he has proposed a range of ways to pay for his
Build Back Better agenda and he — and why it’s fully paid for and would
still lower the cost for Americans on prescription drugs, childcare, and
many other issues.   
   
But he is somebody who is — is mindful about being fiscally responsible
and is focused on that as he looks to his agenda moving forward.   
   
Q    And one more on climate change.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    On climate change — so the President talks about a transition away
from gas cars, recently announcing the mileage standards going up 40
miles per gallon over the next — in the next five years.  He’s pushed
for electric cars.  The Beast gets an estimated six miles to the
gallon.  The President has been in office a year.  Is there any plans to
make his car electric?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to check on that.  I mean, part of what we’ve
talked about is making sure that the fleet owned by the United States
government, which is very large beyond the Beast — the Beast is just one
member — is that we work toward making sure we’re leading with our focus
on energy independence as well.  But I am happy to check on his car,
otherwise known as “the Beast.”   
   
Thank you, everyone, very much.   
   
Q    Jen?  Jen, can I just ask you on the teachers?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    You’ve talked about the importance of students being back in the
schools and the mental health issues.  And — but this administration has
made a really strong commitment to labor unions in general.  So, how can
you disregard the concerns of teacher unions who say that classrooms
aren’t safe, or who are concerned that teacher — that classrooms aren’t
safe?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think, Andrea, that’s an accurate characterization. 
We’ve prioritized teachers getting vaccinated first.  We fought for —
the President fought for an enormous amount of funding to ensure that
schools and classrooms could — could — and teachers could take steps
that could put in place mitigation measures to make sure students,
school teachers, and members of school communities are safe.   
   
And I think what I’m echoing is what a number of people in the public
health community have conveyed: that those measures can make sure that
schools are safe, can ensure people attending school are safe.  No
parents want to send their schools — their kids to school in an unsafe
environment either.   
   
But we are in a very different place than we were earlier this year. 
And it’s important for people to be mindful of the mental health impact
on kids, something that, of course, many parents across the country feel
very strongly about.   
   
Thank you, everyone, so much.
