James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

11:48 A.M. EST

MS. PSAKI: Okay. We have another special guest today: our FEMA
Administrator, Deanne Criswell. And she’s going to give a brief update
to all of you at the top on all of the important work the — FEMA is
doing to help us fight the pandemic. She’ll take a few questions, and
then we’ll proceed with the briefing from there.

I know it’s going to be a short one today, but we’ll try to get around
to as many people as possible.

With that, I will turn it over.

ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: All right. Thank you.

All right. Good afternoon, everybody — or good morning, still.
Yesterday, Secretary Austin and I were able to brief the President on
the tremendous work that’s being done to support our hospitals right
now.

At FEMA, we’ve been part of this COVID mission since day one, beginning
with supporting jurisdictions with medical personnel; acquiring and
shipping personal protective equipment, medical equipment; opening
testing sites; and deploying federal resources in support of our state,
local, territorial, and Tribal members.

As we approach the one-year anniversary of opening our first community
vaccination center in California — just one of the thousands we
supported across the county — FEMA and our over 20,000-strong workforce
continues to meet the ongoing requirements of the pandemic.

Our support to our partners hasn’t stopped and will not stop until this
pandemic is over.

We know the most critical need right now is medical staffing for our
hospitals. And we’ve been working non-stop with the Departments of
Defense and Health and Human Services, who have been on the grounds in
communities since day one, to push even more medical teams out the door
to communities who need it most.  
I’ve seen firsthand the impacts of these teams on their continued heroic
efforts.

During my time as commissioner in New York City for Emergency
Management, at the beginning of the pandemic, I had the privilege of
speaking with the Chief Nursing Officer at Elmhurst Hospital, which was
— at the time — the epicenter of the epicenter in those very early days,
and listened to her address the Department of Defense medical team as
they were concluding their mission at their hospital.

She said, with tears in her eyes, “You were the miracle we needed when
we needed it most.” DOD continues to deliver on those miracles every day
as they stand shoulder to shoulder with the heroes working on the
frontline in your communities.

Yesterday, I spoke with Governors Whitmer and DeWine, who both said
separately that these teams, in addition to adding more clinical
capacity, are a morale boost to the doctors, the nurses, and the support
staff in the hospitals that they’re working in. And they have been
working day and night to save lives.

So now DOD is deploying six additional teams to Ohio, Michigan, Rhode
Island, New Jersey, New York, and New Mexico. We will also be deploying
an additional HHS team to Rhode Island. And in the next several weeks,
we are prepared to do more.

These teams are in addition to more than the — the more than 1,000 staff
that are already deployed to 26 states, 2 territories, the District of
Columbia, and 24 Tribal Nations. And since March of 2020 — since the
beginning of this pandemic — thousands of federal personnel have
deployed all over our country.

As critical as our doctors and nurses are, countless other professionals
keep our hospitals running. Patient transporters, food workers, and
cleaning staff are all at the heart of these healthcare facilities.

And so, for that reason, with the President’s support, I am now
directing an expansion of our FEMA policy to permit funding to states
who elect to use their National Guard troops to fill these critical
support roles in hospitals.

During every disaster, FEMA’s strength is our ability to coordinate with
other stakeholders –- federal, state, local, Tribal, private, and
non-profit partners -– to identify gaps and meet needs. And this COVID
mission has been no different.

We meet with our DOD, HHS, and other federal partners daily to
anticipate future needs and fill those requests.

FEMA has also been supporting communities across the country through
nearly $100 billion in funding for all types of COVID-related needs,
including vaccination, safely opening and operating schools and other
public facilities, and testing, thanks to an unprecedented commitment by
this administration.

This funding — combined with the extraordinary work of DOD, HHS, and our
other federal partners — has enabled states and local communities to
fight this pandemic, save lives, and protect families.  

This pandemic has shifted and changed through the Delta variant and now
the Omicron variant, but our commitment, and the commitment of the
entire federal family, has not changed.

Together, we will continue to surge staff, push resources, and provide
support using every tool that we have available to fight our fight
against COVID-19.    
Thank you. And I’ll take a few questions.

MS. PSAKI: All right. Weijia.

Q  Thank you. And thank you so much for being here, Administrator.

Manpower is one thing, but I know you’ve talked about, in the past, too,
having to make sure they have somewhere to work and that there are
hospital beds. So, for these six particular states and hospitals that
have been identified, are you building out capacity, adding more
physical space for the teams to work?

ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: In these specific states — these six states — we
are just sending staff. That is the request that they had.

Our regional administrators have been in constant communication with our
state emergency management directors and state public health directors
throughout this pandemic. And we have been conducting, recently,
facility expansion assistance to all of the states.

Right now, we’ve had a few states that have requested some assistance in
helping to identify where they may be able to expand. But we’ve had no
specific requests to expand hospital capacity outside of maybe setting
up a tent outside of their emergency room to be able to support triage
efforts.

Q  Thank you.

MS. PSAKI: Alex. Oh, go ahead.

Q  I do have a question. You know, this has been a year of unprecedented
natural disasters, as well as, obviously, a global pandemic that has no
end in sight at this point.

Are you largely relying on ARP funding, or are you hoping to get more
funding from the administration going forward, as we’re looking at
another year of ongoing challenges?

ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, the funding that FEMA uses is through our
Disaster Relief Fund. And right now, for all the requirements that we
have on our plate, we have enough funding within that to meet all of
those demands.

MS. PSAKI: Jeremy.

Q  Thank you, Administrator, for doing this. What kind of feedback were
you getting from governors or hospitals that led to this decision and
this added flexibility?

And then, secondly, I’m also wondering — you know, next week, there’s, I
guess, 120 military members going as part of this six-state deployment.
That’s out of the, I think, 1,000 military members that the President
has said he would mobilize this coming month. So why are you only
sending 120 right now, at a time when there are, you know, nearly two
dozen states, I think, that have 85-percent-plus ICU bed capacity? Are
there not more requests coming in? Or what are you waiting for to deploy
the rest of that 1,000?

ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, great questions. And so, on the first
question — remind me the first question again real fast.  
   
Q  Yeah. The feedback that you’re getting from governors and hospitals
that (inaudible).  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: So, again, my regional administrators, they’ve
been communicating with our state directors daily. And one of the things
that — that we have heard recently is, while we do need medical
staffing, there’s a lot of other functions within the hospital that need
additional staffing, in particular because of the Omicron variant and
how it’s taking other staff within the hospital out.  
   
And so, we’ve been able to expand our policy in order to make sure that
we’re providing whatever type of resources are available to keep those
hospitals functioning. So, an incredible step forward to make sure that
they can keep moving.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: As far as where we’re at with the deployment of
personnel going out, the Department of Defense — through FEMA, we have
been sending Department of Defense personnel out throughout this
pandemic.  
   
We sent several teams out during the Delta surge, and we started to
evaluate what we thought the impacts would be for the Omicron variant
earlier in December. That’s where the initial announcement was made that
we were going to send the 1,000 additional personnel from the Department
of Defense.  
   
As we get requests from our state partners for what they need — these
are the requests that we have right now, and we’re filling those based
on when they can receive them.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Peter.  
   
Q  Thank you for the question. So, what’s the point of now sending N95
or KN95 masks out to Americans if a lot of those masks are just single,
daily use, like somebody wears it once. Then what?  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Masks save lives — I think is the important
thing here. And we want to make sure that everybody has the tools and
resources that they need in order to protect themselves and their
families.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q  Administrator, thank you so much for taking my question. I just want
to ask you: Is there any plan — you said your agency is willing to do
more, but is there any plan to set up perhaps ma- — more of those mass
testing sites, federally run testing sites, or the vaccination sites to
help stop the spread but also get people tested?  
   
We know that your — the administration is planning to send out those
rapid tests, but the PCR test, of course, is more accurate. So, is there
a plan to do more in some of those hard-hit states across the country?  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Absolutely. So, again, we’re working with our
states to identify what their needs are. You know, there’s many parts of
the country that have built up internal capacity across their states.
But those areas that need that additional testing sites, we are
available to set those up.  
   
We’ve been partnering with the Centers for Disease Control, and we are
setting those up now and will continue to do so, you know, as the states
need them and as they request them.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Brian. That’s going to be — have to be the last one.  
   
Q  Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, Administrator. When you came on in April
— and FEMA’s had mass vaccination sites that it’s rolled out — I think
that one of the questions is: Right now, the President just announced
that they’re going to triple the stockpile of PPE, get masks out to
Americans, and also try to expand the testing capacity and home test
kits.  
   
Did FEMA weigh too much of its resources for vaccinations, or should it
have also been surging that capacity months ago in testing and PPE?  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: FEMA’s role has always been to support our
hospitals, our schools, and our public service agencies. We have been
supporting them through the delivery and reimbursement for PPE, for the
medical staff that we’re sending out. That has not changed, and that
support will continue.  
   
The additional support that’s coming out for the general population is
something that FEMA does not participate in, and those are the issues
that — or the items that you’re hearing are going to be announced and
available to the general public later.  
   
Q  But when it comes to testing sites, FEMA has rolled out public
testing sites. Why not surge public testing sites three months ago in
anticipation that there would be surges of variants?  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Again, we’re working with our states routinely,
and we’re hearing what their needs are, and we’re basing our support to
them on what they need. And so, as they request additional assistance,
that’s when we come together and give them the assistance that they
need.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Thank you, Administrator Criswell. Appreciate you coming.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: You’re always welcome and invited.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Thank you. Thank you, everyone.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay. I know, again, we have a short time here, so I just
have two items for you at the top.  
   
Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 60 days
ago, the Biden-Harris administration has hit the ground running to
deliver results. We’ve made key progress toward implementing the largest
long-term investment in America’s infrastructure and competitiveness in
nearly a century.  
   
The Department of Transportation today announced a historic investment
under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to modernize, repair, and
replace approximately 15,000 bridges nationwide. That’s a lot of
bridges.  
   
This is the single-largest dedicated bridge investment since the
construction of the Interstate Highway System, and provides more than
$27 billion to states and Tribal transportation facilities.  
   
Obviously, there will be more to come, and you’ll hear the President
soon.  
   
Another little bit of news for all of you, and we’ll have more on the
week ahead, I expect, in the coming days. But next Wednesday, the
President will hold a formal press conference at 4:00 p.m. in the
afternoon. So, we look forward to seeing you there and to — the
President looks forward to speaking directly to the American people.  
   
I’m going to try to go to the people who didn’t get questions, and then
come back around if that works.  
   
So, go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you. I wanted to just follow up on the cyberattack against the
Ukraine. I know the NSC said it was too soon to attribute the attack.
But could you say where early indications are pointing?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, let me first say that — and just to — because I know
there’s been a lot of questions, understandably, on this. So, let me try
to address a few of them as well, if that’s okay.  
   
The United States and our allies and partners are concerned about the
cyberattack, and the President has been briefed. We are also in touch
with the Ukrainians and have offered our support as Ukraine investigates
the impact and nature and recovers from the incidents.  
   
We don’t have attribution at this time, and I can’t point to any more
specifics.  
   
I know the Ukrainians also announced and conveyed that they got their
systems up and running pretty quickly and that personal data was not
accessed. We will continue to, of course, work with them and assess any
additional impacts. We’re continuing to consult with allies and
partners, including Ukraine, on this.  
   
You might have also seen NATO’s statement as well, which says that
they’re also exchanging information with Ukraine. So that’s where the
status stands right now. I think it’s important to note the Ukrainians’
statements on this, which convey very, very clearly that they were able
to get their systems up and running.  
   
Q  If it determined that Russia was behind the attack, how would the
U.S. respond to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m just not going to speculate on that or preview what
actions we would take at this time. I would just note that we will take
necessary and proper steps, of course, to defend our allies, support our
partners, and support the Ukrainian people. But we’re still assessing
that at this point in time.  
   
Q  Could you describe in a little more detail what sort of support the
U.S. has been providing Ukraine on the cyber front, like over the last
few months?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m happy to check with our team and see if we can detail
that more to all of you specifically. We have been in touch with them,
working with them on many levels. And certainly the threat of cyber is
something — of cyberattacks is something that has impacted a number of
countries throughout Europe, throughout the world.  
   
We’re providing, of course, best practices, the expertise we have in the
U.S. government, but I can see if we can detail that more
specifically.  
   
Chris, go ahead.  
   
Q  I know there have been some challenges this week, but zooming out,
kind of, even more: What’s your message to Democratic voters out there
who said they voted for lawmakers to protect voting rights, turn the
tide on global warming, lower prescription drug prices, reform police
departments, raise the minimum wage, tackle student debt — and have
gotten none of it?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Our message to them is that we’re still fighting for
absolutely every component of what you just listed and that, right now,
we are dealing with the realities of the fact that we have a very slim
majority in the Senate and in the House. That makes things more
challenging than they have been in the past.  
   
I would also note — and I bet a lot of Americans who have conveyed their
advocacy for a lot of those issues — issues the President cares deeply
about — have also cared deeply about getting the pandemic under control,
have also cared deeply about ensuring schools are open across the
country, that small businesses are functioning, that our economy is up
and running. And those have been the top issues, basically, in every
piece of data we’ve seen across the board.  
   
So, the message from the President to them is: He is committed to
continuing to fight. You heard him say this week that voting rights, the
rights of people to express their views at the polls is something that
is fundamental to him. And he’s going to stay at it.  
   
Q  One last thing. Do you have any news for us on the President holding
a formal news conference?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I just announced one at the top. Chris, we’ve just caught
you.  
   
Q  You have. I —  
   
MS. PSAKI: It’s okay. I now relate to your teachers in high school and
what they may have experienced, but it’s okay.  
   
Q  I’ll look for the Mediaite clip.    
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah. (Laughter.) There you go.  
   
It’s — to be fair, it is a Friday in a very busy news week. So, I will —
everybody should take any pressure off of Chris.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Is the —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yes, go ahead. And we have not met before, so welcome to the
briefing room.  
   
Q  Thank you. Is the President planning any sort of staff shake-up or
changes at the White House given recent setbacks, including inflation at
a 40-year high, the Supreme Court blocking the vaccine mandate, and the
collapse of voting rights legislation?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say the other way to look at the last year is
that 200 million Americans are now vaccinated; more than 80 percent of
Americans have received at least one dose. If you look back to a year
ago, only about 35 percent of people were willing to do that. The
President’s — through the President’s action and leadership, we have
made vaccines available across the country.  
   
Boosters: We have provided more supply to the global community — 400
million doses — than any other country in the world.  
   
We have had record economic growth in this country. We have record low
unemployment rates in this country. And we are getting out of a pandemic
and the economic downturn tied to it at a rate that is faster than
anyone thought would have happened.  
   
We have confirmed more judges that look like America, that are diverse
like this country, than almost any other administration in history.  
   
And again, the truth is: An agenda doesn’t wrap up in one year. We are
going to continue to fight for every component of his legi- — of his
agenda and his — and his plans for his presidency that he outlined when
he was running for President.  
   
Q  One more thing. Can you confirm that a coronavirus emergency spending
request is coming? And what details can you provide on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we are always in touch with Congress and leaders in
Congress about what needs the American people have as we continue to
fight the pandemic. That has been the case continuously throughout the
pandemic, and that remains the case today.  
   
I don’t have anything to preview for you, but I would just echo what
Speaker Pelosi said over the weekend — a couple days ago, where she said
that we weren’t going to let resources get in the way of fighting the
pandemic. That continues to be our view.  
   
But I have nothing to preview at this point in time, but those
conversations are ongoing.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you. I have a couple of questions and one from my colleague at
VOA.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  My first question is the administration’s response as hundreds of
nurses with the National Nurses United held demonstrations demanding for
safer COVID conditions. And they talked about there’s not necessarily a
shortage of nurses, but many are not willing to work in what they feel
like are unsafe conditions and feel like some of the protections are
being weakened.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say, first, that we believe there should be
strict and stringent requirements in medical and — in hospitals and
medical facilities to keep the people who are working there safe and
also to keep the patients safe. And I would just note that, yesterday,
the Supreme Court continued to — is allowing for the CMS requirement to
move forward, which is an important component of keeping people who are
patients safe but also keeping workers in a lot of facilities safe.  
   
A number of hospital systems across the country have implemented vaccine
requirements, which we certainly support, and they’ve been very
successful. We — so we’d continue to encourage others to do the same.  
   
Q  With MLK coming — ML\[K\] Day coming, is there anything that we can
expect to hear from the President — any type of new strategy, any plan?
And what is he going to be doing on that day?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I expect we’ll have more details. I certainly understand the
interest. We’re dealing with mother nature here — with the storm. And
so, we are adjusting and making some plans for how he will commemorate a
very important day in our history. But I expect we’ll have more details
for that, hopefully in the next 24 hours.

Q  From VOA, just a quick question: Confirmation on — that the U.S. has
information that indicates Russia has pre-positioned a group of
operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in Eastern Ukraine, as
reported by CNN.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah, I do have some detail on this. Let me confirm for
you.  
   
So, as you all have heard us say many times, we are concerned that the
Russian government is preparing for an invasion in Ukraine that may
result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should
diplomacy fail to meet their objectives.  
   
As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option
of fabricating a pretext for invasion — and we’ve seen this before; we
saw this before leading up 2014, just to note — including through
sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of
preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine.
And the Russian military plans to begin these activities several weeks
before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and
mid-February.

Again, we saw this playbook before, including the widespread effort to
push out misinformation, not just in Eastern Europe but around the
global community.  
   
We have information that indicates Russia has already pre-positioned a
group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in Eastern
Ukraine. The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using
explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy
forces.  
   
Our information also indicates that Russian influence actors are already
starting to fabricate Ukrainian provocations in state and social media
to justify a Russian intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine.  
   
For example, Russian officials and influence actors are emphasizing
narratives about the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and the
increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders. This is all the spreading of
misinformation.  
   
These media narrativ- — narratives also blame the West for escalating
tension, highlight humanitarian issues in Ukraine that Russian
intervention could solve, and promote Russian patriotism to encourage
domestic support for military action.  
   
And, finally, during December, Russian-language content on social media
covering all three of these narratives increased to an average of nearly
3,500 posts per day, a 200 percent increase from the daily average in
November.  
   
So it’s important to note what people are seeing out there and to call
out this misinformation that is being spread to — as a false-flag
operation. And there’s a number of tactics that they’re using in that
regard.  
   
Let me go to the back. Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said today
that Moscow have “run out of patience” with the West. So, how patient is
President Biden with Russia’s aggressive behavior?  
   
And another one: The AFP News Agency reports that Ukraine proposes
three-way crisis summit with President Biden, Putin, and Zelenskyy. Are
you open to such a format?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I have nothing to preview in terms of the next steps on
negotiations or talks. Everybody is back in their capitals now having
conversations about that.  
   
I will note that the President’s view and our view is that this is up to
President Putin and Russia to determine what the path for it is. We are
ready regardless of what they decide.  
   
If they decide they’re going to invade Ukraine, there are going to be
economic consequences that go far beyond 2014.  
   
If they decide they want to engage in diplomatic conversations and
talks, we are very open to that. And we’re hopeful they will do that.  
   
But, ultimately, it’s a choice they need to make. And so, I would
suggest you ask them that question.  
   
Q  But what about —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go —  
   
Q  What about the — President Biden’s patience with what Russia is doing
right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Again, it’s not about that; it’s about Russia deciding what
path they’re going to take.  
   
Go ahead. Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q  Hi. So, President Biden, yesterday, said that he will be providing —
or the administration will be providing high-quality masks to Americans
for free.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  However, health experts have been saying for quite some time now that
better masks are crucial against Omicron. So why is the White House late
to making them available for free?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We aren’t. We actually have already provided 30 million masks
across the country. We have built a stockpile of 750 million masks in
the government.  
   
And this is about expanding and building upon — providing high-quality
masks out to people across the country.  
   
And I would say of the money that was used for — from the American
Rescue Plan to keep schools open, some of that was used for PPE. A lot
of funding that has been — that has already been approved over the
course of the last year-plus has been used for PPE as well. So, this is
building on those steps.  
   
I just want to get around to everybody. Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q  Just one more. So, Kamala Harris was put in charge of voting rights.
Why wasn’t she with the President at the crucial Senate lunch to sell
the bill?

MS. PSAKI: Well, the Vice President has been selling the bill across the
country — obviously, delivering speeches, providing — engaging and
meeting with activists. She’s also been — she was also working the
phones over the last couple of days and has played a pivotal role, no
question, and will continue to moving forward.  
Go ahead.

Q  Thanks so much, Jen.

MS. PSAKI: Oh, wait, actually, let me just make sure I get to everybody
in, and then I’ll come around.

Go ahead.

Q  Thanks, Jen. Last March, President Biden signed an executive order
encouraging federal agencies to help expand access to the ballot. Can we
get an update on how federal agencies have dealt with that in the past
year or so?

MS. PSAKI: In terms of how they’ve implemented it and steps they’ve
taken?  
   
Q  How they implemented it and what steps —  
   
MS. PSAKI: We can absolutely get you one and get you one from what —
agency to agency, what they’ve been doing. And that was something —  
   
Q  And I was wondering about the situation in Congress. Could we expect
any more executive orders like that or actions from the federal
government that (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I will say we are going to continue to look for ways to
protect and expand the rights of the American people to have access to
voting.  
   
And in addition to that executive order, the Department of Justice, as
you know, doubled their funding and support for the protection of voting
rights. We also have been working with organizations all across the
country who are building diverse coalitions to pass pro-voter laws and
push back against those that make it harder to vote and threaten free
and fair administration of elections.  
   
In addition to doing the critical work to register and educate voters,
these organizations have built grassroots leadership at the state level,
including among state legislators and across Latino, African American,
AAPI, and Native American communities, among young people. And they’re
providing also training, policy research, messaging guidance, and direct
organizing to register voters and deploying voter protection teams.  
   
So, we are working certainly at the federal level, also at the
grassroots level, and we will continue to look for ways to protect
people’s fundamental rights.  
   
George, go ahead.  
   
Q  Yeah, I want to go back to first-year anniversary and ask you if
there’s anything that surprised you in the first year. And I’m thinking
of a couple things that weren’t being talked about a year ago at
inauguration. Everybody was excited about vaccines; now you have
anti-vax groups. Trump was being impeached; now he controls the
opposition party. And there was no talk of inflation at the time of the
inauguration.  
   
MS. PSAKI: A lot has happened in a year. I would say — you know,
actually, if we look back at data around the time or shortly before the
inauguration, only about a third of the American public was willing to
get vaccinated, and now we’re over 80 percent. So, actually, that’s an
area where there has been an enormous amount of progress made.  
   
There has been some surprising components, including the fact that many
people who were opposed to getting vaccinated, we assumed that because
it was a vaccine that was approved — one of them at least by — under a
Republican president, that the FDA had given formal approval in
September and obviously given the dire impacts of the virus, that there
wouldn’t be as much vaccine hesitancy. But that’s one of the reasons
that we took a number of the steps we did over the course of the fall.  
   
You know, I would say that, of course, you know, you look back and there
are — there are initiatives that the President has fought for that have
historically not been partisan. And I don’t know if that’s a surprise,
but voting rights is certainly an example of them. And as I’ve said a
few times from here, there are 16 Republicans sitting in the Senate who
have supported voting rights protections in the past.  
So, I’m not sure if that’s surprising, but that certainly is not a
development in the right direction.  
   
Q  Has he been surprised at the difficulty in bringing Republicans along
to his views?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think a lot of people are surprised 19 Republicans
voted for the infrastructure bill and 5 or 6 voted in the Hou- — in the
Senate, and 5 or 6 voted in the House.  
   
There are — there are, again, initiatives and policies that have
historically had bipartisan support, like voting rights, that have
become unfortunately perceived as a partisan issue.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. Back to Russia. Just hours before that cyberattack on
Ukraine, Ukraine’s ambassador here in Washington told CBS News that her
country believed a cyberattack would precede any major military action
by Putin’s forces. I think you touched on this when you were talking
about the groundwork being laid. But just to be more clear: Does the
administration view cyberattacks as a signal that Russia plans to
invade?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to give an assessment of that from here. I
would just note it’s also important that — to include the context of the
fact that Ukrainian officials have spoken to the impact of this specific
attack.  
   
We know that cyber is a tool that many actors across the world use as a
form of warfare. We have seen that increase — only increase in recent
years. But in terms of what the chain of events would be or will be, I
just don’t have anything more for you on that.  
   
Q  But has the cyberattack and the false-flag ops that you talked about,
has that changed the assessment of how probable a military invasion
would be compared to yesterday, before these two incidents?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think it gives everyone a pretty clear picture of what
we’re seeing in terms of the preparations. Now, whether or not they move
forward, that is up to the Russian leaders to decide. But the fact that
they are laying out — to your point, Weijia — these false-flag
operations, that they are sowing the seeds of misinformation, that does
give you an indication of all of the preparations that are underway.  
   
Q  And then, I have one question Iran.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  Because Secretary Blinken was very frank yesterday in an interview,
and he said there are just “a few weeks left” to reach mutual compliance
with Iran because they are just a few weeks away from having enough
material for a nuclear weapon. So can you talk about what this final
push for an agreement looks like and how realistic it is given there are
only a few weeks left?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I, of course, agree with Secretary Blinken. I mean, I was
going to say he’s absolutely right, which seems like a silly thing to
say. But I would note, Weijia, that it is a critical time, and this is
how the President sees it as well.  
   
Though there has been some progress made in negotiations, if we don’t
reach an understanding soon — a mutual return to compliance — we will
have to consider a different path forward.  
   
And the bottom line is the President is not going to allow Iran to
possess a nuclear weapon. And as Secretary Blinken noted, they have made
progress, and this is no thanks to the decision by the former president
to pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement despite promises that they
would agree on a stronger agreement that Iran would not move forward.
They have done exactly those things. Exactly those things they predicted
would not happen have happened.  
   
That is why we’re in the point we are in, but that means — several weeks
ago, the President asked his team to prepare a range of options. They
have done that, and obviously our preference is always diplomacy.  
   
Q  Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Oh, I got — okay, Peter, go ahead. Last one.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. President Biden promised to bring decades of D.C.
experience to the Oval Office, but Build Back Better has not passed,
voting rights apparently not going to pass, and vaccine requirements
that he likes are apparently illegal. What happened?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, first, Peter, I would say if you look back at last year
and what we were able to accomplish — that includes getting the American
Rescue Plan passed — a package that has contributed to cutting childhood
poverty by 40 percent; has helped ensure we are moving at a faster pace
toward economic growth, toward a record-low unemployment rate; helped
ensure schools — more than 95 percent — are open across the country.  
   
He also pressed, despite skeptics, to get a Bipartisan Infrastructure
Bill passed — one that we have just — we’re just announcing today. The
fact that 15,000 bridges are going to be repaired — that was despite
many skeptics. And because of his efforts, 200 million Americans are now
vaccinated.  
   
The work of an administration continues after one year, and it will — he
will continue to press forward on all of those priorities.  
   
Q  But as he talked about a year ago and working with Republicans, now
he is talking about Republicans that don’t agree with voting rights.
He’s describing them as George Wallace, Bull Connor, and Jefferson
Davis. What happened to the guy who — when he was elected said, “To make
progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy”?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think everybody listening to that speech who is “speaking
on the level,” as my mother would say, would note that he was not
comparing them as humans, he was comparing the choice to those figures
in history and where they’re going to position themselves if they — as
they determine whether they’re going to support the fundamental right to
vote or not.  
   
One last thing. The Bengals are playing tomorrow. I’m just giving it a
shout out so that my husband will be excited at home. They haven’t won a
playoff game in 31 years.  
   
Okay, we got to wrap it up.  
   
Q  Can I get a quick —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yes, go ahead.  
   
Q  Can I get a quick update on — now that the dust has settled, are
there any steps the administration is going to take going forward with
respect to the vaccine mandate? And have you found that it was a
success?  
   
And then one more update on yesterday. Are you guys still making calls
this weekend on voting rights? It seems that Manchin and Sinema, even
after coming to the White House — there’s no hint that they’re going to
change their positions. So, I mean, what are the next few days look like
before that vote?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say that the President’s view, as you heard him
say yesterday, is that we’re going to continue to press to get this done
moving forward. And that means continuing to engage with a range of
officials who are supportive, some who have questions and some who are
skeptical.  
   
He obviously met with Senator Sinema yesterday afternoon, even after she
made a public speech about — about her opposition to the filibuster. I
think that’s evidence of his continued commitment to keep engaging.  
   
As it relates to the vaccine requirements and what’s next: As the
President said yesterday, the Supreme Court has chosen to block
commonsense, lifesaving requirements for employees. We’re, of course,
immensely disappointed by that decision. It’s now up to the states and
individual employers to put in place vaccination requirements.  
   
Here are some pieces of good news — and this is a little updated from
yesterday: Businesses and other employers have already taken these
steps. Nearly 40 percent of Fortune 100 companies have vaccine
requirements.  
   
In October, prior to the OSHA rule even coming out, a quarter of workers
in the country were already subject to a requirement from their
employer. By January, that number had risen to nearly 60 percent of
employ- — of employers requiring or planning to require vaccines.  
   
And since the administration began implementing requirements in July,
we’ve gotten from 90 million to 30 million Americans unvaccinated. More
work to be done — no question.  
   
It was good news that the CMS requirement for healthcare workers was
kept in place; that will impact 10 to 11 million. And there are a number
of companies across the country that are good models. We’re going to
continue to echo those.  
   
Q  Just —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay. I don’t want you to be late. Go ahead.  
   
Q  Just real quick. Just real quick. Did the President move the needle
at all with Senators Manchin and Sinema as it relates to voting rights
and the filibuster yesterday?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I will let them give an assessment of where they stand.  
   
Q  And, you know, I understand you guys think this is a fight worth
having. But are you clear-eyed at least, and are you willing to tell
your supporters to be clear-eyed that these votes next week on voting
rights and on changing filibuster rules are going to fail?  
   
MS. PSAKI: If we believed everything every pundit said out there and
listened to that, the President would not have run for office. He would
not be President. We would not have an infrastructure bill that is law.
We have —  
   
Q  That’s not false hope?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We have heard — we have heard what members have said. It is
important about where they stand on the filibuster.  
   
The President is going to stay at it, as you heard him say yesterday,
because he believes that voting rights is a fundamental right for people
across the country.  
   
Thanks, everyone. Happy Friday.
