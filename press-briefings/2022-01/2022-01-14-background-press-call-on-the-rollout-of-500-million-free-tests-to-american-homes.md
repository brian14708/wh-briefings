title: Background Press Call on the Rollout of 500 Million Free Tests to American
  Homes
---
 
Via Teleconference

1:36 P.M. EST  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Hi, everybody.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon to
talk about the Biden administration’s new plan to begin distributing
at-home COVID-19 rapid tests to the American people for free.   
   
As a reminder, this call will be embargoed until 2:30, as is the
factsheet that should be in your inbox.  And the conversation will be
attributable to “senior administration officials.”  
   
On this call, we have \[senior administration officials\].  We’ll have
some remarks to explain some of the logistics here.   
   
And with that, first, I will kick it to \[senior administration
official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks very much, Kevin.  Testing is a
critical tool to help mitigate the spread of COVID.  And as you know,
there are a number of different kinds of COVID tests in this country. 
These include lab-based PCR tests, rapid PCR tests, and rapid
point-of-care antigen tests, available through healthcare providers and
at over 20,000 free testing sites nationwide.  
   
Public health experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
agree that Americans should consider using at-home rapid tests in the
following situations: First, if they begin to have symptoms consistent
with COVID; second, at least five days after close contact with someone
who has COVID; and third, if someone is gathering indoors with a group
of people who are at risk of severe disease or are unvaccinated.  
   
At-home rapid tests are available at pharmacies and online retailers. 
And as of tomorrow, health insurance will cover the cost of these
at-home tests.  
   
Before I turn to \[senior administration official\] to walk through
those — the details of our plan for online ordering and distribution of
500 million at-home rapid tests for Americans — to Americans for free, I
want to step back and emphasize that this historic plan builds on
significant, aggressive action the Biden administration has taken from
the start to expand testing capacity.  
   
We streamlined the FDA authorization process to increase the number of
tests that are authorized for use in the U.S.  We’ve brought in the NIH
to help companies get through that FDA process.  And we’ve focused on
increasing manufacturing of these tests.  
   
Starting as early as last February, the administration has used the
Defense Production Act, industrial mobilization, as well as $3 billion
in advance purchase commitments to ramp up supply of testing, including
at-home rapid tests.   
   
All of these actions have paid off.  When the President took office,
there were zero at-home rapid tests on the market.  In January, there
will be 375 million at-home rapid tests on the market in the U.S.  That
is this month alone.  And this is in addition to the 1 billion at-home
rapid tests that we are purchasing as part of the President’s
announcement.  
   
All of this is on top of the work the administration has done to
increase capacity and resilience for lab-based COVID-19 testing.  The
U.S. is now conducting more lab-based tests per capita than many peer
countries, including Germany, Canada, and Japan.  
   
So, while we are seeing record testing demand with Omicron, and we’re
seeing it across the globe, we’re making great strides to increase our
testing supply to meet this demand.  
   
With that, let me turn it over to \[senior administration official\] for
more on today’s announcement.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\].  Thanks for being with us today.   
   
So, as \[senior administration official\] said and as everyone knows,
the President is committed to purchasing 1 billion at-home rapid tests
to be given to the American people for free.  
   
Today, we want to walk through new details about our plan for online
ordering and distribution of 500 million at-home rapid tests to the
American people for free.  
   
First, on contracting and supply: The administration is quickly
completing a contracting process for this unprecedented purchase of 500
million at-home rapid tests, with over 420 million tests already under
contract.  
   
All tests contracted through this program will be rapid at-home tests
that have been granted an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA.  
   
Half a billion tests will be available for order on January 19th and
will be mailed directly to American households that order them.  
   
On January 19th, Americans can visit COVIDTests.gov and begin to order
their — submit their orders.  Let me repeat that: It’s COVIDTests.gov.  
   
To ensure broad access, the program will limit the number of tests sent
to each residential address to four tests.  
   
There will be tests for every household that wants to order them.  
   
Tests will typically ship within 7 to 12 days of ordering.  
   
All orders in the continental United States will be shipped through
First Class Package Service, with shipments to Alaska, Hawaii, and the
U.S. Territories, and APO, FPO, and DPO addresses sent through Priority
Mail.  
   
To order these tests, the only two things that people will need are
their name and residential mailing address.  
   
They can also get order status updates by sharing their email address.  
   
Lastly, just as it is has been throughout all of our COVID programs,
equity is a top priority for us here too.  We’re taking a number of
steps to ensure this program reaches our hardest-hit and highest-risk
communities.  
   
This includes working with national and local organizations with deep
experience serving communities of color, people with disabilities, and
other high-risk communities to serve as navigators who will raise
awareness about this program and help people submit their requests for
tests.  
   
We’ll be also launching a free call line so that Americans who have
difficulty accessing the Internet or need additional support can
phone-in orders for their tests.  
   
Before we open for questions, I want to underscore some of what \[senior
administration official\] said, that this new program is just one of the
many ways we’re ensuring access to free testing.   
   
As you know, there are over 20,000 free testing sites nationwide.  And
over the past several weeks, to help communities that need additional
capacity for testing as they battle Omicron, the administration has
rapidly stood up new, federal free testing sites across the country,
with many more coming soon.  
   
And just this week, we announced that starting tomorrow, private health
insurance companies will be required to cover at-home rapid COVID-19
tests for free.  
   
So, let me stop there, Kevin, and we can open up for questions.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks, \[senior administration official\].  So, we have
time for a few questions.   
   
First, let’s go to Tamara Keith at NPR.  
   
Q    Hi.  So, I just had a few questions about the timeline and
availability.  There are some tests that were ordered from warehouse
companies.  I’m wondering: Are those already on hand?  Like, how many
tests are actually on hand ready to send on day one?  And how many more
are going to be coming out over time?  How’s that going to work?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Tamara.  It’s a good
question.  
   
As I mentioned, we’ve now contracted for over 420 million tests.  And I
say we’ve done that on an extremely rapid timeline for such a big
purchase and across different companies.  
   
We have, as you mentioned, some tests already in the possession of the
U.S. government; it’s on the order of tens of millions.  And we’re
working to get those packed up — the U.S. Postal Service is — now.   
   
And we’re confident we can meet the timelines that we outlined today on
both ordering and shipping.  
   
Q    Is that why it’s going to take those 7 to 12 days?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It’s going to take 7 — that’s our best
estimation of what the usual shipment time will be.  I think as the
program ramps up, we expect that timeline will shorten.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Next question, let’s go to Zeke Miller at the
AP.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for doing this.  Just a follow-up on that last bit
there.  \[Senior administration official\], you mentioned that, you
know, when the CDC recommends testing — that’s five days after exposure
or when you started feeling sick.  So, is the plan here that Americans
need to anticipate those factors?  Should every American go online to
this website now and buy — and order these tests in order to have them
on hand for when they meet those criteria for when they should test
according to CDC guidelines?  
   
And then, I was hoping you could also elaborate on why just four tests
per residential address.  I mean, there are families with more than four
people.  We’ve seen people need to test multiple times in order to get —
you know, to pick up the virus.  How did you select four for that?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Zeke, good questions.  \[Senior
administration official\], do you want to take the first one, and I can
take the second one — multiple (inaudible).  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  So, Zeke, yeah, we are — we are
just calling out here the most important uses of OTC tests, but there —
beyond OTC tests, we have — there many ways to get tested in the United
States, and there are many ways beyond this website to procure tests —
through the pharmacy chains, through the community health centers,
through other programs, other state programs.  
   
And so, we have more than 20,000 community-based testing sites
nationwide, over-the-counter tests being provided to community health
centers.  And — so —  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  — I think, basically, you know — I
think that’s answering your question.  I think that I understood it,
which is just to say there’s many modalities for testing.  Those
recommendations are consistent with CDC’s recommendations on testing.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  And I’d say: I think there’s
been a lot of questions about the uses of at-home tests.  So we’re
trying to clarify here what our experts recommend the uses of at-home
tests are, and those are the three.  
   
And then, on your second question, Zeke, you know, this — and I think it
sounded (inaudible) because this is one of many programs that we are
executing to make sure that Americans have ready access to tests.  This
particular program was designed to ensure that Americans have at-home
rapid tests on hand in the weeks and months ahead, as they have a need
to test.   
   
And, you know, we’ve talked about the many other programs we have that
are targeting — and we also have targeted programs, of course, to
support schools, to support long-term care facilities, and other
vulnerable populations, including mailing and sending tests to community
health centers.  We have millions of free tests at community health
centers where folks can go and pick those up.  
   
So, I’d say this is just one part of a broader set of programs.   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Cheryl Stolberg at the New York Times.   
   
Q    Hi, thanks for doing this call.  I have a couple of questions. 
First, when will the website be live?  I imagine that a lot of
Americans, if it’s going live at midnight, will, like, wait up until
midnight to order their tests.  Are you confident that it won’t crash?  
   
And then also, on the reimbursement, the administration has said it’s
providing incentives for insurers to work with pharmacies so that people
can be reimbursed at a point of care — at a point of purchase — you
know, right when they’re buying the test, like you do with drugs.  And
I’m wondering: What kind of incentives and how many insurers — what
percentage of insurers do you think will go that route versus requiring
people to send in forms for reimbursements?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Sheryl.  I think I’ll take the
first two, and then, \[senior administration official\], you take the
last one on reimbursements.   
   
On the website, it will be live on the 19th.  And I don’t have a
particular time to share, but we’ll stick with the 19th.   
   
On the question about our website, I’d say we’re taking our website
launch very seriously.  We didn’t start from scratch.  The Postal
Service is an important partner here.  They already have a website that
does sell goods to the public and has for quite some time.   
   
But, of course, every website launch comes with some risk.  We’re quite
cognizant of that.  But we have the best tech teams across, you know,
our administration, across USPS who have been working hard to make this
a success.  And we think we’re well positioned to do that.   
   
The U.S. Digital Service, which I’m sure you know is an organization
that was founded after Healthcare.gov, has been supporting USPS and
helping, partnering to ensure that we’re ready for a successful launch
at this critical moment.   
   
The USDS team has been following industry best practices, and they
conduct load testing.  They are working to be able to scale to the
demand.  They’ve been monitoring — they have monitoring tools in place. 
We have incidence response playbooks in place.   
   
So we’re ready for this.  And we’re ready — ready for Americans to start
ordering their tests on January 19th.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, and in terms of — yeah, insurance
reimbursement.  As you said, Sheryl, the insurance companies have been
given a strong incentive — very strong financial incentive to create
point-of-sale options for — for people to get their tests in stores and
online.  And they are in the process of doing that.  
   
From our conversations with insurers and pharmacies, it seems like they
are moving — I would say, as a group, moving rapidly to do that.  There
are obviously different permutations.  And they’re working that out.  In
the first couple of days, we’re encouraging people just to make sure you
keep your receipts.  
   
As the systems are getting up online, as with any new program, it’ll be,
you know, probably a minute before they get going.  But we’re optimistic
that that’s the direction that they’re going to move. 

MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Kaitlan Collins at CNN.

Q    Thank you so much.  I’ve got a few questions. 

One, just to follow up: So as of today, you have not secured the entire
half a billion tests?  I just want to make sure that that’s what you
were saying earlier. 

Secondly, why is it going to take 7 to 12 days for the delivery, given
that would put us, at the earliest, on January 26, which is obviously
several weeks now after the Omicron surge has taken hold here in the
United States? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Kaitlan.  For your first
question, we have under contract — formally under contract about — over
420 million tests.  And we’re working to finalize the contracting of the
last 80 million.  This is an unprecedentedly large purchase.  And it’s
been going at a fast speed and — really fast.  And so, we’re confident
we’re going to get the rest under contract. 

And we always knew that this would be a series of contracts over a
number of weeks.  And so this is as we anticipated.  We’re happy and
satisfied with the speed; very excited about the speed in which it has
been contracted.

On the 7 to 12 days, I would tell you that’s what we are projecting for
typical shipment times — or typical shipment times after ordering. 

All orders will go, you know, through — in the continental U.S., through
First-Class Mail.  And the program is intended to really ensure that
people have at-home rapid tests available in the weeks ahead. 

And, you know, as we said, this is just one more program on top of a
number of programs that we have been putting in place to make sure
Americans have access to at-home tests.  That includes on Saturday when
you can pick up a test when you go to a store or purchase one online,
and you can get that test, for the first time, reimbursed from
insurance.

And, you know, what the Postal Service has done is a lot of work to make
sure they’re ready for this and they are prepared.  They routinely ship,
you know, about 26 to 40 million packages a day.  They’ve expanded their
staffing, and they — they expanded staffing in the holiday season to
accommodate that volume.  And they’re leveraging that now. 

But as I said, I think, in response to Zeke’s earlier question, I think
7 to 12 days is what we say typical shipment times would be now from
when you order to when you ship.  But we hope that those and we
anticipate those will shorten as we ramp up this program.

MR. MUNOZ:  All right, we have time for a couple more questions.  Let’s
go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.

Q    Thanks, Kevin.  My question is on cost.   Is — do you have a sense
of the total cost for the U.S. government to purchase these 1 billion
tests?  And is all of that covered from the American Rescue Plan?

And just to follow up on the other questioning: Four tests per
household, be it a one-person or multi-person household, will probably
get used up pretty quickly.  Do you expect to be increasing this order
from over a billion to (inaudible) soon after?  And are you budgeting
for that?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Jeff.  Good question.  So, if I
caught your first one, I think we — for the initial purchase of the 500
million tests, we anticipate that coming in around $4 billion for the
purchase and distribution — the — you know, the ultimate cost will
probably differ slightly from that amount.  And we’ll get the level of
(inaudible) on costing probably in a few weeks. 

In terms of tests, I mean, we — as I said, I think, earlier, this is
just one of many programs.  If folks use up the tests, we hope that they
can access other ways to get tested, including through pharmacies and
online; including our 20,000 free testing sites; including, for those
that are patients of community health centers, free testing and pick-up
at community health centers. 

And so, you know, there’s lots of ways to get tests, and this is just
one more.  And, you know, the President committed to another 500 million
just yesterday for a billion.  And we’re not saying we’re stopping
there.  And we’re going to keep — keep moving forward to expand testing
so that Americans have it both now and moving into the future.

  
MR. MUNOZ:  Cheyenne Haslett, ABC.   
   
Q    Hi, thanks for doing this.  My first question is on: Is that second
500 million going to allow for another four tests to be ordered per
residential households?  And what’s the timeline for that?  Or is it all
— is it four tests for the entire 1 billion?  
   
And then I want to clarify: On January 19th, Americans as a whole will
be able to order up to 500 million tests.  And even though you don’t
have them all on hand yet, you’ll still be able to get them all out
within a max of approximately 12 days?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Cheyenne.  Great questions.  
   
On your first question, for the second 500 million: I think, you know,
we’re committed to buying that.  We will — again, as we did with the
first 500 million — do at a sort of very fast and in the most
expeditious way we can to (inaudible) that.  
   
We will look at demand for this website and make sure we can — we’re
committed to get those tests out in a way that best meets Americans’
needs.  That may be through the website.  That may be through a website
and other means.  And we’re going to make sure this website works well,
and we’re going to figure out the exact delivery mechanism for those
500, but we are committed to get them to Americans that need them and
that want them in the best way that suits Americans.  
   
But — can you repeat your second question?  I’m sorry.  I didn’t write
it down.  
   
Q    Yeah.  I was wondering — so, I mean, to follow up on that, you’re
saying that the four tests per household is for all 1 billion, right?   
   
And then my second question is for the January 19th.  I’m asking if,
even though you don’t have all 500 million tests on hand yet — they’re
just getting to the point of all being contracted — will you still be
able to send them all out within 12 days without having them, you know,
physically in the government’s warehouses or whatever?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, so thank you.  So, look, we have a
lot of loaded systems and experts working on getting these test
(inaudible) and getting them packed up and getting them sent out to
Americans.   
   
And we’re confident that with our contracting team, which is very fast,
with the ones we have on hand and the timelines we’re laying out today,
that we can we can meet all of our timelines and get these to Americans
that want them.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And then your question about four tests
— for the 500 million versus the billion, that is a commitment of four
tests to every household that wants them in the first 500 million.   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, we have time for one more question.  Let’s go to
Weijia at CBS.   
   
Q    Thank you, Kevin.  And thank you so much for having this call.  You
said you currently have tens of millions of tests physically on hand and
that you’re confident you’ll be able to hit the time targets that you
laid out.  But how many tests are the contracted manufacturers able to
produce every week, just so we have an understanding of how many more
you’re going to get on hand?  
   
And then, secondly, have you talked to the manufacturers about tweaking
the tests at all, given how hit or miss the current at-home tests seem
to be in detecting the Omicron variant?  
   
Thanks.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Weijia, for those good
questions.  I’ll let \[senior administration official\] take the second
one.  
   
But on the first one, you know, it depends on the manufacturers.  But
again, we’re confident in our ability to get these tests to Americans
after they’ve ordered them in our 7-to-12-day window.   
   
And again, we hope that window — we anticipate that window will shorten
as we get further along into this program.   
   
\[Senior administration official\], do you want to take the second
one?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  So, yes, we are confident in the
accuracy of all the tests that we — that will be part of this program. 
HHS, specifically ASPR and NIH in HHS, in terms of setting up the
contracting process for these tests — that process has included
analytical studies, confirmed that all tests that will be used and
distributed can detect the Omicron variant, and that performance is
consistent with their FDA emergency use authorization.   
   
So, yes, we do have confidence in all of these tests.   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, thank you, everybody.  I know there’s a ton of
questions.  We’ll be happy to follow up with additional materials.   
   
A reminder: This was on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials.”  The factsheet is embargoed as well until
2:30.  And talk soon.   
   
Thank you.
