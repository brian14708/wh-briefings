James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

4:15 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  
   
Q    Hello.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  We have a very special guest — a return guest, shall
I say — Brian Deese, our NEC Director, who is going to give some brief
comments on the data out this morning, answer a couple of questions, and
then we’ll proceed from there.  
   
So, with that, I’ll turn it over to Brian Deese.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Thanks, Jen.  Good to be with you all today.  I, just at the
top, wanted to make a couple of points about — of context on our current
economic situation, and then happy to take questions that you have.  
   
So, four quick points.  First is the context on our economic recovery. 
We’ve learned, based on data that we received over the last several
days, that, in 2021, our economy experienced the largest single drop in
the unemployment rate on record in the history of the country, down to
3.9 percent; the most jobs created in any year on record at 6.4 million;
the strongest economic growth of any year in nearly four decades, coming
in between 5.6 — 5 and 6 percent over the course of 2021, in all
likelihood; and real household income — that is taking into account
price increases — increased in 2021.   
   
So, just to repeat that context: the largest decline in unemployment,
the most jobs created, and the strongest economic growth in nearly 40
years.  
   
The second point is we got December price data today.  And I would note
that we saw a welcome deceleration in the rate of price increases in a
number of respects.   
   
In the headline — price increase data — we saw a decline month to month
to 0.5 percent, down from 0.8 percent in the month before.  It’s still
too high, but moving in the right direction.  
   
As I think I say every time here — and if I don’t, I — it’s a mistake —
we never index too heavily on any individual one month of data in any
direction.  But I would note that we saw, in prices from November to
December, a decline in the rate of growth of the prices for food at
home, which is a technical way of saying food that people buy in the
grocery store.  And we saw a drop in the price of energy, both at the
gas pump but also natural gas and winter heating costs.  
   
And many of you focused on the annual 7 percent rate.  If we are trying
to look at where we are headed, the month-to-month changes are more
instructive.  And most independent forecasters continue to project that
we will see moderation in price increases over the course of 2022.  
   
Third point is the global context for this data, both on prices and on
economic growth writ large.  What we’re seeing right now is these price
increases are a global phenomenon, and that reflects the nature of the
global challenge of coming through a pandemic crisis and a
pandemic-affected recovery.  
   
Over the past six months, price increases in the United States and
Europe have basically run neck and neck.  In December, the EU saw its
highest recorded inflation in — on record.  Germany saw its highest
inflation, in December, since reunification.  And so, while there are
differences country by country, this is a global phenomenon and driven
by these global issues.  
   
Which comes to the fourth point, which is: Given the unique strength of
the United States economic recovery — overall growth, as well as the
labor market — we are well positioned to attack the challenges of prices
and costs head on.  And that’s exactly what the President and this
administration are doing.  And it’s his principal focus when it comes to
the economy.   
   
As he laid out on Friday, his approach to attacking prices and costs are
grounded in the — in the premise that the right way to do this is to
build on the economic successes that we have seen, not to abandon
them.   
   
And that really means, with respect to what we in the administration and
Congress can do, is to focus on how we can expand the productive
capacity of the economy; how we can make sure that our economy can
produce more goods and services more cheaply and easily across the
country; get more people working; and get to the strong, sustainable
growth that we are beginning to see — and if we can address these
present challenges, we’ll hopefully see going forward.  
   
The President has outlined a very specific three-part plan to do that
around unsticking supply chains, protecting consumers, and promoting
competition and trying to actually reduce directly some of the most
significant costs that Americans’ families face.  And obviously, key
elements of the Build Back Better framework go directly at that issue. 
So, I’m happy to talk about the policy details behind that plan in
general.  
   
But I think, just to summarize: We have a historically strong economic
growth and labor market outcomes.  We have — saw some welcomed
deceleration, but price increases that are still too high; decidedly a
global phenomenon happening everywhere, but we in the United States are
uniquely well positioned that — against that challenge.  And that’s —
that’s the President’s focus.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Jeff.  
   
Q    Brian, thanks for coming today.  The White House and other
economists, last spring and fall, were talking about inflation being
transitory.  And I think at least the expectation when we were talking
about it last spring was that it was going to be well taken care of by
now.  What did you get wrong?  What did economists writ large get
wrong?  And how should Americans — why should Americans be confident
when you say prices are going to get better later this year?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, I think that if we look at the situation earlier in the
year, a number of projections and forecasts have come out differently
than we anticipated.  If you — if you look at employment, for example,
virtually nobody was projecting that we would see unemployment fall as
quickly as it — as it has and get to 3.9 percent by the end of this
year.  That’s four years faster than the median forecast.  
   
And so, I think we’ve seen a number of unanticipated outcomes.   
   
When it comes to prices, what we have — what we have said consistently —
focused consistently is that this is a global phenomenon; it is
connected to the pandemic and the issues that that has raised. 
Certainly the supply chain challenges that have evolved over the course
of time, through the Delta variant and over the course of the fall, have
been issues that we’ve had to go and tackle head on.  
   
But I think that the — nomenclature aside, we find ourselves in a
position now where we’re looking forward, and most forecasters are
projecting that the price increases will moderate.  Our focus here is
looking at what are the concrete, practical steps that we can take to
try to help ensure that outcome and try to help accelerate relief where
we can — where we appropriately can.   
   
So, when it comes to something like the supply chain challenges, those
manifested more significantly than people were anticipating over the
course of the summer and early fall, both because of COVID factors but
also buying behavior of major retailers and major freight movers.  And
so, we went into action over the course of the fall to try to help
address those issues and the bottlenecking we were seeing at ports. 
Made very significant progress on that — a 40 percent decline in the
amount of time that a container is sitting at the dock.  
   
And at the same time, we still have work to do on that front, which is
why, even this month, we’re going to take additional steps with ports
across the country to set up inland locations to move products and
impose new fees on empty containers that are sitting idle at our
ports.  
   
So, we’re going to — we’re going to stay at that and other issues.  And
we believe that that’s the best way that we can, again, help to expand
the economy’s capacity to deliver goods and services to the American
people.  
   
Q    But is it the supply chain then, essentially, that is the reason
for the incorrect forecasts 10 months ago?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Look, I think that we are — our focus now is on assessing
where we are and trying to address the issues in front of us in an
effort to try to accelerate the course — the course of the recovery.  
   
As I said, there’s lots of — this has been a unique year on a lot of
accounts.  And so we find ourselves in a uniquely strong economic
position on a number of counts, and we’ve got price increases that we
need to — we need to tackle, and that’s our focus.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Weijia.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  And thank you, Brian, for being here.  I have a
quick question on some of the practical matters that you’ve talked
about.   
   
Are you taking any steps to help people afford food?  Despite the figure
that you mentioned — that, month to month, the prices have gone down —
my colleagues are reporting about how people are finding shortages on
the shelves, how the stuff that is there is more expensive.  Is there
anything you can do to help families pay for that food?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I would say a number of things.  One is, when the
President came into office, he prioritized early passing the American
Rescue Plan.  The American Rescue Plan has historic investments in
actually addressing food insecurity for people who couldn’t afford food.
 As a result, we saw hunger in the United States decline in 2021.  
   
It also included a — the Child Tax Credit — another resource that went
directly — that are going directly to families to help address the, you
know, typical costs that they face on a monthly basis.  And, as a
result, we saw child poverty fall by 35 to 40 percent in America over
the course of 2021.   
   
And we saw — as I mentioned, we saw some welcome deceleration in the
increase in the cost of food this month.   
   
And we’re going to keep focused on those ways that we can address the
typical pocketbook issues that the American people face.  And this is
one of the issues why the core economic logic behind the President’s —
behind the Build Back Better plan is important in this context, because
for working Americans who are bene- — who are benefitting from a strong
labor market and more job opportunities but also struggling with costs
not only of food but costs of childcare or cost of healthcare, the
components of the Build Back Better plan would directly address those
issues by putting — by providing a tax cut to families directly in their
pocketbook, and then reducing other of their most salient costs.

So, for a lot of the families that you’re talking about, if they, you
know, only had to pay 7 percent of their income in childcare, that would
free up a lot of resources to invest in other monthly needs.  So —  
   
Q    But in short of that passing and separate from what you have
already done — the measures you mentioned — is there anything new you
can do to help the food situation?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I would say, first, what we have done is historic and
has made a big difference.  Number two, our central economic legislative
priority is getting those elements of Build Back Better in place.  And
part of the urgency of that is to address precisely the challenges that
you are identifying.  
   
So — and beyond that, we are looking at ways that we can unstick
elements of the supply chain that may be getting in the way of, for
example, physical product getting to market.   
   
And certainly we have seen — we have seen — over the course of this
fall, we’ve seen concerns about product shortages in particular
categories and otherwise.  What we see overall, if you look at retail
inventories, including grocery store inventories, they’re actually
higher now than they were pre-pandemic — so, in a pretty healthy place. 
But that doesn’t mean that there’s logistical challenges at bottlenecks
that may be localized.   
   
And to the degree that we can work with private sector companies and
help, you know, ease the challenges in their private sector supply
chains, certainly we will — we’ll remain open to doing that.   
   
Q    And I do have one question on the global challenge, since you
mentioned it, the President mentioned it today.  Can you talk about how
much you believe China’s latest round of lockdowns and its zero-case
doctrine is having an impact on inflation since, obviously, it’s
impacting the global manufacturing?   
   
And has the administration had any conversations with China about the
factory workers, about the lockdowns?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, there’s no question that the global nature of the
pandemic affects global supply chains and has affected the flow of goods
across economies.   
   
One of the things that we did earlier this fall was actually set up what
we call an early warning system, working with a number of our American
companies that rely on sourcing input components or products from
Southeast Asian countries to identify where there might be COVID
outbreaks in those countries, and work with the State Department and
USAID and the CDC on the ground in those countries to do what we can to
actually help to stabilize the situation and reduce the potential impact
of a shutdown or a lockdown or otherwise.   
   
With respect to China specifically and the current moment, we’re
monitoring it very closely.  As we assess the issue today, the lockdowns
are most likely to have the effect isolated in China because the
production facilities in those geographies are principally suppliers to
the Chinese market.   
   
But the situation is fluid and ongoing.  It’s something that we’re
monitoring in real-time and working across the interagency, including
the State Department and the CDC, to try to keep a handle on.

MS. PSAKI:  Peter?

Q    Brian, respecting that you said that prices are expected to
moderate in the months ahead, Americans right now, at the start of 2022,
are setting their budgets; they’re trying to figure out how much things
are going to cost them for themselves and for their families.  How much
longer should Americans expect that they’ll be paying these inflated
prices?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So what I can say is that, in the context of a strong
economy, most independent forecasters expect these prices to moderate
over the course of 2022.  And that’s consistent with the
administration’s view.   
   
And you have a President and an administration that’s waking up every
day and thinking about the practical actions we can take to try to help
accelerate that, protecting — unsticking supply chains, protecting
consumers — make sure that consumers aren’t being taken advantage of in
a moment of uncertainty.   
   
Q    So, for clarity, that means by the end of ‘22 it’s moderated, or
we’re kind of back to where we were before this, by those
projections?   
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, if you look at — if you look at the projections by
independent forecasters, then you see moderation over the course of
‘22.  And you get back to — you get back to levels that are closer to
pre-pandemic normal.   
   
But I think that, you know, in the — in the short term, in the immediate
term, I think there — we’ll focus on the practical steps that we can
take; focus — working with Congress, encouraging Congress to take
practical steps that would have real, concrete impact for those families
in their lives right now; and delivering in practical, concrete ways.   
   
And I think that, as we have seen with what we were able to get done in
2021 to deliver that type of relief directly to families, that can make
all the difference.  And that can really help to bridge this gap for
families and also help to get more people to work, that we continue to
face real challenges where parents and other caregivers in this economy
want to get back to work but are held back because of the cost of
actually finding a quality way to take care of a kid or take care of an
elderly parent — that’s compounded by the pandemic.   
   
And us acting now to help address those costs for families would not
only provide some peace of mind to those families.  You know, if every
American family with kids knew they weren’t going to pay more than 7
percent of their income in childcare, that would be a big weight off
their shoulders; it also would be a big benefit to the labor market by
allowing more people to work as productively as they — as they choose
to.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You mentioned the port measures you’re taking, setting
up these off-site areas.  Can you talk a little bit more about that? 
And the dwell fees — they’ve had that on hold for weeks at Port of Long
Beach and the Port of LA.  Are you talking about imposing a dwell fee on
other ports?  In other words, can you give a little more detail on what
you’re talking about?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Sure.  Sure.  We’re going to go a little deep on ports, but
this is exciting for me.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    I know you’re not John Porcari.   
   
MR. DEESE:  No, no, it’s good.  I’m thrilled.

MS. PSAKI:  Save room for this.

MR. DEESE:  So, the first issue of the inland ports — and the idea here
is relatively simple, which is: If you’re having to offload all of the
containers at one location, it creates a bottleneck, it means fewer
things moving through.  If you can push those — push that product out to
facilities inland, then you can increase the throughput.   
   
We’ve taken steps at the Port of Savannah to open multiple ports, and
we’ve seen real progress there — reduction in the backlog coming into
the Port of Savannah quite noticeably.   
   
So we’re going to take action at the Port of Oakland, finalizing inland
port opportunities there — basically running the same play there as
well.  And we’re working through the national port associations to
basically work with any port that sees that as an opportunity to try to
deploy that.  And we have money that we have been able to deploy,
associated with the President’s infrastructure legislation, to try to
help move that as quickly as possible.  
   
On the dwell fees: There’s the issue around the fees on import
containers that they have identified and said they’re willing to
impose.  Just the threat of doing that was actually quite effective at
getting the ocean carriers to move on their own and provide incentives —
carrots and sticks — to move that through.   
   
Now, this month, they’re focused on a fee on export containers —
basically, the empty containers that are sitting idle that need to be
moved off and shipped off in order to create more space.  And they have
announced that they will impose those fees by the end of the month.  But
as you know, part of the announcement of those fees is to give everybody
an opportunity to figure out is there a more efficient way to solve this
than the imposition of those fees.   
   
But that’s where things stand.   
   
Q    Forgive me, both you and Jen, for asking about the Fed. 
(Laughter.)  On December — on December 1st, you said —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We understand.  
   
Q    — you said that the President would make a choice in the coming
days, on the 1st.  And you said that part of the reason to make those
picks was so that people could, quote, “face squarely, head on, the
economic challenges that we face” — the governors can.  
   
So, at the time, we’re talking about imminent picks that would help the
central bank — which the President is now banking on to help fight
inflation — see around corners and address crises.   
   
Six weeks later, we don’t have picks.  So I guess my question is: What’s
the holdup?  What changed?  And do you think that that six-week delay is
having an impact if you’re relying on the Fed to be able to help curb
inflation and they don’t have a full bench?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, on your last question: No, I don’t think it’s having an
impact.  I think that the most immediate issue on that score is that the
President’s two nominees to be the Chair and the Vice Chair of the Fed
are now up in front of the Senate — one had his confirmation hearing
yesterday; the other will have her confirmation hearing tomorrow.  And
the Senate moving expeditiously to confirm both of those nominees is
important.    And we are grateful to the leadership — the committee
leadership of Chairman Brown and others in the Senate for moving
quickly, and that is important.   
   
At the same time, we are working closely with congressional leadership
to finalize those — those additional nominees and are confident that we
can move them on a schedule that will mean that they will be in place at
the appropriate cadence.  So, I don’t have any news for you today about
that personnel announcement, but —  
   
Q    Is inflation, like, the ballgame when you’re making these
considerations, in terms of considering particular candidates one
against the other?  Or is it part of a range of factors?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, I think the President laid out his thinking relatively —
in a sort of relatively detailed way in the context of announcing
Chairman Powell and Governor Brainard for the positions that he’s
nominated them to.   
   
And I think that that basic approach extends to the other Chairs as well
— so, obviously, expertise, independent judgment, and, you know,
proximity to the range of issues that the Fed is facing. 

Obviously, central among them is charting a course of monetary policy
that sustains the strength of recovery and achieves the dual mandate
while making sure that prices are not entrenched, but also facility with
other, you know, front-and-center issues like financial regulation, and
the — the financial threats associated with climate change.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mary and Seung Min.  And then we’ll have to wrap it up.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You mentioned that you expect prices to moderate over
the course of the year.  But how worried are you that consumers and
businesses are starting to expect inflation is here to stay and will act
accordingly, especially as many workers aren’t feeling any increase in
wages due to the increase in prices?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, it’s a concern, and it’s why you heard the President on
Friday reinforce that — that the Fed should and needs to have the
independence to act to make sure that prices don’t become entrenched.  I
would say that if you look at the market, you don’t see — you haven’t
seen a noticeable move in long-term inflation expectations, as of
recently.   
   
And so, it’s — it’s a concern, but it’s also part of why we think that
acting in the way that we’ve laid out and respecting the independence of
the Fed is the right approach.  
   
And I think that for, you know, the typical people who are working and
thinking about their household budgets, for many of them, they’ve never
seen a labor market that offers as many job opportunities as they have
right now.   
   
For people in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, wage
increases are up at historic levels, which creates new opportunities.   
   
And for many people, they are taking this opportunity to start new
businesses and innovate.  We’ve seen the rate of new applications for
small businesses up — increase by 30 percent.  And that’s — you know,
that’s an opportunity for those people and the people that they will
employ, but also a real driver of innovation and a signal of the health
and the kind of economy and economic growth that we can drive if we keep
at this.   
   
And the last thing I would say is that for those typical folks sitting
around the kitchen table, thinking about this coming year, the largest
single costs that families face are healthcare, childcare, the cost of a
home.  And we have concrete, practical, straightforward ways to deliver
relief on those costs and to do so in a way that wouldn’t add to
aggregate demand, wouldn’t create an inflation concern, would be fully
paid for across time.  And in fact, the principal long-term economic
impact would be to expand our economy’s productive capacity by getting
more people into the workforce.   
   
So that’s why, you know, our focus and our work on Build Back Better
continues.  And I guess we will leave it there.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, Seung Min is the last one.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Oh, no, we have one more.  Okay.   
   
Q    On Build Back Better, would the White House support adding a work
requirement, like Senator Manchin has discussed, to the Child Tax Credit
as part of the package?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, I think the President has spoken to the importance of
the Child Tax Credit and his views on that topic.  I would say that if
you look at the Child Tax Credit itself, 97 percent of the recipients of
the Child Tax Credit are working.  And among the remaining 3 percent,
the majority are grandparents or people with disabilities.  So, I think
that you have a tool that is delivering relief to working families right
now.   
   
And, in fact, what we’ve seen over the course of 2021, is that as that —
as that tax cut was delivered to families, we actually saw labor force
participation and the employment-to-population ratio increase, meaning
that we saw more people get into the workforce.  And that’s consistent
with evidence historically and in other countries where they have
similar child allowances, where you see no evidence of a negative impact
on labor force participation and, in some cases, a positive impact
because it frees people up to work more.   
   
So, certainly, the President is focused on how to get more people
working and make sure that people have opportunities in this labor
market.  And the Child Tax Credit is actu- — a very well-designed tool
to do that.  
   
Q    So it sounds like, at a minimum, the White House doesn’t think it’s
necessary or it’s redundant or — as part of as part of — as part of the
package.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, certainly the — the Child Tax Credit is a — operates
in a way that goes to working families and does not create any
disincentive for people to work and, if anything, would help more
families and more people get into the labor market.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Thank you, Brian Deese.  
   
Q    Can I ask one about the global phenomenon — on inflation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right, last one, Raquel, on his way out.   
   
Q    Thank you so much, Brian.  What do you make of statements that the
pandemic will not be the number-one public enemy for the global economy
this year, but it will be inflation and how central banks around the
world will — could be the number-one enemy of the global economy — how
central banks respond to inflation and inflation?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, what I’d say to that is they’re very — they’re
interlinked.  And that that is — that’s — has been true and has been a
feature of our economy and our economic recovery for the last — for the
last year and a half, to the first question: that the more effective we
are as a global community — as the United States and as a global
community — at working to contain this pandemic, get it under control,
reduce the impact on people and on — and individual health but also on
economic operations and supply chains and otherwise, the more quickly we
can normalize supply chains and address the price increases, which are
decidedly a global phenomenon.   
   
So, I don’t think that — I don’t think it’s an either/or.  I think that
there is an urgent and compelling priority to address the COVID pandemic
globally, which is why you see this administration and the President
acting across the board for vaccines to the other — support that we’re
providing globally.  And that the more effective we are at doing that,
the more runway we’ll provide for the global economy to grow while
mitigating price increases.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Thank you, Brian Deese.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Thank you, all.  
   
Q    Thanks, Brian. 

MS. PSAKI:   Okay.  I have nothing at the top.  I’m mindful of the
time.  And I will jump around to people who have not yet gotten
questions.  But I will start with Alex, if you want to kick us off.

Q    I have three questions.  First, on inflation: You know, Brian
talked a lot about needing to address some errors in the supply chain,
but you all have taken quite a few of those steps, and we’re still
seeing high inflation and shortages on shelves.  So, is this an issue
that shows the sort of limitations of the presidency and the executive
branch?  Is this an issue that the President simply can’t solve?

MS. PSAKI:  I think what it shows — and you heard Brian talk about this
a bit — is that it’s a multi-pronged challenge.  And he talked about,
obviously, the steps we’re taking to address supply chain challenges. 
And there’s no question those have been impacted by the pandemic, have
also been impacted by a huge increase of demand and retail purchases
online that we saw across the course of the fall.  So, that is one
challenge that we’ve been attacking head on.  
   
We also know that there are specific industries, like the auto industry,
that accounts for about one third of what we’re seeing in terms of
inflationary increases and price increases.  And if you look at the
purchases of cars, one of the biggest issues there is chips and the lack
of manufacturing capacity here in the United States.  
   
Of course that’s been impacted by a range of issues, including the
pandemic.  But one of the things that we have been advocating for and
pushing for is for Congress to move forward in the — in taking steps to
support and boost — bolster our competitiveness here.  That includes
over $50 billion in funding for chips manufacturing.  
   
I would also say that, you know, that would also help ensure that
manufacturing in the future is — the capacity is increased here at home,
so we’re less dependent on the global supply chain around the world.

So, I think what it speaks to, Alex — a good question — is the
multi-pronged components that impact the supply chain, that impact price
increases that people have seen — the American public has seen across
the country.

Q    And then, do you have an update on how the Iran talks are going
over the JCPOA?

MS. PSAKI:  Sure.

Q    Is the administration satisfied with how they’re going?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, I know there’s been a lot going on.  This has certainly
been happening. 

Right now, what’s happening is: On Monday, January 3rd, the eighth round
of negotiations commenced in Vienna, and those are ongoing.  And what
we’re looking at and how — what we’d like to remind the public of is why
we are at this point now. 

Most importantly, none of the things we’re looking at now — Iran’s
increased capability and capacity, their aggressive actions that they
have taken through proxy wars around the world — would be happening if
the former president had not recklessly pulled out of the nuclear deal
with no thought as to what might come next.

And if you look at that step and the impact of that — the fact that the
former president ripped up the nuclear deal meant that Iran’s nuclear
program was no longer in a box, it no longer had the most robust
inspection regime ever negotiated, no longer had the tight restrictions
on nuclear activity. 

And so now where we’re at — even as these negotiations are ongoing, and
as we conveyed back in December that we were a bit frustrated by the
lack of seriousness that negotiators came to the table — they’ve come
back, and now we’re back at the table, again, as I noted. 

But because of the last administration pulling out of the nuclear
agreement, now Iran’s program has been rapidly accelerating.  Iran
directly attacked our partners in the Gulf, and its proxies began
attacking U.S. troops again in Iraq, and the United States has become
totally — had become totally isolated internationally.

So, what we’re — we’ve been working to do is rebuild those relationships
— our partnerships with countries around the world, get back to the
table so we can have that increased capacity and ability to see what is
happening with the program. 

But right now, the negotiations are ongoing.  And we’re, of course,
eager to see the diplomatic path move forward.  
   
Q    And then, one more on voting rights.  You know, you guys have
talked about yesterday’s speech, and the President’s actions this week
is him showing that he’s putting his whole presidency behind this
issue.  But if it doesn’t pass next week, what does that say about his
presidency and his political clout? 

And what would you say to Democratic base voters who have seen, you
know, potentially not just one legislative failure with Build Back
Better, which has been shelved, but potentially a second legislative
failure in a month?  How do you convince Democratic voters to vote for
you?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what I think we would say to any American, whether
they’re Democratic base voters or not, is that the majority of the
American public elected the President to do hard things and to fight for
hard things, including fighting for issues that may feel like an uphill
battle but that are vitally important to protecting fundamental rights
of the American public.

Every single major legislative effort that the President has undertaken,
that he’s been a part of, has been subject to all manner of speculation
and criticism about whether it would happen or not.  And if the
President paid attention to that, he probably wouldn’t have run for
president to begin with.

So his view and, I think, the view of many in the Senate and many
Americans, including the activists you referenced, is that it is time to
fight, that protecting people’s fundamental rights — this is a defining
moment that will divide everything before and everything after, when the
most fundamental American right that all others flow from — the right to
vote and have your vote counted — is at risk.

And he is going to be working the phones, the Vice President will be
working the phones.  As you know, he’s heading up to the Hill tomorrow
to speak to the caucus and make the strong case that you heard him make
publicly, directly to members tomorrow.  And, you know, I think that’s
evidence that he’s going to fight even when it’s hard.

Go ahead, Mike.

Q    If I could ask just two questions on COVID testing.  So, about
three weeks ago, you and I had an exchange in this room in which I —

MS. PSAKI:   Oh.

Q    — in which I — (laughter).

MS. PSAKI:   That made it sound nefarious.  I don’t remember it that
way.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Well, no, I don’t mean it nefarious.  But I posited a bunch of
questions that you couldn’t answer about when the tests would be
available; how many Americans would be able to order per family; you
know, when they would be rolling off — you know, actually rolling off
the factory floors but then delivered to people and in their hands. 

MS. PSAKI:  Sure. 

Q    It’s now three — three and a half weeks later.  Is there any — are
there any answers to any of those questions yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, we’ve put out a number of steps
that have been taken since that point in time — the pleasant and
democratic exchange we had in this briefing room a few weeks ago, Mike —
but including a number of contracts have been signed.  There was an RFP
— a request for proposal — that was put out. 

It was important for us to take the time to assess and work closely with
manufacturers and distributors to understand what they can ship and by
when. 

Of course, it’s vitally important, once this website goes up and people
are ordering it, that they actually get what they order, right?  So
that’s what we’ve been working on.

So a number of those contracts have been signed.  We expect that the
first delivery of these contracts will be arriving by early next week,
which is a good sign.  We expect to also have details — or everyone can
expect we’ll have details that we put out on the website, as well as a
hotline later this week, and more specifics about exactly the questions
that you’ve been asking.  So the American public can expect that later
this week.  And we also expect to have all contracts awarded for the 500
million over the course of the next two weeks.   
   
So that’s the status of where things stand. 

I would also note that, in that period of time, we’ve also been
distributing 50 million tests to community health centers and rural
health centers.  We’ve also expanded our federal testing capacity,
including right here in Washington, D.C., in New York, Philadelphia, New
Jersey, other places that have been impacted.  We made an announcement
about providing additional funding and testing capacity to schools
today.   
   
And tomorrow, the President will be providing an update on COVID, on our
ongoing effort to fight the virus, and providing an update on more we’re
going to continue to do.

So, that’s what we can expect.  But I would say we’ve made a great deal
of progress in the last few weeks.  
   
Q    Okay, but just to follow up on that —

MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.

Q    — is it fair to say that, you know, with half of January finished
and the first of the — of the doses — the first of the doses beginning
to arrive maybe by next week, that there’s no way that 500 million tests
— sorry, not doses — tests are going to be delivered in the hands of
Americans by the end of this month?

MS. PSAKI:   Well, that’s why we said at the time that we would begin to
get these tests and they would begin to go out to the American public in
January.  And that’s — we’re exactly on track for that.

Q    Okay.  And then the second question goes back to the summer.  
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    One of the things you guys have said repeatedly is that the reason
that we don’t — that we’re having — that you’re having to take the kind
of steps that you just talked about is because there wasn’t the capacity
in the system to produce the tests so that they would be more available
now.  
   
Back in the summer, when demand for tests dropped off because Americans
were more interested in getting vaccinated and the CDC was saying, “Hey,
if you’re vaccinated, you don’t need to test,” and so on,
understandably, demand dropped off.   
   
Why didn’t the administration do what the federal government does in
many emergency — anthrax vaccines and others — which is to create a
government market for tests and say to test makers in May and June of
the — of last year, “We will guarantee that we’ll buy a billion test
kits.  Keep manufacturing them; don’t stop”?   
   
Why didn’t the administration do that in the summer so that we would
have been in a position to — this fall, when Omicron hit — to have the
number of tests and you wouldn’t have had to go through this process?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say there were steps that — and decisions that
were made in the summer, including steps that we took in the early fall,
which were to use the Defense Production Act to — 3 billion dollars’
worth — to invest in the testing market.   
   
We expanded, as — or in part, as a result — the testing capacity by four
times.  We’ve quadrupled the size of it.  And we also took a number of
steps through that period of time to expand the number of tests that
were on the market.  
   
Obviously, the FDA works on their own process.  But now there are nine
tests.  There were far fewer — about half of that number — back in the
summer.  So, there were a number of steps that were taken over the
course of time — not just in December, not post-Omicron — to expand and
build the testing capacity.  
   
Okay, Karen.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You mentioned that tomorrow the President is going to
give an update on the COVID effort.  Can you give us any more details on
that?  Is there going to be a major announcement?  What will he be
talking about tomorrow?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you know, Karen, at every step in this process and
frequently, the President provides updates on how we’re building on our
capacity — right? — whether that is vaccine distribution or capacity at
one point; testing capacity; or supplies, PPE.  So, he will be building
on that tomorrow.   
   
I don’t have anything specific to prev- — preview for you in terms of
the components at this point.  But let me just give you a sense of, kind
of, what we’ve been doing to address what we’ve seen — straining
hospital capacity and needs, as we’ve seen the surge in Omicron in
recent weeks.  To date — and he’ll talk more about this tomorrow and
build on it, is my point here.  
   
So, we have helped more than 38 states and territories and deployed over
2,100 federal personnel and thousands of ventilators, ambulances, and
other critical supplies.   
   
In addition, more than 13,000 National Guard members have been activated
in 48 states to support vaccination, testing, and clinical care.  These
deployments are fully paid for, of course, by the federal government.   
   
Hundreds of military doctors and nurses are already on the ground in New
York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Arizona, New Mexico, with more to
follow.  And we’re building on that.   
   
And this is all in addition to the hundreds of FEMA and HHS clinical
staff.  
   
We’ve also shipped nearly 5.5 million pieces of PPE — from hospital
gowns, to N95s, to gloves — in the last two weeks alone.   
   
And we’ve also invited our FEMA Administrator to come and give you guys
an update.  Hopefully, we’ll be able to do that by the end of the
week.   
   
But the point is: We’ve been deploying a number of federal resources,
and the President will talk more about specifics and more steps to build
on that tomorrow.  
   
Q    And one quick one on testing.  Last year, the administration had
announced there would be $10 billion going to schools for testing. 
Today — well, the President, last week, specifically brought up that $10
billion when he made a pretty forceful statement about keeping schools
open.   
   
Today, the administration announced 10 million tests per month will be
going to schools.  What’s the accounting for the $10 billion?  Did
schools use that?  Is that money gone and that’s why there’s now a need
for these additional tests to be sent out directly?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the funding and money went to states to distribute to
local school districts.  That’s how it essentially functioned.  
   
I think what the announcement today — and I’m happy to check on the
specifics of the status of it for you — what the announcement today
reflects is our desire and our commitment to keep schools open and do
everything we need to do to help keep schools open from the federal
government.  
   
Now, a number of schools in — and nearly every state across the country
has made arrangements with testing providers to provide schools with
tests using that $10 billion in funds that you referenced.  But it’s
been used in different ways from school district to school district.   
   
And so, this is just a reflection, which has been consistent with how
we’ve approached our — our efforts to — against the pandemic — to build
on what we know works and a reflection of our commitment to help school
districts stay open.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  Two questions for you.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    First of all, I wanted to follow up on the President’s visit to
Georgia yesterday.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    That’s one of our markets where voter restriction bills have passed
and been signed into law in the past year.  The Brennan Center for
Justice says nearly a hundred more bills are pending this year in
statehouses across the country.  Does the President feel powerless right
now to stop more voter restriction bills from passing at the state and
local level?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we have to take — the President believes we
have to take a multi-faceted approach.  And, no, he certainly does not
feel powerless.  But he thinks that one of the most effective roles he
can play now is by advocating for Congress to pass two pieces of voting
rights legislation that will help protect — put in place a baseline of
protections for states across the country.  So, there is that — not that
inconsistency.  
   
And of course, as you know — Georgia is one of the states — 19 states
across the country have already passed laws that are putting in place
additional restrictions to make it harder to vote.  More to come. 
That’s why it’s so important to move forward with legislation on the
federal level.  
   
Q    My other question is on climate.  Last month, we went to New
Orleans.  They had a very large climate conference there — thousands of
researchers and scientists.  And when we were there, we met a
homeowner.  He lost his house to Hurricane Ida.  His grandmother lost
her house to Hurricane Katrina.  He blames climate change.  He wants
action now.  
   
Today, the White House announced a host of clean energy measures.  But
as the Washington Post reported on Sunday, nearly three dozen rules that
would impact the environment at the Energy Department are delayed; the
President’s climate plan is stuck in the Senate at the moment.  So, does
the President have a sense of urgency about climate?  And if so, how is
it not just important to the President but urgent?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that the President is eager to get climate
legislation passed.  And there’s an enormous, historic, largest-ever
investment in addressing the climate crisis in his Build Back Better
agenda and plan.  Of course, he wants to get that across the finish
line.   
   
But he is not waiting for Congress to act.  That is why he has taken
steps to tackle super-pollutants, phasing down HFCs, rallied the world
on methane in Glasgow, stood with auto workers and America’s big car
manufacturers to roll out plans to boost electric vehicles, put America
on track to ensure that one of every two cars sold will be zero
emissions within the decade.   
   
He’s going to take — continue to take steps.  He’s taken a number of
steps that are — that he has the ability to take to address the climate
— to address the climate crisis.  And, of course, he wants to get his
legislation across the finish line.   
   
I think the point you raised is a really interesting one.  I mean, there
is a startling statistic that something like one in three Americans is
impacted by extreme weather across the country.  You reference a
specific storm.  There are storms that have taken place in the Northeast
and the Northwest.  It’s devastating people’s homes, people’s
communities.  And it’s certainly — and it’s also devastating local
economies.  And it’s a reminder of why it’s so important to act on this
— on climate.    
   
Q    So the President believes it’s urgent?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.   
   
Go ahead, in the back.   
   
Q    Thanks.  On Build Back Better, there was a lot of discussion about
whether it would help or hurt the situation on inflation.  I just
noticed in the inflation statement from the White House this morning
there was no reference to Build Back Better.  There was a reference to
the American Rescue Plan.  I’m just wondering if that reflects anything
about the view of the White House on the prospects for Build Back Better
or the role it can play in the situation on inflation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, I would say that the — your colleagues here who are —
frequent this briefing room have heard us say more times than they can
probably count–  the role of — of a number of economists in advocating
for Build Back Better passing because of the impact it would have on
lowering costs and addressing inflation.   
   
And, ultimately, how the American people experience inflation — as we
were talking about when Brian Deese was here — is costs rising, whether
it’s the cost of meat or — which, of course, we say has a range of — a
range of reasons for it — or the cost of goods they’re purchasing.   
   
And for us, our objective and focus is on lowering costs.  And the
biggest costs — some of the biggest costs impacting the public are
childcare, healthcare, eldercare — issues that are addressed in Build
Back Better.  
   
Q    And one on COVID.  In the briefing this morning, Jeff said you’re
in the process of, quote, “strongly considering options to make more
high-quality masks available to all Americans.”  But I don’t think they
really got into specifics on that.  Can you share any of the options
that you guys are looking at on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have more details.  I would just echo — what Jeff
said is that we are strongly considering that and certainly want to
ensure that everybody has the necessary protections as we continue to
fight the virus.  
   
Go ahead, in the back — let’s see.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Jonathan.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Three years ago, a New Jersey college student was
murdered after getting into a fake Uber.  Legislation to require
ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft to have electronic systems to
match riders with passengers is awaiting White House signoff this year. 
Where do you stand on the legislation?  And would the President be
willing to meet with the parents of the murdered woman, as they’ve
requested?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think you’re referring to Sami’s Law.  And I
remember that story well.  I don’t know anybody who saw it or read it
who wasn’t deeply impacted by it.   
   
We are committed to ensuring that the safety — the safety of all
passengers, including those in rideshare, and we’ll work closely with
Congress to ensure federal oversight of rideshare companies to protect
other parents from the tragedy of Sam — Sami’s parents have gone
through, and her friends and her entire community.   
   
We have met — members of the administration have met with her family and
continue to be in touch on this important issue.  We thank them for
their continued advocacy.  
   
In terms of a meeting with the President, I just don’t have anything to
preview at this point in time.   
   
Q    And one other — one other question.  The Transportation Department
is accelerating a pilot program to allow truck drivers under age 21 to
drive across state lines, which safety advocates say could hurt truck
safety at a time where deaths and truck crashes are up more than a third
over the last decade.   
   
Why is the administration prioritizing that issue over other safety
measures such as emergency braking, speed control devices, which the
National Transportations — National Transportation Board has among its
most wanted safety improvements?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re certainly very mindful of safety.  The reason
this was included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act is because we
need to address the shortage of drivers which is impacting, of course,
the transferring of goods and then the cost of goods on the shelves. 
Right?   
   
So — but we are approaching this and ensuring it’s implemented in a way
that sets a high bar for safety and quality.  Registered apprenticeships
offers critical structural — critical structure on this front, which
includes ensuring that training programs are held to defined standards
and include significant supervised and paid on-the-job training,
including with skilled driving mentors.   
   
And all pilot participants in this program have to be trained on trucks
equipped with cameras, automated — automatic emergency brakes, and speed
limiters.  And we want to make sure it’s as safe as possible while also
addressing the need to have more drivers so that we can move more goods
and lower the cost for Americans across the country.   
   
Did I get to everyone so far?  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    Me?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, no, go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks for the question.  Yesterday, during his speech in Georgia,
President Biden only very briefly mentioned the provisions of the Let
America Vote Act that deal with gerrymandering and getting money out of
politics.  Those provisions actually poll better in public polling
frequently than, sort of, the broader stuff about protecting the right
to vote.   
   
Throughout this process, Biden has been very focused — the President —
on those right to vote provisions.  Why hasn’t he talked more about
those gerrymandering provisions, about provisions about getting money
out of politics, which do seem to be quite popular with the public?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say, first: What the President’s objective was,
going into the speech yesterday, was to make very clear to the American
public what was at stake and exactly what it means when we say, “Your
vote is being suppressed across the country.”  
   
Because sometimes we — or this is what’s on his mind, I should say — we
shorthand and we talk about legislation, or the status, or the meeting
with this person or that person, and the American people — their eyes
glaze over because they don’t — that doesn’t mean anything to them.   
   
So, the objective in the speech yesterday, for him, was to really spend
the majority of time talking about what the impact was, why this was
such a dire issue, and what was at stake, and why it was important to
potentially make changes to Senate rules in order to get this
legislation passed.   
   
So, I wouldn’t overread into how many words he spent on different pieces
of legislation.  He cares deeply about both of these pieces of
legislation.  He wants to sign them into law.   
   
Q    And then —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — sort of, relatedly: Senator Romney today basically said — I’ll
use the exact quote — that the speech yesterday that the President gave
was, quote, “going down the same tragic road taken by President Trump
\[in\] casting \[the\] doubt on the reliability of American elections.” 
Does the White House have a response to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  With all due respect to Senator Romney, I think anyone would
note there’s a night-and-day difference between fomenting an
insurrection based on lies totally debunked by 80 judges, including
Trump-appointed ones, and election authorities across the country and
making objective, true statements, which is what the President made
yesterday, about the effects of a coordinated nationwide effort to
undermine the constitutional right to vote.   
   
I know there has been a lot of claim of the offensive nature of the
speech yesterday — which is hilarious on many levels, given how many
people sat silently over the last four years for the former president —
but I would note that, in our view and the President’s view, what is far
more offensive is the effort to suppress people’s basic right to
exercise who they want to support and who they want to elect.  That’s
not a partisan thing.   
   
And that — that was why he gave such a strong speech yesterday.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    To follow up on the issue of masks and this push to expand access
to high-quality masks — health experts have long been urging and calling
for Americans to upgrade their masks.  So why wait until now to push for
this wider availability of better masks?  Like, what’s taken so long?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, just to be clear: There is no shortage of masks on the
market.  That — that is not an issue.  I know that my colleagues from
the COVID team made clear that we have a strong stockpile — over 750
million masks — that we have at our disposal, widely available — N95
masks, other masks.   
   
What the CDC director conveyed is that they’re going — they’re in the
process of updating the information on their website to help address and
answer these questions.  Their guidance currently is a well-fitted
mask.   
   
But what we’re trying to do is continue to be responsive to what
people’s needs are across the country and make sure they’re getting the
supplies where we need them.   
   
But there’s no shortage.  There is a wide — 750 million masks that we
have available.   
   
Q    And can I quickly get your response to Mitch McConnell today, who
had some strong words for the President?  He called his speech a “rant,”
“incoherent,” “profoundly unpresidential.”  But he also accused the
President of “shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are
racist unless he gets whatever he wants.”   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know the President was asked about this and said — a
version of this, I should say — and he said he considers Mitch McConnell
a friend.  And that is true.  That is why it is even more disappointing
that someone who has supported and advocated for voting rights in the
past — wrote about in his book, has talked about it publicly — and
repeatedly voted for the extension of voting rights protections is on
the other side of this argument now.  
   
You know, and I — I think it clearly struck a nerve — the President’s
speech yesterday and the Vice President’s remarks.  I think there’s
evidence of that.  But to us and to the President, what is more
irresponsible, unbecoming, and divisive is the coordinated effort by far
too many Republicans across the country to perpetuate the Big Lie and
make it more difficult to vote.   
   
And we have seen evidence of that in 19 states who passed — which passed
34 laws attacking voting rights.  That’s why he’s standing up and made
the passionate case he made yesterday.   
   
Okay.   
   
Q    I think we’ve got to wrap.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Thanks.   
   
Q    Can I just ask quickly, on Facebook —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    I’m sorry.  There was a ruling yesterday —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Happy to talk about Facebook anytime.  
   
Q    — against Meta, I guess.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Meta.  (Laughs.)  Sorry.  
   
Q    A district judge yesterday denied the company’s motion to dismiss
the FTC’s revised antitrust complaint, essentially clearing the way for
it to go forward.  I’m ask- — wondering whether you have a view on
that.   
   
And in particular, that case is seeking to essentially break up the
company — to split off Instagram and WhatsApp.  Is that something the
White House thinks should happen?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we welcome the district court’s decision, which allows
the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Facebook to
move forward.  The favorable decision is a testament to the skill and
determination of the Federal Trade Commission, its staff, and its
experts.   
   
For generations, the Americans’ approach has been to expose — American
approach has been to expose our main tech firms to more competition. 
The President supports that.  He’s talked about that publicly a number
of times.   
   
That approach has been key to our innovation and success.  And we’ve
been clear and he’s been clear: We need more competition in the tech
industry.   
   
As you know, there are a range of pieces of legislation — bipartisan,
many of them — in Congress.  That’s encouraging.   
   
And in July, of course, the President signed an executive order on
competition, which, among several actions, called on the federal
agencies like the Department of Justice and the FTC to use existing
tools to tackle these problems.   
   
So, we’re not going to prejudge what it looks like, of course.  There’s
