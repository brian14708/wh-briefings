James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:36 P.M. EST

MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Okay, I have a couple of
items for all of you at the top.  
   
As we mentioned, later today — in our guidance last night, I should say
— later today, the President will sign an executive order to make sexual
harassment an offense in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   
   
This historic addition to the UCMJ honors — honors the memory of Army
Specialist Vanessa Guillén, whose experience with severe sexual
harassment was followed by a brutal murder, catalyzing national
attention to the scourge of sexual violence in our military and helping
advance bipartisan military justice reform in the 2022 NDAA.  
   
This executive order also delivers on a key recommendation from the
Independent Review Commission to strengthen the military justice
response in prosecuting cases of domestic violence and fully implements
changes to the UCMJ to criminalize the wrongful broadcast or
distribution of intimate visual images.  
   
The Biden-Harris administration thanks Congress for its bipartisan
commitment to pass monumental reforms to our military justice system and
codify key recommendations from the IRC — the Independent Review
Commission.  
   
We also look forward to continuing to work with Congress to support the
safety and dignity of our service members.  
   
I also wanted to note that today we hit a major milestone in our global
effort to be the arsenal of vaccines: 400 million doses shipped to 112
countries for free, with no strings attached.  To put America’s
leadership into perspective, we have shipped four times more free doses
to the world than any other country.  
   
And this is on top of our efforts to expand manufacturing at home and
abroad, our close partnerships with manufacturers to provide their
vaccines to hard-hit areas, and our work to turn vaccines into
vaccinations around the globe.  
   
The last item for you: Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
launched a new initiative to save American families billions of dollars
a year in unexpected and hidden fees charged by banks and financial
companies.   
   
Right now, as I’m sure many of you know, banks and credit card companies
lock you in with low rates, only to charge you high fees after the
fact.  If you’ve ever used a credit card, which I’m sure everybody in
this room has, you are familiar with this; you’re familiar with all
those extra fees — balance transfer fees, late fees, and more.  They add
up.  Collectively, the CFPB estimates that these junk fees drain tens of
billions of dollars per year from American families.  
   
Consumers are already starting to feel the benefits of the CFPB’s work
in this space.  After the CFPB published a report on bank overdraft fees
in December, many large banks — Bank of America, Capital One, and Wells
Fargo — announced they would reduce or eliminate some of these fees. 
That’s an important start, but not enough, which is why the CFPB is
interested in hearing about everyday Americans’ experiences with
unexpected fees.  
   
This latest initiative by the CFPB was previewed at this week’s
Competition Council meeting and is just one of the ways we are — one of
the steps we are taking to go after excessive fees that companies use to
hide the true cost of products.  From airline tickets to high-speed
Internet services, agencies are planning — Internet service fees, I
should say — agencies are planning actions over the coming months that
will make prices clearer up front so that consumers can save money by
choosing the best deals for them.  
   
Let me say one other thing.  I know there is a lot of news out there
today, so let me reiterate something that you heard the President say,
and I also said over Twitter: “It’s always been the decision of any
Supreme Court Justice if and when they decide to retire, how they want
to announce it, and that remains the case today.”  So, we’re not going
to have additional details.  You are always welcome to ask any questions
you’d like at any time.  And there’s a lot of news out there, but I just
wanted to say that at the top.  
   
Josh, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two subjects.  So let’s say hypothetically —
(laughter) — a Supreme Court justice was to retire and announce it on
his or her own terms.  Does President Biden plan to honor his pledge to
nominate a Black woman to the Court?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’ve commented on this previously.  The President has
stated and reiterated his commitment to nominating a Black woman to the
Supreme Court and certainly stands by that.  
   
For today, again, I’m just not going to be able to say anything about
any specifics until, of course, Justice Breyer makes any announcement,
should he decide to make an announcement.  
   
Q    Okay.  Secondly, on Ukraine: Is the White House publicizing the
troop buildups in the Russian disinfo efforts in hopes of deterring
Moscow?  And does the White House think that strategy is working?  And
are you prepared to release more details about what you say Russia’s
been doing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, on the last one, as we — as we have.  And I think you
have all experienced that in here, also at the State Department and
Defense Department briefings, and certainly from briefings delivered by
national security officials — senior national security officials as
well.   
   
I will say, Josh, that we are much more cognizant of the Russian
disinformation machine than we were in 2014.  And many of you covered,
of course, the invasion of Ukraine in 2014.  And we have made a decision
— a strategic decision — to call out disinformation when we see it.  
   
And all across the federal government, various agencies are working
together to fight disinformation and correct it.   
   
In part, we know — the part — that’s because we know that Russia’s
disinformation operation is highly developed.  We are more wiser — we
are wiser, the world is wiser than they were in 2021, and Russia has a
boundless capacity to misrepresent truth and what it’s doing.   
   
And some of that tactic from their end is intended to set the predicate
for them invading.  And we need to be very clear with the global
community and the U.S. public what they’re trying to do and why.  So,
there’s a lot of efforts underway to do exactly that.  
   
In terms of whether it will have a deterrent effect, I think our biggest
effort — in that regard is laying out the clear potential consequences. 
But it is also important — and we think strategically important — to be
very clear that what they’re trying to convey publicly out there, a lot
of that is misinformation, and people need to understand and digest
that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, what preparations is the White House engaged in broadly in the
case of a Supreme Court vacancy?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just not going to detail any of that from here.  
   
Q    Not about — unrelated to this, you can’t detail what — like,
doesn’t every White House like to get ahead of this in case of a sudden
passing — in the case of Ruth Bader Ginsburg?  None of that you can
share?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to detail internal planning from here.  No.  
   
Q    Okay.  Then let me ask you a couple other questions.  Is there any
scenario in which the President would select his Vice President, Kamala
Harris, for the Supreme Court?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I’m not going to speak to any considerations,
preparations, lists.  And as we’ve stated earlier, and you heard the
President say, it is — there’s a long history of Supreme Court justices
determining when they may retire, if they retire, and announcing that. 
And we’re going to — that remains the case today.  
   
Q    Clearly, you are more wiser than to take those questions then.  So,
I will ask you about a different topic, and that’s Vladimir Putin —  the
President saying, “yes,” that he would very much consider personally
sanctioning him in the case of a Russian invasion.  Can you give us a
sense — because Russia has dismissed, or sort of pooh-poohed that idea —
what would sanctioning Vladimir Putin —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Does Russia have a role in determining our sanctions?  
   
Q    No, but they’ve said that it would have no impact.  So, what impact
would sanctioning Vladimir Putin have on him, and what would that look
like?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what’s important to note, broadly, is that
what we’ve also said is that it will be far beyond — any sanctions
package would be far beyond what was done in 2014, and that includes
impacting business and economic interests of President Putin and the
leadership of the Russian government.   
   
I would also note that, while it has been our policy that we are not
going to take options off the table from here — and we haven’t — we also
haven’t been detailed what isn’t in an initial package.  And that
doesn’t mean that everything out there that’s being talked about is in
an initial package.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  When you were asked about the Vice President possibly
being selected as a Supreme Court nominee, you said you’re “not going to
speak to any considerations.”  Does that mean she is being considered?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, Peter, I’m not going to speak to the reports of a
Supreme Court justice retirement that hasn’t been announced.  
   
Q    So, theoretically, would someone who served —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Theoretically?  I do like that you preface it.  I appreciate
that.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Would — just wondering, hypothetically and theoretically, would
someone who was an attorney general of a large state and who served with
many keys Senate votes be an attractive candidate to the President for
an open Supreme Court seat?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I see what you did there, Peter.  (Laughter.)  But the
President has every intention, as he said before, of running for
reelection, and for running for reelection with Vice President Harris on
the ticket as his partner.   
   
But, again, I will just reiterate that I have nothing more to offer in
terms of specifics or information on the reports this morning.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Would you have another question for me?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  I know there’s other things on your mind —  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — on your list over there.  
   
Q    Now that you guys have submitted the written responses to Russia’s
demands, they are saying, “If we do not receive a constructive answer
from the West on our security demands, Moscow will take appropriate
measures.”  Is that a threat —  “appropriate measures”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that the aggressor here — as maybe
you’re echoing in some ways or raising — is Russia.  Russia has tens of
thousands of troops at the border.  They have the ability also to make
the decision to de-escalate, to bring troops back from the border, to
participate in good faith in a diplomatic conversation.  And that would
certainly be our preference.   
   
So, them making threats — I think Secretary Blinken had a very good
quote — or it made me laugh — that he gave a couple of days ago where he
said it was like the fox threatening to attack the hens in the henhouse
because they were feeling threatened by the hens.   
   
But our objective is to give them paths and to take part in a diplomatic
conversation in good faith.  
   
Q    And as the Russians talk about “appropriate measures,” if one of
those winds up being a Russian cyberattack, like DHS is warning about,
would you guys consider that an act of war?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Peter, we have talked many times before — first of
all, there’s no — no information we have at this point about any
imminent threat against the U.S. homeland.  We are always prepared for
cyber threats from a range of sources.  And we have a range of tools at
our disposal to use and react — in reaction, and the President reserves
the right to do that.  But I’m not going to get into a hypothetical.  
   
Q    And then, on COVID origins: You guys are talking a lot about
sanctions for Russia if they dare to invade Ukraine.  What about
sanctions for China — at any point — for misleading the world about the
early days of the global pandemic?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have used sanctions as a tool as it relates to our
concerns about the behavior of a range of countries, including officials
in China.  But I have nothing to preview for you at this point.  
   
Q    Is it possible down the line though that they — that sanctions
would be considered — or some other form of punishment — for their
actions in the earliest days of the pandemic?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, you know, we strongly believe, and the President has
been clear and directly clear, about the importance of them being
transparent and providing data and information related to the origins of
the pandemic.  But I don’t have anything to predict for you in terms of
additional actions.  
   
Q    So then, my last one would be: The President said for months that
he had not spoken directly to Xi about the COVID origins investigation. 
Now he says that he did talk to Xi about it, but nobody else was there. 
If the President had that conversation, did it work and is Xi now
playing ball?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What are you getting at there?  Are you suggesting the
President wasn’t being honest about his own conversation with Xi?  
   
Q    No, but the story did change.  For months he was asked about it and
he said that he had not directly asked him about the COVID origins
investigation.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We don’t share every detail of every diplomatic
conversation.  You know that.  The President answered a direct question
just a week ago — or I think it was a week ago, yes? — and provided that
information.   
   
Q    Okay.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  When was the last time the President talked to Justice
Breyer?  Have they had any communication today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any more details of their communications.  
   
Q    I wonder if you can clear this up because there seems to be some
disagreement among some legal scholars: Is it your understanding and the
understanding of this administration that the Vice President can be the
tie-breaking vote to confirm a nominee to the Court?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would have to check on the specifics of that.  
   
Q    And just one more.  On the President’s Supreme Court Commission, I
believe they finished their report.  They turned it —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — in last month.  Has the President had a chance to review this? 
Might we hear from him on any decision or input that he’s had?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He has received the report.  I don’t have any update on his
analysis of it at this point in time.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Taking you somewhere completely different.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Let’s go there.    
   
Q    On the China bill —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    — which the President, last night in his statement, said he’s,
“heartened” by the bipartisan work on the package — which it was in the
Senate, not so much in the House.  Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman
McCaul said it was “absolutely not” bipartisan, “will likely garner no
Republican support.”  
   
Are you guys involved in — and if so — in getting this to a bipartisan
package eventually?  And what are your priorities in that 3,000-page
bill, since it is pretty long?  And is your timeline the State of the
Union?  What are you looking at here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that it did receive extensive
bipartisan support in the Senate vote — right? — in the Senate version;
that our objective is — certainly remains ensuring that this passes as
soon as possible and the President can sign it as soon as possible.  I
don’t have a new deadline or timeline for you.   
   
We believe that bipartisan, compe- — competitiveness legislation will
help us tackle supply chain issues and inflation head on, and will make
investments in American manufacturing and our economic strength so we
can outcompete China.  
   
And we’re certainly advocating that and have been advocating that and
deeply involved in conversations with the House and Senate.   
   
And our objective is certainly that — to have legislation pass that can
take a range of steps: strengthening R&D, boosting manufacturing, with
important and imperative funding for chips — manufacturing chips so we
can make sure we bring down the cost of cars, as we know which is
leading to one third of the inflationary pressure out there in the
country.   
   
We want this legislation to help businesses and communities in every
corner of the country outcompete their global competitors.   
   
In terms of specifics, as you noted, it’s quite a long bill.  We’re
certainly involved and engaged in it with officials from throughout the
administration, but I’m not going to detail specifics of what we’re for
and against in it either.  
   
Is there any possibility that should this play out, you know, sort of
similar to the infrastructure bill — take a long time, House Republicans
will not get on board — that you, given the pressure of the chips
shortage on inflation, that you just take out the strip — strip out the
chips portion, pass that individually, and then negotiate on the rest? 
Do you see that —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to make a prediction of that at this point.  I
mean, as I understand it, the status of the legislative process is that
both the House and Senate have indicated that it will go to conference
and they’ll work out disagreements that they have over components of the
legislation.   
   
Also, the Senate version had 68 votes.  And certainly, we believe that
increasing and improving America’s competitiveness and investing in R&D
— research and development — and making sure we’re more competitive in
communities across the country is not a partisan idea.   
   
So we are hopeful about that process moving forward quickly, and the
President would certainly like to sign it as soon as possible.   
   
Q    And then one more on this bill, too, that is a difference between
the House and the Senate version.  The House version published last
night had this outbound investment screening mechanism that wasn’t part
of the Senate bill.  It would potentially block investments in countries
like China.   
   
Does the White House support this provision and will you fight that
that’s going to make it in the final package that’s reaching the
President’s desk?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to get into specifics of the bill.  I would
tell you that we are in daily contact, from the White House, with House
and Senate leadership and committees.  And we’re discussing the path
forward, but we’re not going to negotiate the pieces from here.   
   
Q    Is there anything you can tell us on the work the executive branch
is doing on exactly that same thing?  Because Jake Sullivan has been
talking about a potential mechanism like this being interesting to you
guys and potentially working on this, but we haven’t heard about it in a
while.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can see if there’s any additional update from the national
security team, of course.  And certainly, I know he’s talked about that
in the past and it remains a priority.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
I have to give a — give it a shot myself as well.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    In this hypothetical alternative reality where a retirement — a
vacancy were to open up, could you say who within the White House would
be, sort of, leading the charge on the selection and vetting process?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As the President said, I’m sure that if and when there is an
announcement by Justice Breyer, there will be more to be said.  And
we’ll have more conversation in here, I’m sure he’ll have more to say,
but I’m not going to have anything more for you at this point.   
   
Q    Just switching gears.  On the energy front, the administration
said, on Tuesday, it’s in talks with major energy-producing countries
and companies around the world over a potential diversion of supplies to
Europe if Russia invades Ukraine.  Have any of the energy companies or
countries contacted by the administration told you that they do indeed
have an ability to divert extra supplies to Europe?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that’s been part of the conversation, but I don’t have
any announcements to make on their behalf.  But certainly, that’s been
our objective is to ensure that we are prepared for the possibility of
the supply — the natural gas supply — which, as you know, is very much a
regional issue, and there’d be a big regional impact, less so here in
the United States — as well as the global oil supply and ensuring
there’s enough supply in the market.   
   
Q    And what do you see is the risk of the contingency planning failing
to secure Europe’s energy supplies, since our reporting suggests so far
that the industry has little or no capacity to do this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are — no question there are logistical challenges,
especially moving natural gas.  We know that.  That’s part of our
discussion with a lot of these companies and countries.   
   
But again, these conversations are ongoing and we don’t intend to fail
on them.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    A number of lawmakers sent a letter to the White House today,
including Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, asking the White House to
release the memo that the Education Department put together looking at
the President’s legal authority to cancel student loan debt.   
   
I wondered: Do have a response to that?  And, you know, why hasn’t this
memo been released?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say: No one has paid or been required to
pay a single dime of federal student loans since the President took
office over a year ago.   
   
And I’ll also add that our country is seeing one of the strongest
economic recoveries in history.  And the pause announced in December
gives some breathing room, for several more months, to borrowers who are
still coping with the pandemic.   
   
The Education Department will continue working to ensure a smooth
transition to repayment.   
   
I would reiterate also that the President supports Congress, members of
the — who sent the letter and others — sending him a bill that would
provide $10,000 in debt relief.  And he continues to look into what debt
relief actions can be taken administratively.   
   
I’d also note that in terms of loans that have been forgiven, since the
President took office — beyond the pause on repayment — a total of $15
billion benefiting more than 675,000 student-loan borrowers as part of —
been part of the forgiveness; borrower defense to repayment at $1.5
billion; total and permanent disability repayments — loans —
forgiveness, I should say — $7.8 billion; ITT Tech students, $1.3
billion; and public service loan forgiveness, $5 billion.  
   
So, we have been doing a broad range of forgiveness and also have had
this pause in place, meaning that no one who has student loans has been
required to pay since the President took office.  
   
Q    But does the White House plan to release the memo?  Like does the
White House plan to tell the public whether it thinks it has the
authority to cancel $10,000 in debt on its own?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as I said, again, we’re still looking at
administrative options.  But Congress can also send the President a bill
that would provide $10,000 in debt relief, and he’d be happy to sign
that bill.  
   
Q    On the trip on Friday to Pittsburgh, can you talk a little bit more
about why the President is taking this trip?  Is this about the
President getting out more?  I know that he talked about that last week
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — that he wanted to get out and, you know, be face to face with
people.  Is that what this is about?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s part of it.  I think if the President could spend
every day out on the road, he might do that.  There are, of course, a
lot of responsibilities as president that don’t make that possible.  So
that is certainly part of that.  And I expect you’ll see him out on the
road more in the coming weeks as well.   
   
It’s also an opportunity for him to speak about his economic agenda and
what steps he’s taking to make people’s lives better, to lower costs for
Americans, to rebuild their communities, to make us more competitive,
but certainly to interact with people in communities — those who
disagree with him and those who agree with him as well.   
   
Q    And just quickly, on the executive order that’s being signed later
on today, is that order coming out because the NDAA did not do enough to
address the issue of sexual harassment?  Like why is this order
needed?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It was a key recommendation from the Independent Review
Commission, so it’s delivering on the Independent Review Commission’s
recommendation, which is something that was supported — these
recommendations and delivering on them — by the leadership of the
Department of Justice.  So, it’s an effort to implement that.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I wanted to start with a question on behalf of a colleague from
another radio network who wants to know if you have any update on the
launch of Build Back Better World, which was supposed to, I guess, be
implemented earlier this year?  And would Daleep Singh’s upcoming trip
to Africa include scouting projects for Build Back Better World?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to check with our national security team.  We have
talked about Build Back Better World and been working a lot behind the
scenes on efforts to launch that around the world.  And the President
has talked about it on all — virtually all of his foreign trips to
date.  But I can see — get more specifics about Daleep’s trip.   
   
Q    And on the meeting the President had today with the CEO’s about
Build Back Better here: Is the strategy now — with sort of the President
talking about breaking it up in chunks potentially — is the plan to
bring a new proposal to Democrats in Congress?  What does that strategy
look like as it relates to, kind of, the meeting that he had today?  Is
he trying to get a sense of what the priorities would be from these
private sector CEOs?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  The meeting was not a negotiation; it was not the basis of a
negotiation.  Those discussions will happen between the 50 members of
the Senate who need to support a package — a big chunk — to move it
forward.   
   
This was an opportunity to hear from business leaders.  And I think you
heard a number of them speak during the open press component of the
meeting.  And I know a number of them will be doing interviews — maybe
with some of you — afterwards as well.   
   
What I think was interesting and compelling to the President when we
were talking about this last night was that they’re all experiencing
different challenges as they look ahead to their, many of them, very
successful businesses.   
   
Some of that is ensuring they can have enough women at a senior level in
the workforce.  And lowering the cost of childcare and making that
affordable is a big issue that the CEO of Etsy has talked about, for
example, quite a bit.   
   
The CEO of Cummins has talked a lot about climate change — or the
climate agenda and the importance of investing in that moving forward,
because those are industries that will grow and have a huge opportunity
for our manufacturing industries here in the United States.   
   
Those are all components that are part of the President’s Build Back
Better agenda, but he really wanted to hear from them on their
industries; of the best way to grow their businesses, the middle class;
and how components will certainly impact them.  
   
Q    So is that a message the President plans to take to Democrats?  Is
he going to present something smaller — a big chunk — sort of a more
narrow piece of legislation and proposal that perhaps can get unstuck in
the Senate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Well, again, I don’t have any predictions of the
legislative process.  This was not a meeting about the legislative
process.   
   
The President and members — senior members of our legislative team and
senior White House officials are in constant contact with a range of
senators, committee members, staffers.  And, really, the point we’re at
now is determining what components there can be 50 votes for, and that
will hopefully include a big, big chunk of what the President has
proposed.  But that’s what the status of that is.   
   
But this was not a meeting to discuss legislative strategy or how to
navigate conversations with different senators.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, Jen, I have a couple more on BBB.  Ron Klain said last week
that you’d like to see BBB legislation approved as quickly as possible. 
Some Democrats — Representative Jayapal — are saying that March 1st, the
State of the Union, is kind of the deadline for action.  Does the White
House see it that way, in terms of the timeframe?  Do you see the
(inaudible) —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, we have not set a deadline.  No.   
   
Q    And the — five Democratic senators wrote the President and the Vice
President urging them to keep the Child Tax Credit expansion in BBB. 
But the President seemed pretty clear in his press conference he wasn’t
sure that that could happen.  Is he reviewing that?  Did he change his
mind?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President proposed the Child Tax Credit
extension.  He very much wants to see the Child Tax Credit extended, and
you’ve all heard him talk about how proud he is of the expanded Child
Tax Credit because of the impact it had on cutting childhood poverty by
40 percent, for giving people some extra breathing room.  And there’s
some recent studies and evidence that the Child Tax Credit helps working
families in the developments and opportunities for all children.  So, he
has long been an advocate.   
   
Again, this is the legislative process — right? — and there needs to be
50 votes.  We need every Democrat to support a package moving forward. 
I don’t have anything to preview or predict for you on that front.  That
is going to be up to them to determine what that looks like.  
   
Q    And just one more.  Should you have a Supreme Court nomination that
has to make its way through the Senate, is there any concern that that
could crowd out priorities like Build Back Better and make it that much
harder to get something done here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not — without getting into any specifics of what may be on
the docket, we have to walk and chew gum at the same time here in the
White House, and that includes navigating, you know, the buildup of
military troops on the border of Ukraine; that includes trying to get an
omnibus bill passed and get our competition bill passed; that includes
continuing to be the arsenal of vaccines to the world.  And we are
entirely capable of doing more than one thing at once.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I have two questions — two different topics.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    The first one on Ukraine —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Is it about the Supreme Court?  
   
Q    No, actually.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh.  
   
Q    No, I’m not part of this — this bunch.  
   
The President, earlier this week, said he talked to all NATO leaders. 
Canada has offered a $100 million loan to Ukraine and is considering —
to be announced this afternoon — further support, assistance.  What type
of contribution does the President think Canada could make to this
crisis — to solve the crisis?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we wel- — we welcome the support of Canada and any
country that is contributing to the needs of Ukraine, that is defending
the territorial integrity of Ukraine and defending what we feel is a
fundamental value that we share with Canada and a number of countries
around the world, which is the fact that no country should be able to
invade and take the territory of another country.  
   
So, we’re not going to assess what they should do or not do.  Every
country has different capacities, capabilities, legal authorities.  We
recognize that, but we certainly welcome their support for Ukraine.  
   
Q    So the President hasn’t asked for arm shipments or troop
deployments?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to get into any more details of
conversations.  We just recognize that every country has different
capabilities, capacities, authorities, and a range of contributions, and
doing it in a coordinated way, we think, is very effective.  
   
Q    I’d like to talk about — I have a question about Haiti.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    So Canada hosted an international meeting last week.  Prime
Minister Trudeau has called for “immediate action” to fix the security
situation in Haiti.  You know that in the next two weeks, it would have
been the end of President Jovenel Moïse’s term if he hadn’t been
assassinated.  What’s the U.S. plan, particularly in terms of security,
knowing that there’s no newly elected president to swear in on February
7th?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first reference — and I think you’re probably
aware of this — but last week, Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman
participated in a high-level ministerial, hosted by Canada, to discuss
sustainable, inclusive solutions to the challenges faced by Haiti and
Haitians.  
   
The ministerial was an opportunity for global leaders or high-level
officials to reaffirm the continued international commitment to support
Haiti as it confronts growing insecurity, works to restore its
democratic institutions, and revives the country’s economic
development.   
   
We’re also — continue to work with Haitian authorities and international
partners to provide additional systems from the United States to the
Haitian National Police to strengthen law enforcement, build up
anti-gang operations, maintain peace and stability.  And we have also —
in response to heightened humanitarian needs in Haiti, USAID has
provided more than $92 million in assistance in fiscal year 2021.  
   
So we are working on a range of channels, including in close
coordination with other leaders, about how we can help prop up
humanitarian needs, address their security needs, and act in a
coordinated way as Haiti looks to their future.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just a quick question on inflation.  Many people believe that
government spending is a big factor in the current inflation levels. 
Can you speak to concerns that spending plans that come out of Build
Back Better aren’t paid for and — so could mean higher deficits and more
inflation in the future?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Aren’t paid for?  
   
Q    Right.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Build Back Better is paid for.  
   
Q    Can —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Entirely.  
   
Q    Okay.  Can you speak to the concerns that are coming in that it’s
not actually —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Who are the concerns from, though?  But who’s saying it’s
not paid for?  Because there have been a range of economists saying it’s
entirely paid for, and that has been a priority for the President.   
   
It has also been concluded by a number of Nobel laureates and experts —
from a range of economic experts on the outside that it will not
contribute to inflation.   
   
So those are the global experts that we would point to.  But there may
be others suggesting something else, but I don’t know who those people
are.  
   
Q    So if those bills do pass, it will not raise taxes?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it — something being entirely paid for means that part
of that is the highest-income Americans, highest — that companies would
be asked to pay a little bit more.  That has been part of the proposal
and part of reforming the tax system to make it more fair.  
   
Q    So they’re also not expected to contribute to future inflation
then?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The Build Back Better Bill?  
   
Q    Correct.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, it’s fully paid for.  We would point to Nobel
laureates and a range of global economists who have conveyed that it
would not contribute to inflationary pressures.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to ask about the impact that President
Biden’s experience in foreign policy has on the — his handling of the
current situation with Russia and Ukraine.   
   
Obviously, he served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  He was
Vice President when Russia invaded Crimea. He oversaw the end of the war
in Afghanistan last year.  Can you just talk about how those various
experiences have informed his decision-making and his thinking on the
situation currently with Russia and Ukraine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  So, one of the lessons learned we talked about
— I talked about a little bit earlier in response to Josh’s question,
which is the ability and the boundless capacity of Russia to
misrepresent the truth and spread misinformation through a range of
channels.  
   
I mean, they have a range of state-run media channels that are not just
prevalent in Russia, but around Eastern Europe, across Europe.  You can
even find them in the United States.  But even beyond that, this is the
capacity that we’ve seen them utilize in 2014 and 2016, and many times
in between.   
   
So one of the lessons that we have learned is certainly — and the
President has learned — is certainly that it’s important to call out
this disinformation and to make clear to the American public, to the
global community what they’re trying to do here, and the fact that it is
not accurate.  They’re trying to set the predicate for war.   
   
We’ve done that through a number of means.  Last week, the
administration announced sanctions on four, of course, Ukrainian
individuals.  We also had a briefing, launched a website, released a
factsheet to educate the public on the Russia disinformation ecosystem. 
The FBI and DHS are coordinated with the intelligence community, as well
as state and local partners, to ensure a common understanding of Russia
disinformation and influence activities related to the situation in
Ukraine.  So, that’s one part.   
   
I’d also say that for the President — and this has been a priority for
him since he came into office — building up our alliances and
partnerships with the global community, ensuring that close coordination
is front and center and is a priority is something that he has learned
through his time in foreign policy — as the former Chair of the of the
Foreign Relations Committee; of course, as Vice President — is
imperative.   
   
And we believe that’s proving to be very effective at this point in
time.  We’ve had more than a hundred — probably way more than that at
this point — engagements with NATO partners, allies around the world. 
And we have a coordinated and strong, you know, approach to how we’re
approaching the buildup of troops on the border of Ukraine.   
   
So, there are many lessons, but I would say those are two of the biggest
ones.  
   
Q    Right.  And can I also ask about the China competitiveness bill —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — that was mentioned earlier?  Does the White House want to see
Congress finish work on that before Build Back Better, or is there,
like, a priority there in terms of  
getting that done?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President would like to sign it as soon as possible. 
But beyond that, I’m not going to get into an order of events.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I have a few questions.  The first on the Supreme
Court.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Does the President believe that the current makeup of the Court
accurately reflects America’s demographics?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say the President, as you know, asked for a —
put together a commission that could review — that is a bi- — a
commission made of Democrats and Republicans of a range of legal views
that could take a look at everything from the makeup of the Court, to
how they select cases, to the length of service, to the size of the
Court.   
   
That’s a report, as Mary asked about earlier, that he certainly has.  I
don’t have an update on his review of that at this point in time.   
   
I will — I will note though, for you — to go directly to your question —
he has nominated a historic number of judges who are people of color.  A
historic — I don’t know if it’s a historic number of women, but a
majority of the judges he has nominated are women.  That speaks to his
desire and his interest in having courts around the country that look
like America and that represent the experiences of America, including
public defenders and others.  So, that is the evidence of his commitment
to that I would point to.  
   
Q    And is it the expectation of the President and the White House that
whomever he would nominate for any hypothetical vacancy that that would
be an appointment that Democrats could unify behind?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that’s always the hope.  If there were — if that — if
that opportunity presents itself.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  The pace of Americans who are getting booster shots
has dropped by more than 50 percent since December.  And public health
experts are saying that one cause that might be behind that is confusion
over the CDC’s distinction between being “fully vaccinated” and being
“up to date on vaccinations.”   
   
Folks with whom I’ve spoken say that initially describing the two-dose
regimen for mRNA vaccines may have been premature.  Given what we now
know about variants and breakthrough cases, was it a mistake to say that
people were “fully vaccinated” back last year before we knew what the
virus was going to do next?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that — it was not a decision made by the White House. 
It was a decision made by our public health experts at the CDC who make
those definitions or determine those definitions.   
   
They’ve also said that the term “fully vaccinated” refers to your
primary series.  So that means being up to date on your vaccines, which
is true if you have kids.  I have kids.  Making sure they’re up to date
— when they go to the doctor, you ask them if they need any shots.  That
is true of when you need a booster shot; you needed a set number of
months, depending on what vaccine you got, past your second dose. 
That’s something we think American people are more than capable of
keeping up to date on.   
   
It is also true that we think more people need to get boosters; that
boosters are very effective in protecting against serious illness,
hospitalization; and that that is one of the most effective steps that
can be taken.  Seventy percent of eligible seniors have gotten their
boosters, but certainly it needs to be higher in other age groups.  
   
Q    And I do have one on the news of the day.  I’m sorry.  I got to
try.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go — don’t need to be sorry.  It’s okay.  You’re doing your
job.   
   
Q    So, if Justice Breyer were to retire, one of the last cases that
he’ll face as a member of the Supreme Court, obviously, will be Dobbs v.
Jackson, which court watchers are saying is likely to weaken or
potentially overturn Roe v.  Wade.  If his potentially final opinion
ends up being a dissent in the Dobbs case, what is the administration’s
plan to protect abortion access as best it can, beyond trying to pass a
congressional remedy, which I think — you know, unless you guys have 10
extra senators lying around — might not be able to beat a filibuster?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, without speaking to the future of the Supreme Court,
what I will reiterate is that the President has been an advocate for
codifying Roe.  That’s something he certainly thinks and hopes that
Congress will act on.  
   
We’ve also taken steps and have announced steps, in recent days even, to
— for HHS to support — to amp up their support for providers across the
country.  And that’s something we will continue to look for ways to
do.  
   
But I’m not going to make a prediction of the outcome.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks everyone.   
   
Q    The German chancellor timing — do you guys have that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not yet.  Hopefully we’ll have it soon.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
Q    Jen, any response to the Fed signaling it will raise rates in
mid-March?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would just say that the President — obviously, the Fed is
independent, and we stand by that, as does the President; that the —
Chairman Powell has indicated his plans to recalibrate in the past, and
the President spoke last week to his support for that.   
   
Thank you, everyone.
