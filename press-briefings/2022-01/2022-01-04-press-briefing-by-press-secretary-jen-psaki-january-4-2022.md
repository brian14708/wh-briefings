James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:05 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Happy New Year!  I hope everyone had nice
time with family and friends.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you.   
   
I just have two items for you at the top.   
   
I just wanted to highlight that yesterday President Biden, Agriculture
Secretary Vilsack, and Attorney General Garland met with family and
independent farmers, ranchers, independent processors from across the
country to discuss the challenges they have faced as large conglomerates
have absorbed more and more small processors, significantly reducing
competition in the meat and poultry processing industry.  
   
This is just one example of a broad suite of executive actions being
taken by agencies across the economy that will promote competition,
protect consumers and workers, and lower prices.   
   
When dominant middlemen control so much of the supply chain, they’re
able to increase their own profits at the expense of both farmers and
ranchers who make less for their product and consumers at the grocery
store who pay more.   
   
So, just to be clear: Farmers, ranchers, and poultry growers — of
course, they are growing the meat — or overseeing the meat.  It goes to
the meatpackers and processors — that is where we see the middleman;
goes to grocery stores, restaurants, and other retailers; and then to
consumers.  And our concern is about where prices are being elevated and
they should not be.  
   
Many farmers and ranchers now have little or no choice of buyer for
their product and little leverage to negotiate, causing their share of
every dollar spent on food to decline.  
   
Fifty years ago, ranchers got over 60 cents of every dollar a consumer
spent on beef, compared to about 39 cents today.  
   
Similarly, hog farmers got 40 to 60 cents on each dollar spent 50 years
ago, down to about 19 cents today.  So that, obviously, is a significant
concern.  If you see the wholesale of beef value and the cattle value,
that should not be how the lines — the gap between the lines.   
   
I just wanted to highlight again: We announced we’re investing up to $1
billion in new and expanded independent meat and poultry processing
capacity, workforce development, and other assistance.  All of that was
included in the American Rescue Plan.  We’re continuing to strengthen
rules to protect farmers, ranchers, and other producers.  And we’re
enforcing existing competition laws vigorously and fairly.  And our new
White House Competition Council will make sure agencies work together as
appropriate.  
   
Finally, we’re bringing greater transparency to the industry.  The USDA
announced steps on that back in August, and we’ll continue to build on
that.  
   
I also just wanted to highlight that, yesterday, the Department of
Justice announced two important new steps to address gun violence and
keep guns out of the wrong hands.   
   
First, they issued a final rule making clear that federally licensed
firearms dealers must sell safe storage devices that are compatible with
the firearms they sell.  Individuals who choose to keep a firearm have a
responsibility to safely store their firearms.  This rule will make it
easier for gun owners to purchase a safe storage device and keep guns
from being stolen and used by criminals, accessed by children, or
obtained by other people who shouldn’t have access to the weapon.  
   
Second, the Department of Justice issued a best practices guide to
federally licensed firearms dealers to make sure they understand their
obligations to comply with the federal laws and keep guns out of the
wrong hands.  
   
And, of course, this announcement builds on the work the President and
the administration did over the course of 2021, which represented more
action on gun violence prevention — the executive authority — than any
President in his — in a first year in office in history.  
   
With that, Darlene, why don’t you kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Happy New Year to you and your team.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Happy New Year.  
   
Q    I just wanted to start off with getting an update on the 500
million at-home test kits that you all are supposed to be sending out at
some point this month.  Can you say if the contract has been signed
yet?  And if not, when do you expect that to be signed?  And also, the
website — what is the status of getting that up and running?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me give you an update of where we are in the
process.   
   
So, as Jeff Zients said last week, the Department of Defense and HHS are
already executing on an accelerating — accelerated contracting
timeline.  This is the largest, of course, over-the-counter purchase of
tests to date.  And the RFP — the Request for Proposal — that has been
sent out to industry allows us to best understand logistics, timing, and
manufacturing considerations.  
   
So, where we are now is that the RFP has been closed as of today and we
are currently evaluating the responses to it, which means we are
finalizing the contracts.  
   
While I expect we can share additional details with all of you soon —
and, certainly, we hope to do that — we’re on track to start seeing
movement on some of the awards through the RFP this week.  So, the first
deliver- — delivery for manufacturers will start later this month. 
That’s our expectation.  
   
When we have those deliveries in hand, we will put the website up, make
it available so that people can order tests at that point in time.  
   
Q    And then, secondly, do you have anything to share on what the
President’s message will be on Thursday when he goes to the Hill for the
anniversary of 1/6?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Absolutely.  I can give you some highlights at this
point in time.  And obviously, the President is still working through
and reviewing his own remarks.  
   
But on the afternoon — what you can expect, I should say, is that the
President will speak to the historical significance of January 6th and
what it means for the country one year later.  
   
As a reminder, on the afternoon of January 6th, the President called
what was happening at the Capitol then “an unprecedented assault on our
democracy” and an attempt to subvert our Constitution and interfere with
the peaceful transfer of power.   
   
So, on Thursday, the President is going to speak to the truth of what
happened — not the lies that some have spread since — and the peril it
has posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governments —
governance.  
   
He will also mark that day — commemorate the heroes of January 6th,
especially the brave men and women of law enforcement who fought to
uphold the Constitution and protect the Capitol and the lives of the
people who were there.  Because of their efforts, our democracy
withstood an attack from a mob and the will of the more than 150 million
people who voted in the presidential election was ultimately registered
by Congress.  
   
And he will also speak to the work we still need to do to secure and
strengthen our democracy and our institutions, to reject the hatred and
lies we saw on January 6th, and to unite our country.  And obviously,
we’ll have more to preview as we get closer to the speech.  
   
Q    Just one more.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Since the President didn’t take questions from us either today or
yesterday, can you tell us whether he can live with a smaller Build Back
Better package, or a package that doesn’t have the Child Tax Credit in
it, or with only employed people qualifying for the Child Tax Credit,
which is what Senator Manchin says he wants?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can tell you that the President absolutely wants to
get Build Back Better done, is committed to get it done because it will
lower costs for Americans across the country — childcare, eldercare,
healthcare — a lot of the areas that are impacting American families’
budgets across the country.   
   
I can tell you that that’s — those are conversations he and many members
of our senior team will continue to have with a range of senators who
are involved in this process in the weeks ahead and that we’re not going
to outline them in more detail from here.  
   
And I would also just reiterate that the President sees and recognizes
and values the contribution of the Child Tax Credit and what it did to
help redu- — lower the — prevent 30 percent of kids from being — from
being in poverty last year.  And it’s something that he advocated for,
he introduced, and he called for himself.  So, he absolutely wants to
see an extension of the Child Tax Credit.  
   
I would note — this doesn’t answer your question, but I thought this was
an interesting thing someone shared with me this morning — that the way
it was designed is that payments are going out one — every month for six
months.  As soon as people file their taxes, they will get the other
half.  So, we absolutely want it to be extended.  We’re going to fight
for that.  But there is also additional payment that will come to people
who are eligible when they file their taxes.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hey, Jen.  Happy New Year.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Happy New Year.  
   
Q    And since the President didn’t take questions from us, we weren’t
able to clarify.  He said to the — to the vaccinated and boosted, quote,
“You can still get COVID,” but it’s very “unlikely” you’ll be “seriously
ill” — roughly what he said.   
   
Have we reached a point in the pandemic now where he’s basically saying
to Americans, “Accept the fact you may get the virus, but if you’re
vaccinated, it won’t be that bad”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think what he’s saying to Americans is: We know there are
going to be breakthrough cases.  We’ve had them at the White House.  We
are seeing them across the country and, certainly, elevated rates of
cases in certain communities across the country, including in
Washington, D.C.  
   
But the step that’s most important that people can take to prevent —
reduce the potential for hospitalization and death is to get vaccinated,
get boosted.  He’s not telling anyone to accept anything.  He’s just
conveying to people what they can do to protect themselves.   
   
He’s also said very clearly — and I think he’s illustrated that — this
in what he said publicly, as have our doctors — that we’re going to be
direct and straightforward with the American people.  We know cases are
going up.  But we also know that if people are boosted, it is going to
significantly reduce their potential to be hospitalized and certainly
prevent to — to die.  And that is what we’re conveying to the public.  
   
Q    Okay.  So, let’s — let’s be straight here for a second: Cases are
rising across the country; tests are hard to come by in many places, or
there’s long lines for them; schools are closing again or having to go
virtual — and that’s not just because of the weather in some parts of
the country, but because of the pandemic.   
   
There is a sense among many that the country has lost control of the
virus.  Would the White House agree with that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We would not.  And here’s why: We’re in a very different
place than we were a year ago, Ed.  Two hundred million people are
vaccinated.  Those are people who are protected — seriously protected
from illness and death from the virus.   
   
We have also just purchased the largest over-the-counter purchase of
tests in history: 500 million tests.  That builds on the fact that we
have already distributed 50 million tests back in December to rural
health centers, to community health centers; the fact that we have
20,000 sites across the country where you can get free tests; the fact
that, next week, people can get reimbursed for their tests.  And we are
going to continue to build on that.  
   
It also — on schools, I would say: Ninety-seven percent of schools are
open across the country.  And the President wants school to be open. 
That’s why, months ago, even when people questioned his advocacy for
this funding, he advocated for $130 million in the American Rescue Plan
and $10 billion to cover testing, even when many people said that was
not necessary and was not needed.   
   
That has all been distributed to states.  If states have not used it —
and some have not — and if school districts have not used it, now is the
time to use it.   
   
So, I would note that we have taken steps to prepare for any
contingency, any moment.  And we’re working to implement and build on
that from here.   
   
Q    He mentioned — you just mentioned outbreaks here at the White
House.  Is it a large number?  Is it anyone — I know there’s a policy
that you’re only really going to let us know if it’s the top four
individuals in the government or their spouses, but has there been a
wide outbreak here in the West Wing or across the White House campus?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our policy is that — which I think is important for
the public to know, because it is in the public interest to know —  
   
Q    Sure.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — and, of course, your interest: If there is anyone who has
a close contact, as deemed by the White House Medical Unit, with the
President, the Vice President, the First Lady, or the Second Gentleman,
we will make that information available, as we have done, as those
instances have occurred.   
   
And I was only conveying there are breakthrough cases here.  There’s
2,000 people who work on the White House complex, right?  The — 99
percent of them are vaccinated, and there will be breakthrough cases
here.  Thanks to the vaccination, those cases have been mild.   
   
But again, there are — there are rising case numbers across the country,
and we expect to be in line with that.   
   
Q    And just on another topic — and you kind of discussed this with
Darlene — but Senator Durbin today suggested that Build Back Better has
kind of taken a backburner spot — to add the B’s.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s a lot of alliteration there.  
   
Q    — a lot of “B’s” there — as voting rights pushes ahead, as we near
the MLK holiday.  
   
Is that the White House’s stance right now — that voting rights is, sort
of, issue number one up there, or should be?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re working — and you’ve seen, I’m sure, the “Dear
Colleague” letter that Leader Schumer put out just a couple of days ago,
and we’re working in lockstep with Leader Schumer on that, on getting
voting rights done.  He’s obviously put a timeline for that.  We’re
going to work with him on getting that done.   
   
But that doesn’t change our commitment to Build Back Better.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Why hasn’t the CDC revised the definition of what it
means to be “fully vaccinated” yet, given that the President has spoken
about boosters for months now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  It’s a good question, Jacqui.  I don’t speak for the
CDC.  Obviously, they speak for themselves, given they are — they make
decisions based on data and science.   
   
So I would point you to them.  I know they have a COVID briefing
tomorrow.   
   
Q    Well, we’ve had the President, you know, emphasizing the importance
of boosters for months.  And, you know, people have to ask the question,
or a lot of people are asking the question, you know: Would revising the
guidance cause some sort of logistical or political or economic
consequence that the White House isn’t ready to embrace — something
like, you know, not being able to go to restaurants or people go to
offices or industries that have suffered labor shortages?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have boosters — we have boosters available for every
American.  They can get boosted now, regardless of what the CDC guidance
is, whether you were just approved for the booster or you were approved
weeks ago.   
   
Q    So do you expect, then, that that guidance will change
eventually?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s up to the CDC, and they make those decisions based on
data and science.   
   
Q    Will we have any update on when they might make a decision on that,
given that there’s been so much time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I encourage you to ask them that question when they
participate in the COVID briefing tomorrow.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, similar line of questioning —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — but this time about the FDA.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.   
   
Q    There have been some decisions by the FDA over the last few months
that have happened without consulting the panel of independent experts
that we saw for authorizations for the vaccines themselves.  We haven’t
seen that with boosters.   
   
A couple examples: On the 19th of November, FDA authorized the booster
for all adults; 29th, the CDC announced people 18-plus should get
boosters.  December 9th, they — the FDA authorized boosters for 16- and
17-year-olds.  Then, just yesterday, the FDA amended the emergency use
authorization for the Pfizer booster for kids ages 12 to 15.   
   
So, I guess my question is: Why has the protocol been different with the
boosters than it was for the emergency use authorization for the vaccine
itself?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jacqui, the FDA makes their own decisions, not driven by
what the White House is telling them what to do.  So, I would point you
to the FDA to get any comment on that.   
   
Q    So, it doesn’t — I guess, then, the White House is not — or the FDA
is not getting rid of its independent panel of experts by any White
House guidance?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely not.  And again, I think they would confirm that
themselves.  And I think what’s important to step back here is —
recognize we’re still in the middle of a pandemic.  There are still far
too many people who are not vaccinated.  There are still kids who are at
risk because there are not enough people — adults vaccinated.  And I
think what we’re all collectively trying to do here is protect more
people and save more lives, whether you work here or at the CDC or the
FDA.  
   
Q    Is the President, then, okay with the FDA making these
authorizations without calling their panel of experts?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I would point you to the FDA, and they can speak to
their decision-making process.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, real quick, on the Florida surgeon general and
testing: What’s your reaction to his comments that the U.S. needs to
“unwind” its “testing psychology,” where people are planning their lives
around testing?  Is that sound medical advice, in the White House
view?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would really point to our own health and medical experts
on when tests should be administered and utilized and our focus on
making them more available, accessible, and free to the public.   
   
Q    And then, real —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    — real quick: Is there any reason why the CDC did not include a
testing component when it revised its guidance for isolation?  Given
that there is such a scarcity of tests, there’s been some criticism
that, you know, the CDC couldn’t tell people they should get tested when
they emerged from isolation because then people would try to get tests
and they’re not available, and it might blow back onto the
administration.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, the CDC makes these decisions.  I expect they’ll have
an updated guidance if it hasn’t already gone out.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Can you —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, sorry, Kaitlan, I’ll come back to you.  
   
Q    Can you give us an update on the President’s selection — you’ll be
shocked to hear me ask this —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The Fed!  
   
Q    — the Fed, yes — you know, and, in particular, whether he’s made
the decisions?  Is it a question of the announcement not having been
done but the decisions are made?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything more for you at this moment.  I expect
we will have more soon, and I will let this President speak to his
decision and whom he will select.  
   
Q    My colleague, Katia Dmitrieva, and Jennifer Jacobs — they were
reporting that economist Philip Jefferson is likely to be nominated for
one of the seats.  And he would be just the fourth Black man to hold a
position on the central bank’s board in its history.   
   
Can you comment on Mr. Jefferson’s candidacy or whether — or what role
equity will be playing in the President’s determinations for all these
seats?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  I can’t speak to an individual name.  I can say that
it has been a priority for the President to ensure that there — that
equity and making sure there are diverse choices and diverse leaders
representing different roles in the Federal Reserve.  Just as it has
been a priority for him in other points — in parts of his government, it
is an important part of his decision-making process.   
   
Q    And could we just go back to the testing issue?  
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Do you have a sense of how long the 500 million will be, you know,
spread out in terms of timeline?  They’ll start in January, but —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — when will all 500 be available?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update on that at this point in time. 
Certainly understand the question.  I expect as we finalize the
contracts, which we’re in the process of doing, we’ll have more
information on that.   
   
But, again, we expect the first shipment from manufacturers to come
soon.   
   
Q    And on testing: One of the — some of the biggest retailers —
Walmart and Kroger — have raised the price of Abbott’s BinaxNOW test. 
They’ve been selling it at cost because the detail — deal — excuse me —
with the White House that expired.  They are now about 19, 20 bucks, and
they were at about 14 per box of two tests.  
   
I’m wondering whether there any talks ongoing with retailers to bring
that price back down to an at-cost level or whether you’re confident
that the increasing supply of tests will more or less work itself out in
the market.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can’t give you an update on any conversations.  I
can tell you that our objective is, of course, to increase and scale up
access to free tests.  Hence, next week, people who have health
insurance — 150 million Americans — will be able to get those tests or
get reimbursed for those tests, hence making — ordering of — sending 500
million tests for free out to Americans — 20,000 free testing sites, 50
million tests that we’ve already given out.   
   
So that is our focus from the federal government.  Obviously, we want a
competitive market out there that will lower the cost of tests over the
course of time as well.   
   
Q    And, sorry, one more: The President’s announcement today on the
therapeutics — the ordering of more Pfizer courses — has he ruled out
ordering more of Merck’s pill, which was easier and quicker to make but
had less effective results in its clinical trial?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  He hasn’t ordered — he hasn’t ruled anything out.  I would
say this is — just as you’ve seen with any of our steps on COVID,
whether it’s the antivirals or other steps that have been approved out
there in the market — the monoclonal antibodies — we’re going to
continue to build on the orders we have done to date.  So this is just
the recent step to expand what we have in our medicine cabinet.  
   
Q    All right.  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks so much, Jen.  With the CDC expected to update its guidance
on isolating today and the confusion that the agency generated over that
guidance last week on what you should and should not do after you’ve
tested positive, I’m wondering if the President himself thinks that the
CDC has been clear on that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what I can tell you, Kaitlan, is that CDC is offering
its updated guidance in real-time of a fast-moving and changing pandemic
environment.  And we’ve seen them change guidance and update guidance on
other occasions.  They made this recommendation last week based on
science.   
   
The vast majority of transmission, infectiousness occurs in the first
five days after diagnosis with COVID-19, somewhere in the range of 85 to
90 percent.  If people are asymptomatic, five days of strict
mask-wearing will prevent future transmission.   
   
Obviously, they are expected to update that today.  I’m not sure if any
information has gone out on that at this point in time, so I won’t speak
to that ahead of them.   
   
But they are just continuing to assess every day, every week what
information can — they can update on based on the science.  And
sometimes that means changing recommendations, that means adding to
recommendations.  But that’s what happens when you lead with the data
and the science and not — lead with a clear communications plan.  
   
Q    Well, last week, Director Walensky did say that it wasn’t just the
science, it was also what people can tolerate.  And I don’t really think
that much has changed in the last week.  So I just am wondering if the
White House thinks that the CDC is doing its best to offer the clearest
guidance possible to people, because it seems like they’re generating a
lot of confusion when they do offer guidance.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our objective is to provide clarity and help provide
clarity on their decisions whenever we can.  And so that’s why I just
listed out why they made the recommendation, based on the science, on
the 5 days — the change to 5 days from 10 days.  
   
Q    On testing and the rule that’s going to go into effect next week,
where private insurers will reimburse people for the tests that they’re
buying at home, you still have to file a claim for each test.  Is that
correct?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have — that’s a good question.  I don’t have the
details of exactly how it would work.  I would assume some version of
filing a claim or filing paperwork, but I can get you more specifics on
it.  
   
Q    Has the administration done the math and added up the cost of what
it would be to just make these at-home tests either one dollar, like
some other countries have done, or free for everyone?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve looked at a range of options.  I would say that
what — when — they’re free for everyone.  They’re actually — a lot of
countries have done what we’re about to do — right? — which is, for
people who want tests, they can request them online and get them for
free.   
   
I don’t know of countries — maybe there are some — that have sent them
to every person living in their country.  This is about making them free
and accessible to the people who want them, and we want to do that.  And
there are some countries who have done that — some who’ve had to stop
doing that because they haven’t had enough access to tests to continue
programs like that.  
   
Q    Right.  But we’re still waiting on the details for that.   
   
I do want to switch subjects just for one more question.  Why has the
President not nominated an ambassador to Ukraine yet?  And does he plan
to do so soon?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He absolutely plans to nominate an ambassador to Ukraine. 
Just like any position, he’s always looking to find the right person to
nominate to fill the role — an important one.  
   
Q    Has he interviewed people for that position?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to get into more details about a personnel
process.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, Happy New Year to you.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Happy New Year.   
   
Q    So, Senator Manchin — he presented a proposal to you on December
14th, an outline of a Build Back Better framework that included $1.75
trillion in spending.  Is — to your knowledge, is that still available
as a fallback position?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just not going to get into private discussions or
conversations with any members of the Senate from here.  I know that’s
maybe a change, but we feel that’s the best way that this is going to
work to get this done.  
   
Q    Got it.  Okay so — and just on — I mean, if — had you taken that
framework and put it through the legislative process, we could have text
the Senate could be moving towards a vote this week on something that
Senator Manchin supports.  Why is it that you haven’t decided to —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Have you done a vote count on the former proposal?  
   
Q    I have not.  Please correct me if that’s — if that’s wrong.  But
why not — if he’s, kind of, the major stumbling block to getting
legislation passed, why not go with something that he endorsed a month
ago?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, Trevor, it’s important to note that — and I
think as Senator Manchin noted earlier today — we have a very slim
majority in the Senate.  That means you need every single senator from
across the spectrum of the Democratic Party agreeing to what a package
looks like moving forward.   
   
We’re not naïve about how challenging that is and how challenging it can
be, but we feel good about the possibility of getting something done. 
What the final package looks like, I can’t outline that for you at this
point in time.  I would note that when he spoke earlier today, he also
said he saw a lot of good things in the package and a lot of good basis
for discussion.   And there’s agreement among Democrats about lowering
costs for Americans, about lowering the cost of healthcare, lowering the
cost of childcare, lowering the cost of eldercare.  That’s a very strong
basis.   
   
We’ve got to work through the details, and we’ll keep having those
conversations privately.  
   
Q    But you don’t think his framework would pass?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I’m not going to give you a vote count or whip count
from here, but I think it’s important to note that you need 50 votes in
order to — you need every single Democrat to support a package in order
for it to move forward, even through reconciliation.  
   
Q    And is there any plan to reengage with him at any point on this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re going to keep those engagements and conversations
private.  
   
Q    Okay.  Then, another topic.  Back in the summertime, when OPEC said
that it was going to boost production of crude oil by 400,000 barrels
per day, Sullivan said it’s “simply not enough” during a “critical
moment in the global recovery.”  
   
Today, OPEC stuck with that decision to keep the exact same amount of
oil production increase.  Why is the White House’s reaction different
this time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say first, since you gave me the opportunity:
We do appreciate the close coordination over the recent weeks with our
partners — Saudi Arabia, UAE, and other OPEC Plus producers — to help
address price pressures.  We welcome OPEC Plus decision to continue
increases in production.  
   
And together with our recent release from the SPR, we believe this
should help facilitate the global economic recovery.  We’ll continue to
monitor prices in the context of global economic growth and engage our
OPEC Plus partners as appropriate.   
   
And obviously, as we said at the time, our objective is ensuring that
the supply out there meets the demand.  Obviously, we took our own steps
in coordination with others as well.  
   
Q    But they haven’t made any changes to their — what they’re doing. 
So why — why is the message different?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, we took steps on our own.  Right?  We have taken
steps in coordination with other countries around the world.  And our
objective is to ensure that the supply out there meets the demand. 
We’ll continue to have conversations if we have ongoing concerns.   
   
Go ahead.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Hey, Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sorry, I just jumped around there.  It was a confusing pen
point.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay.  Well, Happy New Year to you.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Happy New Year.   
   
Q    Yes.  So, the President, he’s making remarks on Thursday, as you
said.  And he has often denounced the January 6th events.  But could you
talk a little bit about why he refrains, to the extent that he does
(inaudible), from condemning ex-President Trump personally, not just for
January 6th, but for his ongoing campaign — which is very persistent,
almost daily, maybe at least weekly — to discredit Americans’ faith in
the election process?   
   
So, in short, does President Biden think that his predecessor is acting
normally, or does he think he’s a threat to democracy, which is what
some people would say?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, I have to say, I don’t think we’ve held back on
this front.  I mean, President Trump’s role in subverting our
Constitution, attempting to block the peaceful transfer of power, and
defending a mob that attacked our Capitol and law enforcement has been
well documented.  And it’s something obviously the President spoke about
in terms of that being one of the worst days in our democracy.   
   
And he’ll speak to — as I noted a little bit earlier, he’ll speak to the
historical significance of January 6th — what it means for the country
one year later; the importance of the peaceful transfer of power, which,
obviously, the prior administration and the prior President weren’t a
part of.   
   
And — but I think there’s a larger message here to the country about who
we are and who we need to be, moving forward.  
   
Q    Does he consider ex-President Trump to be a threat to democracy?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think he’s spoken to this in the past.  
   
Q    Okay.  On the same issue, but a little more broadly: The polls keep
showing, again and again, that something like 70 percent of Trump voters
think the election was rigged, that President Biden is not legitimate,
and so on.   
   
Is there anything that President Biden feels he should have already done
or is there anything he feels he still can do to actually talk directly
to those people and try and get, you know, people’s reality to match a
bit more in this country?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think what he’s going to continue to do is speak to
everyone in the country — those who didn’t vote for him, those who may
not believe he is the legitimate President — about what he wants to do
to make their lives better.  And he sees that as his responsibility as
the President of the United States.  That’s what he will continue to
do.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Happy New Year.  So, Senator Schumer just said that
he and Senator Manchin talked numerous times during the break, mostly on
voting rights but also on Build Back Better.  And he also says that the
White House will be having more talks, with Manchin’s, quote,
“participation and cooperation” on Build Back Better.  
   
So can I ask: Did the President and Senator Manchin talk at all over the
break?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We obviously confirm the conversation they had two weeks
ago.  I don’t have any more conversations to confirm for you.  
   
Q    Thank you.  And given what Schumer said about more talks in the
future, do you know the next time they’ll talk about this (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I am not going to predict that for you, but I can assure you
that the President and members of our senior team will, of course, be in
touch with a range of senators who care deeply about moving Build Back
Better forward.  
   
Q    Can I clarify something on the —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — testing delivery timeline?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Yeah.   
   
Q    You said the first deliveries go out later this month, then the
website goes up, then people can sign up.  So probably, those tests —
people can expect end of this month, early February to their home?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what I was trying to convey, perhaps not as
articulate — articulately as I meant to, is that we will put the website
up when the tests are available to be sent — right? — as to not cause
any confusion.   
   
So, I think the timeline I provided was that — for the first delivery
for manufacturers will start later this month.  And obviously, then we
will work to get it out the door as quickly as possible.  
   
Q    So given that a lot of experts are saying, “If Omicron follows the
surge it did in South Africa, it could be peaking here as early as next
week and probably start declining by the end of the month,” is there
some concern that these tests are being provided too late, when the
worst is already behind us?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that there’s unprecedented demand
— we know that — right now for tests; there was in advance of the
holidays for understandable reasons.  People wanted to see loved ones. 
They wanted to ensure they tested before they saw loved ones.  And we
were not where we needed to be; we’re still not.

What we’ve done is try to do this as quickly as possible through an
expedited, accelerated contracting process to ensure that tests are
available for free to people across the country as quickly as possible. 

Now, at the same time, we know that online and in retail stores across
the country they are restocking shelves with tests.  That is a good
thing.  We are continuing to open more federal testing sites, as we have
done in New York and different cities that have been hardest hit across
the country.  And we continue to have 20,000 free sites across the
country.

So, we’re not working on one channel.  We are doing it as quickly as we
can to get these 500 million tests in our hands, doing it through an
accelerated expedited process, but we’ve also taken a number of
additional steps to ensure — the federal testing sites, just to note,
are in New Jersey, D.C., New York City, and Philadelphia.  Those are
some of the places, just to give you a sense.  And we’ll continue to
build on that, which we have the capacity to do.

Q    Given the surge that we’re seeing now, is it fair to say if those
free tests had been made available earlier — before the holidays, before
people traveled and where contacting gatherings occurred — would we not
be seeing the same numbers we’re seeing today?  Wouldn’t it have
prevented some of that spread?

MS. PSAKI:  I don’t know that we can make a prediction of that.  It’s a
good question to ask the doctors. 

Look, I would say though and again reiterate, as the President said
before Christmas: We were not where we needed to be.  What he did do is
he quadrupled our testing capacity from the summer to December.  He made
50 million tests available at rural health centers and community health
centers in December to expand that access.  We opened these federal
testing sites in December. 

So, these were steps we took to, as quickly as possible, expedite our
capacity, even in December, as the demand — the unprecedented demand was
rising, and doing everything we could at an accelerated pace. 

Of course, you know, we would’ve liked to have more in our hands
earlier.

Q    Can I ask a —

MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.

Q    — follow-up quickly on the Child —

MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.

Q    — just Child Tax Credit question.  We know those aren’t going to
hit families’ accounts this month — right? —

MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.

Q    — even though there’s relief down the line.  But for families who
were relying on it month to month, is there any talk of executive action
or anything from the White House to provide more relief for them?

MS. PSAKI:  We are always looking at how we can help provide relief to
American families and the American people.  If you — if Build Back
Better were to pass in February, there is an option of doing retroactive
checks.  But I would note that our objective is to get this passed.  The
President wants to see the Child Tax Credit extended.

Go ahead.

Q    To follow up on testing then, if it’s going to take that long.

MS. PSAKI:  I should say in January — sorry.  In January to do February,
if that makes sense.

Q    Yeah.

MS. PSAKI:   Yeah, go ahead.

Q    Along those same lines, for people who see those long testing lines
— you have more sites, but it’s cold out; people don’t want to wait in
that.  You swing by CVS, there are no tests. 

While waiting for all this expanded capacity, what is your advice to
people who may be going back to college and want to take a test or they
want to go see their grandparents, or whatever it might be?  If their
workplace says, “We want you to take a self-test before you walk in,”
what can people do in the meantime until that capacity does get built
up?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it depends on the person, which is a hard question to
answer.  But I would say that there are still many doctors’ offices that
are administering tests.  If somebody has health insurance, that’s
something that you can go do. 

Everyone does not have health insurance.  There are community health
centers, rural health centers.  You can go look online and see if there
is one near you and go to that. 

We have just opened a number of federal testing sites in New Jersey,
D.C., New York City, and Philadelphia.  We will continue to expand those
— big federal testing sites — and we have 20,000 free sites across the
country. 

Different communities and states are doing — taking different steps. 
Some libraries are providing tests.  Some community buildings are
providing tests.  It really depends community to community.

If tests are required, there’s a number of steps and we’re — that people
can take, and we’re working to expand that as quickly as possible.

Q    And lastly, you had mentioned rising cases, the President mentioned
rising cases a little while ago — every doctor has said that.  We’ve
also heard from Dr. Fauci and other doctors saying, “That’s not the
number to look at.  We know they’re going to go up, but maybe
hospitalizations is a better case.”  
MS. PSAKI:  I think — yeah, that’s an important point.

Q    What’s the President’s barometer?  Is there one number that he kind
of gauges to get an idea of where the country is right now?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, what I was trying to say in response to Ed’s question
— again, maybe not as articulately as I’d like — is, as Dr. Fauci said,
one of the areas that we are concerned about and focused on is hospital
capacity and that — how that is impacting medical professionals and the
capacity for hospitals to take people in.  So, we look at a range of
metrics, but we certainly look at that as we see rising cases.

It is fortunate in many areas that the vast, vast majority, if not all
of the people, who are going to hospitals — are unvaccinated — not in
every community; it depends community to community.  So that’s why we
are also continuing to echo and advocate for people to get vaccinated,
to get boosted to protect themselves.  That’s the most important step
they can take.

But certainly, as Dr. Fauci said, we are looking at and concerned about
hospitalizations — or capacity given hospitalizations.

Go ahead, in the back.

Q    Back to testing: How can employers be obligated to test
unvaccinated workers when there’s such a shortage right now?  And what
will OSHA do when it starts enforcing this rule in a few days when
employers say, “Well, sorry, we can’t comply because we can’t find any
tests”?  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first say that two thirds of employ- — of
companies — almost two thirds of companies have taken steps to put in
place either vaccination requirements or testing requirements.  They’re
all implementing it in a different way.  And the leadership of these
companies is making a decision about what works best for their
workforce. 

Giving that option is something, certainly, we support.  Obviously,
getting vaccinated — they’re free across the country, available across
the country — is also a very easy option for many people, and many
companies are opting to do that.

As OSHA works to implement and work with companies to do that, our
objective and what we’re continuing to focus on is continuing to
increase capacity of free tests that are targeted more though at
individuals and households, less than companies.  And obviously, to
work, there’s now nine tests that are approved to go to market that
different companies and different school districts and others can have
direct contact with.

So, there’s a range of ways to get access to tests, and we’re working to
increase capacity to make them free and accessible to households and
individuals across the country.

Q    So, are you saying it’s up to workers to find tests themselves if
they must be tested to go to work rather than their employer providing
them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Actually, I’m saying — and I think what I said pretty
clearly — is that different companies — about 60 percent of them have
already implemented — are implementing the test or vaccine requirements
in different ways — company to company, employer to employer.  So — and
many of them have done it extremely successfully, including many of the
airlines, a number of huge hospital systems.   
   
And this has helped make — remember what the objective is here.  The
objective is to make workplaces safer, to provide more security to
people.

If you look at the data that just came out this morning, JOLTS — that
was a shout-out to Bloomberg; they’ll get that — they’ll get that
reference — data that came out today — there are still many people who
are fearful about going back to work.  That is one of the reasons why
it’s important to put in place these requirements and why employers have
taken the step to provide that certainty to people in their workplaces
as well.

Q    I want to ask one more question related to the workforce.  The
White House labor task force, led by Vice President Harris, was supposed
to release a report in October about how the federal government can
boost unionization in this country in a variety of employers.  It’s
January 4th and that report has not come out yet.  What’s going on?  And
does the — do the President and Vice President still care about this
initiative, given everything else that’s going on?

MS. PSAKI:  I would say the President has been an advocate for
collective bargaining rights, for the rights of workers, for the str- —
for strong unions, for six — five decades of his career, and I think
that speaks for itself.  And the Vice President, while a little younger
— not in public office quite as long, but has also been a strong
advocate for the rights of workers.   
   
And so, I think that speaks for itself.  Of course, this is an
initiative they ini- — they put forward.  I am certain I can check on
the status of the report.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Jen.  A couple of topics, if you don’t mind.

As you know, the anniversary of the opening of Guantanamo Bay detention
facility is next week.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    The President promised to close it.  You reiterated that in
February.  What’s taking so long?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that the National Security Council
continues to work closely with the Departments of Defense, State, and
Justice and other departments and agencies to do exactly that.   
   
I would note — and I know this was put out during a very crazy, holiday
period of time, but in the President’s statement on the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, he outlined that:  
   
“Section 1032 of the Act continues to bar the use of funds to transfer
Guantánamo Bay detainees to the custody or effective control of certain
foreign countries, and Section 1033 of the Act bars the use of funds to
transfer Guantánamo Bay detainees into the United States unless certain
conditions are met.   
   
It is the longstanding position of the executive branch that \[those\]
provisions unduly impair the ability of the executive branch to
determine when and where to prosecute Guantánamo Bay detainees…In some
circumstances these provisions could make it difficult to comply with
the final judgment of a court that has directed the release of a
detainee…In addition, the limitations in Section 1032 of the Act
constrain the flexibility of the executive branch with respect to its
engagement in delicate negotiations with foreign countries over the
potential transfer of detainees.”   
   
There are only 39 remaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay, but I just
wanted to highlight that piece that was in the NDAA statement because we
feel it’s obviously creating a burden and a hindrance to our progress
here.  
   
Q    So it’s the foreign — the transfer to foreign countries that’s
causing delays essentially?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think I listed three cur- — three car- — clear
pieces there and limitations on how funding can be used, and how this  —
this Section 1032 also limits, at times, how an individual can be
released, as well as, three: how we can negotiate and communicative with
foreign countries about it.  
   
Q    But some of them have been awaiting trials for years.  What —
what’s causing — why is that taking so long?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I would say this is what we see as one of the major,
if not the major hindrance.  Beyond that, I would point you to — point
you to the Department of Defense.   
   
But there are 39 remaining individuals there.  And obviously our
commitment continues to be to close Guantanamo Bay.   
   
Q    One other topic.  The Iranian president said yesterday, as the
talks begin in Vienna again, that President Trump — former President
Trump should be put on trial for the killing of General Soleimani.  I’m
wondering if I can get your reaction to that and whether that hinders
discussions around the — Iran’s nuclear future this week.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that I don’t have any direct comment on
his comments.  I would note that he has his own politics and his own
audience that he speaks to, just as many country — leaders in other
countries do.   
   
But, right now, Special Envoy Malley is currently leading an interagency
delegation to the eighth round of talks in Vienna, which resumed on
January 3rd.  There was modest progress in talks last week, and we hope
to build on that this week.   
   
What is clear is that if we do not soon reach an understanding on mutual
return to compliance, Iran’s accelerating nuclear steps will hollow out
the JCPOA.  So, our priority remains reaching and implementing a rapid
mutual return.  And I expect those negotiations will focus on those
topics at hand, not comments of any leaders around the world.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    A couple of different topics here as well.  First, from the
administration’s point of view, given what we’ve learned from the
January 6th Select Committee, does it appear the Capitol riot played
some kind of role in an overall coordinated effort to overturn the
democratic process?  So, something longer perhaps and more than just one
day.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Just so I understand your question, are you saying — talk a
little bit more.  Tell me a little bit more about what you’re trying to
ask.  
   
Q    Yeah, sure.  So, there’s the isolated events of that day —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — but there’s also the investigation that goes back much further
and spans more time.  Does it appear that there’s that sort of longer
throw there than just what occurred on January 6th at the Capitol, based
on what we know from the select committee?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to speak for the select committee.  And
obviously, they will speak for when the conclusion of their report will
be and what details.   
   
I would note that we have conveyed our concern in the past about the
fact that many Republican members of Congress have stood by the “Big
Lie” since then.  They were outraged at the time about — many of them —
about the events that happened on January 6th.  Who could not be who was
watching them?  And since then, they have done nothing to help support
the work of the committee, to help argue against the “Big Lie.”  And,
you know, that sort of lack of action, inaction, silence, you know, is
something that is irresponsible as well.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    And then —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    Sorry, another from Todd Gillman, a fellow (inaudible) seat —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — rotation at the Dallas Morning News.  Does the White House have a
reaction to Senator Cruz saying President Biden may be impeached if the
Republicans take back the House next year, specifically for the border
policies?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our reaction is: Maybe Senator Cruz can work with us
on getting something done on comprehensive immigration reform and
putting in place measures that will help make sure smart security is
what we see at the border, taking a more humane approach to the border
instead of name calling, accusation calling, and making predictions of
the future.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I have questions about voting rights and also
about political appointments.  On voting rights, the midterm elections
are 10 months away.  Is the President concerned that the window is
closing to pass legislation that could have an impact on how people vote
in the midterm elections?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to make a prediction of that.  What I will say
and what the President will talk about in his speech on Thursday is also
that, you know, people came out — the American public came out in record
numbers last November and participated in our democracy, and we
shouldn’t underestimate the role of the movement and — grassroots
movement of the public to have their voices heard.   
   
But he absolutely feels that getting voting rights done is fundamental,
it’s essential.  He’s going to work in close lockstep with Leader
Schumer and others in Congress to get this done.   
   
But I’m not going to make a prediction at this point on the timeline. 
It’s obviously a first priority for them in the Senate.  
   
Q    Is it a first priority for the President?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, he’s working with Leader Schumer on it.  
   
Q    In December, he said at South Carolina State University, “We’re
going to keep up the fight until we get it done.”  What does that look
like?  What does the fight look like for voting rights for President
Biden?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It means getting it passed into law and signing it into
law.  
   
Q    So what steps is he taking over the next several weeks to make that
happen?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would — I would first say that the President has —
you can expect to hear more from him soon, and I’m not going to get too
far ahead of that.   
   
But the President has taken a range of steps within his own authority on
voting rights, whether it is signing a historic executive order early in
his presidency, supporting the efforts of the Department of Justice to
increase funding for the protection of people’s fundamental rights
across the country.  And he also spoke to his commitment or openness to
making changes to the process to protect people’s constitutional rights,
should that be the point we get to.   
   
This is obviously going to be front and center on the Senate’s agenda
when they return, and he’s looking forward to being a part of that.  
   
Q    On political appointments, the President, right now, has had 266
political appointments confirmed by the Senate.  That is roughly on par
where President Trump was in his administration at this time.  It’s
about 100 less than where Presidents Obama and Presidents Bush were at
this time in their first years in office.  Is that lower number of
political appointments impacting how President Biden can govern and
implement his policies within the executive branch?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, so, just for the specific numbers — and you gave a
number of these — but we ended 2020 — 2021, I should say, with more than
300 of President Biden’s nominees for Senate-confirmed positions pending
confirmation by the Senate.  Approximately half were on the executive
calendar and awaiting a floor vote — just to give you all a sense —
meaning they could have moved forward; more of these could have moved
forward.   
   
Many of our nominees have received overwhelming support and majorities
from Democrats and Republicans.  And the process, for most of the time
in the Senate, was wound up in lengthy debates when, really, there could
have been unanimous consent votes and moved many of them forward.   
   
So, our — the President’s view is, of course, having the people that he
has nominated, selected — highly qualified individuals — leading
departments, running different parts of agencies — small, large agencies
that impact people’s lives across the country — is important and
imperative to getting his agenda done and moving things forward.  
   
Obviously, there are career employees who — ensuring effectively that
agencies are running.  But, of course, he wants to have his team in
place — his people leading these agencies to continue to move his agenda
forward.  
   
Q    Does he want the Senate and Senate leadership to spend more floor
time on pushing nominations through?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think there’s a way to move them forward without
consuming hours and hours and days of floor time.  We’ve seen some
agreements.  And we were — we were encouraged by the agreement that
happened right before the winter holiday to move a number of nominees
forward.  And we’re hopeful we can push more forward in the weeks
ahead.  
   
Q    But there are still 141 positions where there has been no nominee
put forward.  Why is that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I think the President, one, is eager to have these
nominees he has nominated confirmed; that’s something the Senate can do
— Congress can do.  And there are nominations.  He wants to find the
right person to fill the position.  
   
Go ahead.  Last one.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  And Happy New Year.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Happy New Year.  
   
Q    I have two questions.  One for a colleague who couldn’t be here.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    My first one is that Tesla opened an electric car showroom last
week in Xinjiang, just days after President Biden signed the Uyghur
Forced Labor Prevention Act into law.  Does the White House have any
comment?  And will it do more to discourage American companies from
doing business in Xinjiang?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Yes.  So, I can’t speak to the specific situation of
one company, but as a general matter, we believe the private sector
should oppose the PRC’s human rights abuses and genocide in Xinjiang.   
   
The international community, including the public and private sectors,
cannot look the other way when it comes to what is taking place in
Xinjiang.  
   
As we’ve said before, companies that fail to address forced labor in the
supply chains — in their supply chains and other human rights abuses
face serious legal, reputational, and customer risks, not just in the
United States but in Europe and around the world.  
   
And we’ve been clear about our views on the ongoing genocide and crimes
against humanity in Xinjiang.  We will continue to hold the PRC
accountable.  
   
I would also note that we’re committed to taking action to assure —
ensure our supply chains are free from forced labor, including with the
bipartisan Uyghur Forced \[Labor\] Prevention Act the President signed
last month and, obviously, our continued leadership on the world
stage.  
   
Q    Great.  And one more is on — in light of the surge of Omicron
variant and many events like the 2+2 security talks going virtual, is
the U.S. considering shifting this month’s U.S.-ASEAN Summit to a
virtual format, or will you still do in person?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any changes to the format to preview at this
point in time, but we’ll check and we’ll keep you all updated.  
   
Thanks so much, everyone.
