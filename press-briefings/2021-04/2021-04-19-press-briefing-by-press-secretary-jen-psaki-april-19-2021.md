title: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, April 19, 2021

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:19 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Happy Monday.  Okay, a couple of items for
you all at the top.   
   
Today is an exciting day; we enter a new phase of our vaccination
program and our effort to put the pandemic behind us.  Starting today,
everyone 16 years and older, in every state, is eligible for the
vaccine.  Thanks to the aggressive action we have taken through our
wartime whole-of-government response, we have enough vaccine supply for
all adults to get vaccinated; thousands of vaccinators — we will have, I
should say, thousands of vaccinators ready to get people vaccinated; and
more than 60,000 places — convenient places — for people to get their
shot.   
   
So we have put up a couple of highlights here.  More than half of all
adults in America have now received at least one shot.  More than 32
percent of adults are fully vaccinated. Eighty-one percent of seniors
have at least one, and just about two thirds are fully vaccinated.  At
least 90 percent of Americans now have a vaccine site within five miles
of where they live.  
   
And in order to make sure people know that they’re eligible, we’re
blitzing the airwaves, including local media, constituency radio and
television, and also have a range of officials doing national
interviews, especially health and medical experts.  Google is providing
information on its homepage to help people find a location near them. 
And there are notifications from Facebook and Twitter, as well as even a
stat — Snapchat message from Dr. Fauci.  Never too — never too young to
Snapchat — too old, too young, either way.  
   
There’s also a bipartisan AJP meeting happening today — American Jobs
Plan — happening today.  This afternoon, the President — shortly after
the briefing, I should say — and Secretary of Transportation Pete
Buttigieg will host a meeting in the Oval Office with a bipartisan group
of representatives and senators who are former mayors and governors.   
   
There are, of course, more former mayors and governors than just this
group; we will likely welcome them in the future as well.  But the
President is looking forward to tapping into their experience and
expertise overseeing local communities and states.  Hence, this is the
group he’ll be meeting with today.   
   
They’ll discuss the American Jobs Plan, the critical need for infra- —
investment in our nation’s infrastructure.  And their state and local
executive experience, combined with their legislative experience,
provides, in the President’s view, important perspective on how to
invest in our roads, bridges, railways, and infrastructure across the
country.  
   
Two more quick items for you.  Today, we congratulate the men and women
of NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for yet again making history
in outer space.  The space agency’s aptly named “Ingenuity” helicopter
lifted off of Mars early this morning, performed the first-ever powered
flight on a world beyond Earth.  And this brief flight now paves the way
for more extensive exploration down the road.  Future Red Planet
missions could include choppers as — as scouts or data collectors.  Very
exciting.  
   
Finally, today the Department of Housing and Urban Development is
announcing the obligation of $8.2 billion in Community Development Block
Grant Mitigation funds for Puerto Rico, along with the removal of
onerous restrictions unique to Puerto Rico that limit the island’s
access to these funds that were allocated following Hurricane Maria in
September.  And these actions are the latest in an ongoing,
whole-of-government effort to support the island’s recovery and
renewal.   
   
Jonathan, why don’t you kick us off.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen, and happy Patriots Day.  I know you’re a New
Englander, so —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    In terms of — two matters for you: one domestic, one foreign. 
Starting here at home: The nation is obviously watching right now the
closing arguments in the Derek Chauvin trial in Minnesota, and I was
hoping you could, please, walk us through what the federal level of
preparedness is right now for a verdict that could be coming in a matter
of days.   
   
What sort of coordination is there with the states, not just in
Minnesota but elsewhere, you know, if there indeed will be, perhaps,
unrest one way or the other, after the riot?  Could you walk me through
conversations being had with local officials, mayors, governors, and so
on?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say, as you all know, the jury is
deliberating, will come back with a verdict — or they will be
deliberating, I should say.  After the closing arguments today, they’ll
come back with a verdict, and we’re not going to get ahead of those
deliberations.  I’m not suggesting you’re asking that, but I just wanted
to restate that.  
   
We — what I can say is, broadly speaking, we are in touch with mayors,
governors, local authorities.  Of course, our objective is to ensure
there is a space for peaceful protest; that, you know, we encour- — we
continue to convey that while this country has gone through an extensive
period — especially the Black community — of pain, trauma, and
exhaustion, as we’ve watched these — not just the trial, but, of course,
additional violence against their community over the past several weeks,
we — it’s important to acknowledge that and elevate that at every
opportunity we have.   
   
But in terms of your question, Jonathan, we’re in touch with local
authorities.  We’re in touch with states, with governors, with mayors. 
And certainly, you know, we will continue to encourage peaceful
protests, but we’re not going to get ahead of the verdict in the
trial.  
   
Q    Is there recommendations about — in terms of the National Guard
deployments?  Have there been communi- —  conversations about that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s a range of conversations about how to ensure that,
no matter what the outcome, there is a space for peaceful protest.  But,
of course, we’ll let the verdict — the jury deliberate, and we’ll wait
for the verdict to come out before we say more about our engagements.  
   
Q    Okay.  And the other matter: Aleksey Navalny — obviously in a
Russian prison.  There are reports today that he has been removed to a
hospital for medical treatment after the hunger strike he has been
on.   
   
Can you provide us the latest in terms of what the White House has heard
about how he is doing and if you believe this is an acceptable motive —
if this is enough care for him?  And what sort of conversations are
being had right now with the Russian authorities as to that situation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I expect today, if not now, our National
Security Advisor is going to have an — a conversation with his
counterpart, and we’ll have a readout of that once that’s concluded. 
That, of course, will cover a range of topics, but certainly the
detention and treatment of Navalny will be a part of that.   
   
Let me say that, as a reminder, in the President’s first conversation
with President Putin, he raised a range of concerns, including the
treatment of Navalny.  On March 2nd, we announced, in coordination with
several key allies and partners, our response to Russia’s use of a
chemical weapon to poison Aleksey Navalny.   
   
So our — we continue to reiterate our view that what happens to Mr.
Navalny in the custody of the Russian government is the responsibility
of the Russian government, and that they will be held accountable by the
international community.  As National Security Advisor Sullivan has said
— he said just yesterday — we’re not going to telegraph our punches.  If
Mr. Navalny dies, well, there will be consequences to the Russian
government, and we reserve those options.   
   
But, in the interim, our objective is, of course, continuing to call
for, push for his release and reiterate our view that he must be treated
humanely.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Can you explain where things stand right now when it
comes to the refugee ban?  First off, the White House said on Friday
that, actually, the 15,000 cap that was set by the Trump administration
was — remained justified.  But then later, you said, “Actually, no, the
number is going to go up by May 15th.”   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn’t — I would dispute that being our characterization
on Friday, but let me walk you through what we did announce.  
   
Last week’s announcement — or Friday’s announcement, I should say, was
an effort — an important step forward, in our view — to reverse the
Trump policy that banned refugees from many key regions of the world. 
So there were many parts of the Middle East, parts of Africa where
refugees could not apply and could not come into the United States.  And
part — as a result of that, there were very limited number of refugees —
in the low thousands — that had come over in a extensive period of time
during the Trump administration.  That was an important step, on — in
our view.   
   
In addition, there had been refugee flights that had not traveled, that
had not been taking off to come to the United States, and we resumed
those flights.  This was always meant to be just the beginning.   
   
In the announcement we made on Friday, we were clear in the emergency
presidential determination that if 15,000 is reached, a subsequent
presidential determination would be issued to increase admissions as
appropriate.  And that is certainly our expectation.  
   
In addition, we also announced on Friday that the President — while we
are assessing right now what is possible in terms of — given the fact
that the processing — the asylum processing has been hollowed out from
the State Department, and also the ORR — the Office of Refugee
Resettlement — has also been hollowed out in terms of personnel,
staffing, and financial and funding needs, we are — have every intention
to increase the cap and to make an announcement of that by May 15th at
the latest.  And I expect it will be sooner than that.  
   
The President also remains committed to pursuing the aspirational goal
of reaching 125,000 refugees by the end of the next fiscal year.   
   
Q    And what role has the situation at the border, which the President
called a “crisis” this weekend — what role has that played in decision
making around the refugee cap?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, if I walk you back just a little bit — and
hopefully this will be helpful to you — during the transition, our team
was — made an assessment of what our refugee cap should look like.   
   
And we looked back at the last few years and assessed that, because of
the very low numbers — the restrictions I just mentioned that were in
place, restricting refugees from coming from the Middle — parts of the
Middle East — most of the Middle East, I should say, and Africa — we
needed to go big and have a bold goal.   
   
And so that’s why we set the 125,000 cap objective by the end of fiscal
year ’22.  62,500 was a down payment — meant to be a down payment in
this year.  That was why we set that goal.  Now, that’s an a- — that was
an aspirational increase of 10 times what was being led in by the Trump
administration.   
   
In that period of time — we came into office; the President made that
announcement, made those — put those aspirational goals out there —
there were a couple things that happened: One, as you alluded to, there
was an increase of unaccompanied children at the border. Our policy was
always going to be to welcome those children in, find a place where they
can be sheltered and treated humanely and safely.  That increase and
that influx, as you all know, was higher than most people, including us,
anticipated.  
   
The second factor was that we did not — it took us some time to
recognize how hollowed out these systems were.  The Office of Refugee
Resettlement, which oversees — while there have been different pots of
money and different personnel — has both the resettling of refugees as
well as unaccompanied children.  And there is — there are questions and
have been assessments about reprogramming of funds and how we can
address both at the same time.  And certainly, that ability and ensuring
we can do that effectively has been on the President’s mind.  
   
Q    And then, finally, on a somewhat related matter: The President has
said that climate change is one of the factors that has created this
surge at the border, but there are no Central American countries that
have been invited to the Climate Summit that the White House is putting
on.  Is there — how did you decide which countries to invite?  And has
it been considered whether or not to invite some Central American
countries?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’ll say that engaging Central American countries,
countries in South America, many other countries around the world in the
climate crisis is certainly our objective and our plan.  And you will
see that play out through diplomatic channels, whether it’s through
former Secretary Kerry, who’s now our Envoy; or Secretary of State
Blinken; or the President himself.  
   
There were 40 global leaders invited — this is our first summit of this
kind — and obviously, a number of them will be speaking.  So I think the
decision was made about how to impact and invite — or how to invite,
kind of, some of the largest economies in the world.  That was the
objective.   
   
But engagement with these countries, having a conversation about the
role many of them play in addressing the climate crisis is absolutely on
our diplomatic agenda beyond this summit this week.  
   
Go ahead.  Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q    If it is a “not guilty” verdict, will the President be
disappointed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we’re not going to get ahead of the jury — the legal
process and the jury making their deliberations, Kaitlan.  And when the
jury makes their deliberations and concludes and a verdict is found, I’m
certain the President will speak to that.  
   
Q    And you talked how the White House is preparing for whatever that
verdict is.  Congresswoman Maxine Waters said, over the weekend, that
they need to — “We’ve got to stay on the street and we’ve got to get
more active.  We’ve got to get more confrontational.  We’ve got to make
sure that they know that we mean business.”  Does the President agree
with what she said about getting more confrontational?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can speak to the President’s view.  He has been very
clear that he recognizes the issue of police violence against people of
color, communities of color is one of great anguish, and it’s exhausting
and quite emotional at times.  
   
As you know, he met with the Floyd family last year and has been closely
following the trial, as we’ve been talking about, and is committed to
undoing this longstanding, systemic problem.   
   
His view is also that exercising First Amendment rights and protesting
injustice is the most American thing that anyone can do.  But as he also
always says, protests must be peaceful.  That’s what he continues to
call for and what he continues to believe is the right way to approach
responding.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.  And on the refugee cap, you were saying that
there have been other factors that have affected what that goal is now
going to be with the limit that’s happened since he first announced he
wanted it to be 62,500.   
   
But can you explain why, two weeks ago, when I asked if he was committed
to raising it to that number by the end of this fiscal year, you said,
without hesitation, “yes.”  So I don’t understand what has changed in
the last two weeks to change those numbers, given, two weeks ago, there
were the surging numbers at the border already happening.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I mean, he remains — the goal he set was
125,000 by the end of the next fiscal year.  And 62,500 — sorry, that
was a tongue twister — is meant to be a down payment on that.  And he
will absolutely be putting out a cap — an increased cap — over the
course — in advance of May 15th.  
   
So he would absolutely like to get to that goal and get –reach that
objective.  But we also want to assess — and that’s what we’re doing now
— what is possible, given the fact that the — the Office of Refugee
Resettlement has been hollowed out and given the fact that the system
has been in worse shape.  And we’re just taking the time to do that.  
   
Does he — that goal was always aspirational.  It was always a huge goal
— 10 times what the Trump administration had welcomed, in terms of
refugees.  And so we’re going to put out an — we’re going to put out a
number — he will put out a number in advance of May 15th.  
   
Q    But you say it’s “aspirational,” but clearly you thought it was
possible, given the Secretary of State told Congress about it, the
President committed to it.  So why put a number out there if you can’t
meet it?  Because it does give people false hope that you’re going to
let in 62,500 refugees by the end of September.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s also important for people to understand
that the challenge is not the cap; the challenge is the ability to
process, the abili- — the funding, the staffing, and welcome refugees
in.  
   
The cap is a number that anyone can set.  The biggest battle to getting
more refugees in during the Trump administration was the fact that there
were regional limitations put in on refugees coming in from the Middle
East and Africa.  We’ve changed that cap — we’ve changed that policy, I
should say.   
   
So, the cap, the — the number was always going to be.  We made — as I
said in response to Nancy’s question, we — we knew it was an
aspirational, big goal when we set it.  It was going to be 10 times what
the Trump administration had — had set as their goal.  
   
And we remain — we are looking ahead to and we — we hope — we are
hopeful about reaching that 125,000 number as we look to the next fiscal
year.  But as we came in and assessed and have had time to assess and
have — the teams to have had time to assess where the challenges are, we
learned more about how hollowed out the systems were; we learned more
about the challenges in processing; we learn mo- — more about, of
course, the impact of what the influx of unaccompanied children would be
on these considerations.  
   
Q    But shouldn’t you have assessed that before making a commitment?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we made — the President made the announcement in early
February, and he felt it was important to send the message to the world,
which remains his view, that we’re now a country, again, that is going
to welcome in refugees from around the world.   
   
That continues to be his point of view.  It continues to be his
objective.  It continues to be his policy.  But sometimes it takes a
little bit of time to lift up the hood, kick around the tires, and see
what the big problems are.  And we — he made that announcement within
two weeks of taking office, so clearly we’ve had some time to do it
since then.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I’m still just a little bit confused about what
changed between 1:00 p.m. on Friday and around 4:30 p.m. on Friday to go
from “we’re not raising the refugee cap” to “we are raising it by May
15th.”  What — what changed in those three and a half hours?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, as I just outlined, we never said we’re not
raising the refugee cap.  In the morning, we said actually — and with
the information we put out — was that once we reach 15,000, we will
raise it.  That was not accounted for in some of how people were di- —  
   
Q    But you also said —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me finish.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — some of how people were digesting the information.  And we
wanted to be clear and send a message that we are a country that is
welcoming refugees.  Let’s be clear: We are changing the policies of the
last administration.  We are changing the policy of not welcoming in
people from Africa or people from the Middle East.  That was the biggest
factor preventing refugees come — from coming in during the last
administration.   
   
Q    So are you saying this had nothing to do with the pushback from
some Democrats on Capitol Hill — from Senator Dick Durbin, to
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  It had nothing to do with
that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think you’ve articulated to me what our change in
policy was.  What was our change in policy from the morning until the
afternoon?  
   
Q    The executive order from Friday morning said that “The admission of
up to 15,000 refugees remains justified,” period.   
   
And yes, there was a caveat that you could raise that cap later, but, I
mean, it explicitly says that right there.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s a pretty important caveat, that if we — when we reach
15,000, a subsequent presidential determination could be made.  And,
again —  
   
Q    But then, why —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — the biggest challenge —  
   
Q    Then why the need to issue that clarification?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But the biggest — the biggest challenge —  
   
Because people weren’t understanding what we were conveying to the
public and weren’t conveying what we were trying to project to countries
around the world.   
   
And it’s incumbent upon us to make sure there’s an understanding of what
the President’s policies are, what he’s trying to achieve, and what he
feels morally — is that we’re going to welcome in refugees from around
the world, change the policies from the past administration that — where
they were not welcoming in refugees from the Middle East and Africa.  
   
And that was important to him to take that first step and move it
forward.  
   
Q   The line said, “The admission of up to 15,000 refugees remains
justified.”   
   
MS. PSAKI:  And —  
   
Q    Can you understand how some people would interpret that the way we
did?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we all have a responsibility to provide all of
the context.  And so what I’m conveying is that we also included, would
als- — is read that “a subsequent Presidential Determination \[would\]
be issued to increase admissions.”   
   
And again, the battle is not the cap; the issue has been the limitations
that have been put in place in the past.  We overturned those and
changed those, and it was always meant to be a first step.  
   
Q    So, back to my other question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Did this have anything to do with the pushback from Democrats on
Capitol Hill?  There was —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t you’ve articulated what our change in policy is so —
go ahead.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    That’s not my job to do that.  That’s not my job to do that.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it is if you’re asking a question.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    But I’m asking about the pushback from progressives on Capitol
Hill.  Did that —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But what was — was our change from the morning to the
afternoon?   
   
Q    The change from the morning to the afternoon was that you
explicitly said, “The admission of up to 15,000 refugees remains
justified.”  And in the afternoon, you said that the President would be
raising the cap on or before May 15th.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In the morning, we also said that, if 15,000 is reached,
that “a subsequent Presidential Determination \[would\] be issued to
increase admissions.”  
   
That was not clearly understood.  We felt it was incumbent upon us to
make sure people understood and were clear that our objective was to
welcome in more refugees, and we remain committed to our goal.  
   
Q    And I’ve got —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    — one more question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    President Biden, over the weekend, called what happened at the
border a “crisis.”  Is that now the official White House position, that
there is indeed a crisis at the border?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that we have made some progress —
some progress in moving children from out of Border Patrol facilities
into shelters.  Nearly 1,000 unaccompanied minors were transferred out
of CBP facilities and into the care of Health and Human Services just
this weekend.  We are — still have a lot of work to do, but we — that is
a step forward, in our view.   
   
The President does not feel that children coming to our border, seeking
refuge from violence, economic hardships, and other di- — dire
circumstances is a crisis.  He does feel that the crisis in Central
America, the dire circumstances that many are fleeing from — that he —
that that is a situation we need to spend our time, our effort on, and
we need to address it if we’re going to prevent more of an influx of
migrants from coming in years to come.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  The readout from Jake Sullivan’s call just hit a
little bit ago.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, good.  Timely.  
   
Q    But it didn’t mention Navalny.  And the Russians, of course, last
week, said that President Biden didn’t mention him in their call.  Any
reason while — why his name hasn’t been in the readouts?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I reiterated that the President’s first call
with President Putin — he conveyed a range of concerns we have,
including the treatment of Aleksey Navalny.  We issued, in coordination
with our European partners, a number of steps to — a number of sanctions
in response to the poisoning of Aleksey Navalny.   
   
I, obviously, haven’t spoken to our national security team about the
call, given I was out here for the call, so I’d have to check on that
for you.  
   
Q    And then, another question on the refugee cap.  You mentioned the
infrastructure constraints, et cetera.  I mean, how close do you think
you all can get to the 62,500?  I mean, is there an initial projection
of what you’re hoping to hit for that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We want to get to that, and we want to provide that to all
of you.  And we’re — our team is currently assessing exactly that.  
   
Q    And then, lastly, on the Chauvin trial.  We’re expecting a verdict
any day now.  I know you said you’re not going to get ahead of it.  But
we’ve also seen — but, with that,  we’ve also seen, of course, the
shooting of Adam Toledo in Chicago.  I mean, what is the White House
doing to address policing?  Are there any more executive orders in the
pipeline or under consideration?  I mean, what signal are you going to
send to those communities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there’s a number of steps we’ve actually taken — the
Department of Justice has taken.  Let me first reiterate that the
President has said repeatedly that he believes we need police reform. 
That is why he’s on — calling on Congress to deliver that to his desk. 
It is incumbent upon Congress and the Senate to move forward.  And,
obviously, there are discussions and negotiations about what that looks
like.  But we’ve seen an unacceptable and a longstanding trend that is
the cause of immense pain and hardship across the country.  
   
During the campaign, then — former Vice President Biden emphasized the
importance of the Justice Department using the authority he spearheaded
as a senator to investigate systemic police misconduct.   
   
And there are a couple of steps that have been taken in recent weeks. 
Last week, Attorney General Garland reversed a Trump administration memo
that limited the use of consent decrees with respect to investigation of
police department — departments.  And reversing the prior memo returns
DO-day \[sic\] — DOJ to the use of all civil rights enforcement tools it
has for its crucial work.   
   
The President also pledged to appoint DOJ leadership that would
prioritize pattern-or-practice investigations.  That would, of course,
ensure they were — that investigations into racially unfair and
inappropriate conduct were taken seriously and prioritized.  And he has
two critical nominees pending who would do exactly that: Vanita Gupta to
be Associate Attorney General, and Kristen Clarke to head the Civil
Rights Division.   
   
He also, of course, supports — firmly supports the George Floyd Act, as
I’ve said.  He believes there’s a special — there’s definite urgency at
this point in time, and he’ll continue to convey that.   
   
I’d also note our initial budget calls for increasing funding for the
Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division by millions of dollars in
order to advance accountability and reform for abusive police
practices.   
   
And finally, multiple states have enacted bipartisan policing reform
statutes in recent months.  And we believe that those are encouraging
signs in some states of the country.  It’s not the only thing that needs
to happen; we need federal legislation.  But that’s also something we
certainly have been encouraging.  
   
Q    One last question —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — domestically, if I may.  Is the White House committed to
including the $400 billion for elder care in the AGP \[sic\] — AJP
package?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The caregiving proposal we have in there?  Obviously, we
believe that that is important, imperative, and that will help address
what we see as a caregiving crisis in our country where 2 million women
have left the workforce.  A lot of those women had — did — have done so
because they are in what many call the “sandwich generation,” where
you’re caring for elders and you’re also caring for children.   
   
Also, the caregivers themselves are only being paid about an average of
$11 an hour; that’s completely unacceptable.  That’s why he put that —
we proposed that in that package.  
   
There will be a range of views.  There are a lot of members who are
absolutely for that and adamant that it should be included.  There are
some who don’t feel that way.  So we’ll have the conversation.  More of
those are happening this week, and we’ll go from there.   
   
Q    Could he slip it into the next package just to make it more
palatable for — for this one to pass?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, it’s a great question, but we’re not quite there
on the mechanics or the mechanisms for what different components will be
— will be — how they will move forward on the Hill.  We’re eager to have
those conversations with leaders in Congress.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  India is facing a critical shortage of raw materials
necessary to make vaccines.  And officials there are urging the U.S. to
lift the U.S. embargo of exporting those raw materials.  My colleagues
in India are reporting today that the Biden administration recently told
them — recently told India that its request was being considered and
would be active, in quotes, “at the earliest.”  Could you provide some
more details on that and maybe some timeline?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  So Ambassador Katherine Tai, of course, gave some
remarks at a World Trade Organization virtual conference last week, and
she highlighted a couple of piece that — a couple of points, I should
say, that are very representative of our view.  The significant one
being: “…the significant inequities we are seeing in access to vaccines
between developed and developing countries are completely unacceptable. 
Extraordinary times require extraordinary leadership, communication, and
creativity.”  
   
We are, of course, working with WTO members on a global response to
COVID.  That respon- — that includes a number of components, whether
it’s $4 billion committed to COVAX, or discussions about how we can aid
and assist countries that need help the most.   
   
But our focus is on determining the most effective steps that will help
get the pandemic under control.  We don’t have anything further in terms
of next steps or a timeline, but we are considering a range of
options.   
   
Q    I did a quick review of the President’s daily schedule, and I found
that the White House had 38 listings that dealt with the COVID
pandemic.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.   
   
Q    You conducted 32 COVID press briefings, 20 items dealing with the
economy and jobs, 6 on infrastructure, but just 2 on guns.  One was
happenstance in Georgia.  You know, if the daily schedule represents a
public expression of the White House’s priorities, why shouldn’t we
conclude that the guns and violence is not a top priority?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, having played some role in some White Houses on the
daily public schedule, I will tell you that it often includes the issues
that the public, one, has the appetite most to hear updates on.  And
certainly the COVID pandemic is front and center for people across this
country for understandable reasons; more than 550,000 — more than
560,000, I believe, people have died.  People are worried about their
loved ones, their family, and they want to hear more on what we’re
doing.   
   
I will say that there are also some discussions and policies in — to go
back to an earlier question, the discussions about Aleksey Navalny, in a
separate category, are actually an example of this as well, where
conversations in private can be more effective.  
   
And, on guns, there’s no confusion about where the President stands on
guns.  He spoke to this issue quite passionately on Friday.  He’s been
an advocate through the course of his career for decades — not only
verbally, but he’s led the fight to get background checks in place; to
ensure the assault weapons ban was placed; to — lead the effort to get
20 — almost two dozen executive actions in place during the Obama-Biden
administration, and just announced a few recently.   
   
There’s no confusion about his view.  The American public also supports
background checks — more than 80 percent.   
   
So I would — I would say that this will continue to be a central focus
of his presidency, of his time in public office, and he will use every
lever he can to get it done.  But I wouldn’t confuse public speeches for
what actions or commitment he or any President has to an issue.   
   
Q    One other quick question.  There’s increasing evidence that methane
emissions are much higher than what’s been accounted for.  Is the
President committed to releasing a specific target for methane
reductions as part of the U.S. announcement this week?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I know we’ll start some preview and background calls
tomorrow, and, hopefully, we’re going to have some climate experts come
to the briefing room later this week as well.  But I’m just not going to
get ahead of our planned public announcements or decisions that are
still being finalized.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  There were some reports in recent days about people
counterfeiting their vaccination cards, going around with cards that say
they’re vaccinated so they can maybe get in places where they otherwise
couldn’t.  Is the administration aware of those reports?  Concerned? 
Having conversations with local folk — local officials about how to
counteract that, potentially?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are certainly aware of them.  We’ve seen the reports. 
And we, of course, defer to law enforcement and other authorities who
are overseeing and — and cracking down where this has come up.   
   
I don’t have a number or percentage or data to give you on how expansive
this is.  I mean, the fact is, as of today, every adult American over 16
is now eligible.  So the best way to get a vaccine card is to get
vaccinated, and that’s what our focus will continue to be.   
   
Q    Another question on Navalny, given Jake Sullivan’s comments
yesterday about consequences.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    President Biden, obviously, has requested a summit with Vladimir
Putin.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    If Navalny dies in Russian custody, is that summit still on the
table?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let’s certainly all hope and pray that that is not the
outcome we’re looking at.  And again, there are a range of private
conversations that occur diplomatically, and we continue to reiterate
publicly as well our call for him to be released, to be treated
humanely.  And — but I’m not going to get ahead of a horrible outcome
like that.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  I’ve got a vaccine question.  But just, first, a quick
follow-up to my colleagues’ —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — questions about the refugee —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    — cap earlier.  You — you said that the issue about the cap
statement on Friday was not clearly understood by some people.  Would
some of the President’s Democratic allies on the Hill be some of those
people that did not clearly understand?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I don’t think I was placing blame; I was more
characterizing that we recognized that we needed to be clear and make
sure people were understanding what our objective was and that the
President remains committed to welcoming in refugees from around the
world.   
   
That — the announcement on Friday was intended to be a first step
intended to convey clearly that we are overturning what we felt was a
xenophobic policy of the past administration to prevent people from many
parts of the Middle East and Africa from applying for refugee status and
to resume flights and that we remain committed to welcoming refugees
in.  So we provided more information, as sometimes is necessary to do.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine: It’s been almost
a week —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    — since it’s been paused.  The indication is that it may still be a
few more days before we understand what the next step will be.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Is the White House concerned — or what is the level of concern that
J&J’s reputation may be harmed during this — this time period and it
could hamper the administration’s efforts to reach out to skeptical or
hesitant Americans about getting vaccinated?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s interesting; we actually haven’t seen data —
unless you have, which is possible — that has suggested that has been
the outcome.  The FDA is the gold standard.  They took this step out of
an abundance of caution, as they’ve said, to ensure that the American
people could have confidence in their actions, their — the high level of
review and the high standards that we have in the U.S. government.   
   
They’re convening again on Friday, as Dr. Fauci, I think, spoke to over
the weekend.  So we’ll see what comes out of that.   
   
But what we’ve seen as it relates to confidence or hesitancy is that,
broadly speaking, it’s really an issue of access.  And we’ve seen that
as the case in many communities across the country.  And our focus is on
working to address that.  In part access, I should say — but also, in
part messengers, and that’s why a huge amount of our $3 billion in
funding is focused on empowering and funding local messengers, whether
it’s doctors or clergy or local civic leaders, because we know they are
the most effective in conveying the efficacy of these vaccines.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hey, Jen.  Just a couple on the Jobs bill and Climate Summit. 
Senator Cornyn and Senator Coons spoke about the possibility for a
smaller, narrower infrastructure bill in the range of $800 billion. 
Does the President see that as a viable alternative to what he’s
proposed?   
   
And then: How does he view this idea that there might be an opportunity
to get some kind of, you know, bipartisan agreement on infrastructure
before you move on to the care economy?  That if you could do it in the
near term, as President — as Senator Coons suggested, that, you know,
that would be the way to go?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there are a range of ideas and proposals out there —
some Senator Coons, Senator Manchin, some — some Republican senators,
and some Democrats who may be more on the progressive wing of the party
as well.  And our objective, at this point in time, is to hear and
listen to all of those, and to determine what the path forward may look
like in coordination and cooperation.   
   
We have — the President’s bottom line here is that the only thing we
cannot do is — is fail to invest in our nation’s infrastructure, rebuild
our economy, and create millions of jobs.  That’s the only piece he does
not want to see us fail to do as a country, and fail to do as,
hopefully, in a bipartisan manner, ideally.  
   
But in terms of the ideas being put forward, we’re quite open to a range
of mechanisms for agreed-upon legislation moving forward.  Smaller
packages, pieces being peeled off — right now there’s the nitty-gritty
work going on in Congress where members are meeting, staffs are meeting,
committee staff are meeting to discuss what’s possible, where there’s
agreement.  We welcome that.   
   
But, you know, in terms of what the package or size looks like, we’re —
we’re just not quite there yet.  
   
Q    On the Climate Summit, I know you don’t want to get ahead of the
decision on emissions targets for 2030, but broadly, how is the
administration thinking about striking the balance between a target
that’s aggressive and that will meet the needs of — the demands of
climate change, versus ones that may not be achievable and could lead to
job losses in the next 10 years?  How is the President looking to strike
that balance?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President believes that inv- — cli- — green jobs
are jobs, right?  I mean, they are a way to invest in our — and this is
very central to the American Jobs Plan.  And when we talk about the
Climate Summit and how we’re thinking about setting these targets and
how we’re going to achieve them, a big part of that is investing in
areas of our economy where there are industries of the future — where we
can create and build out industries, and create jobs where we’re also
able to meet our targets that we’ll set.  
   
So, he thinks of them as in lockstep.  And that’s one of the reasons
why, when he put out his climate plan during the campaign, he had labor
leaders and climate advocates meet together and discuss how we could
work together on a path forward.   
   
But, you know, if you look at areas like electric vehicles or, you know,
re- — weatherizing infrastructure, these are areas where there — there’s
alignment on — they’re creating jobs, they’re investing in industries,
they’re putting people back to work, and they’re also doing it in a way
that is, you know, helping us reach our climate targets.  
   
Q    Can I just do one more?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    Just to follow Nancy’s question: You know, you mentioned the Office
of Refugee Resettlement, that — that it’s exhausted its funding.  Do you
expect the administration to ask for some type of supplemental for that
office in the next few weeks to help them meet their demands?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say the first step — there are some considerations
of reprogramming funding, which is, of course, a factor internally.  But
I’m not aware of an intention to request additional funding.  I can — I
can check and see.  Obviously, we’ll put out our budget that is
forward-looking in May.   
   
But in terms of — I think, you’re asking about an emergency supplemental
— I’m not aware of that consideration, but I’ll check on that for you
and others who, I’m sure, are interested.  
   
Q    Jen, can I jump in real quick?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Are we still on track for the one o’clock presidential meeting? 
The pool call?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, yes.   
   
Q    Okay, so you —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  We’re almost wrapped here.  Let’s just go to one in
the back, go ahead.  Sorry, we —  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I was not paying attention to the time.  Thank you for the
reminder.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just a couple quick ones.  On Johnson & Johnson: Between the pause
and then the issues at the Baltimore plant, is — is the administration
still expecting Johnson & Johnson to be on track to deliver its promised
amount of doses by the end of the month?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the next step with Johnson & Johnson is for
the FDA to meet and determine what the considerations are for the path
forward.  As we look at our own preparedness here, we have ordered
enough supply to ensure we can meet the demand by the end of May and
have enough supply to vaccinate every adult American by the end of July
without Johnson & Johnson.  So that’s where our objective and our focus
remains.   
   
Pfizer has also announced that they are going to try to expedite some of
their production as well.  But in terms of Johnson & Johnson, the next
step is really Friday and whatever comes from there.  And we certainly
will refer to the FDA.   
   
I’m sorry.  We have to wrap up because you guys are gathering in about
30 seconds here.  But thank you everyone so much.   
   
1:00 P.M. EDT
