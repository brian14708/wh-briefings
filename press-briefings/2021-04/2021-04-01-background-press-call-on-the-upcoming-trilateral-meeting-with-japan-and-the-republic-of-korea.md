 4:20 P.M. EDT  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone,
and thank you for joining us.  A reminder that today’s call will be on
background, attributed to a senior administration official.  The
contents of this call will be embargoed until 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time
tonight.  
   
Our speaker today is \[senior administration official\].  We’ll have
some opening remarks at the top, and then we’re happy to turn it over
for a few questions.  
   
Over to you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  And thanks, guys, for your
patience.  And I’ll try to just give you guys a little bit of an
overview of what we’re expecting in terms of next steps in some
diplomacy.  
   
Tomorrow, Jake Sullivan, our National Security Advisor, will welcome the
National Security Secretary, Secretary Kitamura, of Japan and National
Security Advisor Hoon of the Republic of Korea for a trilateral
dialogue.  And we’re going to host that at the Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Maryland.  And we’ve been preparing for this session for some
time.  
   
This meeting — it, you know, obviously follows on from the trips of
Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defense Austin to Japan and
the Republic of Korea for reciprocal two-plus-two meetings — so-called
“two-plus-two” meetings — in both countries.  
   
This is our first trilateral meeting among the three countries, and we
believe that this partnership is increasingly important in a complex
environment in the Indo-Pacific going forward.  
   
We have a number of topics that we’re going to want to discuss over the
course of a full day.  And I want to say that not only will we have
trilateral sessions and participants will have a chance to meet some of
the cadets — and we’ve got cadets, I believe, from Japan and, I believe,
from South Korea.  And there’ll be an opportunity to engage with some of
the naval personnel.  
   
We’ll also have an opportunity for bilateral meetings between each of
the countries to ensure that we’re on the same page on the issues that
we’re dealing with.  I expect us to talk primarily on issues associated
with the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. 
We’re going to talk about respective views and efforts to address the
COVID-19 pandemic.  And we’ll obviously talk about next steps associated
with climate change.  
   
As I indicated, this is the first meeting of its kind — trilateral
meeting — of the Biden administration, and it follows on a number of
diplomatic steps that we’ve sought to take since assuming power in
January.  
   
We’ve already talked about many of these, but, more recently, we had an
intensive discussion this week between the United States and NATO about
shared perspectives and areas that we can potentially work together on
out-of-area challenges in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.  
   
I think the most important reason for this trilateral is it will give
Jake and our team the opportunity to review and discuss our policy
review on North Korea.  And I think, as you all know, it’s in its final
stages.  We’ve — we’ve done extensive consultations both across the U.S.
government, in Congress.  We’ve consulted previous individuals and teams
that have been involved in diplomacy with North Korea.  And we’re
prepared to now have some final consultations with Japan and South Korea
as we go forward.  
   
I think it’d be fair to say that each of these countries are intensively
interested in our planned way forward, and we intend to discuss that in
some detail.   
   
In addition to North Korea, I think we will also discuss other strategic
and regional and economic goals.  We’re going to talk extensively on
technology, including on semiconductors, supply chains, and
biotechnology.  
   
I think it’d be fair to say that our three countries hold many of the
keys to the future of semiconductor manufacturing technology.  And we
will seek to affirm the importance of keeping these sensitive supply
chains secure while also working together to uphold upcoming norms and
standards discussions.  
   
We’ll also have discussions about next steps, as I indicated, on
COVID-19 and the summit next month here in Washington — I guess, later
this month — that Secretary — President Biden and Secretary Kerry will
hold on climate.  And both Japan and South Korea have been invited to
that.  And we’ll discuss those issues in some detail.  
   
Obviously, we’ll talk about other regional issues: the very serious
concerns, collectively, we all have on the tragic developments in
Myanmar; concerns about broader regional security issues in the South
China Sea and elsewhere.  And we’re looking — we’ll look forward to
taking steps to advance our trilateral cooperation as we go forward.   
   
Why don’t I stop there, and I’m happy to take some questions.  Thank
you.  
   
Q    Thank you for doing this call.  Two quick questions.  You talked
about how this is, you know, obviously going to be very focused on North
Korea, and you guys are, you know, in the final stages of conducting
that policy review.  Is it fair to say that this will be the final
meeting with U.S. allies before the administration rolls out that
policy?   
   
And then my second question is just with regard to the Singapore
Declaration.  Does any of that still stand?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thank you, Kylie.  Good
questions.  First of all, I would say that I — we don’t view this, in
any way, as a kind of final meeting in the United States then departs on
to engage without partnership.  
   
We believe that this is an iterative process that we will be working
constantly as we go forward with both Japan and South Korea on shared
goals of denuclearization and reducing tensions and the like across the
Korean Peninsula and Asia more directly.  So I’d view this as part of a
process and not as an end result.   
   
And we, you know, take note of your question generally.   The report
does go into detail about how we intend to go forward.  I think I’d
leave some of those details — or I understand the significance of the
Singapore Agreement, and we’ll have more to say about the next couple of
days.  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
Q    Thank you for taking my call.  I just have a quick question.  Is
there going to be any kind of joint statement or press availability
following the meeting tomorrow?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think — I think this will be a
private meeting.  I do not believe there will be a press availability
after.  We’re — we’ll be in — we’ll be in — the area, which is closed
down — it’s, you know, COVID-controlled around the academy.  And I think
it was agreed that we will basically conduct these discussions
privately.   
   
Q    Hello, thank you for taking my call.  I have three questions to
ask.  As you mentioned that you — the talks will focus on North Korea
policy, I wondered whether there will be a slogan or a short outcome
explanation on tomorrow’s meeting.   
   
And, as for the topic, would the discussion, kind of, take part by a
distinguishing topic, such as North Korea, human rights, and
denuclearization?   
   
And my third question is: Currently, Korea is discussing whether Biden
administration’s North Korea policy will be focused on engagement or
sanctions or other pressure options, and we really would like to balance
this.  So, will we be able to picture the — how the proportion of
engagement and pressure will be after this discussion?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, thank you for the very detailed
question.  Let me take the second one first.  And I think our intention
is to discuss every aspect of North Korea policy — protect — prospective
arenas of diplomacy, nonproliferation issues.  We will probably review
some of the recent missile provocations that we have seen.  We’ll talk
about the domestic circumstances in North Korea — what we’ve seen in
terms of COVID response — and some of the diplomacy of late that we’ve
seen, particularly between China and North Korea.   
   
So I think our intent is to have a deep review that will inform our
process forward with respect to the review more generally.   
   
I don’t think there will be any — somehow, you know, sort of, a
nameplate or a title coming out of the meeting tomorrow.  I think the
primary goal is to ensure that we have a deep, shared understanding of
circumstances that are taking place on the peninsula in North Korea —
that our goals and assessments of what we want to achieve are in
alignment — and that’s of critical importance — and also for us to brief
both teams on what we believe are the essential elements of our strategy
going forward.  
   
So I don’t think it can be easily condensed into a headline, but our
hope will be that they will see the work that has gone into the overall
effort.  
   
And then, your third question — can you repeat that again?  I’m sorry. 
I got the first two.  
   
Q    Would you be able to picture the proportion of engagement and
pressure after this discussion?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think — I think all sides will have a
sense of what we’re contemplating in terms of the way forward.  And
again, I think I’ll just leave it at that at this juncture.  
   
We also want to make clear that, although these are some preliminary
findings, this is the most senior consultation we’ve had with Japanese
and South Korean friends.  And so we are very much open and prepared and
engaged to take that feedback.   
   
And so this is not going to be a one-way conversation.  I anticipate
this being more of a dialogue in which we’ll get feedback and
suggestions and iterations on the process.  And again, this is not the
end.  This is more of a beginning as we go forward.  
   
Anything that we do with respect to North Korea, we believe we need to
do in partnership and in harmony with Japan and South Korea.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you for doing this.  So, I have two questions.  First is:
You mentioned in the trilateral tomorrow that COVID-19 will, of course,
be one of the topics.  So will the discussion of South Korea join the
Quad’s effort to push for vaccine production distribution in the meeting
as well? 

And second question is: I’m assuming China offers North Korea their
vaccine, but maybe North Korea would consider, United States always say,
a safer and more effective option.  Will that be a leverage for the
Biden administration’s engagement with North Korea?  I mean the vaccine.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, look, on the — on the second
question, I think the President and other senior representatives in the
U.S. government have made clear that our primary mission right now is to
ensure that the U.S. population is vaccinated and that we are also
beginning to work closely with partners and others.  And that’s a
critical matter going forward. 

I don’t think I have anything further to add with respect to possible
engagement on health-related issues in North Korea.  I think at this
juncture, I would view that as premature. 

And — but I think we’re also interested to hear what are the assessments
about the nature of COVID-19 in North Korea.  Some reports indicate the
country is in a state of virtual lockdown.  And I think we will want to
assess what is the impact that is having on the economy, on the
leadership, on its thinking about the outside world.  And that will be
important going forward.

Can I ask you to, again — sorry, I’m getting so bad at the multiple
questions.  What was your fir- — I think that was the second question. 
Can you repeat the first one very quickly?  And I apologize — I should
be writing these down.

Q    Of course.  So the first question is, we know Japan —

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, on the Quad, yes.  Yeah.   
So, look — so the Quad is an informal grouping, and it’s an open
architecture.  And it is an attempt to gather together like-minded
states that have an interest in maintaining and supporting a free and
open Indo-Pacific. 

We’ve had very close consultations with Korean friends.  We’ve made
clear that there might be opportunities for unofficial engagement in a
number of initiatives we’ve launched: as you know, working groups on
technology; we’re working closely on a COVID plan to deliver up to a
billion doses to Southeast Asia.  And we would welcome at any point a
closer consultation and engagement with South Korean friends in the
process.

Q    Thank you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, I think that’s it.  Thank
you, everyone, for joining us today.  A friendly reminder that this call
was on background, attributed to SAOs, and that the contents are
embargoed until 9:00 p.m. tonight.  Thanks, everyone.  And have a good
evening.
