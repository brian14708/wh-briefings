James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:23 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hello, everyone.  Okay, happy Monday.  I know we have a busy
afternoon for all of you, so we will try to get through as many
questions as we can possibly get through.  I just have two items for you
at the top.  
   
This morning, the White House — we released 50 state-by-state
factsheets, in addition to factsheets for Puerto Rico and the District
of Columbia, laying out the critical necessity of passing the American
Jobs Plan so we can invest in vital infrastructure, create good-paying
jobs, and grow our economy.  
   
On the screens behind me, you’ll see some of the needs outlined and the
tangible difference the Jobs Plan will make in improving the lives of
Americans.  
   
So, just to — for a few highlights here: From 2010 to 2020, Florida has
experienced 22 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $100
billion in damages.  The President is calling for $50 billion to improve
the resiliency of our infrastructure.  Of course, there are many states
across the country that have had weather events and have been impacted,
but this is just one of the examples.  
   
In Michigan, there are more than 1,200 bridges and over 7,300 miles of
highway in poor condition.  That’s clearly an area that could benefit
from funding, including the $115 billion repairing — for repairing roads
and bridges in the plan.  
   
In South Dakota, 13 percent of South Dakotans do not have access to
acceptable broadband speeds.  That’s something we’d love to improve —
why there’s $100 billion to propose — to bring universal, reliable,
high-speed, and affordable coverage to every family.  
   
And in Nevada, finally, 243,000 renters spend more than 30 percent of
their income on rent — one of the reasons we’ve proposed — the President
has proposed investing over $200 billion to increase housing supply.  
   
So these are — they’re state-by-state.  You should all have them.  But
what they really do is identify the needs in these states and how this
package could be — could benefit.  As we’ve talked about a bit in here,
there are different types of funding for infrastructure that would be
worked through with Congress as the discussions proceed.  
   
Finally, I also wanted to highlight a significant win for American
workers in the American auto industry over the weekend — late Saturday
night into Sunday morning.  
   
As you know, a key part of the President’s Build Back Better plan
includes a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles and
batteries built here in America.  We need a strong, diversified, and
resilient U.S.-based electric vehicle battery supply chain so we can
meet the growing global demand for these vehicles and components.  
   
And the settlement we announced over the weekend — or, I should say, it
was announced by USTR and others, by SK Innovation and LG is a positive
step that builds confidence in their reliability and responsibility as
suppliers to the U.S. auto industry.  
   
It’s great news for many people in the country, including people of
Georgia and other states that are impacted a great deal by this issue.  
   
With that, Alex, kick us off.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to ask about the attack on Iran’s Natanz
nuclear facility.  Is there concern within the White House that this
will derail ongoing talks to reestablish the Iran nuclear deal?  
   
And has there been any effort by the administration to reach out through
intermediaries or any other way to Tehran and make clear that the U.S.
wasn’t involved in these attacks — or in the attack?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I — we, of course, have seen the reports of the
incident at the Natanz enrichment facility.  The U.S. was not involved
in any manner.  We have nothing to add on speculation about the causes
or the impacts.  
   
I will say, on your first question, though: We are focused on the
discussions that we expect to proceed this Wednesday in Vienna, to — the
diplomatic discussions that are — that have been taking place and took
place last week.  They were — we expect them to be difficult and long. 
We have not been given any indication about a change in participation
for these discussions.  
   
Q    And then, with respect to the Semiconductor Summit, are there any
actions the White House or the federal government can take immediately
to address the chip shortage?  Or, you know, is this just the kind of
thing that you need reforms and more funding for?  And then, does the
President see the shortage as a national security issue?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We certainly do.  I will say there are a number of steps
that we believe we can take as a federal government.  We believe there
needs to be a holistic, long-term, across- government approach.  
   
In the near term, we’re engaging with industry — as is evidenced by the
meeting that’s taking place shortly later this afternoon — as well as
our international partners to ensure that American companies are
operating on an even playing field.   
   
Even before this global — this meeting today, I should say, we have also
proposed major investments.  That’s something we feel the federal
government could also do.  We’ve proposed — we’ve called on Congress to
invest $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research, as
called for in the bipartisanship CHIPS Act.   
   
We have also called for additional funding.  There’s also bipartisan
proposals, I should say, like an investment of $50 billion in the
National Science Foundation, which would create a techno- — technology
directorate that will focus on fields like semiconductors and advanced
computing to help increase our competitiveness at home.   
   
So, our view is that this is certainly something where we need to work
closely with industry; we need to work closely with Congress — Democrats
and Republicans — there’s agreement on this issue being one that’s
impacting industries across the country; also with allies and partners
on how we can prevent the shortage from happening in the future.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Just to follow up on the chip shortage and, sort
of, short-term solutions —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    — any — any conversations, perhaps with chip manufacturers — like,
for example, Samsung — to prioritize U.S. orders for automakers?  Or,
you know, any thoughts on perhaps getting rid of regulations that will
help kick in supplies for automakers?  Any sense of what you can do
now?  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, one of the reasons the President is stopping by this
meeting that our National Security Advisor and our NEC Director are
holding this afternoon is to hear directly from companies about the
impacts — what would help the most through this period of time and this
shortage that, as you all have reported on, has impacted a range of
industries across the country.   
   
So, this isn’t a meeting where we expect a decision or an announcement
to come out of, but part of our ongoing engagement and discussion about
how to best address this issue over the long term but also over the
short term.   
   
Q    Okay.  And a couple of questions on immigration.  We understand
that there was an agreement with Honduras, Mexico, and Guatemala to
place more troops at the border.  And we understand that the Vice
President was able to secure these commitments and have seen some
numbers on, you know, how many troops will be placed at these borders.  
   
But when were these — when were these agreements struck?  And if you can
just give us any sense of what this plan really entails.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there have been a series of bilateral discussions
between our leadership and the regional governments of Mexico, Honduras,
and Guatemala.  Through those discussions, there was a commitment, as
you mentioned, to increase border security.   
   
So, Mexico made the decision to maintain 10,000 troops at its southern
border, resulting in twice as many daily migrant interdictions. 
Guatemala surged 1,500 police and military personnel to its southern
border with Honduras and agreed to set up 12 checkpoints along the
migratory route.  Honduras surged 7,000 police and military to disperse
a large contingent of migrants.  
   
As with any diplomatic discussion, these discussions happen at several
levels.  And certainly, as you know, we have an envoy who has
discussions with the region.  We’ve had Roberta Jacobson working for a
period of time to help have these discussions with the region about what
steps can be taken to help reduce the number of migrants who are coming
to the U.S.-Mexico border.  
   
Q    So, fair to characterize it as: These agreements were struck
recently — I mean, and in the past few weeks?  Would it be fair to say
that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think that’s — that’s fair to say, but I would also say
that they — often these discussions are ongoing over a period of time
and take place at several levels of the government, both here and within
these countries.  
   
Q    And is the plan to, sort of, apprehend these migrants who were
trying to cross the border or, sort of, as they’re already on their way
to the United States?  Is the plan to sort of, you know, stop them
there?  How will this work?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You’d have to speak with these countries about how they will
be implementing.  I think the objective is to make it more difficult to
make the journey and make crossing the borders more — more difficult.   
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Kelly.  
   
Q    On Minnesota and another officer-involved shooting that resulted in
the death of an African American man: Has the White House been in touch
with Governor Walz?  Or are there any resources from the federal
government that are being offered?  
   
And this comes at a time when, obviously, the Chauvin trial is
progressing.  Is there a federal plan for when that trial reaches its
conclusion, whatever the outcome may be?  
   
And thirdly — I’m racing through them because we’re short on time today
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    The President had promised, as a candidate, a police commission
that Dr. Rice says will not go forward at this time.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    It seems, obviously, that officer-involved interactions with the
public are intensely important at the moment.  So, first, on Minnesota —
and if you could address the police commission not going forward.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Sure.  And just check me if I don’t get to all of
your questions; I will try to do my best.   
   
Let me first say that we are incredibly saddened.  We were incredibly
saddened to hear about the loss of life at the hands of law enforcement
in Minnesota yesterday.  The President has, of course, been briefed.  He
will have a few words he will share at the top of the semiconductor
event that will be starting shortly.  Hence, we’ll be moving through our
questions here about his own thoughts.   
   
We are also in touch with the governor, in touch with the mayor, in
touch with local enforcement — law enforcement authorities as well.   
   
I would say it is a reminder of the pain, the anger, the trauma, the
exhaustion that many communities across the country have felt as we see
these incidents continue to occur within just a few miles of where the
tragic events happened just a year ago.  
   
In terms of the police commission, we have been in very close contact
over the course of several months — back to the transition — with both
civil rights activists, with law enforcement authorities and the law
enforcement community about what would be most effective moving
forward.   
   
And as Dr. Rice conveyed — or I think the statement we put out, I should
say, conveyed, we have made a decision, in coordination, that the best
path forward is to work to the past — to pass the George Floyd Policing
Act; that that has a great deal of the content of the policy changes, of
the necessary reforms that we would all like to see in place.  So that
was a collective decision, and that’s where our focus will be.   
   
Q    And is this a delay, or do you expect it to just not go forward at
all?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we expect, for the time being, for our focus to be on
moving the legislation forward and not on the policing commission.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On that, you mentioned, you know, the focus is now on passing the
George Floyd Policing Act.  It’s been over a month since we’ve heard the
President talk about this though.  We haven’t seen a big push, at least
not publicly, from this administration.  What kind of steps are you
taking to pressure Congress on this?  And should we expect to see this,
sort of, rise on the list of your priorities?  You obviously have a very
full plate.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We do.  But I would say that the President was addressing
racial equity, ensuring that we are putting in place long-overdue
reforms.  Real change is a priority for him.  It is something he looks
forward to continuing to discuss with members of Congress.  He believes
that there is a path forward, that this piece of legislation offers that
path forward, and he certainly will use the power of his presidency to
move it forward.  
   
Q    And you mentioned that civil rights groups recommended against this
commission.  Did they put forth other recommendations — steps that the
White House can take while you try and pressure Congress and wait and
hope that the Senate will act on them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we, of course, are in very close touch with them.  I
think what is in — I should say, more specifically, we’ve been in touch
with a range of groups, including the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; the
Leadership Congr- — Conference — I’m sorry; as well as leading experts. 
And the strong consensus from all of these groups is that the work
should be focused on trying to pass the George Floyd Act, and the
commission would not be the most constructive way to deliver on our top
priority.  
   
So we are working together collectively to do exactly that.  There are
steps that we certainly will work in conjunction to take as they are
possible.  And some of them we’ve signed through executive orders, and
we’ll continue to communicate with these groups about what is most
effective.  
   
Q    Just quickly, on infrastructure: The President is having this
bipartisan meeting today, but what is your message to some congressional
Republicans who have expressed skepticism about whether the White House
is authentically interested in negotiating here, given how things played
out with the COVID relief bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that the President — you don’t use the
President of the United States’ time multiple times over, including two
infrastructure meetings — bipartisan infrastructure meetings he’s
already had — or the meeting today, if he did not want to authentically
hear from the members attending about their ideas about how to move
forward this package in a bipartisan manner.  
   
Q    So is he willing to negotiate on the scope and the price tag or
just on ways to pay for this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He absolutely is.  He looks forward to hearing their ideas. 
And his objective is to find a way forward where we can modernize our
nation’s infrastructure so we can compete with China.  He’s proposed a
way to pay for it, which is what he thinks the responsible thing is to
do, and he hopes they’ll come to the table with ideas.  
   
Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    If I could ask for an update.  On March 18th, you said that there
was a stockpile of 7 million AstraZeneca doses, some of which were
loaned to the Canadians and Mexicans.  Can you give us a current number
and say whether the President is considering sending more either to
those countries or other countries?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to predict in terms of sharing the
stockpile at this point.  I can assure you that we don’t want that
stockpile to expire, and obviously, we don’t have control over the FDA
approval process.  But I don’t have anything more to preview for you at
this point.  
   
Q    Do you know when the first May doses that are in that stockpile
would expire?  How much (inaudible) is there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy — I’m happy to check for you, Josh, and see if
there’s more we can share.  And AstraZeneca themselves, of course, could
share more details probably.  
   
Q    Does the White House know whether any U.S.-made shots have left
U.S. soil, other than those loans?  In other words, shots made on U.S.
soil but not for the U.S. government.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  From the companies?  
   
Q    Yeah, correct.  So, can the companies sell, export currently as
long as they’re meeting the U.S. obligations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think that’s a question about their contracts.  Obviously,
we — and we’ve had this discussion before — there’s an obligation, under
certain contracts, to deliver on the commitments made in the contract
with the U.S. government, especially when the Defense Production Act has
been invoked.  But I would send you to the companies for that
question.  
   
Q    Okay.  Can I ask just a couple of personnel things?  You mentioned
Roberta Jacobson.  Why did she make the decision to step down from that
post?  And can you say whether it’s accurate that Cindy McCain is being
considered for the U.N. food ambassador program post?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  On the first, I would say it was always Ambassador
Jacobson’s intention to stay for about 100 days.  She’s been a diplomat
serving in a range of roles around the world — from Ambassador to
Mexico, to Assistant Secretary for WHA — for decades.  And she is
retiring, as she deserves — as she has certainly done her — paid her
time to do, and so that was always her intention, to stay for a period
of time.   
   
In that period of time, of course, we have also announced the naming of
an envoy, Ricardo Zuñiga, who has played a prominent role in the Western
Hemisphere in the past for the U.S. government.  He’ll be playing that
role.  The President has asked the Vice President to play an elevated
role in engagements, in negotiations with the Northern Triangle, hence
our earlier discussion about her role there and the path forward
there.  
   
So there are a range of officials who will continue to do this work.  We
were fortunate to have the work and the expertise and experience of
Ambassador Jacobson as long as we have.  
   
Q    And on Cindy McCain?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There is an ongoing process on ambassadors.  I know that
there’s a lot of eager — eagerness and interest in learning more.  It’s
ongoing.  The President has not made the decision about the majo- — vast
majority of his ambassadorial nominations.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  President Biden has made very clear that two of his
top priorities for the infrastructure plan is to create jobs and to
stimulate the economy.  Last night, on “60 Minutes,” Jerome Powell said
he and other forecasters already see that happening.  So I wonder if the
optimistic outlook changes the President’s priorities and the plan at
all, and offers more wiggle room for negotiation in certain areas.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Do you mean to — to — we don’t need as many jobs?  Do you
—  
   
Q    I mean, you know, the goal of the plan is to create jobs and
stimulate the economy, and they’re saying that’s already happening,
which is a great thing.  So is he willing to scale back on some of these
items?  Because we’re already seeing growth.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well I — I, unfortunately — I regularly watch “60 Minutes.” 
I did not see the whole episode, so I don’t know the whole context of
his remarks.  But I will say that part of what economists feel is that
we are still behind, that we need to still do more.  Because if you look
at our last jobs report, it was — we were still about 8.4 million jobs
in the red, you know, that we needed to create, that we needed to — you
know, Americans we needed to put back to work.  There are still parts of
the American population — high levels of unemployment among African
Americans, Latino Americans, Asian Americans that we need to work to
address.  
   
This is definitely a jobs package, hence the American Jobs Plan, but
what it also does is it helps modernize, invest in our nation’s
infrastructure, and do that in a way that will help us compete over the
long term and help us have jobs for the future.  
   
So there are many objectives of this package, but certainly we feel
there is more work to be done to put more Americans back to work, and we
are not in the clear on that front.  
   
Q    Thank you.  And on the state-by-state factsheets that you released
this morning, can you just share how that process happened, including
who was involved in putting together the state-by-state report and what
the metrics were to assign that, you know, final grade for each state?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s — it was done by a collection of smart and
brilliant people on our economic team that you probably wouldn’t
necessarily identify on the street, but sounds like a good profile piece
to me.   
   
But, you know, they work to identify what the needs are in the states. 
I don’t know that I have the exact process to outline for you, but maybe
you can —  
   
Q    But, I mean, did they work with state officials and local
departments, as well, to decide what each state needed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What the needs are?  I’m happy to check and see if there’s
more about the process that we can share.   
   
Q    Okay, great.   Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yes, you talked about paying for the infrastructure bill.  Is the
President set on raising the corporate tax rate as the way to do that,
even though Republicans are saying it’s a red line?  Or is that also
open to negotiation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s op- — it’s all open to negotiation.  But I will say
that raising — having corporations pay more, pay their fair share;
raising the rate to a rate that is still lower than it has been — aside
from a few years, since World War Two — the President feels is an
entirely reasonable, appropriate, effective way to pay for this
package.  
   
There are other proposals that have been put out there, including user
fees.  The President doesn’t feel that we should pay for this package on
the backs of the American people, but he’s certainly eager to hear ideas
from Democrats and Republicans on alternatives.  
   
Q    And then, Senator John Cornyn called Joe Biden’s tweets
“unimaginably conventional” and said that his comments were “largely
scripted,” and questioned whether he was really in charge.  Does the
White House have any reaction to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can confirm that the President of the United States
does not spend his time tweeting conspiracy theories.  He spends his
time working on behalf of the American people.   
   
Go ahead.  Oh, go ahead.  Oh, Josh, you went.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Oh, me?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep, go ahead.  
   
Q    Great.  Thanks, Jen.  So just to piggyback off — on the corporate
tax rate —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    — Senator Manchin said that he only supports raising it to 25
percent — that that’s his line in the sand.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    What’s the White House response to that?  And has the President or
Secretary Buttigieg spoken to Manchin about the corporate tax
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we are in regular touch with a range of officials,
senators, members of Congress.  There have been dozens and dozens of
meetings and briefings.  I don’t have a specific readout of our
engagements with Senator Manchin.  I’m sure he could share that with all
of you.   
   
But I would say that we’re certainly encouraged to hear that Senator
Manchin is open to raising the corporate tax rate as a means of
potentially paying for a historic investment in our nation’s
infrastructure and, most importantly, to creating jobs.   
   
And the President is happy to hear ideas or alternatives for how this
plan and package could — should be paid for.  His primary focus is on
this investment; on creating jobs; on helping put back to work the
millions of men and women who don’t have college degrees; on ensuring
we’re evening the playing field, on doing what we can to compete with
China over the long term.  
   
There are disagreements about how to pay for it.  We’re happy to have a
discussion about that.  
   
Q    And then, two more, quickly.  There appears to be a large
deployment of Russian land forces towards the border with Ukraine.  What
is the administration prepared to do if Russia moves to invade eastern
Ukraine?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say we are concerned, as I’ve said in
the past — but we’ve been, of course, watching it over the course of the
weekend — about the increasing aggression of Russian forces on the
border.   
   
Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin are in Brussels this week,
meeting with their NATO partners, and we will, of course — I’m sure this
will be a topic of discussion.  We also remain in touch with Ukrainian
officials at a range of levels.  But I’m not going to get ahead of their
discussions that they’re having on the ground.  
   
Q    And then, just on police reform again: The — you mentioned on
Friday that the President is meeting with the CDC tomorrow.  Is police
reform going to be the topic of discussion?  Criminal justice reform? 
What exactly will they be discussing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sure there’ll be a range of issues discussed.  The
primary purpose from our perspective is to discuss the American Jobs
Plan and how to move that forward.  But as is always the case, there
will be a range of topics we expect discussed during the meeting.   
   
Q    Do we have to gather in —  
   
Q    12:45.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think it’s one o’clock.  
   
AIDE:  12:55 is when —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  12:55.  Okay.  Ten more minutes.  Alex is so responsible for
keeping track.  (Laughter.)  She — she is.  
   
Q    Got to keep it rolling.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    When can we expect to see the President announce the American
Family Plan?  That was supposed to be coming soon.  When should we look
for that?  
   
Also, there’s some talk about making the expanded childcare tax credit
permanent.  Is the administration looking at extending it or making it
permanent at this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, the President believes there’s a hugely ben- — huge
benefits of the Child Tax Credit.  That’s why he put the Child Tax
Credit in his — in his ARP, American Rescue Plan, because he feels it’s
important, it’s vital, it will help get the 2 million women who are out
of work, back to work — hopefully back into the workforce.  
   
Expect you’ll hear more on the American Families Plan in the coming
weeks, but I don’t have an exact date for you quite yet.   
   
Q    And nothing on whether or not the administration is considering
making it permanent or just extending it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything more to preview for you on the
American Families Plan, although, just to reiterate, the President
believes the Child Tax Credit is a way to help American families and
especially all of the working moms out there who are trying to make ends
meet.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Me?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, go ahead.  
   
Q    So, I want to follow up on a question I asked, I feel like it’s a
month ago now.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It may have been.  
   
Q    The New York Times, last week, came out with a story that
Mississippi was having a hard time getting folks vaccinated.  But it’s
not just Mississippi; it’s a bunch of other rural states — Ohio,
Oklahoma.  They’re at 34 percent vaccination rate.   
   
Even so, opening up vaccines to out-of-staters — I know we talked a
little bit about before —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — the preliminary steps — but has the White House been in touch
with these governors to see what they can do now?  Because, of course,
this impacts herd immunity and the goals of the White House just to get
these shots in arms.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there are a number of steps that we’ve taken in the
recent weeks, including launching the Community Corps, which is our
program to provide fact-based messages into the hands of local
messengers.  
   
So we’ve now — we’re now working with more than 4,000 organizations that
have signed up so far across the country, including in a number of the
states that you mentioned.   
   
We’re also investing $3 billion to states and community-based
organizations to strengthen vaccine confidence in the highest-risk and
hardest-hit communities.  And often, people think of that as just Black
and brown communities, and that is not.  As you’ve noted, that is also
conservative communities, white evangelicals.  It’s a range of
communities around the country.   
   
What we’ve found to be most effective is to work with these local
organizations — so, faith-based organizations, community health
organizations, civic leaders, and others who can really get this message
deeply in communities.   
   
We’ve also had a number of our members of our COVID team, from Dr. Fauci
and Fran- — and Dr. Collins — participate — as an example — participate
in a range of media interviews.  You know, an example is Dr. Collins
participated in “The 700 Club.”  Dr. Nunez-Smith hosted a faith leaders
roundtable.  We’re also looking for — we’ve run PSAs on “The Deadliest
Catch.”  We’re engaged with NASCAR and Country Music TV.  
   
We’re looking for a range of creative ways to get directly connected to
white conservative communities.  We won’t always be the best messengers,
but we’re still trying to meet people where they are but also empower
local organizations.  
   
Q    And just a quick follow-up: Do you — does the White House endorse
these states opening up their vaccines to folks from out of state?  You
know, these — these do expire, so rather than them sitting on the shelf,
they are going to go to somebody else.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, these states are all going to have their own
implementation plans, and we certainly work with them to advise how to
distribute the vaccines most — as equitably as possibly — as possible
and as effectively and efficiently around states.  
   
No state is 100 percent vaccinated, as — as we know.  So our focus has
been working with them on how to get them to the communities that are
the hardest hit.   
   
Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Sorry, go ahead.  And then we’ll go to you.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  So why hasn’t President Biden signed the presidential
determination that would lift former President Trump’s immigration
policies, including the 15,000-person refugee cap?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s an issue he remains committed to, as he announced.  I
just don’t have an update on the signing of the paperwork.   
   
Q    Okay.  And equity was cited as the reason for which the White House
decided against surging vaccines in Michigan.  The administration is
surging FEMA vaccinators.  What makes the vaccine different?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say, I think it’s important to understand how we’ve
approached vaccine distribution from the beginning.  It’s done with
equity in mind.  It’s done with the state — the population, the adult
population in mind.  
   
We don’t pick by our friends.  We don’t pick through a political prism. 
We pick through what is most effective to be fair and equitable around
the country.  
   
We also made an announcement during the transition that we were not
going to hold on to a big supply.  We distribute and get the supply out
as quickly as possible.  So that’s why our focus is on working with
states like Michigan to, you know, surge testing, surge tracing, surge
the distribution of therapeutics — areas where we have the ability to
provide additional help, additional resources.  But we’re not in a
place, nor will we be, where we take supply from one state to give it to
another.  
   
Q    Okay.  I see.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    To follow up on Brittany’s question about vaccines: Do you think
that the White House has had any part in this — in having, sort of,
maybe a pessimistic message towards some Americans who are skeptical of
this administration, who — for partisan reasons or otherwise — to see
vaccinated people in the Cabinet or the President continuing to wear
masks around each other, or hearing that things won’t be back to normal
as the vaccine continues to be distributed?  Do you think that that is
having a negative effect at all?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  On people — make sure I understand your question.  
   
Q    Of people who are skeptical.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  On people not taking the vaccine?  
   
Q    Yeah, of people who are skeptical of the vaccine and who don’t
trust the Biden administration.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, look, I think, one, we recognize we’re not always the
best messengers.  That’s why we’re working with these local
organizations and groups — because we certainly know that President
Biden and Vice President Harris may not be the right voices in a range
of communities across the country.   
   
Two, we believe that part of our objective is to model public health
guidelines, and that means continuing to wear masks, continuing to
handwash, social distance, because there is still ongoing research on
what is most effective and how to prevent distribution and it — the va-
— I’m sorry, the pandemic traveling further.  So I’m not sure I’m
understanding your question maybe.  
   
Q    The question is: How do you — how do you strike that balance
between being a model of the public health guidelines and also not
contributing to the sense of hopelessness, perhaps, among people who are
skeptical to take the vaccine and maybe feel like getting it would not
make a difference in their lives anyway?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Yeah, I think a big part of what we’re trying to do
is provide accurate information about what getting a vaccine will enable
the American people to do; hence, the President gave a primetime address
where he said, if when you get the vac- — if you — when the vaccine is
accessible to you and you get it, we can work towards having backyard
barbecues.  
   
He — we’ve also had a number of officials out there to convey, and we’ve
had — obviously, the CDC has put out guidance that says, “If you’re
vaccinated, if your neighbors are vaccinated, you can have dinner inside
together.”  It’s a pandemic.  We don’t think it’s easy.  We know it’s
difficult.  It’s required a lot of sacrifice.  But at the same time,
we’re trying to provide accurate, public health-based guidance on what
people can do once they have taken the vaccine.   
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you very much, Jen.  Two East Asia questions, if I may.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    On John Kerry’s visit to — potential visit to Shanghai, what’s
President Biden’s expectation of them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of John Kerry’s visit?  
   
Q    Yeah, to Shanghai.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly he’ll be focused on discussing climate and
how we can work with leaders around the region to get control of our —
the climate crisis.  But I would send you to the State Department
because they — that’s where he works.  
   
Q  And also, on the chip summit: According to South Korea media, Korea
Economic Daily, quote, “Industry watchers said following this White
House meeting, Samsung may be forced to make the decision on its new
U.S. factory sooner and build a production line for automotive chips,
given the dire shortage of such chips in the \[United States\].”  What’s
the —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know — we’ll put out a readout after the meeting,
but the meeting — the purpose of the meeting is really to consult with
these business leaders about how we can help address the shortage.   
   
Let me just get around to the back, and then I know you have to gather
soon.  
   
Q    Quick follow-up.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    On Iran, immigration — (inaudible).  On Iran, the foreign minister
is vowing revenge against Israel for its alleged attack on its nuclear
facilities.  Israel has not denied this.  How concerned is the White
House, is the President, that the actions of an ally potentially may be
derailing efforts by the White House to get Iran back into compliance
under the JCPOA?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think I answered a version of this question earlier,
but let me try again.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) Israel we haven’t talked about (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, we’ve seen the reports.  We don’t have anything
more to speak to as it relates to the causes or who is responsible.  Our
focus is, of course, on the diplomatic path forward.  We have not been
given any indication that attendance at the discussions and the — that
will proceed on Wednesday has changed.  So that’s where our focus is.  
   
Q    But is there concern that the actions of an ally are derailing the
U.S. efforts?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think I’ve answered your question.  Did you have another
one?  
   
Q    I didn’t think it was an answer.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, I’m sorry to hear that.  I’ve answered it a couple
times.  
   
Q    Okay.  Let me just quickly follow and —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    — let me try on Ukraine.  The Secretary of State said that there
will be consequences if Russia continues its escalation on the border. 
Can you give us a sense of what those range of options are?  And then,
also, at what level does this escalation require President Biden to
reach out to Vladimir Putin?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that what we’ve long said is that there
will be some consequences that are seen and some that are unseen.  I’m
not going to give you a menu of the options.  When we’re ready to
announce them, we will announce them and share the details with all of
you.  
   
Q    And very quickly on immigration.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    With regard to the militarization of the borders in Central America
and the agreements that have been secured: Did the White House in any
way secure any — is the White House concerned, given the record number
of children that have been making this trek, that they are at greater
risk given the fact that these are soldiers, not daycare workers?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the objective is to deter — deter the
journey.  And so that’s why our discussions with these countries
involved increasing law enforcement capacity at the border.  
   
Q    But is there a worry though about, sort of, this increased
militarization, given (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I didn’t call it that.  Those are your words, not mine.   
   
Q    No, I’m asking.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are — we inc- — we worked with them to increase law
enforcement at the border to deter the travel, which is a treacherous
journey which — where many lose their lives.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we have to gather.  Thank — thank you so much.   
   
Q    Should we expect anything on Afghanistan this week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to preview for you on the timeline.   
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, thanks, everyone.
