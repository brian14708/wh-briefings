title: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Director of the National Economic
  Council Brian Deese, April 26, 2021

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

   
1:25 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Happy Monday.  
   
Q    Happy Monday.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Our special guest today is our Director of the
National Economic Council, Brian Deese.  And he will be — as you may
know, Brian was Senior Advisor to President Obama and previously served
as Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  And in the
Obama-Biden administration, Brian helped coordinate policy development
for tax policy, housing, clean energy, manufacturing, and the automotive
industry.   
   
Brian has agreed to come despite having the unenviable task of not being
able to roll out many details of our joint session speech or the
American Families Plan, but we still wanted to have him here to provide
some context on some of the questions you all had raised.  And he’ll
take — will only be able to take a couple of questions.   
   
But, with that, I’ll turn it over to Brian.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Thank you, Jen.  And it’s good to see you all again.  So I
wanted to just provide a little bit of context around, in particular,
capital gains taxes — and will provide just a little bit of context. 
And I’m happy to take a couple of questions.  
   
So, as you know and as Jen has spoken about, the President is excited
to, this week, lay out his plan to invest in American families.  It will
be a plan that will provide critical support for children and families
and, in — by doing so, critical support for our economy by boosting
labor force participation and future economic competitiveness, making it
among the most cost-effective measures to boost our long-term economic
strength that we know of.   
   
And the President will also outline ways to offset the long-term costs
of those investments by making reforms to our tax code that reward work
and not just wealth.   
   
And one element of this reform will be to change how we tax capital
gains.  And, as you all know, that’s income from selling stocks and
other assets for taxpayers that make more than $1 million per year in
income.   
   
So, I want to start by reinforcing who this change will actually
affect.  This change will affect taxpayers making more than a million
dollars a year.   
   
In 2018, three tenths of 1 percent of tax filers made more than a
million dollars a year.  So, I want to start by underscoring this in
simple terms: This change will only apply to three tenths of a percent
of taxpayers, which is not the top 1 percent; it’s not even the top one
half of 1 percent.  We’re talking about three tenths of a percent;
that’s about 500,000 households in the country that we’re talking
about.  
   
So, for the other 997 out of 1,000 households in the country — or the
other 150 million households in the country — this is not a change that
will be relevant.  It won’t change their — the tax treatment of capital
gains at all.   
   
And this makes sense because, for the typical Americans, most of their
income comes from wages.  So, for people making less than a hundred —
less than a million dollars a year, about 70 percent of their income
comes from wages.   
   
But for those making more than a million, for the top three tenths of a
percent, it’s the opposite: About 30 percent of their wages come from
wages.  And that’s probably actually an understatement since the
wealthiest can often strategically avoid reporting this type of income
entirely.  
   
And so, as a result, this is — this is the provision that, since 2000,
if you look at the 1,400 tax filers — those are people making over $60
million a year — that’s the — for those of you keeping track, that’s the
top one thousandth of 1 percent — they have only paid about 20 percent
of their reported income in taxes.  So, their tax rate, which probably
is overstated, again, because this is the category that often doesn’t
report or underreports income — their tax rate is lower than many
middle-class families’ tax rate.   
   
This is the dynamic that led Warren Buffett to famously explain that he
paid a lower tax rate than his secretary.  And it’s the — it is the
dynamic that has led the President and others to argue that we need to
do something about equalizing the taxation of work and wealth in this
country.   
   
And that’s why the reforms that the President will lay out are focused
on this top sliver of people and treating capital gains the same as
wages for that top three tenths of a percent.  And we believe that it’s
not only fair, but it would also help to reduce the kinds of tax
avoidance that significantly under- — undermines trust and fairness in
the tax code itself.  
   
And importantly, the revenue from this provision would invest dir- —
would help invest directly in our kids and our families and our future
economic competitiveness, and put us in a position where we can drive
greater economic growth.   
   
So we’ll — we’ll have more to say on this and how it fits into the
overall plan, but I just wanted to re- — underscore at the top that —
that, number one, we’re talking about a tax change that would affect,
again, the three tenths of 1 percent — the top sliver of households.  
   
And, number two, the principle here is to equalize the treatment of
ordinary income and capital gains, and that is a principle that’s
neither new nor particularly novel.  In fact, the last President to
enact a reform to equalize the treatment of ordinary income and capital
gains was President Reagan, who did so while raising capital gains taxes
as part of the 1986 Tax Reform.   
   
And, of course, we will be raising higher rates than in that reform, but
a lot has changed in the economy since then; a lot has changed in the
academic and empirical research in this space.  But the principle is the
same, which is that for the very highest income Americans, we should tax
at the same rate ordinary income and capital gains.   
   
So, with that, why don’t I pause and can take a couple of questions.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Josh.  
   
Q    Thanks so much for doing this, Brian.  Just to make sure I
understand this: Critics say that you tax capital gains at lower rates
to incentivize investments that help the economy grow.  Is the
administration’s perspective that, among these high earners, they have
not been making the investments to help the economy and that the
government programs can do it better?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, across a wide body of academic and empirical evidence,
there is no evidence of a significant impact of capital gains rates on
the level of long-term investment in the economy.  
   
If you look back over the last 30 or 40 years, we’ve had capital gains
rates at various rates; we’ve seen different levels of investment in
overall economic growth.  You can’t identify a meaningful correlation
between the two.  There’s lots of reasons for that, including that if
you look at where a lot of venture capital and early-stage investment
comes from, it actually comes from pension funds, sovereign wealth
funds, entities that actually are not tax-sensitive.  Also because, at
the — at the end of the day, a lot of things go into making an
investment decision.   
   
But certainly our view and reading of the evidence is that there is not
a — there’s not a correlation that would significantly affect investment
for these highest-income individuals, number one.  
   
And number two, we can use those resources to invest in areas that we
know where there is convincing academic evidence, empirical evidence
that investments — for example, in early childhood and in our children —
return enormous dividends, in terms of their own academic success,
reduced costs in healthcare system, productivity and growth in the
future.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Catherine.  
   
Q    Brian, one question on the Families Plan itself: Why isn’t the
White House including a plan to reduce the price of prescription drugs
in the plan?  
   
MR. DEESE:  The good news about a question like that is I get to tell
you that, since we haven’t rolled out the Families Plan yet and I’m not
going to do it at the podium right now, I am not going to confirm
whether or not that is — is in.  I can, you know, say that the President
has long focused on the issue of rising cost of prescription drugs for
American consumers and American families.  It’s something that he
continues to focus on and prioritize, but I’m going to let him speak to
those issues in the speech.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Andrea.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Brian, so, on the question of how you enact this: So, is it
— I mean, is this capital gains tax increase dead on arrival when it
comes to the Hill?  The Republicans are screaming that it is not a good
proposal.  There’s even some concerns in Democratic circles.  How do you
convince people that this makes sense?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I would say a couple of things to that.  The first is
on the — on the facts and on the evidence, to go to the conversation we
were just having, that we think that the best read of the — of the
evidence is actually that making this sort of change for that top, you
know, three tenths of a percent of taxpayers — equalizing ordinary
income and capital gains — is — would restore fairness, and do so in a
way that wouldn’t significantly affect investment and that would allow
us to make really high return investments, for which there’s been broad
bipartisan support.  So, we think that that’s a pretty sensible way of
going at it, number one.   
   
Number two, is: The President has said in the context of the Jobs Plan
and the Corporate Tax Reform Plan, and will say in the context of this
plan as well, he is laying out his Jobs Plan and his Families Plan.
 This is his vision for how we need to put in place a public adjust- —
investment agenda for the country.    
   
He is also identifying ways to responsibly pay for it, and he is
welcoming and encouraging others to come forward with their ideas as
well.   
   
Q    Are you going to need reconciliation to do this?   
   
MR. DEESE:  I think what you’re going to hear from the President is a
call to consider these investments and the potential that they would
provide for the country, and engage in a serious conversation about both
whether these investments are needed — and, if we can agree that they’re
needed, how we’re going to offset their cost.  He’s starting that
conversation where he believes is a responsible place to start: by
putting a plan on the table.  And we’ll take the conversation from
there.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Geoff.  
   
Q    I want to pick up on something you mentioned about investing in
kids and ask you about the Child Tax Credit — not specific to the
American Families Plan, but just in general.  Some of the President’s
Democratic allies on the Hill, as you well know, have pushed to make
that permanent.  They say they’ve faced some resistance and pushback
from the administration.   
   
What’s the argument against making it permanent?  Is it economic or is
it political, in that Democrats potentially might want to run on this in
2024 and, if you make it permanent, it robs Democrats of that
opportunity?   
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, let me start by making the argument for the expanded
and fully refundable Child Tax Credit, because it was President Biden
who put a temporary, one-year expansion of the Child Tax Credit in his
American Rescue Plan, which he announced on January 14th — seven days
before he was even inaugurated.  And it was President Biden who worked
with Congress and fought to get that enacted into law.   
   
And now, as a result, the American families — families with — of 66
million children will receive a fully refundable, expanded Child Tax
Credit this year, and that will be delivered monthly, going forward. 
And the best estimates are that that, in combination with the other
elements of the Rescue Plan, will reduce child poverty by 50 percent —
by about 50 percent this year.   
   
So President Biden is both incredibly proud of that accomplishment and
the — and the speed with which we were able to implement it, and
believes that we should extend that — that policy to provide some
certainty and stability to those families who will be relying on that
payment but would see it go away if Congress doesn’t act.   
   
So that’s the context for it, and I’ll let the President speak to the
specific plan in the joint session speech.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Brian has gone, already, way over the time allotted.  He
will come back, as will other people.  But Brian has got to go.  Sorry,
Brian.  Thank you for coming, and he’ll come back soon.  
   
MR. DEESE:  It’s always so much easier for me to play good cop.  Now I
realize why.  (Laughter.)  You know?  I’d take all your questions, but
Jen — (laughter).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s right.  Okay.  Come on back.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Oh, just do that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.) Right, exactly.  Well, there will be much more to
say when we roll out the speech.  Okay, a couple of items — additional
items for all of you at the top.   
   
Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Vilsack
announced the historic expansion of the Summer Pandemic EBT program. 
This is the single-largest summer child nutrition effort in our nation’s
history and will reach more than 30 million kids this summer thanks to
the American Rescue Plan.  
   
Summer feeding programs are considered a lifeline for some families, but
until now, they’ve reached less than 20 percent of families served
during the school year. Children are eligible for this program if
they’re eligible to receive free or reduced-price meals during the
school year or if they are under age six and live in a SNAP household.
That is about 34 million American children.   
   
Parents or guardians do not need to take any action to receive the cards
in the mail from their state agencies; each child will receive a $375
credit loaded onto an EBT card and can then — that they can — that can
then be used by parents or guardians to purchase food.   
   
Also today, President Biden will sign an executive order establishing
the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. This
Task Force is a historic effort to mobilize the federal government’s
programs, policies, and practices to empower workers to organize and
collectively bargain with their employers, and will have a specific
focus on increasing worker power in marginalized and underserved
communities.   
   
Vice President Harris will be Chair of the Task Force and Secretary of
Labor Marty Walsh will be the Vice Chair. The Task Force will include
more than 20 Cabinet members and department heads.  
   
Also, Vice President Harris — and will — will have a bilateral meeting
with the President of Guatemala this afternoon.  They’ll meet virtually
to discuss working together to address immediate relief needs of the
Guatemalan people, as well as deepening cooperation on migration.  The
Vice President will also participate in a roundtable with
representatives from the Guatemalan community-based organizations
tomorrow.  
   
Vice President Harris’s direct engagement is a testament to the
importance we are placing on improving conditions in Guatemala. When the
Vice President spoke last with the President of Guatemala on March 30th,
they agreed to collaborate on promoting economic development, leveraging
technology, strengthening climate resis- — resilience, and creating the
conditions to expand opportunity for people in their home countries in
order to address the root causes of migration.    
   
Finally, as you may have also seen: Today, we announced that the
administration is looking at options to share American-made AstraZeneca
vaccine doses during the next few months.  Given the strong portfolio of
vaccines that the United States has already authorized and available in
large quantity — and that is available in large quantities, including
two-do- — two two-dose vaccines and one one-dose vaccine, and given
AstraZeneca is not authorized for use in the United States, we do not
need to use AstraZeneca in our fight against COVID over the next few
months.   
   
Before any AstraZeneca doses are shipped from the United States, the FDA
will confirm any such doses meet its expectations for product quality. 
This is being done in the context of the FDA’s ongoing review of all
doses made at the plant where these AstraZeneca doses were produced.   
   
And I anticipate, in the near future, our team will share more details
about our planning and who will be receiving doses from here.  But we’re
in the planning process at this point in time.  
   
Josh, go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Let’s go to India and what they’re dealing with with
the coronavirus.  The President just spoke with the Prime Minister of
India: Can you give us some more details about that?  And in terms of
how many supplies: What all are we really going to rush out there? 
What’s the volume and the scale to deal with the problem?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, as Josh noted — you may have all seen the
readout that we just put out, but just in case you didn’t — the
President spoke today with Prime Minister Modi of India committing that
the United States and India will continue to work closely together in
the fight against COVID.  The President pledged America’s steadfast,
ongoing support for the people of India who have been impacted by the
recent surge in the COVID-19 cases.   
   
In respon- — and we have provided — and let me give you more of a
specific update, and I will also note for you that there’ll be an
additional call later this afternoon that will provide additional
details.  So this is just what is available at this point in time of
what is being requested and what we are providing.   
   
So there are a number of areas that ha- — are of great interest and are
of great need to India at this point in time; oxygen is one of them.  At
India’s request, the — we are exploring options to provide oxygen and
related supplies.  The Department of Defense and USAID are pursuing
options to provide oxygen generation systems.  We may be in a position
to reroute shipments planned for other countries with lower immediate
needs, given the urgency of the conditions in India.  And we’ll have
more details, hopefully, on the possibilities soon.   
   
DOD is also exploring providing field oxygen generation systems, which
we have used in our field medical hospitals.  Each unit can provide
oxygen for up to 50 to 100 beds.  And we’re also exploring options to
provide oxygen concentrators and ventilators, and are in technical
discussions with India to ensure the equipment we supply can connect to
Indian devices.   
   
The United States has already provided 200 ventilators to India last
year and trained medical professionals on their use, so this is, of
course, in addition to that and other assistance we’ve provided.   
   
Another one of the major needs is PPE, and we’ve identified U.S.
commercial suppliers as well, and — and I should say, “and therapeutics
and tests.”  But we’ve identified U.S. commercial suppliers of
remdesivir that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering
of COVID-19 patients in India.   
   
We’ve identified rapid diagnostic testing supplies, personal protective
equipment, and additional ventilators available to be transferred to
immedia- — into India immediately.   
   
And I noted, of course — we’re also, of course, are in close touch with
India officials at all levels about the raw material needs that they
have.  And as requested by India, we will provide raw materials for the
production of AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine at Serum Institute of
India.  
   
I know some of these have been announced, but that’s just a little bit
of additional details.  So we’re in ongoing discussions about what their
needs are and how we can meet them.  But go ahead.   
   
Q    And then, secondly, the President issued a 100-day mask mandate for
federal buildings.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Does the administration plan to update its mask guidance now that
we’re at 100 days, roughly, of the Biden presidency?  And what about for
the broader country?  What science, what research are using to guide
you?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know there’s been some reports out about CDC plans,
and we will certainly leave it to the CDC to announce their guidance —
which I think was the second part of your question about what will be
required outside — and when masks will be required for individuals who
have been vaccinated, so we won’t get ahead of any final details or
announcements they will make.   
   
You know, the President, of course, issued that at 100 days; we’re not
quite at 100 days, so I don’t have anything more to preview for you in
terms of what might be next.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Looking ahead to Wednesday, to the President’s speech before a
joint session of Congress, can you give us a sense of how the speech is
coming together — the President’s involvement in it, how he wants to use
that speech and his appearance there to sell the remainder of his
legislative agenda?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, first, the President has been working over the
last couple of days, as he will be over the next two, on his speech. 
He’s deeply involved in the development of his speech.  He’s thinking a
great deal about what — what message he can send directly to the
American people about what progress we’ve been made, but, of course,
what challenges remain ahead.   
   
He recognizes, as somebody who served in the Senate for 36 years, that
this is an opportunity — one of the highest-profile opportunities — even
the President has each year to speak directly to the American people,
and that’s exactly what he intends to do.   
   
He will lay out the specific details of the American Families Plan in
that speech, but he will also talk about a range of priorities that he
has for the upcoming months of his presidency, including putting in
place — working with Congress to put in place police reform; including
doing more to expand access to affordable healthcare.   
   
So there will be a range of priorities he will also mention in his
speech, but he’s deep — working closely with his speechwriters on it,
but also with policy advisors and policy — and the policy teams on
finalizing the components that will be in the speech.  
   
Q    And on COVID in this country: What’s the level of concern within
the administration that apparently 5 million people — or about 8 percent
of those who got the first dose of Pfizer and Moderna didn’t return for
dose two?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what — what I will say is that there’s no precedent,
right?  There’s no playbook.  And the other way of looking at that is
that we’re pleased that the vast majority — or 92 percent — of people
came back for their second doses.  And that is, actually, a pretty
significant number, in our view.  
   
We know people lead busy lives, but the second dose is critical to
getting the maximum level of protection to help defend against variants
and get people the longest-lasting protection, and that is certainly a
message that is being projected by our health and medical team and
doctors who are speaking on behalf of the administration, as it was over
the last couple of days.   
   
I’ll also say that a big part of our effort, as we shift into this newer
stage where it’s less about supply and more about reaching people where
they are, is making it easier to get vaccinated.  And that certainly
applies to people who have not yet received their first dose, but it
also applies to people getting their second dose.  
   
So partnering with doctors’ offices, setting up walk-up sites, helping
workers get paid time off — that’s all a part of our effort to ensure
people are getting both doses of the vaccine if they’re doing the
two-dose vaccine.   
   
Go ahead, Peter.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And congratulations.  Not to embarrass you, you got
married.   
   
Q    I did, yes.  Thank you very much.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, congratulations.  Welcome back.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Jen.  
   
First, Vice President Harris says that she’s not gone to the border yet
because “We have to deal with COVID issues.”  What is she referring
to?  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would certainly have to ask her team about that
specifically, but I would tell you also that her focus is not on the
border; it’s on addressing the root causes in the Northern Triangle.
 And that’s why the majority of her time has been spent on working with
— on a diplomatic level.   
   
She is going to speak — have a bilateral meeting with the President of
Guatemala this afternoon.  She’s going to speak with the President of
Mexico next week.  And she’s working with them to ensure there are
systems put in place to reduce the amount of migration coming from these
countries, but also to address the root causes.  And that’s really what
the President has asked her to do.   
   
Q    Then, I guess, if not with regard to her specific statement, is
there a White House concern — when you guys were planning presidential
or vice presidential travel — more about COVID at the border than other
places that she has traveled recently?  
MS. PSAKI:  We certainly know that the number of people who were in
facilities — the reason we have been so focused on expediting moving
kids out of these Border Patrol facilities is because we want to reduce
the public health impact in these facilities and get them into spaces
where we can do social distancing and where we can ensure these kids
have access to health — you know, health and medical experts and
educational resources.  
   
So that’s certainly — and we’ve made some progress on that front even
over the last few weeks, since you got married, I will say, on that
exact issue.   
   
So, look, but if the — if a President or a Vice President goes down and
visits a facility like this, you have to potentially clear some parts
out; there’s a lot of security that comes.  Our focus here is on
solutions, on making progress, on moving these kids out of these
facilities, on getting them connected with sponsor homes with — with
family members if possible.  And that’s really where the President — the
President’s focus is at this point in time.  
   
Q    And then, about those facilities: There was a report in the last
couple of days in the New York Post that every migrant child being
brought to a shelter is being given a copy of her children’s book,
“Superheroes are Everywhere.”  Do you know why that is and if she is
making any money off of that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of the President — of the Vice President’s —  
   
Q    The Vice President’s book.  Yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to check with our Health and Human Services team if
— you’re talking about if they go to shelters or if they go —  
   
Q    Yeah.  In the welcome kit, apparently, there’s a copy of her 2019
children’s book, “Superheroes are Everywhere.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to certainly check on that.  I hear it’s a good
book.  
   
Q    And then — (laughs) — and then I’ve got one more.  Why was
President Biden the only world leader at the Climate Summit Zoom who was
wearing a mask?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Because he is sending a message to the world that he is
putting in place precautions and continuing to do that as leader of the
United States.  And I don’t know what setups they all had in their
countries — that may warrant some more reporting or not.  But obviously,
he had a pool there for portions.  There were additional staff there,
additional personnel.  And that’s the sort of model that we try to keep
ourselves to here.  
   
Q    But I know the CDC’s website and their guidance is that you can
gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask or
staying six feet apart, so —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s actually for — in your private home, so it’s not
workplace guidance.  And we still wear masks around here, just like you
are all wearing masks.  And we wear masks in our offices and continue to
abide by that until that guidance changes here.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, Mary.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you.  Our latest poll over the weekend showed that the
President has a 53 percent approval rating, which is of course lower
than any recent past President except for President Trump.  Just 52
percent approve of his handling of the economy.  Why do you think that
is?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say there were a bunch of polls over
the weekend.  I know you’re asking about yours specifically, but there
were also some very positive signs about the American public’s view of
the President’s job he’s doing, including his response to COVID and the
pandemic — something that’s on the minds of the majority of the American
public.   
   
According to the NBC poll, it was 69 percent; CBS, 65 percent; ABC, 64
percent approval.  Also, I will — I will also note, per our earlier
discussion, that, according to the ABC poll, 58 percent of the public
approved of raising corporate tax rates.  
   
But the bottom line is the President — these polls show what we have
long known: that the President came into office at one of the most
divisive moments in modern American history.  And the President’s focus
is on fulfilling his promise to bring the country together — so, in
large part, on delivering on the things the American people were —
elected him to do, which there — we have seen broad approval for:
getting the pandemic under control; turning our economy around,
especially for working families and the middle class.  
   
So we know that bringing the country together — that getting through
what is a height of divisiveness in our country is going to take some
time.  And that certainly, we see, is reflected in the polls.   
   
Q    So, when you do look at these numbers, what lessons do you take
away, if any, in terms of how you may approach the next 100 days?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we — the President would be the first to tell you we
have a lot of work left to do to get the virus under control, despite
the fact that two thirds of the public, in all of these polls, support
his approach and support the progress that’s been made to get our
economy up and running.  
   
There’s still 10 million people out of work.  People aren’t feeling
satisfied by that.  And we still need to keep our heads down and keep
pushing forward to get the American Jobs Plan passed and ultimately the
American Families Plan passed.  
   
But also, he knows that he needs to do — continue to work at bringing
the country together.  And he will always be open to bipartisanship.  He
will always have an open door in the Oval Office to members of Congress
of different viewpoints to get work done for the American people.  And
he certainly believes that’s what people elected him to do.  
   
Q    And on the speech on Wednesday — you know, obviously, your first
joint address is a big moment for any new President, but this is not
going to be a joint address like we’ve seen before because of the
pandemic.  A lot of the pomp and circumstance won’t be there.  The
audience will be scaled down.  No guests, et cetera.  How is the
President modifying his approach to the speech to sort of accommodate
these unusual circumstances?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You’re right.  And it will look very different for people
who are watching at home who are used to seeing — they may not even know
they’re used to seeing this — right? — but they’re used to seeing a full
Senate Chamber — House and Senate — you know, full members of Congress
filling — they’re used to seeing guests for all of these members of
Congress.  
   
They’re used to seeing — which is always an important part of the speech
— a First Lady’s box that’s full of incredible people who are inspiring
— have inspiring stories and the President references in his speech. 
And that’s tradition as well.   
   
And none of that will be a part of the speech in the same way that
people have seen in the past.  So there’s certainly an adjustment to,
you know, how he’ll speak to the audience, speaking directly to the
American people at home.  That’s always a part of it, but even more so —
to, you know, not having all of these incredible stories, inspiring
stories that are typically a part of any President’s joint session or
State of the Union Address.  
   
So, it will look different.  But from his vantage point, it still is an
opportunity to speak directly to the American people about the progress
that’s been made, the work that’s still ahead, his new proposals for an
American Families Plan, and some of the priorities that remain central
to his presidency.  And that hasn’t changed.  
   
Q    And do you know — will he be wearing a mask?  Because, I think,
technically, now the rules are such that anyone speaking on the floor
must be masked.  Or will there be an exception for the speech?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, I’ll have to ask him that and ask our doctors
that.  It’s a great question, and we’ll — let me get back to you so
people can know what to expect.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Quickly, because I didn’t get to ask Brian Deese this: Is
the 1 million threshold for the capital gains tax increase applying to
households or individuals?  Do you know?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  These are all excellent questions.  And I know I put him in
a very difficult position, as I am too, because the speech is not for
two days.  And we will have lots of briefings that will go through all
of the specific details.  
   
So you can’t clarify right now if it’s —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just —  
   
Q    Because he did confirm that there will be a capital gains tax
raise, but it’s not clear —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, and over a million dollars is what’s been reported;
that’s accurate.  But I am not going to get into more specifics.  I will
see if there’s more we can provide to you after the briefing, but we’ve
been quite careful about not getting ahead of the President.  
   
Q    Noted.   
   
Another topic: The European Commission president said, over the weekend,
that American — vaccinated American tourists can safely enter with proof
of vaccination — whatever form that may be — in the summer.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Is there any discussion that the White House would reciprocate that
for European travelers?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re constantly reviewing.  But obviously, it is
based on the advice of our health and medical team who are evaluating
what needs to be done to continue to protect the health and safety of
the American people.  So I don’t have any update on that at this
point.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, Canada and the United Kingdom have both restricted travelers
from India amid concerns about the variant there.  Is there any effort
here or a review here about whether the U.S. would temporarily suspend
travel from India?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re always reviewing what needs to be done to protect the
American people, but I don’t have any restrictions — or rollback of
restrictions to preview today.   
   
Q    And one more on India.  The Indian government ordered Twitter and
Facebook and Instagram to block social media posts criticizing the
handling of the COVID response there.  Any White House comment on that
move?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that certainly wouldn’t be aligned with our view of
freedom of speech around the world.   
   
Q    And will the First Lady have any kind of virtual box?  Or will
there be anything to, sort of, replace the — you know, the traditional —
as you spoke about, the First Lady’s box full of guests?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not as people knew it previously.  Right?  There won’t be —
she won’t be sitting in the box with people.  We are looking for ways to
engage with the American public — whether it’s through viewing parties
or ways to communicate about what the President is proposing — but it
won’t look or feel or sound like it has in the past.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, so, just back on the tax question, real quick.  We keep
asking this question about reconciliation.  Do you have a — a sort of a
plan to increase your outreach to potential skeptics, even among the
Democratic side, in terms of getting this, really, additionally large
package through Congress?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  I mean, obviously the President has himself been
engaged with Republicans, as he was last week and I expect he will be
again next week.  And he’ll talk about the American Jobs Plan as well as
the American Families Plan.  
   
But our root focus here — I know you were asking Brian about the
corporate opposition to the capital gains component.   Look, our core —
our core focus here and the President’s core focus is on laying out
policies that will increase investment in industries of the future,
create millions of jobs, invest in childcare and education to make us
more competitive.   
   
Then he believes we should propose ways to pay for it, but that’s not —
he’s not doing a corporate tax proposal; he’s doing an American Families
proposal, an American Jobs Plan proposal.  These are ways to pay for
it.  If people have alternative ways, we’re open to hear from them.   
   
But the bottom line is the President is not going to raise taxes on
people making less than four hundred doll- — “$400,” that would be like
nobody pays taxes — but $400,000 a year.  And he believes that the
burden should be on the backs of corporations and highest-level income
people who can afford to pay more.  Hence his opposition to user fees
and other proposals that would be — put the weight — the burdens on the
back of American people.   
   
Q    On India, I have another question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    You — actually, on AstraZeneca.  So did — the opening up of a — is
that — is there any specific measure or urgency to get doses of the
AstraZeneca vaccine to India?  Is that a biggest — among the biggest
priorities?  
   
And then on the India — specifically, you mentioned that the idea is to
get some raw materials —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    — to Indian production of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  There are other
vaccines that are being produced in India.  Will those raw materials
also be available to other manufacturers working on other vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, on the second question, I think we — I
mentioned another vaccine option as well, where the raw materials would
work for — could be useful for.  
   
But I will say that we are continuing to look for a range of ways to
help India.  So we’re talking about what we can redirect, what is
available now.   
   
A lot of what they need at this moment is oxygen.  That is what they
will tell you.  What — I know reporters, all of you and your colleagues
who are reporting from the region, will tell you that we are quite
focused on that, as well as PPE, testing, and other immediate needs they
have now.  
   
But since you — since I didn’t mention this earlier: Just to be clear,
we have — right now we have zero doses available of AstraZeneca.  We’re
talking about what the F- — the FDA needs to go through a review —
right? — to ensure the safety and it’s meeting our own bar and our own
guidelines.   
   
And we expect there to be approximately 10 million doses that could be
released if/when the FDA — if or when the FDA gives its concurrence,
which could happen in the coming weeks.  So this is not immediate.   
   
And there is an estimated additional 50 million doses that are in
various stages of production.  These could be completed in stages across
May and June.   
   
But our team — our national security team, our COVID team, working with
the State Department and others — we’re going to assess a range of
requests, a range of needs around the world.  But that’s the timeline,
just to give you a sense.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, on the Putin summit, is there a date that you’ve
got in mind?  And have you made any decisions?   
   
So there was some reporting that was — you were looking at the 15th and
16th of June, which would be right after the G7 Summit.  Is that the
intention — to, sort of, twin those two trips?  And do you have a
country yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re not quite there yet.  We are eager, of course, to — as
we have any details to provide, we will provide them, but we don’t have
confirmation of any details yet or a proposed timeline quite yet.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to follow up on something Geoff was asking
you about — about the second doses —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — and then do a school question on the back end.  
   
But on the second doses: The 5 million Americans who have missed their
second dose — why does the administration think that’s happening?  Why
are people not going back for their second shot?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are a range of im- — a range of reasons for different
individuals.  I will say — it is important to note — there is no history
or precedent here.  Right?  So the fact that 92 percent of people are
going back for their second doses, in our assessment, is a pretty
significant number.   
   
But we are looking at ways that we can take steps — as we are for people
who haven’t even taken their first dose — or their only dose, if they’re
doing Johnson & Johnson — to help address, including ensuring that we
have more mobile sites; that we are, as we announced last week,
providing — ensuring there’s an opportunity for paid leave; that we are
working in partnership with doctors to make it easier.   
   
You know, people have busy lives; we certainly understand that.  And we
want to take every step we can to make it easier for people to get their
second dose or their first dose if they have not yet done that either.  
   
Q    And would there be any plan to do some of those things specifically
for those people who need to go back for shot two to guarantee that they
get back in the door wherever they went for their first one?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The same approaches apply to all of these challenges.  So,
obviously, we target — you know, we take different approaches, depending
on the community or depending on what we’re seeing in the data of the
challenges.   
   
But the importance of increasing our investment in mobile sites;
partnering with doctors; partnering — increasing our pharmacy allotment
— these are all steps we’re taking to increase the number of people who
are getting their doses.  
   
Q    And on schools — obviously, this was a key part of the President’s
100-days agenda: Nearly half of schools are open full time, but the vast
majority of students are learning online at least some of the time
during the week.  They’re fulltime virtual or hybrid learning.   
   
If the buildings are open but the students are still learning remotely a
significant portion of the time, does the President view that as a
success, and will he declare that this week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I don’t think we’ve seen data since the early April
data that was reflective of February.  So the data is quite old at this
point in time.  And we’ve seen, across communities and states, there’s
been a significant amount of progress of schools opening five days a
week, of students being in school learning.   
   
Now, some school districts have given the option of scoo- — of students,
if their parents choose, to stay remote.  That is, in some school
districts, the option they’ve chosen.  I expect we’ll have more data on
March — not until probably early May or late April time.  That will give
us a greater assessment, and we have every confidence we will be over 50
percent of schools open five days a week.  
   
Q    So no data — new data before day 100 this week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s — the data is done by the Department of
Education, so we can’t really change the data-release timing.  But we
are confident, given what we’ve seen happen across the country, that we
are going to meet that goal.  
   
Go ahead, David.  
   
Q    I have two questions for you on different topics, Jen.  First, you
may have seen the FBI and DHS turned out a fairly detailed set of
guidance today on SolarWinds and suggested there would be more attacks
coming.  How are we supposed to measure — since the President announced
his sanctions two weeks ago — what success looks like there?  Would it
be —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  From — from the impact of sanctions?   
   
Q    From the impacts of the sanctions and whatever unseen activities
you –- you engaged in.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s challenging, as you know from covering this for
some time, as you have.  I will say that, you know, we have never —
never thought — seen one set of sanctions as being the silver bullet
that would change — alone change the behavior of the Russian government,
just like we wouldn’t see sanctions as the one silver bullet that would
change behavior in any country.   
   
We still felt it was essential to put in place consequences and
implement consequences for a behavior that we found to be absolutely
unacceptable, as did most of the global community.  
   
But in terms of measuring success: You know, our objective is to
deescalate the relationship; to, of course, speak out where we have
concerns; speak out where we have — take action as needed when we are
responding to their behavior that we find unacceptable; but also to find
a way to make it predictable and stable.  
   
So I would say, you know, that’s what we’re working toward.  We’re not
looking as the implementation of sanctions as a — as a solo incident
that we’re evaluating the success of, as much as it is part of moving
and changing the relationship.  
   
Q    Did you see Putin’s move to pull back from the Ukraine border as
his indication that he also wanted to deescalate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I am — as I’ve said before, I’m blissfully not in the mind
of Vladimir Putin.  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And I — but, you know, we are — and so, I can’t predict or
analyze for you really effectively what was in his mind in the movements
that were made.   
   
But our objective continues to be working with our partners in Europe to
convey that mil- — that troop buildup was unacceptable, that escalation
is unacceptable.   
   
And, you know, President Biden, Tony Blin- — or Secretary Blinken and
others don’t hold back in making that — conveying that clearly.  
   
Q    One last question for you.  You have some visitors this week from
Israel — an intelligence group, I think, led by Yossi Cohen of the
Mossad and some others.  Who are they seeing in the administration?  And
do you plan to be conveying or do officials plan to be conveying to them
the thought that Israel may be, actually, actively undercutting your
effort to get back — get the Iran deal back together?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to get back to you — as we try to be transparent
around here — who they’re meeting with and check with our national
security team about that, David and others who are interested in that.  
   
I will say that we will, of course, brief them — I’m certain it will be
a part of the — of the conversation — as we regularly do, on the status
of negotiations.  We’ve just concluded the second round; that will
likely be multi-round negotiations in Vienna.  And we will update them,
I would expect, on those discussions and the progress being made
there.   
   
But in terms of other components of the discussion, I will see what we
plan to read out from those meetings.  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Two questions on behalf of colleagues who can’t be here —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — a couple of ones, and one of my own.  For the capital gains tax
increase, when would that take effect?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I know there’s lots of questions and interest.  I
understand it; I’m with you for it.  But we will have many factsheets,
many pages of factsheets, many briefings to get you all of the details
you would like.  
   
Q    And, on AstraZeneca, the doses: Are those going to be given
specifically to countries or to COVAX?  What is the process for
determining who gets those?  Does Canada get any of those, other
countries, and how many?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  We’re working through the — what the process will
look like, and we will consider a range of options from our partner
countries.  And, of course, much of that will be through direct
relationships.  
   
Q    Okay.  And the other question I had was: You mentioned two of the
President’s goals was to bring the country together and end the
pandemic.  Those are obviously the two big goals that he has.  You’re
seeing —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Get Americans back to work.   
   
Q    Which is obviously connected to ending the pandemic.   
   
And, you know, you see this vaccine hesitancy among Republicans.  You
see slower vaccination rates in Republican-led states.  How are the —
how does the President view those two goals as intertwined?  And does,
you know — do they have to, kind of — can you not have one without the
other, I guess, is what I’m saying?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s an interesting question.  I would say that the
President believes he’s got to govern for all people.  And that
includes, of course, getting the pandemic under control, which is
certainly not impacting people through a political prism.   
   
So, our efforts are to increase vaccine hesi– — confidence, I should
say, across a range of communities where we’ve seen some — some concern
or some question.   
   
Now we have seen, in recent data, that there has been large increases
among not just communities of color, but also more conservative
communities — people who have had a neighbor take the vaccine; who have
seen the — people who are vaccinated able to have dinner together in
their home, as is part of the CDC guidance.  And so that’s
encouraging.   
   
But we are going to — the President is going to continue to govern for
all people to work to address the crises we’re facing — that are not
Democratic or Republican crises; they’re crises for the American public
— whether that is the pandemic, people who are out of work, the climate
crisis, racial injustice in our country.  Those are the four he’s
identified as being central to his presidency.  
   
Hi, David.  
   
Q    Hey, Jen.  Hey, a question on unity.  You know, you talk about —
earlier, you said you wanted to bring — or the President wanted to
“bring the country back together.”  So, I guess, the question is: He has
not met with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, according to Kevin
McCarthy.  What does that say about unity?   
   
And also, there are some other legislative issues, as it relates to H.R.
1 and a commission to study packing the Supreme Court, as you would
say.  And there’s a lot of other lists as well — budget reconciliation. 
So, there’s a lot of folks — you talk about tens of millions of people —
that are concerned about that this doesn’t seem like unity at all.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Do you think tens of millions are people are concerned about
him not meeting with Kevin McCarthy?  
   
Q    No, I think of tens of millions of people are concerned about H.R.
1 and budget reconciliation and going with a 50-vote threshold.  I think
that was a concern.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not sure the polling bears that out.  But I will say
that the President’s view is that bringing the country together is
bringing the American people together.  So, when I say he is — he is
focused on re- — bringing — you know, bringing people together, bringing
Democrats and Republicans together, he is not talking about solving
bipartisanship in the — this ZIP Code here.  He is talking about
proposing policies that address the crises that we’re facing, whether
it’s getting the pandemic under control, putting people back to work.   
   
A lot of those policies he’s proposed — whether it’s the American Rescue
Plan or the American Jobs Plan — are supported by the vast majority of
the American public — Democrat, Republican, independent.  They certainly
want to see him working with — with Republicans and Democrats and —
here.  And he’s absolutely doing everything he can to do that.  He’s had
a number of Republicans down here to the Oval Office.  He’s looking
forward — we’re going to be reviewing their proposals, and I think
certainly people see that — see him rolling up his sleeves and ready to
work with people of all different viewpoints.  
   
Q    So, just real quick: Why not separate the infrastructure bill that
Republicans have — whatever it is; $800 billion or so?  Why not just
take that and call it “unity,” call it a deal, and then move on to some
of the other legislative priorities within the total construct?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, David, as you know, you need 60 votes.  You can talk
to Republicans in the Senate and see how many votes they have.   
   
But I will say that where we are now is that we are certainly taking a
look at the proposal.  Right now, there’s deep-in-the-weeds,
sometimes-nerdy conversations between staffers, members of Congress.  We
have lots of follow-up questions; I’m sure they have lots of follow-up
questions.  We’re sharing ideas.  That’s actively happening now.   
   
He’ll invite some members next week — bipartisan members — to come to
the Oval Office and have a discussion about it on what the path forward
looks like.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, ma’am.  I have one question about foreign policy, and
then another about COVID here.  So, the first one is: In tapes obtained
by the New York Times, Iran’s foreign minister says that former
Secretary of State John Kerry informed him that Israel attacked Iranian
interests at least 200 times.   
   
You know, as the Secretary has shifted roles, he still continues to
represent the United States on a world stage.  Does the President have
any comment or reaction to Kerry telling the Iranians about covert
military action on the part of Israel?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re not going to comment on leaked tapes.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, my second question is: I’ve heard from a number of
governors who are frustrated that they haven’t heard directly from
President Biden on these weekly coordinating COVID calls.  Why hasn’t he
joined those weekly calls?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And how many governors?  
   
Q    Say what?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  How many governors have you heard from?  
   
Q    I’ve heard from a number, but has — how many times —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Like how many?  One?  Two?  
   
Q    Well, I’m actually curious to see how many times he’s joined those
calls, and if there’s — if there’s a reason why?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It was never his — but I’m curious to answer to your
question too.  
   
Q    It’s — it’s in our story.  We —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think there were two in your story.  
   
Q    There were two in my story and there were others who didn’t go on
the record, but we reflected that in the story.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, so two governors and some anonymous governors.   
   
I will say that the intention was never for the weekly call — the COVID
call that is led by our COVID Coordinator — to be a part — to — for the
President to be leading that call.  That — the intention was for our
COVID Coordinator to be providing an update directly from the President,
directly from our work across the federal government to get the pandemic
under control.   
   
And what we’ve done on that call is provided weekly updates on the
number of doses that are going out to states, which is — have increased
nearly every week.  We’re talking about an average of about 28 million
out to states now.  It’s an opportunity to have an engagement, have a
discussion about where there are challenges in the system; how to better
operationalize; better communicate, which was a complaint that we came
in and tried to solve when we came into office.   
   
So that was the intention.  I can assure you that the — the American
public, governors hear quite a deal — quite a great deal from the
President on his plans to get the pandemic under control.  And he is —
it’s in excellent hands with — with his COVID Coordinator.   
   
Q    So to clarify: He has not joined.  Does he have any plans in the
future to join those calls?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ve never conveyed it as a call that would be a part of
his agenda, so I’m not sure there’s like a big controversy here.   
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you, ma’am.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Can you confirm reports that Ambassador — that — sorry, excuse me —
that the CIA Director Bill Burns was in Iraq, in Baghdad, meeting with
Iranian officials in (inaudible) foreign minister’s home?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would point you to the CIA for confirmation of anything
about his schedule.   
   
Q    Okay.  Because he was somebody who led the discussions in 2015, and
currently, Prime Minister — I mean, Foreign Minister Zarif is in Iraq
too, so I’d be interested to know whether the two of them are planning
to meet.  Is that something that you’re able to discuss?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d — again, I’d point you to — to the CIA and his team
there for any details of his schedule.   
   
Q    I have another question —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — on Guatemala.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    So, earlier today, Secretary Blinken announced sanctions on some
Guatemalan officials.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.   
   
Q    Are there are other sanctions that the administration is weighing
for other Northern Triangle countries now?  And how is this expected to
affect the discussions that the Vice President is having later today on
migration cooperation?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, the sanctions that were announced today — which
everybody may not have seen; I know there’s a lot going on — is on one
current and one former Guatemalan government official for their role in
corruption in Guatemala.  And these sanctions support efforts by the
people of Guatemala to end the scourge of corruption as part of the U.S.
government’s commitment to support improvements in government — in
governance in Guatemala.  
   
You know, and as the Vice President’s virtual bilat with the President
today indicates, we are focused on working with Guatemala and other
partners in the region to improve conditions and address the root causes
of migration.   
   
Today’s actions were also taken in close coordination with the United
Kingdom, which has today established a new anti-corruption sanctions
regime.  
   
But we are confident we will continue to be able to work with the
Guatemalan leadership on areas of agreement, areas where there is
opportunity.  But we also are not going to hold back when actions
warrant sanctions, as they did in this case, on the grounds of
corruption.   
   
Q    Do you expect the Vice President to meet with El Salvador President
Bukele?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know she has a — a virtual bilat next week with the
Mexican president, and I expect she’ll have more in the coming weeks. 
But I don’t have anything to preview for you today.  
   
Go ahead, all the way in the back.   
   
Q    Yes, I have a question for myself, and then two for colleagues who
can’t be in the room.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    First, you’ve laid out a number of domestic agenda items for the
President’s speech on Wednesday.  How much can we expect that he will
speak about foreign policy?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  He will certainly talk about foreign policy in his speech
and reiterate his objectives and commitments to rebuilding our place in
the world, regaining the United States’ seat at the table.  I don’t have
more to preview for you than that, but it will certainly be a part of
the speech.   
   
Q    Okay.  And let me see — what is your response to the criticism that
the U.S. response to the crisis in India is coming late?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I will say, first, you know, the United States has
been one of the largest providers of assistance to address the COVID
pandemic around the world, including to India.  
   
And we have obviously taken some significant steps over the nex- — last
couple of days to address their immediate needs and been in close touch
with them at every level, including with Prime Minister and the
President discussing — or communicating.  
   
I will also say that, you know, we are continuing to fight a pandemic
here.  India and the United States are — have two of the highest — or
have two of the highest challenges as it relates to fighting the COVID
pandemic, so we also take that into account.  
   
But I can assure people who are watching and paying attention that we
are — want to work in partnership with India. We are committed to
getting them assistance they need — whether that’s oxygen, PPE,
therapeutics, tests, raw materials for vaccines — and we’ll continue to
communicate at the highest level.  
   
Q    Okay, and —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Andrea.  
   
Q    Oh, sorry.  
   
Q    Sorry.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, did you have one more?  Go ahead.   
   
Q    One more.  Is the administration concerned about reports on the use
of forced labor to produce polysilicon for solar panels in Xinjiang?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me check.  I think we would be concerned, but let me
check with our national security team and we’ll get you a statement
directly on that.  
   
Go ahead, Andrea.  
   
Q    I just had a — kind of, a clarification question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Previously, when you released doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to
Canada and Mexico —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We lent them.  
   
Q    You lent them.  Is the loan thing — the loan program over?  Are we
into gifting now?  Or —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.)  We’re — we are considering a range of options. 
And I expect, as we put together our plan and we consider the range of
requests we have and determine where we will be distributing these
vaccines, we will do that through a range of means.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
Q    And then just — Jen, just on the overall issue of, kind of, vaccine
production in the U.S.  There is, as you know, mounting pressure on U.S.
to support this TRIPS waiver at the WTO.  Has there been any shift in
the U.S. position?   
   
Up until now, the U.S. has not even permitted those discussions to take
place on a formal level.  Given what we’re seeing now — this sort of
worst-case scenario of the increased incidents in India and Brazil and
other places — is there a rethink going on?   
   
I understand that there’s concern about the emergence of variants and
not knowing that — you know, what will happen to those.  Are you
rethinking the position now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’ll first say — and I know we’ll have a call shortly
on — where you can — where there’ll be an opportunity to ask a lot of
these questions too.  
   
But, you know, India has their own IP — right? — and they are also
manufacturer of vaccines.  Some of it has been delayed.  Our — the last
time we really communicated about this at a high level was from our
USTR, Katherine Tai, but I don’t have any updates to that.  
   
Q    Jen, could I do one from a colleague?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    (Inaudible), sorry.  I know you want to get out for the call.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s okay.  
   
Q    This is from VOA.  He can’t be here, obviously —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — due to COVID.  The question is: Ukrainian President Zelensky is
suggesting including U.S. participation to try to end the Donbas war. 
Is the administration ready to take a more active role in the peace
process?  And if yes, what capacity?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would certainly point you to the State Department. 
They’re probably the most appropriate entity to talk about our
engagement in negotiations.   
   
We have been engaged in the past, as you know, and certainly we are in
close touch with the leadership of Ukraine at a range of levels.  The
President himself has spoken with the President of Ukraine, and
certainly the Secretary of State and others have spoken with their
counterparts about what their needs are and how we can be effective
partners.  
   
Thanks, everyone.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You have eight minutes until the call, so you’re welcome. 
(Laughter.)
