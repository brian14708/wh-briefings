title: "Background Press Call by a Senior Administration Official on\_Afghanistan"
---
 
12:04 P.M. EDT  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, everyone.  Good afternoon.  And
thanks for joining us on short notice.  Today’s call on Afghanistan will
be attributable to a senior administration official, and the contents
will be embargoed until the conclusion of this call.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to our speaker, \[senior administration
official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining
today.  I am here to talk to you about the President’s decision on the
way forward in Afghanistan.   
   
After a rigorous policy review, President Biden has decided to draw down
the remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan and finally end the U.S. war
there after 20 years.  We will begin an orderly drawdown of the
remaining forces before May 1st and plan to have all U.S. troops out of
the country before the 20th anniversary of 9/11.   
   
The President is deeply grateful for the honor, courage, and
determination of the U.S. men and women who have served in Afghanistan
for almost two decades, as well as the sacrifices made not just by those
troops, but also by their families.  
   
We went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked us on
September 11th and to disrupt terrorists seeking to use Afghanistan as a
safe haven to attack the United States.  We believe we achieved that
objective some years ago.  We judge the threat against the homeland now
emanating from Afghanistan to be at a level that we can address it
without a persistent military footprint in the country and without
remaining at war with the Taliban.  
   
The President made the determination and is announcing tomorrow that the
best path forward to advance American interests is to end the war in
Afghanistan after 20 years so that we can address the global threat
picture as it exists today, not as it was two decades ago.  
   
We’ve long known that military force would not solve Afghanistan’s
internal political challenges, would not end Afghanistan’s internal
conflict.  And so we are ending our military operations while we focus
our efforts on supporting, diplomatically, the ongoing peace process.  
   
Just a few points of context on all of this.  When we came into office,
the Biden administration inherited a number of things: the lowest number
of U.S. and partner forces since the early days of the war; an agreement
between the United States and the Taliban to draw down all U.S. troops
by May 1, just three months after Inauguration Day; as well as a
military stalemate between the Taliban and Afghan forces.  
   
President Biden asked for a review of genuine, realistic options to
advance and protect U.S. interests, and a review that would not and did
not sugarcoat the likely outcomes or rely on best-case scenarios.  
   
The President and his team consulted with his Cabinet, members of
Congress, the Afghan government, NATO Allies, partners who are still
serving alongside the United States in Afghanistan, as well as other
donor nations, regional powers, and former officials from both parties
here in the United States.  
   
What emerged was a clear-eyed assessment of the best path forward.  We
have, as I said before, long known that there is no military solution to
the problems plaguing Afghanistan, and we will focus our efforts on
supporting the ongoing peace process.  And that means putting the full
weight of our government behind diplomatic efforts to reach a peace
agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government.  But what we
will not do is use our troops as bargaining chips in that process.  
   
We will coordinate with NATO Allies and partners about a drawdown of
their forces in the same timeframe: beginning before May 1, ending
before the 20th anniversary of September 11th.  And we have told the
Taliban in no uncertain terms that any attacks on U.S. troops as we
undergo a safe and orderly withdrawal will be met with a forceful
response.  
   
At this point, we have discussed the drawdown with our NATO Allies and
operational partners.  We will remain in lockstep with them as we
undergo this operation.  We went in together, adjusted together, and now
we will prepare to leave together.  
   
We are deeply grateful for the sacrifices so many of them made along the
way, and we’ll never forget the ultimate show of Allied support when
NATO invoked Article 5 on September 12, 2001, after our country was
attacked.  
   
So President Biden was adamant that a hasty, ill-coordinated withdrawal
that puts at risk our forces or those of our Allies and operational
partners was not a viable option, which is how he landed where we are.  
   
The United States is going to remain deeply engaged with the government
of Afghanistan, committed to the Afghan people who have made
extraordinary services — excuse me, extraordinary sacrifices during this
conflict.  We’ll stand behind the diplomatic process, and we will use
our full toolkit to ensure the future that the Afghan people are seeking
has the best chance of coming about.  
   
We will also look to work with other countries using diplomatic,
economic, and humanitarian tools to protect the gains made by Afghan
women.   
   
And we will encourage any future government in Afghanistan to expand
resources for refugees and internally displaced peoples while also
working with Congress to expand and expedite Special Immigrant Visas for
those Afghans and their families who supported U.S. efforts in
Afghanistan.  
   
Finally, we are not taking our eye off of the terrorist threat or signs
of al Qaeda’s resurgence.  They do not currently present an external —
or do not currently possess an external plotting capability that can
threaten the homeland.  But this is something that we have to focus on:
its potential for reemerging in the years ahead.  And we have to
continue relentlessly to work to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming
a base from which terrorists can attack the United States.   
   
So, in coordination with our Afghan partners and with other allies, we
will reposition our counterterrorism capabilities, retaining significant
assets in the region to counter the potential reemergence of a terrorist
threat to the homeland from Afghanistan, and to hold the Taliban to its
commitment to ensure al Qaeda does not once again threaten the United
States or our interests or our allies.  And we will refine our
counterterrorism strategy to monitor and disrupt terrorist threats to
the homeland and to our interests in a way that contends with the
dispersed threats big picture we face today.   
   
I want to finish on this point: This is not 2001; it is 2021.  And in
2021, the terrorist threat that we face is real and it emanates from a
number of countries — indeed a number of continents — from Yemen, from
Syria, from Somalia, from other parts of Africa.  And we have to focus
on those aspects of a dispersed and distributed terrorist threat, even
as we keep our eye on the ball to prevent the reemergence of a
significant terrorist threat from Afghanistan through these repositioned
counterterrorism capabilities.   
   
Final point.  The President deeply believes that in contending with the
threats and challenges of 2021, as opposed to those of 2001, we need to
be focusing our energy, our resources, our personnel, our — the time of
our foreign policy and national security leadership on those threats and
challenges that are most acute for the United States: on the challenge
of competition with China, on the challenge presented by the current
pandemic and future pandemics, on the challenge posed by this much more
distributed terrorist threat across multiple countries.  And that doing
that requires us to close the book on a 20-year conflict in Afghanistan
and move forward with clear eyes and an effective strategy to protect
and defend America’s national security interests.   
   
So, I will stop there and would be happy to take some questions.  
   
Q    Thanks so much, \[senior administration official\] and team, for
setting this up.  First question is: I wonder what you’d base your
assessment that al Qaeda does not currently possess an external plotting
capability and what level of confidence you and the intel community have
with that assessment?   
   
And just as a related question: Given the experience of the withdrawal
from Iraq, and the subsequent rise of ISIS, what lesson — of course, you
have a number of folks from the current administration who were veterans
of that decision, the aftermath — what lessons did you learn from that?
 And how does that inform this decision or contribute to any hesitancy
to withdraw from Afghanistan?  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I will — I’ll let the intelligence
community speak to the basis for their current assessment, which is, as
I noted, a current assessment.  I think you, rightly, raised the
question of the potential for the reemergence of al Qaeda in the region,
following a drawdown of U.S. and coalition forces.  That is a genuine
threat.  It needs to be met with vigilance, and it will be.   
   
And a lesson that we learned from the drawdown in Iraq is that we have
to have the intelligence and military capabilities positioned in the
region and the attention of our national security apparatus sufficiently
focused to ensure that if the al Qaeda external plotting threat begins
to reemerge, we deal with it.  And we deal with it both directly and by
holding the Taliban accountable through all the tools at our disposal
for doing their part to keep their commitment, which, you know, we’re
not just going to take on faith that they will do.   
   
So that is our intention, and we think we can do that in a way that
applies and allocates sufficient resources to that threat, while also
staying focused on the terrorist threat as it has emerged and evolved in
multiple other countries where al Qaeda’s and ISIS’s capabilities have
advanced considerably since we first went into Afghanistan in 2001.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks for doing this.  Just to clarify: Is September 11th a
conditions-based target for withdrawal, or is it a hard commitment to
get to zero?  When I spoke to then-candidate Biden in February, at the
time he was clear that he did feel some residual U.S. force was
necessary in Afghanistan.  Are you committing today to going to zero?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  This is not conditions-based. 
The President has judged that a conditions-based approach, which has
been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in
Afghanistan forever.   
   
And so he has reached the conclusion that United States will complete
its drawdown, will remove its forces from Afghanistan before September
11th.  And I would hasten to note, for those on the call, that a lot of
this is about operational and logistical issues related to ensuring that
we have a safe and orderly withdrawal.   
   
That withdrawal may be completed well in advance of September 11th.  But
that is the outside date by which it will be completed.  And, as I said,
it will begin before May 1.  It will be completed over the course of
that next period and no later than the 20th anniversary of 9/11, but
potentially a meaningful amount of time before then.   
   
Q    Hi there.  Can you tell me what, if any, U.S. personnel will remain
in the country lastingly?  Will there be any counterterror force based
there?  Will there be any training — keep open the military base there,
for example?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The remaining military presence in
Afghanistan will be the force required to protect our diplomatic
presence.  We obviously put the safety and security of our personnel
overseas at the top of our priority list.  And we are in the process of
extensive planning, as well as consultations with our allies and
partners on the shape and nature of that ongoing diplomatic presence to
ensure that our diplomats in Afghanistan have what they need to fulfill
their important and enduring mission.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I’d like to go back to the timeline.  One of the
criticisms of the previous administration was that a May 1st deadline
was arbitrary.  I’d like to know why a September one isn’t arbitrary,
given that, practically speaking, you could withdraw well before
that.   
   
And what concerns do you have about increased violence against U.S.
troops in that period?  One of the threats from the Taliban had been
that, had the troops stayed beyond out May 1st, there could be potential
violence against them.   
   
I guess what I’m trying to clarify: Is the September deadline because
helping NATO troops get out?  Is it because U.S. troops could get out
far faster than that?  And what security measures would be in place for
U.S. forces in that period when the Taliban has threatened increased
violence?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The answer is — the answer is “yes” to
the question about NATO forces.  Basically, President Biden has — will
give our military commanders the time and space they need to conduct a
safe and orderly withdrawal, not just of U.S. forces but of allied
forces, as well, on the principle of “in together, out together.”  And
so, we will take the time we need to execute that, and no more time than
that.   
   
We believe that we certainly can complete that before September.  And
the question of “how long before September” depends on, you know,
conditions as the — as the drawdown unfolds.   
   
So that’s why I said there’s not — there’s not actually a date on the
calendar for when we can guarantee you the last trip will be out, other
than, you know, an outside — you know, it will be no later than the 20th
anniversary of 9/11, meaning it could be, as I said before, well before
then.   
   
So it’s not arbitrary; it is what is required, in the judgment of our
military commanders, to get not just U.S. forces safely drawn down, but
to get our partners and allies safely drawn down as well.   
   
We have communicated to the Taliban in no uncertain terms that if they
do conduct attacks against U.S. or allied forces as we carry out this
drawdown — which, again, as I indicated, will begin before May 1 — that
we will hit back hard and that we will hold them accountable for that. 
And so, we believe we can execute this in an effective way and intend to
do so.  
   
Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks for doing this.  I wanted to follow up on what
\[senior administration official\] said about ensuring women’s rights. 
I’m just wondering how you’re expecting to do that if the Taliban has
greater control, and if the U.S. would consider returning if women’s
rights aren’t protected or, more broadly, if some of the other concerns
that you mentioned, like the possible reemergence of al Qaeda or other
terror networks in the region, would result in the U.S. redeploying
troops to Afghanistan.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We believe that we retain substantial
military and intelligence capabilities to disrupt the broader capacity
of al Qaeda to successfully reconstitute the sustained homeland threat
to the United States.  And we will exercise those capabilities, again,
both directly and by holding the Taliban accountable with all the tools
at our disposal for ensuring that Afghanistan is not a base for attacks
against the West.  
   
And then, with respect to protecting women’s rights, the United States,
as I mentioned in my opening comments, will use its full diplomatic,
humanitarian, and economic toolkit to try to — as best we can — to
protect the gains made by women and girls over the course of the past 20
years.  We’re committed to supporting our Afghan partners.  We’ll do so
with an eye towards accountability.  We will bolster support for
civilian, economic, and humanitarian assistance programs.   
   
Part of the drawdown and the time that we have to execute the drawdown
will help us ramp up humanitarian assistance and support for Afghan
civil society.   
   
I would note that a lot has changed in two decades.  In 2001, there were
fewer than 900,000 children, almost all boys, in school.  Today, there’s
over 9.2 million children, 40 percent of which are girls, in school. 
Life expectancy has gone from 44 years to 60 years.  Maternal mortality
rates remain far too high but have declined dramatically.   
   
So, you know, we have made really substantial investments over two
decades.  And we will do all we can, working with the international
community, to protect those gains but not with the continuation of a
military force on the ground.   
   
The last thing I would say on this is: We’re going to make clear to any
nation, any government, any party that wants to participate in a
government that if they want international legitimacy or connection to
the rest of the world and does not want to be deemed a “pariah state,”
then they must not interfere with the progress that has been made to
advance human rights, including for women, girls, and minorities in
Afghanistan.  So we will — we will work at that.  
   
But our view is that that has to be done through aggressive diplomatic,
humanitarian, and economic measures, not through the continuation of the
U.S. war in Afghanistan.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks very much for doing this.  When — where are you going
to be repositioning these American troops?  And also, it sounds like you
are keeping the American Embassy in Afghanistan open then.  Have you
decided or judged how — what kind of military presence you need there to
protect the diplomats, since some officials estimate that it would be
close to the same number as we have now?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The — so, first, the question of where
these forces will be repositioned to, I’m going to refer to the
Pentagon.  They will be giving a fuller briefing on this — not probably
in the next 48 or 72 hours, but as we move forward.  So I can’t speak to
that, in this context, now.  
   
On the question of the embassy presence: We are actively working through
that contingency planning right now, including what will be required to
protect the embassy.  We are also in consultation with the Afghan
government on that question.  And we’ll have more to say on that as we
come to a firmer understanding, over the course of our drawdown, of what
precisely will be required.   
   
So we have not completed — or we have not reached our final conclusion,
despite an immense amount of analysis over the last three years, of what
the footprint will look like.  We have a range of options, and we will
tailor those options to the conditions as the drawdown unfolds.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, thanks everyone.  That
concludes our call this afternoon.  
   
A reminder that we are on background, attributed to a “senior
administration official.”  With that, the embargo is lifted.  Thanks,
everyone, and have a good day.
