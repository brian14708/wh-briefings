Via Teleconference 

10:36 A.M. EDT  
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  Good morning.  Thank you for joining
us.  
   
Today, I am joined by Dr. Walensky, Dr. Fauci, and Dr.  Murthy to give
you a thorough update on a busy week of activity fighting the pandemic
across multiple fronts.   
   
You have heard our scientific and public health teams, led by Dr. Fauci
and Dr. Walensky, talk in plain terms about the threat to ending the
pandemic we face from more dangerous variants that emerge from
COVID-19.  Today, with their help, I want to lay out our strategy to
tackle these variants.   
   
When we arrived in January, we put together a 200-page plan on how we
would tackle every element of the pandemic — from vaccinations, to
inequities, to school re-openings, to testing.  Part of any plan is
tackling the things you can’t fully prepare for but which emerge as
critical threats.   
   
All roads to defeating the pandemic go through the path of successfully
and quickly vaccinating the country.  To date, 125 million Americans
have been vaccinated and millions more each day.  But even as we
accelerate our efforts to get shots in arms, more dangerous variants are
growing, causing increases in cases with people without immunity.   
   
This increases the urgency for you to get vaccinated.  But it also
requires us to intensify our efforts to quickly test for and find the
genetic sequence of the virus as it spreads.   
   
Now, we started in a hole.  Despite having world-class researchers and
dedicated state and local public health leaders, when we arrived, the
U.S. was sequencing only a small fragment of what other countries were. 
This hampered our ability to find and react to these new variants.   
   
What we call surveillance — our ability to spot variants as they emerge
and spread — is vital, particularly as we aim to get ahead of dangerous
variances before they emerge, as they are in the Midwest right now.  
   
Today, we are announcing a $1.7 billion investment to bolster the
ability of the CDC and state and local public health departments to
monitor, track, and defeat emerging threats — whether it’s COVID-19
variants today or other viruses in the future — through a process known
as genomic sequencing.    
   
This significant investment, which is made possible due to the American
Rescue Plan President Biden signed into law last month, is critical in
our fight against the new and potentially dangerous variants of
COVID-19.  Right now, these variants account for nearly half of all
COVID-19 cases in the United States, and we need more capacity in our
public health system to identify and track these mutations.  
   
State and local public health departments are on the frontlines of
beating back the pandemic, but they need more capacity to detect these
variants early on before dangerous outbreaks.  This funding will enable
CDC and states to do more genomic sequencing as we activate the nation’s
great research capabilities to detect variants earlier and increase our
visibility into emerging threats.  This investment will give public
health officials the chance to react more quickly to prevent and stop
the spread.  
   
Today’s investment also builds on the major investments in testing and
genomic sequencing that we made earlier this year.  That includes $10
billion of American Rescue Plan funding to support COVID-19 testing in
schools, another $2.5 billion to help state and local public health
agencies increase testing capacity in underserved and high-risk
communities, and nearly $200 million to begin to increase genomic
sequencing capacity that this investment comes on top of.   
   
We’re doing a number of other things to work with individual states that
are experiencing a rise in cases: providing more intensive support to
get more shots in arms more quickly, more personnel to support
vaccination and other public health efforts, and more testing and
therapeutics.  Additional sequencing efforts will be a vital tool in our
battle against COVID-19.   
   
I have one further announcement.  Today, we’re announcing another
federally-run mass vaccination site in Bessemer, Alabama, that will have
the capacity to administer 7,000 shots per week.  Altogether, by next
week, we will have opened 37 mass vaccination sites in 26 states, with a
combined capacity of administering a total of 125,000 shots per day.  
   
We’re doing everything we can to put this pandemic behind us, and we
stand ready to support states.  But, before I turn it to Dr. Walensky, I
want to reiterate the role all of us have to play.  We need everyone to
do their part.  We need all Americans to take the steps we know work to
stop COVID-19.  So, please: Wear a mask, socially distance, and as
needed — socially distance, and get tested as needed, and also go get
vaccinated.  As of Monday, all adult Americans will be eligible.   
   
With that, I’m going to turn it over to Dr. Walensky.  
   
DR. WALENSKY:  Thank you and good morning.  As for my usual, I’ll begin
with an overview of the data.   
   
Yesterday, CDC reported 73,622 cases of COVID-19.  Our seven-day average
is up to 69,500, nearly 70,000 new cases per day.  I know case numbers
may seem similar from day to day, but just four weeks ago, our seven-day
average was only about 53,000 cases per day.  
   
In concert with the increase in cases, the seven-day average of
emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and hospitalizations
are all approximately 5 to 8 percent higher than they were in the prior
seven-day period.  And sadly, average daily deaths have increased for
the third day in a row to over 700 per day.  
   
We are also getting vaccines into arms as quickly and as equitably and
safely as possible.  I am proud of the progress we’ve made.  More than
one third of the U.S. population has received at least one dose, and
more than one fifth of the population is fully vaccinated.  
   
But we must continue to get many more people vaccinated.  This — the
increasing trends in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are very
concerning, and they threaten the progress we’ve already made.  
   
As I’ve discussed, some of these increases are as a result of relaxed
prevention efforts in states across the country, such as relaxed mask
mandates or loosened restrictions on indoor restaurant seating.  Another
reason for these increases is the continued spread of highly
transmissible variants — more than 50 to 70 percent more transmissible —
which makes the race to stop the transmission even more challenging and
threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system again in parts of this
country.  
   
CDC data show that the B117 variant — the variant originally identified
in the United Kingdom — represents 44 percent of the virus circulating
during the week of March 27th.  The prevalence of B117 since that time
is certainly higher, and we are expected to have new data soon.  
   
The emergence of variants underscores the critical need for rapid and
ongoing genomic surveillance.  CDC has been acting on multiple fronts to
increase our sequencing efforts in the United States to detect variants
of the virus that causes COVID-19, and recently began receiving the
sequence data from seven additional large commercial laboratories.  
   
As Andy just announced, the administration is investing $1.7 billion
from the American Rescue Plan in an effort to more effectively track
emerging and circulating variants across the country and to better
prepare the country for the next pandemic.  This includes surveillance
of breakthrough infections, as well as more and more — as more and more
people get vaccinated.  
   
With this critical and substantial investment, CDC will fund the
equipment, supplies, training, staffing, electronic infrastructure,
partnerships, and innovation needed to build a robust national
genomic-sequencing effort.   
   
In addition, $300 million will establish six Centers of Excellence in
Genomic Epidemiology.  These Centers of Excellence will operate as
partnerships between state health departments and academic institutions,
and today’s funding will fuel cutting-edge research into genomic
epidemiology.  In this work, we will build our public health capacity to
respond not just to COVID-19, but to future concerning emerging threats
to public health.   
   
Yesterday, I testified before a congressional subcommittee, where I
shared my commitment to working with the Biden administration and
Congress to address longstanding vulnerabilities and core public health
infrastructure that presents challenges in the nation’s ongoing effort
to successfully tackle COVID-19.  Today’s announcement and this
investment substantially contribute toward that commitment.   
   
Finally, I want to comment on our ongoing surveillance of the safety
(inaudible) with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine we discussed on
Wednesday.  After the press briefing on Wednesday, the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices — or ACIP — met to discuss the six
cases and provide recommendations.   
   
I want to thank the ACIP for their thoughtful discussion and their
commitment to the science.  The recommendation from this group of
independent experts for a continued pause will allow additional time to
review any additional cases that might come in, and for them to conduct
a complete risk assessment and to evaluate the emerging science.  ACIP
will meet again this Friday, April 23rd, from 11:00 to 5:00 to provide
further recommendations.   
   
Importantly, the vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer are still
widely available, and we continue to work with pharmacies, states, and
FEMA to make sure the vaccine supply remains robust across the country
as we approach April 19th, when all Americans above age 16 or 18,
depending on the vaccine received, will be eligible for vaccination.   
   
If you have not been vaccinated, I want to encourage you to do so with
one of the available vaccines as soon as you can.  Widespread
vaccination is the only way we will ultimately move past this
pandemic.   
   
Thank you.  I’ll now turn things over to Dr. Fauci.   
   
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.  I would like to take
this opportunity now to call your attention — can I have the first
slide? — to the first — soon to be first-year anniversary of the
NIH-sponsored Coronavirus Disease 2019 Treatment Guidelines Panel.  
   
Next slide.  
   
This is a panel of individuals co-chaired by Dr. Cliff Lane, who is my
Deputy Director of NIAID, but also the Clinical Director of the
Institute; Henry Masur, who is the Director of the Critical Care
Medicine Unit at NIH; and Roy “Trip” Gulik, who is the Chief of
Infectious Diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.   
   
As you can see from this group, the members — some of you may recognize
— are people who are in the trenches every day, taking care of people
with COVID-19.  This panel was established to be able to work, literally
in real time, updating guidelines for clinicians and healthcare
providers throughout the country and the world on the latest
information.  And since information comes out not only in published
work, but also the results that are pre-publication of either clinical
trials or clinical observations, as well as expert opinion.   
   
Next slide.   
   
This is the list of the organizations that are represented on the panel
by the people that you saw in the previous slide.   
   
Next slide.  
   
As I mentioned, the anniversary is next week on the 21st of April. 
Since we began, one year ago, there have been close to 4 million users
in the United States, about 2,600,000 of which were international.  So
we are serving as a resource for clinicians throughout the world. 
Again, since the beginning, there have been over 14 million page views,
and there have been 23 separate updates to the treatment guidelines.   
   
Next slide.   
   
This is an important slide.  For those not used to looking at
guidelines, there’s varying degrees of strength of recommendation and
what the evidence for that recommendation is.  As you see on the left,
there is “A,” a strong recommendation for a statement; “B,” moderate;
“C,” optional.   
   
And on the right, it depends on what you’re basing this recommendation. 
If you get a “1,” that means there’s one or more randomized trials
without major limitations.  “2A” is other randomized trials or
subgroups.  “2b” is non-randomized trials.  And “3,” you don’t have a
trial but there’s expert opinion.  So obviously, a “1” — an “A-1” is a
very strong recommendation based on good data, but you’re going to see
others, depending upon what the evidence has been.   
   
Next slide.   
   
So, let me just then show you an example.  On April the 8th, eight days
ago, there was an update on the recommendation of the use of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies.  And the panel, after
deliberation, recommended using one of the following combinations — and
I underscore “combinations” — of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies
to treat outpatients — again, underscoring “outpatients” — with mild to
moderate COVID-19 at a high risk of clinical progression, as defined by
the Emergency Use Authorization criteria.  And these are the
combinations listed there: bamlanivimab, etesevimab; or casirivimab and
imdevimab.   
   
Number two, the treatment should be started as soon as possible after a
positive result on SARS-CoV-2 antigen and nucleic acid amplification and
within 10 days of symptom onset.   
   
Next slide.  
   
Now, the updated recommendations also have the following: Because the
clinical outcome data are limited and there are concerns regarding the
decrease of susceptibility of variants, the panel recommends against the
use of bamlanivimab monotherapy.  And that gets an “A-3”
recommendation.   
   
The panel also recommends against the use of these antibodies in people
who are hospitalized, except if it’s in a clinical trial.  However, the
use should be considered for persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 who
are hospitalized for a reason other than the underlying COVID-19 disease
but who otherwise meet the criteria.   
   
And on the last slide.  We often get asked, “If I have a patient coming
into the office who I think I might want to give a monoclonal antibody
to, how do I find out where and how to do that?”  This is the
information here.  Contact the Combat COVID Monoclonal Antibodies Call
Center at that telephone number and at that website.   
   
I’ll stop there and hand it over to Dr. Murthy.  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:  Well, thanks so much, Dr. Fauci.  And it’s good
to be with all of you this morning again.  Today, I’d like to speak with
you about two topics related to the national COVID-19 vaccination
effort.   
   
First, American Indian and Alaska Native people are at higher risk for
COVID disease and complications.  And historically, we also know that
they have faced more limited access to healthcare and great disparities
in health.   
   
According to a recent CDC report, American Indians and Alaska Natives
were 3.5 times more likely to get COVID than a non-Hispanic, white
population.  Native people are also more than four times likely to be
hospitalized as a result of COVID-19.   
   
Despite these challenges, our colleagues working in the Indian health
system have heroically administered more than 1 million doses of
COVID-19 vaccines.  That is a remarkable achievement and a testament to
their dedication.   
   
Today, the Biden administration is doubling down on this critical work
with a — with a $4 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan to
the Indian Health Service Tribal and urban Indian health programs. 
Specifically, these funds will support the following: expanded COVID-19
vaccinations, including mobile efforts, large-scale vaccination events,
and public education and outreach campaigns; expanded testing, contact
tracing, PPE access, and treatment; increased preventive health services
for those at higher risk for COVID-19; and increased support for
telehealth, the healthcare workforce, and the broader Indian healthcare
system, which has been a hard hit during the pandemic due to lost
reimbursements for care for both public and private insurance.  
   
Overall, we’re committed to reducing health disparities and ensuring
equity in our response to COVID-19.  And today’s funding announcement is
part of a broader commitment to increase access to vaccines and reduce
the spread of COVID-19 in hard-hit communities.   
   
Additionally, I want to emphasize one point in particular about vaccines
which isn’t always so obvious, and that’s the following: Increasing
access to vaccines is critical for increasing confidence in vaccines.   
   
And here’s why: The more people see those around and get vaccinated,
particularly family and friends, the more comfortable they become with
getting vaccinated themselves.  So the easier we make it to get
vaccinated, the more people will get vaccinated, and that means more
people around them would feel comfortable with getting vaccine
themselves.  And that’s why access and confidence go hand in hand, and
so does safety.   
   
Which brings me to the second topic.  This week you’ve heard a lot from
us about the pause with administering the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19
vaccine.  These decisions are never simple, and this one was taken after
a very careful assessment of the risks and benefits of calling for such
a pause.  But the actions taken by CDC and the FDA this week should give
Americans confidence that our safety system is working for them.   
   
For some members of the public, uncertainty about getting vaccinated
stems from questions about how safe the vaccines are.  And this week is
a reminder that safety is our top priority.  Even when an extremely rare
safety occurs, our scientific agencies will act with thoroughness and
transparency so people can remain confident in the vaccines that are
recommended to them.   
    
And as much attention as the J&J news has received though, what I’m most
concerned about — the numbers which are most on my mind are the rising
cases in hospitalizations among those who are not vaccinated.   
    
Over the past year, the virus keeps reminding us that the risks of
actually getting COVID are quite significant.  It’s cost us more than
500,000 friends and family members and has led to hospitalizations and
prolonged symptoms for many, many more.   
   
We all want the same thing, which is to turn this pandemic around and
protect ourselves and our loved ones.  And to that end, our best path
forward remains getting vaccinated and continuing to take the prevention
measures that we know work: wearing a mask, washing our hands, and
avoiding indoor gatherings with people outside of our household.   
   
We’re really fortunate to have highly effective vaccines and a system
that’s working day and night to keep us safe.  That gives me faith that
we will make it through this pandemic together.  
   
Thank you so much, and we’ll look forward to your questions.     
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  All right.  Thank you.  I think we have
time for a few questions.  
   
MODERATOR:  We only have a few minutes for questions today, so please,
please keep your questions to one question.  
   
First, we’ll go to Weijia at CBS.  
   
Q    Hi there.  Thanks for taking my question.  Can you lay out what the
administration has done to (inaudible) Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?  And
did the trial include a booster shot so people know what to expect,
medically, if they have to get one?  
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  I think you’re going to — I’m going to
ask you to repeat that because you cut out in the middle.   
   
Q    Sure.  I’m just looking for specifics about what the administration
has done or is doing to acquire enough booster shots for people in the
case that it — that they need them for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines,
and whether the booster was part of the trial so people know what to
expect, medically, if they get one in terms of the side effects. 
Thanks.   
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  Got it.  I’ll take the first half of
that.  And then, in terms of side effects or anything like that, I’d
just turn it to Dr. Fauci for that.   
   
So, look, we often get accused of being hyper-focused on preparation,
preparing for multiple scenarios.  We talk about that in here a lot. 
Requiring additional shots in the future is obviously a foreseeable
potential event.  I want to emphasize that while there is certainly
speculation about this, that is far from saying that that is what’s
going to happen.  I would, again, invite Dr. Fauci to comment on that.
   
   
But I can assure you that when we do our planning, when we do our — the
President orders purchases of additional vaccines, as he has done, and
when we focus on all of the production expansion opportunities that we
talk about in here, we very much have scenarios like that in mind, as
well as, obviously, vaccinating our teens and our children.  So very,
very important for all of us.  
   
Dr. Fauci, would you — what would you add to that?  
   
DR. FAUCI:  Yeah, regarding the clinical trials, in fact, ongoing
already are clinical trials looking at a boost of the original wild-type
virus vaccine, as well as a boost with a variant-specific — in this
case, the variant is 351, the problematic one from South Africa.   
   
So, in direct answer to your question, there are already clinical trial
looking at both the safety of it, obviously, but as well as whether or
not a boost of wild-type versus a boost of variant-specific increases
the ability of the antisera to ultimately neutralize both the wild-type
and the variant.  
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.   
   
Next question.  
   
MODERATOR:  Katherine Eban at Vanity Fair.  
   
Q    Thank you for taking my question.  What I would like to hear you
all discuss is: If we are able to — and it looks like we’re right on
track to do it — vaccinate a solid majority of the country, what happens
to the public health picture here if and when a large majority of the
rest of the world remains unvaccinated?  How will that impact the public
health situation here at home or put pressure on us, medically?   
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  So, Dr. Fauci, do you want to start with
that?  And, Dr. Walensky, Dr. Murthy, you’re welcome to add if you have
additional pieces.  
   
DR. FAUCI:  Sure.  Well, obviously, as we have said very often — all of
us on this call — that a pandemic that is a global pandemic requires a
global response.   
   
And even if we get good control in our country, which we feel that we
will — confident that we will, the fact is that as long as there’s
active dynamics of infection somewhere in the world, there always is
somewhat of a threat that variants will emerge in those parts of the
world and, because we’re such an interconnected planet here, that it
might actually be an issue that we will have to deal with as a challenge
of keeping an eye on the possibility that variants will arise that we
will have to make adjustments to, from the standpoint of vaccines as
well as maintaining a certain degree of public health guideline control
from a public health standpoint.  
   
I’d be happy to hear from Dr. Walensky if you have any other comments
from that, Rochelle.  
   
DR. WALENSKY:  Yeah, I would just say that I think we have a
responsibility to vaccinate the rest of the world, both from a
humanitarian standpoint as well as from a global health security
standpoint, to ensure that we don’t have further variants that threaten
both the rest of the world as well as the United States.   
   
And I look forward to having CDC — where we have partnerships across the
globe — to having a key role in providing technical assistance and
support to make that happen.  
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  Yeah, obviously a key priority of the
Biden administration: to both vaccinate our own country, but also the
leadership role we’re taking in the world.  
   
I think we have time for one more question.  
   
MODERATOR:  Let’s go to Kaitlan Collins at CNN.  
   
Q    Thanks so much.  My question is on the J&J vaccine.  Since you just
announced that the vaccine advisors to the CDC aren’t going to meet
again until next Friday, that means this pause is now lasting more than
a week.  So aren’t you concerned that the longer this pause lasts, the
more damage it does to the reputation of the J&J vaccine and people’s
willingness to get it?  
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  Dr. Walensky?  
   
DR. WALENSKY:  Thank you for that question, Kaitlan.  This was a really
— a meeting that we had with ACIP this week.  The independent panel
suggested that they needed more data; they needed time to look at both
the risk and the risk-benefit analysis that has been — that CDC is
actively conducting, as well as to see if any further cases came in.   
   
We will meet next Friday.  We recognize the critical importance of
moving quickly.  That’s why we will have two unscheduled ACIP meetings
in a 10-day period — or 14-day period.  And so, we are moving.   
   
And what I would say to the American people is that what we found is
really extremely rare cases, through our vaccine safety monitoring
system.  And that we are transparently — this meeting on Friday will be
public.  People can dial in.  We are transparently conveying that
science.  We’ve reached out to over 10,000 providers to sort of, to
ensure that they know what kinds of cases to look for and to do that
outreach.  And we want to convey to the American public: We have two
vaccines that are readily available — the Pfizer and the Moderna — and
people should continue to roll up their sleeves to get vaccinated.   
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  Dr. Murthy, you made earlier comments
about this safety priority that the country is placing and
demonstrating.  Do you want to reiterate some of your points.  
   
SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:  Sure.  And, Kaitlan, let me just say: Look,
when — when events like this happen, when we take these kind of
measures, we recognize that, for some people, it will raise questions. 
And we want to answer those questions, and that’s why what you’ve seen
just over the last few days is really concerted effort not only to do
the safety investigation, but to communicate openly and transparently
with people about what’s going on.   
   
And that’s why, in addition to the calls that Dr. Walensky mentioned
with tens of thousands of healthcare professionals, we’ve also convened
thousands of community organizations to talk to them — faith
organizations and sports organizations, other community-based
organizations.   
   
We’ve also, you know, as you’ve probably noticed, had administration
officials and others out in media to speak to people in national,
regional, and local press.  Again, use as many channels as we have to
communicate with people.  And we’ll continue to do that because we want
to be — we want people to know what we know.   
   
And finally, let me just say this: Our message has been consistent,
which is that, number one, this is — this pause was about the Johnson &
Johnson vaccine.  If people have appointments to get the Pfizer and
Moderna vaccine, we want them to keep those appointments.  We have great
faith in the effectiveness of those vaccines, and they have very strong
safety profiles.   
   
Second, even if you’ve received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the vast
and overwhelming likelihood is that you will be just fine.  I know that
people have questions about this given the cases they’ve heard about,
but keep in mind that more than 7 million people have received the
Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and we feel quite confident that the vast,
vast majority of them, again, are just going to be fine.   
   
And third, just remember, this is your safety system working for you —
what you are seeing right now.  A signal came up, the FDA and CDC jumped
on it immediately to — and decided to investigate thoroughly.  And
that’s what’s happening.  And that, if anything, I believe, should
increase people’s confidence that they’re being told what’s going on and
that any si- — you know, signals are being investigated.   
   
We want people to have confidence the vaccines that we are recommending
are safe and they’re effective, and this is how we do that.   
   
ACTING ADMINISTRATOR SLAVITT:  Kaitlan, I think this is the purpose of
having the top clinical leaders in the country talking directly to you
and to the public.  The demonstration that incredibly rare events — we
also have to face the fact that we have lost 560,000 Americans and that
vaccines save lives.  125 million Americans have gone and gotten
vaccinated, and the results, as we can see, are quite incredible.   
   
So we hope Americans see that, in giving them the straight facts, we
trust them to do the homework, make the decision to get vaccinated, and
it’s the right decision for them and their families.   
   
So, with that, I think we’re going to close.  And we will talk to you
next week.  Thank you.
