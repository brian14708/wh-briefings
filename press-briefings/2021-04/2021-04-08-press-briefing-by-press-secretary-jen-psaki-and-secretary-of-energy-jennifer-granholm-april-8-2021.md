  \ Granholm, April 8,\_2021"

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:44 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  We have another member of the
President’s Jobs Cabinet joining us today: Secretary of Energy Jennifer
Granholm.  
   
Secretary Granholm is just the second woman to lead the Department of
Energy, where she will help America achieve President Biden’s goal of
net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. She’ll do this by advancing
cutting-edge clean energy technologies, creating millions of good-paying
union clean energy jobs, and building an equitable clean energy
future.   
   
Secretary Granholm was the first woman elected Governor of Michigan,
serving two terms from 2003 to 2011.  As governor, she successfully led
efforts to diversify the state’s economy, strengthen its auto industry,
preserve the manufacturing sector, and add emerging sectors, such as
clean energy, to Michigan’s economic portfolio.  
   
Today, one third of all North American electric vehicle battery
production takes place in Michigan.  The state is one of the top five
states for clean energy patents, and 126,000 Michiganders were employed
in the clean energy sector prior to COVID-19.  
   
She also was the first woman elected Attorney General of Michigan and
served as the state’s top law enforcement officer from 1998 to 2002.

As always, she can take a few questions.  I’ll be the bad cop.  And with
that, I’ll turn it over to you.  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Great.  Great.  I get to bring my binder, too. 
(Laughter.)  The double binder stack here.  
   
Thank you so much, Jen.  I really am privileged to be able to share the
podium with you today.  And good afternoon, everybody.  
   
So, you know, I think that President Biden asked me to be the Secretary
of Energy because I was the governor during a time when the auto
industry was on its knees and when autoworkers were finding themselves
out of work through no fault of their own.  I feel like I’ve looked into
the eyes of people who have been desperate and at a loss more times than
I can count.  
   
And I was also governor when we invested to diversify Michigan’s economy
to build car 2.0, which is the electric vehicle — and the guts to that
vehicle, the battery.  And now here we are, 12 years later, and General
Motors is saying that their entire fleet is going to be electrified.   
   
It is a huge distance that we’ve traveled, and so much of that is thanks
to the decision by the federal government to invest in saving the
backbone of the manufacturing industry, which was at that point the
electric — or the vehicle industry.  And the Obama-Biden efforts really
made a statement and worked.   
   
And so we can do so much more than what we did in Michigan, and this is
what the American Jobs Plan is all about.  I’m so — I feel so happy for
America that we have a President who wants to invest in our country and
in our workers and in our manufacturing.  
   
And so, to me, the fact that there is out there, globally, a $23
trillion market for clean energy products, for products that will reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, is a massive opportunity for this country. 
And you better believe that other countries are seeing that opportunity
as well, and our economic competitors are working to corner the market
on those opportunities.  Countries like China are pressing their foot on
the pedal and revving up their electric engines, and they are thrilled
to see that the United States is standing still while they are working
to create jobs for their people.   
   
When I — after I was finished being governor, I traveled to China to see
their clean energy efforts.  It was with a group.  And we went to a
city, and I was standing next to the mayor of the city in China, and
during a demonstration, he leaned over to me and he said, “So when do
you think the United States is going to get a clean energy plan?”  And
at this point — and this was several years ago — I said, “Oh, I don’t
know.  There’s so much polarization.  It’s difficult in Congress to get
consensus.”  And he just looked at me and he smiled, and he said, “Take
your time.”  “Take your time.”  Because they saw our passivity as their
opportunity.  And it’s not just in China; it’s in other countries
too.   
   
Understandably, countries want to corner this market on clean energy
products because we have 195 countries who have committed to lowering
their greenhouse gas emissions.   
   
So the question is: Where are those products going to be built, and who
are they going to be built by?  And it’s going to take a lot of work,
literally.  We need millions of people in the United States working to
lower greenhouse gas emissions.  And we all know that, in the 21st
century, making sure that we have the right infrastructure is
critical.   
   
Infrastructure is, yes, roads and bridges, but it is ports and airports,
and it is trains, and it is the pipes that pump water into our homes,
and it is the broadband that brings the world and learning to our
children; it’s the broadband that brings economic opportunity to our
businesses.  Of course, it’s the electrical grid that keeps the lights
on.  After what happened in Texas, can anybody really doubt that
electricity and the electric grid is part of the foundation of who we
are as a nation?  And we need to invest in it if we want to make sure
power keeps coming to our homes.   
   
There was an interesting poll that was done in February by Consumer
Reports, and they found that 76 percent of Americans think that
broadband is as important as electricity and water.  Water.  I mean, how
can we not agree that broadband  
is infrastructure?  And yet, we have been disinvesting in infrastructure
as a nation, for decades.  In infrastructure, in research and
development, and in manufacturing — all of them we have been
disinvesting in.  
   
Infrastructure, as you know, is now the smallest share of our economy
since World War Two.  We are at a 72-year low with respect to
manufacturing.  Research and development has been dropping since the
1960s.  China and our economic competitors are investing in research and
development because they want to seize the future; they want to surpass
the United States.  And if we allow that to happen, we will be weaker as
a nation, and we will fall.  And we cannot do that.  
   
And that’s what this American Jobs Plan is all about.  So we can’t just
sit around saying, “We need to do this.  It’s bipartisan.”  We know that
Republicans and Democrats — it’s a joke in Washington, Infrastructure
Week.  And Democrats and Republicans have been making that joke, but
it’s not a joke anymore.  We need to get it done.  And there is
bipartisan support for these elements — these basic elements.   
   
So starting on Inauguration Day, just to say a word about what DOE,
Department of Energy, has been doing: We’ve been rolling out efforts to
research and development, and deploy clean energy technologies, with an
eye toward creating jobs.  And if the American Jobs Plan passes, this
will be able to be put on steroids.   
   
So in the past two weeks, just as an example, we made two announcements
on research.  One — or one on research, and one on deployment of
offshore wind.  The research one was to cut the cost of solar by half,
yet again, in the next 10 years.  And on offshore wind, it was to add 30
gigawatts of offshore wind energy on the Atlantic Seaboard, again,
within 10 years.   
   
Today we are announcing another two ser- — two funding opportunities for
clean energy technology.  One of them is to create next-generation
biofuels for airplanes and ships, which are very hard to electrify, and
the second is to announce clean energy technology funding opportunity to
reduce methane emissions from the coal, oil, and gas industry.  And as
many of you know, methane is an extremely potent and dangerous
greenhouse gas.  
   
But these investments are really just a down payment on what we need to
do as a nation, and the American Jobs project will take us the rest of
the way.   
   
And I want to emphasize the — because I’ve been meeting with so many
stakeholders on this — the true importance of ensuring that 40 percent
of the benefits of the American Jobs Plan go to communities that have
been left behind or unseen — people who have been in the shadows of
power plants and whose children have to gasp to breathe or use an
inhaler.   
   
We need to remedy a moral wrong and make those investments, and the
American Jobs Plan will allow us to do that.  It’s a once-in-a-century
investment to seize a once-in-a-century opportunity.  That’s what the
people elected Joe Biden to do, and we’ve waited far too long to do it. 
So we’re going to get it done, and we’re going to put America to work.  
   
And I’m happy to take any questions.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let’s start.  Zeke.  
   
Q    Thank you, Secretary.  If I can shift gears a little bit, one of
the things in the President’s infrastructure package was investments in
nuclear — advanced nuclear development.  One of the things I know you
mentioned — or you reiterated during your confirmation hearing is the
President’s opposition to funding for a nuclear fuel repository in Yucca
Mountain.  Where does the Biden administration plan to store the
nation’s spent radioactive nuclear fuel?  And what’s the ongoing process
of that review?   
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Yeah, you’ll — some of you may recall there was a
bipartisan commission on what to do about spent nuclear fuel.  There has
to be a consent-based process to be able to do that.  We are beginning
that work inside of the Department of Energy.  We have to find a
solution, but it has to be based on, you know, community agreement.  
   
Q    Is there a timetable for that review when you —   
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  We’ll make an announcement — we’ll be making an
announcement on that; I’m not ready to say yet.  
   
Q    And then just — sorry, just changing gears again — the last
administration invested heavily in the nation’s nuclear triad — the
development of new and improved nuclear weaponry.  Is the policy of this
administration that a lot of this development falls under your
department to continue that R&D — that expensive R&D to modernize the
nation’s nuclear arsenal?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  We have to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal. 
We have to keep and maintain the stockpile to make sure that it is safe
and effective.  And we will continue to do that to ensure that we can
deter nuclear aggression from other countries.  So our nuclear deterrent
is important and it is embedded in the values of that stockpile, and
we’ll make sure that our people are safe.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Kaitlan.   
   
Q    Thank you so much.  I’ve heard you talk about the corporate tax
rate and what they want to do with this infrastructure bill.  Can this
infrastructure bill be successful with a 25 percent corporate tax
rate?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  You know, as the President has said, this is a
negotiation.  And he really does want to hear from Democrats and
Republicans about what would be acceptable to get this across the line. 
So there is room for negotiation, but his point is that it has to be
paid for.  And so, if it’s not a 28 percent, what — what else is it?   
   
And we’re very encouraged by those who have been bringing ideas forth,
and we are hopeful that — especially when Congress gets back next week —
that those discussions can begin in earnest.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mary.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You’re one of the five Cabinet secretaries that the
President has tasked with engaging with Congress on this.  You mentioned
the President is willing to negotiate.  He says he’s open to alternative
ways to pay for this if Republicans put forth any.  In your
conversations at all, have you heard any such alternatives from
Republican members?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  I have.  (Laughs.)   
   
Q    Any you’d love to share?   
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Yeah, I’m not going to make announcements for
them.  They obviously want to bring forth their own ideas, but I have
heard alternatives, yes.   
   
Q    And the President also asked you to help engage the public in
selling this plan.  You haven’t hit the road yet though.  Is that
something that you plan to do in the coming weeks?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Well, we’re going to be taking our guidance, you
know, from the White House, in terms of what’s safe, et cetera.   
   
We’ve certainly been hitting the Zoom and making our case through that
and the phones.  So we’ll see, you know, how it goes.  There is a period
of time that we have to be able to do this, but we want to make sure
that it’s safe.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Tamara.  
   
Q    Yeah, in terms of the negotiations — the discussions with Congress
— is there a deadline, is there a timeframe that — where this turns into
a pumpkin?  Or do you just go it alone?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Yeah, I mean, I don’t know if you want to answer
that, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ll have a whole briefing after this.  (Laughs.)  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Yeah, I mean, I know that they said that they would
like to see progress by Memorial Day, and hopefully we can start to see
that.  But, obviously, those meetings have to begin in earnest next
week.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Francesca.  
   
Q    Thank you.  What do you say to Americans working in the oil and gas
industry in California and elsewhere who say that these have been
good-paying jobs that have given them access to the middle class?   
   
And what, if anything, can the federal government do to ensure that
these clean energy jobs, like the ones that you described, are as good
as the ones that they’ll be replacing?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Yeah, this is a great question.  And we — this is
why the American Jobs Plan is very specifically targeting communities in
coal and power plant areas, in gas and in natural gas.  There are
billions of dollars in this bill for the technologies that will reduce
CO2 emissions in those — in those industries.  For example, carbon
capture, use, and sequestration — I don’t mean to get too technical —
but hydrogen deployment and demonstration projects.   
   
I’ve been talking with my counterparts around the world; there is a huge
appetite for a partnership with America on these next-generation
technologies that will reduce CO2 emissions from that kind of baseline
power.  Those jobs, in those kinds of technologies, are good-paying
jobs.  Those are jobs that are going to be for welders and sheet metal
workers and all of the trades.  And we’re going to, as we put out
funding opportunities, ensure that there are project labor agreements
that the people who are working in them are paid — under Davis-Bacon —
are paid prevailing wage.   
   
So we want to create good-paying jobs all across the country, and there
will be millions of them if this is passed.  The opportunities — this is
why we’ve been having a huge number of discussions with our brothers and
sisters in the labor movement, in the building trades, to make sure that
we do this in a way that gives their workers opportunity, and it will. 
And that’s why they’re supportive of it.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Steve.  
   
Q    You mentioned the next-generation biofuels for airplanes and
ships.  When should we expect something like that to come online, when
we’ll see planes flying with biofuel?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Yeah, well, it’s going to take — I mean, obviously,
we got to get started on it.  And this is a research opportunity; it is
not a deployment opportunity.  
   
But they’re — because funding opportunities really accelerate so much
appetite for the technology, and because there have been a lot of
breakthroughs — in fact, the airline industry itself has been investing
in next-generation biofuels to be able to demonstrate that it can be
used.  So, you know, without saying specifically, I think in — certainly
within 5 to 10 years, we will be able to see this deployed and available
for both shipping and for air.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Last question to Nancy.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I’m wondering how — you’re talking about how the
American Jobs Plan, if it passed, would create good jobs.  I’m wondering
what levers that the federal government has to ensure that those jobs
will be, you know, at a certain wage scale, have benefits.  Like, what
can you do to enforce that?  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Yeah, I mean, as we know, the federal government
has many mechanisms for pushing out funding, and that includes bidding
on projects, and that includes passing — passing it through for — in
competitions, et cetera.  In those opportunities, you can put — you
know, attach strings to make sure that these are good-paying jobs, that
they have project labor agreements, et cetera.   
   
And so, I know it is — and it’s true with respect to the federal
government’s buying power, as well as procurement power.  We want to
make sure that we create good-paying jobs for all kinds of people in
every pocket of America, and that means good-paying union jobs.  So
we’re going to use every — every lever possible to be able to do that,
including, if you want to bid on this, you’ve got to make sure that you
have a project labor agreement.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you, Secretary Granholm —  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  All right.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — for joining us.  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Good luck.  
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Wait, I got to grab my — my mask.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go — go ahead.  Sorry.   
   
Okay.  A couple items at the top.  As President Biden noted in a
proclamation issued on Sunday, we are marking Holocaust Remembrance Day
this week.  Today, we rededicate ourselves to standing in solidarity
with the Jewish people in America, Israel, and around the world, and to
remembering the horrors of the Holocaust.  An estimated 6 million Jews
perished alongside millions of other innocent victims around the
world.   
   
We honor the memories of precious lives lost, reflect on the
incomprehensible wounds to our humanity and the lessons learned, and
mourn for the communities broken and scattered.  And we embrace
Holocaust survivors, some of whom are still with us.  They deserve our
continued support to live in dignity.  
   
With that, a short — short topper.  I only had one today.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And a Secretary.   
   
Q    So, on the President’s gun announcement, he announced he’s going to
ask Congress to take action to repeal gun manufacturers’ liability
protections.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes  
   
Q    That had been a day-one promise of his.  When should we expect to
see that text sent to the Hill?  And, you know, if it was a priority —
if it is as big a priority as he said it was for him just a few minutes
ago, you know, why — how much effort is the President willing to put
into gun control right now, when so much of the administration’s focus
right now is on the infrastructure plan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say that there has been legislation
introduced in past congresses, and we certainly hope — and he’s calling
for members to reintroduce legislation on gun liabilities for
manufacturers.  It is an issue that he talked about on the campaign
trail.  And he continues to believe that addressing that, holding
manufacturers to the same account as other industries is pivotal in
keeping our communities safe, keeping our family safe, and addressing
the threat of gun violence across the country.   
   
So what he is calling for is for the introduction of legislation, of
which there has been past versions.   
   
I will say that this has been an issue that the President has been
working on for decades throughout his career.  He helped pass the Brady
Bill.  He helped get a — get a — ban assault weapons back in the ‘90s. 
He believes that taking additional steps on background checks, that
putting in place an assault weapons ban again are pivotal to keeping our
country safe.  He strongly supports the background check bills — the two
that have passed the House.   
   
It is imperative for any President to walk and chew gum at the same
time; to continue to push for, to advocate for, to use the bully pulpit
of the Rose Garden to push forward a range of agenda items.  And he
certainly will continue to do that on putting in place commonsense gun
safety measures.   
   
Q    A couple of weeks ago, in his press conference, the President sort
of said, you know, sequencing is important here, and then essentially
acknowledging that maybe — you know, the President can walk and chew
gum, maybe Congress can’t.  And the President decided to put
infrastructure before gun control, before climate change, before some of
these other issues.  Why is — why are guns not going before
infrastructure?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Congress plays the role — the Senate and the House —
in moving legislation forward.  And at any given time, there are
multiple pieces of legislation moving their way through committees,
moving their way through the House, moving their way to the Senate.  
   
There are two background check bills that have passed the House that can
move to the Senate.  He certainly is an advocate for those while, at the
same time, being an advocate for moving forward on the American Jobs
Plan.   
   
Q    And then, finally — a different topic: On Afghanistan, should we
expect to hear from the President before May 1 about what he will do
with American troops still there?  I mean, it seems they’re either going
to stay there beyond the — sort of — time is running out to vote for an
order of withdrawal for troops still there right now.  Is that an
accurate assessment: that there will be troops there on May 2nd?   
   
And then in terms of — what is the President’s message to the American
people?  Why is it in their interest for their troops to be serving in
harm’s way overseas beyond this month?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to get ahead of the President’s decision
and announcement.  I expect you will hear from him before May 1st.  He
has been consistent and clear that it is operationally challenging to
get troops out by May 1, which is not a deadline he put in place; it is
a timeline put in place by the prior administration.   
   
And there are certainly conditions on the ground, including efforts —
diplomacy efforts to negotiate with the Taliban, that have been underway
for the last several weeks.  But he will — you will certainly hear from
him.  And once you do, we can absolutely have a conversation about where
we go from here.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Given the narrow majorities in the House and the
Senate right now, does the President think enacting universal background
checks this year is doomed?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think the President is going to leave the analysis of
what’s viable and doable to all of you and people on the outside.  And
certainly, he’s not vote counting himself.  But he has — he is also
clear-eyed about the challenges in moving forward with legislation with
the current makeup of the Senate.   
   
He is going to continue to advocate for that, as he did just today, just
this morning in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest and
most courageous advocates for gun control, gun safety legislation in the
country.  But he also is not going to wait.   
   
And he — that’s why he took action on — announced several steps that can
be taken in the form of executive actions, in the form of guidance, and
in the form of nominating someone to lead the ATF, because he feels you
can’t wait and he’s going to use the power of his presidency to take
steps forward.  
   
Q    Because this gets a little bit of what Zeke was getting at.  I
mean, we have a Jobs Cabinet now.  We have face-to-face and Zoom
meetings ongoing with Republicans and Democrats on infrastructure. 
Should we anticipate a Gun Control Cabinet or meetings with Republicans
about this issue?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly would anticipate the President will raise this
issue in a range of conversations he has with members of Congress. 
There — this obviously is slightly different, given the role of the
Attorney General in measures on gun safety and — as is evidenced by the
fact that he was present there today.  So it’s a bit different from a
Jobs Cabinet.  
   
But I can assure you for members where this is appropriate, where it’s
an appropriate role for them to play; for members of the administration,
in the White House and otherwise, to communicate with members of
Congress, that will certainly continue to be at the top of our list.  
   
Q    Two other unrelated things, real quick.  The U.S. and Iran are
engaged in indirect nuclear talks this week.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Will Americans detained in Iran be part of those discussions?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly, Americans detained in Iran is an issue that we
have raised with partners around the world and those who are having
direct discussions with the Iranians.  In terms of the focus and content
of these discussions, I know they’ll do a readout when they conclude the
meetings, likely tomorrow.  
   
Q    And beyond what Secretary Blinken — I know he held a meeting with
families or representatives of them early on.  Can you give us a sense
of what else may be ongoing in this regard?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In the effort to get —  
   
Q    Americans back from Iran.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — Americans who are detained?  You know, the efforts would
certainly be led by our diplomats and our negotiators out of the State
Department, hence your reference to Secretary of State Tony Blinken.   
   
And obviously, these discussions are often raised through different
channels we have with the Iranians, given the fact that we’re not
currently having direct talks on — on even issues like the nuclear
negotiations.  But I’m not going to have an update beyond that from
here.   
   
Q    And then tomorrow, the Army Corps of Engineers will be in a federal
court hearing regarding the fate of the Dakota Access Pipeline.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Is it the administration’s belief that construction of the pipeline
should continue?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our view is that we would look at each pipeline through —
each individual pipeline separately and do an analysis of the costs and
benefits on the environment and jobs, which is my assumption would be
happening here.  So I don’t have an assessment of that, but we look at
each of them individually.  
   
Q    Conceivably, we’d get that tomorrow at the court hearing though.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — I’m —  
   
Q    Because there was a delay, I guess, in considering this, given that
the administration asked for more time.  So I’m sort of trying to figure
out if we may get that tomorrow.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It wouldn’t come from the White House, presumably, but I can
certainly check if there’s an expected timeline that we can share from
here.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks.  Following up on Zeke’s question on the manufacturer
liability bill: The President just said that if God granted him one item
on his to-do list, it would be to get this done — to make it so that gun
manufacturers can be held liable.  It is something he promised on day
one.  It is day 78.  What’s the holdup here?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s no holdup.  It just — legislation needs to be
reintroduced.  There are a number of members in Congress who are strong
advocates for exactly what the President supports, share his view about
the impact.  And we’re certainly hopeful, and encourage them to move
forward on that legislation — reintroduce it.  
   
Q    But the President plan — promised to send his own plan.  You know,
it’s clear that you’re waiting to see how this works its way through
Congress, but why not put out your own bill, lead the charge on this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He is leading the charge by advocating for this moving
forward, by using the bully pulpit of his presidency and of the Rose
Garden to advocate for this legislation moving forward.   
   
It is the role of Congress, of course, to push legislation forward, to
vote on it, to move it through committees.  And he certainly is hopeful
they’ll do exactly that on this issue.   
   
Q    The President did suggest recently that, you know, tackling this is
a long-term issue, as he put it.  Given the recent shootings, does he
still see it that way?  Does he still see this as a long-term issue?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think he certainly sees it as an issue that we won’t solve
overnight, so yes.  He sees and is encouraged by the actions that we’ve
seen across states.   
   
Take red flag laws, as an example.  There are 19 states, many of — have
implemented those laws in just the last few years.  We know that they’re
impactful.  In many places, there’s bipartisan support for that.  What —
one of the announcements he made today was that we will be putting
forward guidance to make it easier for states to put forward those
laws.   
   
He knows that sometimes the first action doesn’t happen at the federal
level; it can happen at the state level.  We’ve certainly seen that on a
range of issues, and we’ve seen that on gun safety legislation as well. 
So he’s — he’s encouraged by that, but knows that it can be a long
journey.   
   
Q    And has he been in touch with — with Leader Schumer about the next
steps forward, especially on these bills that have passed the House?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  He — as you know, he’s regularly in touch with Leader
Schumer, who shares his commitment and concerns about the impact of gun
violence on our communities, on — on this country.  And they certainly
discussed this among a range of other issues.   
   
Q    The President does — I actually have it here: the list of all the
promises that he made during the campaign of gun actions that he wanted
to take.  Obviously, you’re doing what — what you think you can
unilaterally, waiting for these measures to work its way through
Congress.  Does the President feel that he’s doing everything he can to
meet the scope of these commitments right now?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, today, the administration announced initial actions to
address gun violence.  There will be more.  That is absolutely his
commitment.  And he also will use the power of his presidency, his
voice, his political will to advocate for actions in Congress.  
   
He also recognizes that there are incredible roles to be played by many
of the gun safety groups and leaders that were here today, who have
helped pass laws in states across the country on everything from
background checks to red flag laws — efforts that have had a measurable
impact in states to reduce incidents of gun violence, of homicide, of
suicide as a result of guns.  So he will remain engaged with those
groups and those leaders as well, and he will work on this on — through
many levers.   
   
Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q    With these ghost guns, they can basically be bought, printed, and
assembled at home.  So how is the President confident that this rule can
be enforced?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s a rule that is being put in place by the
Department of Justice.  It is certainly a step to make that more
difficult, to regulate an area of gun production that has not been
regulated previously.  So it’s something that will have to be worked
through — through law enforcement officials around the country, through
the Department of Justice.  
   
Q    Right, but if you’re, like, doing it at your house, how are they
going to know to be able to enforce that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there’s the purchase of kits, of course.  That’s part
of it.  But certainly putting in place steps to make it more difficult,
to make it harder, to regulate the ability to gain access to ghost guns,
ghost gun kits is certainly a step forward, in our view.   
   
Q    Okay.  My other question is on the ATF nominee.  When is he
expecting to formally nominate David Chipman to this role?  
MS. PSAKI:  You mean put forward his nomination to Congress?  I would —
I would expect quite soon.  I don’t think there’s any reason for a delay
of that.  
   
I will say that David Chipman, who — for others who are not as familiar
with his background, because I know there’s been a Twitter about him out
there — but he has 25 years of experience at the ATF.  He has helped
with the 1993 World Trade Center bomb.  He helped invest- — he helped —
while he was there, there was investigations into the World Trade Center
bombing and Oklahoma City bombing.  He’s overseen complex firearms
trafficking cases.  And he is a gun owner himself.  
   
So the President’s view is there’s no one better to lead the ATF.  He’s
certainly looking forward to putting his nomination forward, and I
expect there would be no delay in that.  
   
Q    Given his history as a gun control advocate, is the White House
worried that this is going to be an uphill battle to get him
confirmed?  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s up to Congress.  He’s also somebody who — he has
certainly been an advocate for gun safety measures, but he also has 25
years of experience at the ATF.  He’s been involved in play- — he’s
played a pivotal role in investigations.  He is a gun owner himself.  
   
So he has a broad swath of qualifications, and certainly we believe he’s
somebody who should be seriously considered by Congress.  
   
Q    So you’re confident he can get confirmed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that’s up to the Senate.  We — the President gets to
pick who he wants to nominate.  He’s nominated somebody who is
qualified, who has decades of experience, who is a gun owner himself. 
And it is up to the Senate to decide if they move forward with his
nomination.  
   
Q    My last question, sorry, is on the refugee cap that the President
has proposed raising to 62,500, but he’s not actually formally signed
the paperwork yet.  Is the White House still committed to raising that
cap to 62,500 by this fiscal year?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.   
   
Q    And so we should expect that before October?  And it’s not going to
change from 62,500? — is my other question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t anticipate that.  It is — that it would change, I
should say.  It is — remains — the President remains committed to
raising the cap.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, I — following on Kaitlan, have you — have you counted
the votes?  Do think that Chipman can be confirmed by Democrats alone? 
It seems as though there may be at least one Democrat who I can think of
who has a decent grade with the NRA and may not support an ATF
director.   
   
Are there any Republicans that you could win over?  Or is this going to
be a nomination that languishes, like so many other ATF directors have
in the past?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re certainly familiar with the history.  The President
would not have nominated him if he didn’t think he was qualified and
didn’t think he was someone that the Senate, members of both parties,
should give fair hearing to seriously consider confirming.  
   
But we just announced his nomination today, so I don’t have an
assessment of the legislative outlook quite yet.   
   
Q    Okay.  Quickly, when is the address to a joint session of
Congress?  Have you figured out that or the logistics on that — what
it’ll look like?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can’t wait until we can announce this.  I —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m with you.  We can all share our joy on that.  We are
still working through and finalizing the date, the logistics.  The
President remains committed to delivering a joint session.  We’re
working with leaders in Congress to finalize that.  We certainly hope
we’ll have more to say soon.   
   
Q    On another matter, General Motors has halted production in North
America at several factories and extended shutdowns because of this
semiconductor chip shortage.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    It’s disrupting the auto industry.  And I’m wondering: Are there
any short-term measures that the federal government can take to help
with the shortage?  Is there anything that can be done?  
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that we fully recognize that this is
an issue that is impacting industries across the country, including the
auto industry.   
   
Earlier this year, the President held a meeting in his office with a
bipartisan, bicameral group.  He continues to work — he feels there’s
opportunity to work with members of both parties on addressing what is a
very challenging issue for many industries.  
   
There’s — there’s a 100-day review that is ongoing, which we plan to
share the outcome of with the American people soon, and we’re certainly
looking through that review at undertaking — the review is focused, I
should say, on undertaking the first-ever, whole-of-government approach
to building a resilient, diverse, and secure supply chain to help
address this issue for the long term so that we are not just dealing
with a short-term emergency.   
   
The President has also proposed — included, I should say — $50 billion
to create an office at the Commerce Department dedicated to monitoring
domestic industrial capacity because he recognizes that this is an issue
that we will need to continue to address.   
   
And, finally, next week, there’s going to be a meeting led by our NEC
Director and our National Security Advisor, with a number of companies —
we should have more details on hopefully by tomorrow for all of you — to
help discuss — get some private-sector input on how to address this
issue.  
   
So this is something that there is a great deal of focus on at the
highest level across government.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Just following on what Tam said: In the President’s meeting — the
President is supposed to meet with the Japanese Prime Minister next
Friday.  And I’m wondering if he’ll ask Japan to place restrictions on
exports of semiconductor chips to China.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he is meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, as
we’ve confirmed, next Friday.  I certainly expect semiconductors and the
shortage to be a part of that discussion, but we’re just not going to
get ahead of the agenda of that.  I expect they’ll — they’ll have
remarks and take questions following the meeting.   
   
Q    And just one more thing, Jen.  The President has said that next
week he intends to host lawmakers in the Oval Office once they’re back
from recess.  I wonder if you could give us any preview of whether that
— whether or not that will include Democrats, Republicans; what type of
outreach that will look like.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect he’ll have both Democrats and Republicans attend or
join.  And once we have confirmation of attendees, we’ll share that
information with all of you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    The meeting next week on semiconductors — do you expect that to
lead to some recommendations on what to do about this problem?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say, Steve, that it’s part of our effort.  And,
again, it’s led by the National Security Advisor and our Director of the
National Economic Council, so it shows you what a priority this is to
the President to have a discussion about best practices, what they’re —
how it’s — the shortage is impacting their industries; take that
information back as part of our 100-day review.  
   
I wouldn’t say I’m predicting an outcome or an announcement immediately
coming out of it, as much as it’s part of our consulting process as
we’re working to address an issue that’s impacting a range of
industries.  
   
Q    Is there some complication to raising the refugee cap?  We’ve been
hearing about this for a couple of months now.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  We remain committed to it.  And I know there’s a
question about stigning \[sic\] — signing the paperwork, but it remains
a commitment.  And when it’s signed, we will update all of you on that
as well.   
   
Q    Lastly, there’s been an escalation of violence in Northern
Ireland.  Are you aware of this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Do you have a response to this?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We do.  
   
Q    Are you in touch with the parties?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We do.  We are concerned by the violence in Northern
Ireland, and we join the British, Irish, and Northern Irish leaders in
their calls for calm.  We remain steadfast supporters of a secure and
prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and
enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace.   
   
We welcome the provisions in both the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol, which help protect the
gains of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.   
   
At this point, I would expect that engagements and discussions are at
the level of the State Department.  And I expect my colleague over there
— we’ll see if he has an update on those engagements today in his
briefing.   
   
Go ahead, Francesca.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a lawsuit
today against the CDC and the federal government, demanding that cruise
liners be able to operate again.  And Florida’s Attorney General said
the suit was filed this morning against those entities and HHS, pushing
to have the government’s conditional sale order declared unlawful.  Does
the White House have a response to Florida’s lawsuit?

  
MS. PSAKI:  We don’t have a direct response to a lawsuit nor a comment
on a specific legal action, but I will just reiterate that the CDC
guidance is based on data and health and medical guidelines, hence
that’s why they put it out and why they regularly update it.  
   
Q    Well, the President has set forth July 4th as the date he’d like to
see Americans who are vaccinated be able to gather in small groups.  At
the same time, the CDC said last week that there is a low risk for
vaccinated Americans who travel.  So does the President think it’s an
appropriate timeline of July 4th?  That’s what the cruise industry —
specifically Norwegian travel — is asking for, is a July 4th date
here.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We would defer to the CDC on any updated guidelines, but I
don’t anticipate that.  But I would defer to them on any — on any
expectation they have of changing those guidelines.  Again, they base
them on health and medical experts who work at the CDC, on — base — they
base them on data.  
   
The President’s announcement on July 4th has nothing to do with cruise
lines, as you know.  It has to do with incentivizing, encouraging
Americans to get access to the vaccine when they can get vaccinated.  As
we know, by the end of May, we will have enough vaccine supply to ensure
every adult American can be vaccinated.   
   
So that’s more about gatherings — small gatherings — in your backyards. 
It is quite different from cruises, of course.  
   
Q    Well, the reason I brought up July 4th is because that’s the date
that Norwegian Cruise Line is asking for them to be able to allow to —
vaccinated individuals to be able to cruise.  So that’s where the July
4th date comes from.  
   
But also, more broadly speaking, they’re asking in this industry for
them to be able to be treated the same way that planes and airlines are
able to be treated.  So is there any specific concern that the White
House has about allowing people who have been vaccinated to be able to
resume cruising?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, we rely on the guidance of the CDC, health and
medical experts.  There’s a return to science in this administration. 
They have guidelines they’ve put out on cruises — cruise lines.  If they
decide to update them, that is their prerogative to do, but that’s not a
decision made by the White House.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Since the last time you were asked about state and local tax
deduction —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jonathan Salant, by the way.  I recognized you by your
voice.  I can’t see your mustache.  (Laughter.)  He has a good mustache,
for anyone who doesn’t know.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Last time, you were asked about the state and local tax
deductions.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Since then, Speaker Pelosi has now come out in favor of removing
the cap.  You know, we know where Schumer stands on the cap.  And we
also know that the House Democrat — enough House Democrats, mainly from
New York and New Jersey, said they won’t support bills without removing
the cap.  Given the — and they could sink the bill if they stand to
(inaudible).  Given that, are you working with members of Congress now
to try to find a way to address their concerns in the deduction cap?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we certainly know this is a proposal that a number of
members have.  And they’ve advocated for eliminating the SALT deduction
— or returning the SALT deduction, I guess I should say.   
   
It is not a revenue raiser, as you well know.  And — but we are open to
hearing their ideas, whether it’s this, or whether it is different
proposals or different numbers for the corporate tax rate — what it
could be raised to; or whether it is different ways we can approach
expanding broadband access, or rebuilding our roads, railways, bridges,
and helping our caregivers.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So we expect this to be a part of the discussion.  We expect
members to continue to bring forward ideas, including around issues like
SALT, and that will be a part of the negotiations moving forward.  
   
Q    The other question is: Before President Biden took office, he got a
letter from advocates — safety advocates who lost loved ones in truck
crashes.  Truck crashes are up about 35 percent over the last 10 years. 
They asked him to support certain provisions — technology — to reduce
crashes.  Those technologies, including automatic braking systems, speed
limiters, were recommended on Tuesday by the National Transportation
Safety Board.  Is that something the President supports and is going to
have people in the agencies look at trying to impose some of those new
safety restrictions?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly have to talk to him about it, but the good news
is our Secretary of Transportation is coming tomorrow to the briefing
room, so it sounds like a good question somebody can ask him as well. 
But we’ll see if we can get something more for you before then as
well.  
   
Q    And one other thing.  I know, under the Obama-Biden administration,
they began a rulemaking to address sleep apnea, which was implicated in
several fatal crashes.  It was dropped in 2017.  Is that something any
of you guys are looking at resurrecting that rule?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I remember that rule well.  I would have to check with our
team who works on rulemaking as it relates to transportation.  And
again, these all sound like good questions for our Secretary of
Transportation, but we’ll work in between now and then to get you some
answers as well.  
   
Go ahead, Anne.  
   
Q    Yeah, just back on the liability — gunmaker liability issue again. 
At the risk of flogging a dead horse, I’m just —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s okay.  
   
Q    — wondering if you can explain what changed between when, as a
candidate, Biden said that he would send legislation himself on day one,
to now, day 70 — whatever it is — when your position is that Congress
should do this on its own.  Is that right?  What — what happened?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think we’re saying “on its own” — or “on their
own.”  Just like there’s legislation on banning assault weapons that the
President supports, there’s legislation on increasing, expanding
universal background checks, which he supports.  There’s also been
legislation — many cycles of Congress — on gun liabil- — holding gun
manufacturers to the same liability standards as other industries.   
   
So all I’m conveying is he would certainly advocate that — for that, as
he did today.  There is an opportunity to reintroduce legislation. 
We’re certainly hopeful that members do that.  And he would advocate for
it and certainly use the power of the presidency to move it forward.   
   
Q    But has he ruled out sending — drafting something himself, or you
guys yourselves?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s not necessary- — it’s not perhaps
necessary, given there have been a range of bills proposed that would
address exactly this issue and a range of leaders in Congress who have
been advocates for putting in place commonsense gun safety measures.   
   
I wouldn’t rule anything out.  All I’m conveying is that there has been
a range of bills put forward in the past that he would support that
would address exactly this issue.  
   
Go —  
   
Q    I’ve got (inaudible) —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead, Anne.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — actually something else.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, go ahead.   
   
Q    So there’s a spike in coronavirus cases in Japan, and vaccines are
in very short supply.  With the Prime Minister coming next week and the
Tokyo Olympics as a huge priority for the Japanese, is it still the U.S.
position that American athletes should attend those games?  And are you
persuaded — is the President persuaded that they will be safe?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our position hasn’t changed.  Obviously, we work in close
coordination with the U.S. Olympic Committee on assessing — and with our
health and medical advisors in the U.S. government — on assessing.  But
our position has not changed on their attendance at the games.  
   
Q    One more, very quickly.  Is there any update on announcements for
ambassadors?  We’re now past March, which you had said was, sort of,
when many other administrations had done so, and you haven’t put any
forward — any big ones forward yet.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an exact update other than to convey that I
would expect that nominees for career — career nominees will probably be
in the first slate of nominees for ambassadors, as you’re planning.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, ma’am.  A couple of questions on the President’s gun
safety executive orders.  I’m wondering: Does the administration have
data on how many crimes have been committed with these ghost guns that
your team could share?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sure we can get you some data, sure.  And I bet you a
range of the experts who are joining us here today have a bunch of data
and — that they could share with you as well — even maybe on their
websites.  
   
Q    Very good.  All right, then following up: The President said, a
moment ago, quote, “You go to a gun show.  You can buy whatever you
want…no background check.”  Is there a special exemption in federal law
that he was referring to?  Or does — do FLA dealers not have to do
background checks when they’re at a gun show?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Are you asking me if he was referring —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, it’s okay.  Were you asking me if he was referring to,
like, a specific circumstance?  Or — I’m sorry, just tell me a little
bit more about your question.  
   
Q    Yeah, I mean, is it the President’s belief that you do not have to
undergo a background check when you are at a gun show?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, it’s not his belief.  He believes that gun — that
background checks should be universal.  
   
Q    Right.  But he says, “no background check.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we know what his position is — right? –so let me
reiterate that — which is that background checks are something that
should be universal.  They’re supported by more than 80 percent of the
public.  He supported legislation, advocated for that, and advocated
against loopholes as well.  So that’s his position, and I appreciate you
asking for the clarification.   
   
Q    And one —  
    
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    One quick one here.  I know the DOJ is working on this regulation
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — and then we’re going to have to wait.  But with regards to the
stabilizing braces, what’s the message to people who, you know, earlier
on, before this was an issue — law-abiding folks, who bought these and
who weren’t criminals?  According to the Congressional Research Service,
there’s something like 40 million currently in circulation.  What should
the law-abiding American do as they await that regulation?  I mean,
should they expect buybacks, or should they be prepared to turn those
in?  Or is this a confiscation situation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think that’s what we’re suggesting.  There’s
obviously going to be some time to put in place this regulation, as you
referred to, and take a close look at the most effective way to do
that.   
   
And what the effort here is that’s underway is to put in place measures
that make the country safer and make communities safer.  And, obviously,
there are impacts.  We — every step that he announced today, we believe,
would do exactly that.  
   
Q    And then a quick circle-back from last week in terms of the
scheduling of fentanyl as Schedule I.  I know it’s a difficult issue
with a lot of moving parts, but given that that scheduling is set to
expire in May, is the administration taking a closer look at the
scheduling of fentanyl analogues?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I know you asked about this, and I’m sorry we failed to get
you a good answer on it.  We will venture to do that before — May 1st is
the deadline?  Is the — not your deadline, but the timeline —  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — the timeline of the expiration.  Is that correct?  
   
Q    I believe it’s the first week of May.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  We will check that, and we will venture to do a
better job of getting back with you on that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, as today’s print pooler, I’m going to ask an inquiry for
myself, one of my colleagues who can’t be here because of COVID
restrictions, and then I have a wildcard question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  I like the setup.  (Laughter.)  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Let’s start with me.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    Despite warnings, anti-transgender bills are an illegal form of sex
discrimination.  A number of states have enacted into law measures
against transgender youth, including a measure the Arkansas legislature
enacted into law this week by overriding a veto of the governor.  Will
the President reach out to the Attorney General for legal action against
these measures?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t know that I can stand here — I can’t stand here and
predict legal action.  Obviously, that would be a decision made by the
Justice Department and the Attorney General.   
   
What I can say is that the President’s view is that all persons should
receive equal treatment under law, no matter their gender identity or
sexual orientation.  That’s fundamental to how he will make laws —
advocate for laws, I should say; how he will communicate about his views
on the rights of transgender individuals in the country; and certainly,
you know, what his view is as it relates to any actions by the
government.  
   
But in terms of legal action, I would point you to the Attorney General
and the Justice Department.  
   
Q    Well, I understand that, but why not — why ca- — why shouldn’t the
President be able to communicate with the Attorney General on legal
action?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He certainly can.  I don’t have anything to predict for you
on that at this point in time.  
   
Q    And the question from my colleague is next.  How involved is former
President Obama and First Lady Obama in the Biden-Harris
administration?  Is President Biden seeking to bring back the
often-bipartisan portrait unveiling events at the White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m certain we will have bipartisan portrait unveiling
events at the appropriate time when COVID allows.  I don’t know when
that will be, but that certainly would be something I know the President
would support.  
   
In terms of his engagement with President Obama, they are — they’re not
just former colleagues, I guess you’d call them, as President and Vice
President, but they’re — also remain close friends, and they talk
regularly about a range of issues, from policy issues, to bouncing ideas
off of each other, to — to their families.  So they are in close touch,
but we just don’t read out those specific calls; we keep them
private.   
   
Q    And now my wildcard question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.   
   
Q    There’s a lot of construction going on at the South Lawn.  What’s
up with that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, I like that.  It’s — I’m happy to get you kind of a more
official response on this, but it is kind of regular maintenance.  I
expect it to be go- — I think we expect it to be going on for 8 to 10
weeks.  But we can get you a more official —  
   
Q    (Inaudible) new construction going on.  There’s something that’s
really — as opposed to, like, regular happenings.  I mean, is this
something that is consistently going on?  Or is this like a new
construction for a new event or a new thing on the — on the South
Lawn?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, it’s not, but — but I can get you a more official
statement from our team that is overseeing the updates and the
maintenance.   
   
Go ahead, in the back.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Three questions on gun violence.  Does President
Biden have a deadline for Congress to act?  And if they don’t meet that
deadline, is he prepared with more executive action?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  First, the President is not going to wait for Congress to
act to take additional executive actions.  This is the beginning.  He
will continue to have his team review, both from a policy and a legal
standpoint, additional executive actions that are possible to take.   
   
I would just remind everyone that he also led the effort to put in place
nearly two dozen executive actions under the Obama-Biden Administration,
and he fully recognizes that the only way to put in place permanent,
long-term measures to keep our children, our communities, and our — and
families across the country safe is by passing legislation.   
   
So he will also — is also committed to that.  But he’s not going to
wait.  He can move on both levers at the same time.  
   
Q    And how soon does the President expect or hope to see change due to
the executive action — action today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Change in what way?  
   
Q    I guess, how soon does he expect to see some of his policies in
place?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there are certain periods of time of reviews for
different components of this.  Obviously, things like the guidance on
red flag laws is something that states could use, as soon as that’s
prepared and distributed, to move forward on putting in place red flag
laws.   
   
There are certain components of this that require 30 days, 60 days, et
cetera.  So I would say it just depends on the component of his — of
what he proposed this morning.   
   
Q    And my final question for you: President Biden mentioned Fred
Guttenberg by name in the Rose Garden today.  What role did Fred and
other gun safety advocates play in crafting this executive action?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that people like Fred Guttenberg
and Shannon Watts and Gabby Giffords — I mean, these are people who are
absolute heroes on getting gun safety measures in place.  They have led
the effort when there was no appetite in Washington, and none at the
federal level, to move forward on putting in place laws around the
country.   
   
And the President recognizes that, and he has a huge respect and value
for the role that they have played.  That’s why they were here today.   
   
He’s had conversations, our team has had conversations at a range of
levels with a number of these gun safety leaders through the course of
the President’s presidency.  And they have ideas; they have proposals. 
And certainly, that’s taken into account as we were considered —
considering policy options to put forward today.   
   
Go ahead.  La- — oh, go ahead.   
   
Q    German Chancellor Merkel spoke with Vladimir Putin today and
demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border.  What
is the U.S. position?  And has there been any contact between the U.S.
and Russia in the recent days about this issue?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any additional contact to read out, aside from,
I think, the last high-level contact was at the defense-minister level. 
That took place at the end of last week.   
   
But since you gave me the opportunity, let me just convey that the
United States is increasingly concerned by recent escalating Russian
aggressions in eastern Ukraine, including Russian troop movements on
Ukraine’s border.   
   
Russia now has more troops on the border with Ukraine than at any time
since 2014.  Five Ukrainian soldiers have been killed this week alone.  
These are all deeply concerning signs.    
   
We are, of course — the President spoke with President Zelenskyy, as you
know, last week.  In addition to reassurances to Ukrainian officials,
the United States — we are also discussing our concerns about the
increase in tensions in ceasefire violations and regional tensions with
NATO allies.  So that’s another part of the conversations that is
ongoing, but I don’t have any engagements with the Russians to read
out.   
   
Q    After issuing a multitude of sanctions in the last years and even
after calling Vladimir Putin a killer, which the President did — in
general, what do you think — how is the influence?  Does the U.S. and
does the general — and the West, in general, have any influence on
Vladimir Putin?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Do we have any influence on Vladimir Putin?  Look, I think
that is perhaps, in some ways, suggesting that just because someone does
bad behavior, we shouldn’t hold them accountable unless we know it’s
going to immediately change their behavior.  And that’s just not how we
see foreign policy or how we see our engagement in the world.   
   
And, look, I think our focus is on — there’s still an ongoing review —
weeks not months, weeks not months — that we are assessing, as it
relates to the troubling actions of Russia and this Russian government,
where there will be consequences, as the President has conveyed, seen
and unseen.  And we hope to have more on that soon.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just to follow up on your answer there regarding former President
Obama, because you said they are in touch fairly regularly.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Can you more clearly define “fairly regularly”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, that would be violating their friendship.  
   
Q    Okay.  Is it fair to say he is —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The privacy of their friendship, I should say.  
   
Q    Sure.  Is he fairly regularly in touch with any other former
President?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say he is the President he is most frequent — former
President he’s most frequently in touch with.  
   
Q    Are we talking a few times a week?  Are we talking a month?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to give it — more define- — I’m not going to
define it more, other than to say that they engage not just about fre- —
important moments in our country, but also about their own families. 
They have a connection on a personal level, so they discuss a range of
issues when they connect.  
   
Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q    Does the President agree with Senator Manchin that budget
reconciliation should not replace regular order in the Senate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, for those of you who read the op-ed today — or
didn’t read the op-ed — either way —  
   
Q    I think we all read it.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Did you all read it?  Oh, I’m surprised to hear.  Surprised
to hear.   
   
You know, I will say, there’s a couple of principles the President has,
as it relates to engagement with Congress and how Democrats and
Republicans should work together.  The time has come to end these
political games and to usher a new era of bipartisanship where we can
find common ground on the major policy debates facing our nation.   
   
He also believes the issues facing our democracy today are not
insurmountable if we choose to tackle them together.  And he definitely
believes that Republicans have a responsibility to stop saying “no” and
participate in finding real compromise with Democrats.  
   
Q    But does he agree with this line?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me just say, those are all lines in — in Senator
Manchin’s op- — opinion piece.  Look, the President believes that
there’s a path forward to get infra- — this American Jobs Plan passed
with bipartisan support.  That’s why he’s going to invite Democrats and
Republicans here.  That’s why he’s going to hear from them on their
ideas that they’ve already put forward.   
   
We’re going to leave it to leaders in Congress to determine the
mechanisms for moving things forward, but we think there should be every
opportunity to do this on a bipartisan basis.  
   
Q    Hey, Jen.  Just one quick one, if I can?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q    Can you rule out those Russian sanctions coming this week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Coming this week?  Yes.  
   
Q    How about next week?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to rule out further.  (Laughter.) I’m just
trying to give you some sleep tomorrow.  We already have the — the guid-
— the budget guidance coming tomorrow.  We can’t overload you on a
Friday.  
   
Q    I have one more thing about infrastructure.  I know that you
mentioned Secretary Buttigieg would be here tomorrow. Unfortunately, due
to social distancing, I will not be.  So when it comes to —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We will take your questions with one of your colleagues.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Maybe I’ll email the print pooler.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    But in regards to the 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main
streets that are in the President’s infrastructure plan, it also says it
will fix the 10 most economically significant bridges in the country,
and it specifically says it will repair the worst 10,000 smaller
bridges.   
   
So, the White House, to this point, has not released any sort of a list
of these.  So why isn’t there a list that you can share with us?  And
presumably, there is some sort of a list because otherwise where did you
get the 20,000 and 10,000 numbers from.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In terms of roads and railways that needs to be repaired?  
   
Q    Yes.  Where did those numbers come from?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We can certainly get you a citation.  What I did the other
day, but I’m happy to reiterate, is explain that we expect that the
package and the funding will come through a combination of grants —
formula grants and competitive grants. Right?   
   
And formula grants are allocated to states based on certain criteria,
like the number of miles of an interstate highway or a population in a
given urban area.  Most of our existing transportation funding flows
through formula grants — so with past infrastructure funding bills that
have gone through Congress in the — in the last several decades.   
   
This gives states a lot of flexibility in covering how they repair
roads, how they repair rail — you know, things that need to be repaired
in their state.  
   
The other part — type of funding is competitive grants, which — those 10
bridges you talked about, they would be through competitive grants — so,
these direct funding to certain policy goals, like the TIGER grant
program that was a part of the Recovery Act.   
   
So there’s just different — we expect that to be how it’s structured. 
That will all be discussed and finalized through our conversations with
members of Congress, with leaders in Congress about what the combination
of those funding components should be.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Can I just get you on one final gun question?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    The Vice President talked a little bit about — so the President
talked about his role, as Vice President, leading the Obama
administration’s actions on guns.  We’ve seen a lot of conversations
about gun control legislation in that Rose Garden before.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Why does the President think that this time will be different than
any other time?  And clearly when he was in the Vice President’s seat
for this legislation, and how much — and, you know, is he committing
that it will be different, I should say?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He is committing that it will be different.  And if the
President was just defeated every time he was defeated on an objective
or a goal, he wouldn’t be President.   
   
So, here he is.  He remains an advocate throughout his life to putting
in place gun safety measures, and it’s something that he has been
committed through not just through words, but through action.  And he
believes it’s something that, as President, he can help move forward and
put in place more action.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, everyone.
