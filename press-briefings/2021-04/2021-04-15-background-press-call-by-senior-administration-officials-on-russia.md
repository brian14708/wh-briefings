title: Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on Russia
---
 
Via Teleconference

9:36 A.M. EDT  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi everyone.  Thanks for joining us
this morning.  We’re going to be on background today, with comments
attributed to “senior administration officials,” and the contents of
this call are going to be embargoed until its conclusion.   
   
We have three speakers today for you.  \[Redacted.\]  \[Senior
administration official\], we’ll turn it over to you for opening
comments, and then we’ll hear from \[senior administration officials\],
and then we’re happy to take your questions.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks everybody for joining us this. 
I’ll spend a few minutes at the top laying out the context for today’s
actions and then some of the specific measures we’ve undertaken.   
   
We’ve been clear that we seek a relationship with Russia that that is
stable and predictable.  We do not seek, we do not desire a downward
spiral.  We think we can and should avoid that.  But we have also been
clear, publicly and privately, that we will defend our national
interests and that we will impose costs on Russian government actions
that seek to harm our sovereignty.   
   
In his first conversation with President Putin not long after his
inauguration, President Biden raised our strong concerns about a number
of harmful foreign activities by Russia and indicated that the United
States would respond.  On March 2nd, the Biden administration, in
coordination with several key allies and partners, announced our
response to Russia’s use of a chemical weapon to poison Aleksey
Navalny.  Then, earlier this week, the President spoke with President
Putin again and told him, true to his word, that the United States would
in fact be executing responses to the cyber intrusion of SolarWinds and
the interference in the 2020 election.   
   
This week and today, that is what we are doing; we are taking additional
actions to respond to what the Russian government and its intelligence
services have done to directly target American sovereignty.   
   
There will be elements of our responses to these actions that will
remain unseen.  Our actions announced today constitute our public
response, which we intend to be understood as resolute but
proportionate.  
   
On SolarWinds, we’re formerly naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence
Service — the SVR — as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber
espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and
other information technology infrastructures.  
   
The SVR unit, APT29, Cozy Bear, the Dukes — known by all of those names
— we are attributing as the actor that conducted this intrusion.  The
U.S. intelligence community has high confidence in its assessment of
attribution to the SVR.  This is an update to the January 5th, 2021,
assessment by the previous administration that this incident was, quote,
“likely of Russian origin.”   
   
Sanctions are one component of today’s response.  Today, President Biden
signed a new sanctions executive order that provides strengthened
authorities for the administration to respond to and deter Russia’s
harmful foreign activities.  It sends a clear signal to the Russian
government that we will not accept its destabilizing behavior that harms
the United States, our people, our allies and partners, and that we will
respond with economically impactful costs if these activities continue
or escalate.   
   
Under the new EO, Treasury today has issued a directive that prohibits
U.S. financial institutions from participation in the primary market for
ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued after June 14th, 2021, by
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of
Russia, or the Ministry of Finance.  This directive provides authority
for the U.S. government to expand sovereign debt sanctions on Russia as
appropriate.   
   
Also under the new EO, Treasury has today designated six Russian
companies that provide support to the SVR cyber program and other
Russian intelligence agencies’ cyber programs, ranging from providing
expertise, to developing tools and infrastructure, to facilitating
malicious cyber activities.   
   
Importantly, there are elements of this new EO that give us additional
authorities that we are not exercising today.  We would prefer not to
have to deploy these authorities, but the scope of the EO and it
potential to cause meaningful impact should send a clear signal that
continued harmful foreign activities — including further election
interference, further malicious cyber activities — are unacceptable, and
we are prepared, going forward, to impose substantial and lasting costs
if this behavior continues or escalates.  
   
Under other sanctions authorities today, Treasury also sanctioned 32
entities and individuals carrying out Russian government-directed
attempts to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election and to pursue
other forms of disinformation and influence campaigns against partners,
allies, and other governments.   
   
This action seeks to disrupt the coordinated efforts of Russian
officials, proxies, and intelligence agencies to delegitimize democratic
electoral processes.  
   
Furthermore, Treasury — in partnership with the EU, UK, Australia, and
Canada — today sanctioned eight individuals and entities associated with
Russia’s ongoing occupation and repression in Crimea.  And the United
States is expelling 10 Russian officials from Russia’s Washington, D.C.,
diplomatic mission.  
   
At the same time, we’re taking a number of steps to help allies and
partners identify cyberattack perpetrators and strengthen our
cybersecurity partnerships with like-minded nations.  
   
Finally, let me offer an update on reports of bounties on U.S. soldiers
in Afghanistan.  The United States intelligence community assesses, with
low to moderate confidence, that Russian intelligence officers sought to
encourage Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in
Afghanistan in 2019 and perhaps earlier, including through financial
incentives and compensation.  U.S. intelligence community agencies have
low to moderate confidence in this judgment, in part because it relies
on detainee reporting and due to the challenging operating environment
in Afghanistan.   
   
Our conclusion is based on information and evidence of connections
between criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian
government.  This information puts a burden on the Russian government to
explain its actions and take steps to address this disturbing pattern of
behavior.   
   
The safety and wellbeing of U.S. military personnel and that of our
allies and partners is a matter of the absolute highest U.S. national
security interest.  Our men and women in uniform have defended our
country from harm and promoted our interests and values around the
world.  They will continue to do so, and we cannot and will not accept
the targeting of our personnel like this.   
   
As we take these actions, we also want to be clear that we have no
desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia.  We intend these
responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past
activities, past actions that Russia has taken.  We have indicated that
we seek a stable and predictable relationship going forward.   
   
President Biden spoke with President Putin earlier this week and
conveyed that directly.  And in that spirit, he proposed a summit
meeting in the coming months, in a third country in Europe, to discuss
the full range of issues in our relationship.  The Russians have not
responded to that to say whether they will — whether President Putin
will participate in such a summit.  But we believe that, in the coming
months, it will be vital for the two leaders to sit down to discuss the
full range of issues facing our relationship.  And as responsible — and
it is the responsibility of the leaders of significant countries, like
Russia and the United States, to sit together to find a stable and
effective way forward and to stop any kind of escalatory cycle from
spinning out of control.  
   
I will stop there and turn it over to my colleagues.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\].  So, as \[senior administration official\] just underscored,
President Biden has been clear about his desire for a relationship with
Russia that’s stable and predictable.  He’s also been clear that we’ll
defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian government
actions that seem to harm — that seek to harm our sovereignty.  
   
And so that’s the context in which we’re taking action today to impose
tailored and proportionate costs in the Russian sovereign debt market
for actions directed by President Putin that have directly targeted
American sovereignty.   
   
This is a matter of principle.  There’s no credible reason why the
American people should directly fund Russia’s government when the Putin
regime has repeatedly attempted to undermine our sovereignty.   
   
To be clear, before we took this action, our sanctions prohibitions only
prevented U.S. persons from purchases of non-ruble denominated debt at
issuance.  This meant the vast majority — over 80 percent — of the
sovereign debt that Russia issues — the ruble-denominated portion — was
untouched by our sanctions regime.  
   
We’ve now expanded our prohibitions to cover this space, and we’re also
delivering a clear signal that the President has maximum flexibility to
expand the sovereign debt prohibitions if Russia’s maligned activities
continue or escalate.   
   
For now, though, we want to be clear that this prohibition only applies
to newly issued ruble sovereign debt in the primary market, and not to
the secondary market or existing sovereign debt holdings.   
   
You should also know that the prohibition comes into effect on June 14
of this year.  The intent — the intent here is to allow for an orderly
process and to limit spillovers to U.S. or global financial markets.   
   
In terms of how this action imposes costs: Remember, this is the main
market that funds the Russian government.  The ruble-denominated
sovereign debt market is about 185 billion in size, about a quarter of
these bonds are owned by foreign investors.   
   
Judging from history, removing U.S. investors as buyers in this market
can create a broader chilling effect that raises Russia’s borrowing
costs, along with capital flight and a weaker currency.  And all of —
all of these forces have a material impact on Russia’s growth and
inflation outcomes.   
   
But to underscore: The speed and magnitude of that negative feedback
loop is a function of Russia’s choices.  And just to repeat what
\[Senior Administration Official\] said, we’re not looking for
escalation; we’re providing a proportionate and tailored response.  And
we believe it’s in our interest to find a stable and predictable way
forward in the relationship.   
   
Let me turn it now over to \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  Good morning all.   
   
So building on \[senior administration official\]’s comments regarding
the United States formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence
Service, SVR, as responsible for the SolarWinds hack: The U.S.
Intelligence Committee (inaudible) has high confidence in its assessment
of the attribution to the SVR.  
   
There are two aspects to the U.S. response to SolarWinds.  First, naming
and imposing costs on the perpetrator of SolarWinds.  And second,
strongly affirming the importance of an open, interoperable, secure, and
reliable Internet.   
   
So on the first aspect, building on the attribution and, as \[senior
administration official\] noted, Treasury’s designation of six Russian
technology companies that provide support to the Russian Intelligence
Service’s cyber program, ranging from providing expertise to developing
tools and infrastructure to facilitate those malicious cyber
activities.  They’re being designated — the companies — for operating in
the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.  And we will
continue to hold those companies accountable for that behavior.   
   
Second, the SVR’s compromise of SolarWinds and other companies
highlights the risks posed by Russia’s efforts to target companies
worldwide through supply chain exploitation.  Those efforts should serve
as a warning about the risks of using information and communications
technology and services supplied by companies that operate or store user
data in Russia, or rely on software development or remote technical
support by personnel in Russia.   
   
The U.S. government strongly encourages all U.S. companies using
communications or technologies supplied by companies with ties to Russia
to evaluate the security of their infrastructure and be aware of the
potential for future U.S. action that may affect their operation.   
   
The U.S. government is evaluating whether to take action under Executive
Order 13873 to better protect our communications and technology supply
chain from further exploitation by Russia.  
   
The United States is not alone in facing malicious Russian cyber
activity.  And you may have noted both Australia and the European Union
statement of support for the attribution and the need to counter that
malicious activity this morning.  
   
As I noted, the second and key part of this morning’s activity are the
U.S. strongly affirming the importance of an open, interoperable,
secure, and reliable Internet.  Russia’s actions run counter to that
goal, which is shared by many of our allies and partners.   
   
So, to strengthen our collective approach to bolstering cyber security,
we’re announcing two important steps.   
   
First, the United States is strengthening our efforts to promote a
framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace and to cooperate
with allies and partners to counter malign cyber activities, such as
what we’ve seen perpetrated by Moscow.   
   
We’re providing a first-of-its-kind course for policymakers worldwide on
the policy and technical aspects of publicly attributing cyber incidents
that will be inaugurated this year at the George C. Marshall Center in
Germany.   
   
Second, we’re reinforcing our commitment to collective security in
cyberspace.  The Department of Defense hosts an important annual cyber
exercise to build security and cyber operators and overall capability. 
We will be inviting — and the UK, France, Denmark, and Estonia have
agreed to join in the planning for this year CYBER FLAG exercise.   
   
The exercise will build a community of defensive cyber operators and
improve overall capability of the U.S. and our allies to identify,
synchronize, and respond in unison against malicious cyberspace
activities targeting our critical infrastructure and key resources. This
effort is intended to reinforce again our commitment to the security of
our allies and partners.  
   
As the SolarWinds incident has shown, we have to build those domestic
and international partnerships and threat intelligence sharing to ensure
we can identify, defend against, and mitigate malicious cyber activity
from Russia and other adversaries.   
   
Our efforts this morning are designed to be proportionate and tailored
to counter the activities we experienced in the malicious cyber
activities in the SolarWinds hack, as well as to build collective
security with our allies.   
   
And, with that, I’ll turn it over for your questions.  
   
Q    Hey.  Thank you.  Question — a couple questions.  Why list the
reported Taliban attacks if there’s low to moderate confidence?   
   
And second, on the — if I understood right, the Treasury financial
impacts don’t go into effect until June 14th.  Why is there a delay on
that?   
   
And third, how did you pick the Russians that are being expelled?  Thank
you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  I’ll take the first and third
questions, and I will hand it over to \[senior administration official\]
for the second one.  
   
With respect to the question of the reports of bounties or financial
compensation on — you know, provided to Afghans to kill Americans or
coalition troops, as I noted in my opening comments, the IC has low to
moderate confidence in this, both because it’s based in part on detainee
reporting and because of the difficult operating environment in
Afghanistan.   
   
The actions that we have announced today are in response to the cyber
intrusions and the election interference.  We have noted our conclusion
of the review that we conducted on the bounties issue and we have
conveyed — through diplomatic, intelligence, and military channels —
strong, direct messages on this issue, but we are not specifically tying
the actions we are taking today to that — to that matter.  We are tying
it to the SolarWinds and election interference matters.   
   
I did want to report to you, however, our finding on this, which is:
There is an assessment that Russian intelligence officers did seek to
encourage Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel,
including through financial incentives and compensation, but because of
the low- to moderate-confidence element of this, our focus is on sending
a clear message to Russia about the steps the United States would take
in response to such behavior were it to continue.  
   
On the question of the PNGs: The United States is expelling these 10
Russian individuals because we have determined that they were acting in
a manner inconsistent with their status in the United States.   
   
And I will leave it at that and turn it over \[senior administration
official\].   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks.  On the question about
the June 14 date, you are correct.  The sovereign debt prohibitions come
into effect on June 14 of this year.  The rationale for this date is to
allow time for financial institutions to understand and adapt to the
measures we’re taking and to facilitate an orderly process for these
financial institutions to make any adjustments they choose.   
   
So our intent here is to impose costs on the Russian government, but
also to limit any spillovers to the U.S. or global financial markets.   
   
Thanks.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks.  It’s Eamon Javers with CNBC.  Can you guys give us a
little bit more detail on any calculations made about what the impact is
of limiting access to ruble-denominated debt, in terms of the Russian
ability — the Russian government’s ability to fund itself?  And how
badly is it going to impact Russia’s ongoing operations?  I know you
touched on it a little bit.  I’m wondering if you have any more analysis
or detail or numbers around that.  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’m happy to take this if you’d like.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, please.  Go for it.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, okay.  So, Eamon, I would just —
I would just refer you to history.  This is — these aren’t — these
aren’t theoretical calculations that we had to make.  We just looked
back to 2014 and 2015, also 2019, when similar measures were taken.   
   
When you remove U.S. investors from the primary market, it causes a
broader chilling effect.  And what you’ve seen throughout history, even
recent history — as speculation about this measure began to pick up —
what you see is that Russia’s borrowing costs rise, you see that there’s
capital flight, you see the currency weakens in tandem.  And, you know,
that has an impact on Russia’s growth rate; it has an impact on Russia’s
inflation rate.  Previously in 2014, Russia decided to spend some of its
foreign reserves to defend the currency.  Those are all choices that
Russia will have to make.  
   
But there is a negative feedback loop that is triggered when you remove
U.S. investors from a sovereign debt market.  And, as I mentioned
before, the velocity of that feedback loop really is a function of what
Russia decides to do next.   
   
We hope — we hope for de-escalation.  We hope for a stable and
predictable way forward, but that’s — that’s really a matter for
Russia.  
   
In terms of — you asked about what markets are going to do.  I don’t —
you know, we’re not going to speculate about how markets are going to
respond specifically.  I would just repeat: We’ve demonstrated our
resolve today to defend our national interests and defend core
principles, but we’ve also done so, we think, in a strong and
proportionate way.  
   
Q    Good morning.  This is Dina Temple-Raston from NPR.  I have two
quick questions.  The first is: If Russia escalates, what are you
expecting to do?   
   
And the second is: Do you expect that this is going to spur some changes
in the way the federal government procures software?  Is there going to
be new rules, that sort of thing?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’ll defer to my colleague on the
second question, which is a very good question.   
   
On the first, we’re not going to speculate about what Russia’s responses
would be.  We’ve made clear to the Russian government that we believe
these responses are proportionate and measured, that there is more we
could do, and we are not looking to escalate.   
   
They have indicated publicly and in other formats that they would intend
to respond to this, and we will have to see what they choose to do.  The
United States reserves the right, of course, to take further action as
necessary.  But our view is that the best course forward at this point
would be for us to, for the United States and Russia both, to get off of
the ladder of escalation and find a stable way forward.   
   
So, we will track closely the Russian government responses to this, and
then make determinations from that on the way forward.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And on the second question — thank
you.  So defending against malicious cyber activities requires two
components: them and us.  And your question exactly spoke to the “us”
portion.   
   
So the SolarWinds incident highlighted the need to rapidly modernize
federal cybersecurity.  We’ve kicked that effort off already, focused on
the nine federal agencies who were compromised with five specific
efforts: requiring a rapid rollout of encryption and multi-factor
authentication; requiring a rapid rollout of security in the cloud;
ensuring logging and endpoint detection is in place; and ensuring
effective, mature security operations centers will be put in place as
well.   
   
Those efforts will also be the hallmark of an upcoming executive order
which will build on those with regard to setting standards for the
software the U.S. government procures.  As you know, the software the
U.S. government procures is the same software and hardware used broadly
by companies and governments in the U.S. and around the world.   
   
So putting the muscle of U.S. spending on information technology behind
building more secure software and hardware is a key step to help
companies and governments in the U.S. and around the world have the
benefit of more secure software and hardware and, over the longer-term,
counter sophisticated malicious cyber activity, as we saw in
SolarWinds.   
   
Q    A little bit more on the SolarWinds issue here.  You know, there’s
been some discussion about whether or not a response is warranted, given
that, by — by most accounts, it is a cyber espionage campaign, albeit a
rather broad and successful one at that.   
   
Could you just explain a little bit more about why the SolarWinds attack
is deserving of such a response, given that the U.S. and its allies also
engages in cyber espionage and there has been a lot of discussion about
whether or not this is any way different than — than those activities? 
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \[Senior administration official\], I’m
happy to take that one if you’d like.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Please, \[senior administration
official\], go for it.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, Dustin.  So the SVR’s compromise
of the SolarWinds software supply chain gave it the ability to spy on or
potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide.  But
there’s really three core reasons that we saw the need to make clear
that this behavior was unacceptable.   
   
First, that broad scope and scale of the compromise, it’s a national
security and public safety concern.   
   
Second, as you noted, the speed with which an actor can move from
espionage to degrading or disrupting a network is at the blink of an
eye, and a defender cannot move at that speed.  And given the history of
Russia’s malicious activity in cyberspace and their reckless behavior in
cyberspace, that was a key concern.   
   
And finally, the hack placed an undue burden on the mostly
private-sector victims who must bear the unusually high costs of
mitigating this incident.   
   
So, based on the three factors, we saw a need to make clear that
activities like SolarWinds were reckless and unacceptable.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you everyone.  This is \[senior
administration official\] again.  This concludes our call.  A friendly
reminder that we are on background, attributed to “senior administration
officials.”  And with the conclusion of this call, the embargo is
lifted.
