James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

   
2:28 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone.  
   
Q    Hello.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Happy Tuesday.   
   
Okay, a couple of items for you at the top.  Today, President Biden is
issuing an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay a $15
minimum wage to hundreds of thousands of their employees.  These workers
are critical to the functioning of federal government, from cleaning
professionals and maintenance workers, to nursing assistants who care
for the nation’s veterans, to cafeteria and other food service workers
who ensure we all have healthy and nutritious food to eat, to laborers
who build and repair federal infrastructure.  
   
The executive order will increase the hourly minimum wage for federal
contractors to $15 in new and renewed contracts and contract options
starting in January 2022.  This increase must be implemented by March
30th, 2022; continue to index the minimum wage to an inflation measure,
so it keeps up the cost of living — with the cost of living; eliminate
the tipped minimum wage for federal contractors by 2024; ensure a $15
minimum wage for federal contractors with disabilities; and restore
minimum wage protections to outfitters and guides operating on federal
lands.   
   
Also, as you may remember — and I think this announcement just went out
— but President Biden signed a Made in America executive order directing
federal agencies to ensure taxpayer dollars supporting American
manufacturing.  We’ve been, of course, hard at work delivering on that
commitment.  And, today, the President announced the appointment of
Celeste Drake as the nation’s first Made in America Director — which, I
think, is a great title.  
   
As Made in America Director with the — within the Office of Management
and Budget, she will make sure agencies follow the President’s ambitious
“Buy American” commitment and will help continue the work to carry out
his bold “Made in America” agenda.    
   
Also today — sorry, two more items here.  Thanks to the American Rescue
Plan, the Department of Homeland — of Health and Human Services is
announcing the availability of $1 billion for the construction and
renovation of community health centers.  The funding builds on President
Biden’s commitment to ensuring equity and access to COVID-19 response
efforts and high-quality primary healthcare services.  
   
Community health centers are a critical pipeline — as we’ve talked about
a bit in here before — for our COVID-19 vaccination efforts.  And all of
the nation’s nearly 1,400 Health Resources and Services
Administration-funded health centers will be eligible for these funds.
   
   
Finally, following the President’s address to the joint session of
Congress, we are launching the “Getting America Back on Track” tour to
highlight the successes of the first 100 days in addressing the crises
facing our country: vaccinating America to beat the pandemic — 200
million — more than 200 million Americans, to be exact; delivering
much-needed financial help to American families; making transformative
investments to rescue and rebuild our economy; and fundamentally showing
the government can deliver for people.  
   
They’ll also — we’ll also use the tour to take the case directly to the
American people about the vital need for action on the Jobs Plan and the
Families Plan — which the President will be laying out in detail
tomorrow evening — so we can make badly needed investments in the
financial security of middle-class families, as well as in jobs, growth,
and competitiveness.   
   
After the joint session, the President, Vice President, First Lady,
Second Gentleman, and Cabinet members will fan out across the country. 
On Thursday, as you know, the President and First Lady will travel to
Georgia, and the Vice President will go to Baltimore.  On Friday, the
President will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Vice President
will go to Ohio; and the Second Gentleman will head to North Carolina.  
   
They will be traveling, of course, next week, as well.  And we will
announce additional stops then.   
   
Hello, Josh.  Go ahead.  Kick us off.  
   
Q    Thanks so much, Jen.  The census recently came out and reallocated
congressional seats.  Does the White House share the concerns that
Hispanics were undercounted as part of the census?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say that the President took steps when
he took office to overturn the policies of the Trump administration — or
the approach to counting by the Trump administration.  That was one of
the first steps he took.  As you know, this process is carried out by
career, apolitical experts.  It was announced yesterday because they
needed additional time, and we thought that was absolutely
appropriate.   
   
Of course, the steps that are taken to allocate congressional seats is
set by statute and has been in place since 1941.  In terms of the impact
of the last administration, I would send you to the Census.  We’re not
in a position to assess that.   
   
Q    Secondly, a report came out today from Human Rights Watch about
Israel, saying that Israel is guilty of international crimes of
apartheid and persecution because of discriminatory policies towards
Palestinians.  Israel has rejected that characterization.  Does the
White House think the report is accurate or inaccurate?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Josh, the State’s Department has its own rigorous
process for making atrocity determinations and reports on human rights
abus- — issues globally on an annual basis through the Human Rights
Report that they issue, they do briefings on, and they put out
publicly.  The Department has never used such terminology.   
   
As to the question of whether Israel’s actions constitute apartheid,
that is not the view of this administration.   
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Is — thank you, Jen.  Is the President going to change his own
personal habits to adapt to the new CDC guidelines?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly.  He’ll be following public health guidelines.  So
I think you saw him outside today.  He took the mask off; he didn’t put
the mask back on.  It will take some time to adjust and adapt for all of
us.  And I know when I take my kids to the playground this weekend, I’ll
be happy not to be wearing a mask.   
   
Q    And what about indoors: Is he changing anything about indoors?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the — the guidance, as you know, that was put out, it
was more about mask wearing outside.  If you’re vaccinated and — and you
can — and you wear a mask inside, then you can go to gyms and
restaurants and things along those lines.   
   
We will still, in here, until there’s different guidelines, abide by the
recommendations of the CDC as it relates to workplaces.  
   
Q    And could you talk a little bit about the speech tomorrow night?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    How long do you think it will be?  Is he doing practice sessions? 
Are Cabinet members going to be in attendance?  That sort of thing.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me give you as many details as I can, at this
point.  And then we’ll continue to provide additional updates.  As you
all know, there’s a briefing later tonight as well.   
   
First, Steve, you have covered many Presidents who have delivered these
addresses.  You can be our historian and tell us if any of them have
final addresses where we know the exact length about 36 hours in
advance.  So, we’re not quite there on that piece yet, but I can tell
you that the President has been working on this speech for the last few
weeks.  
   
He has been preparing with Senior Advisor Mike Donilon, Director of
Speechwriting Vinay Reddy, working on the speech.  And, really, over the
last several days, he’s been edit — line editing it, meeting with his
speechwriters, getting advice and counsel from senior advisors, checking
in with members of his family.  And also, as part of his process, he
engages with his policy teams to ask for additional details, ask for
further clarification.  And certainly, given we’re rolling out the
American Families Plan, that has also been — being — been finalized — or
in the finalization process through this.   
   
I can also tell you that while the major policy announcement in the
speech is of course the American Families Plan, a historic investment in
education and childcare, he will also use the speech as an opportunity
to talk about many of his other priorities, including police reform,
immigration, gun safety, his ongoing work to get the pandemic under
control, and to putting Americans back to work.   
   
He was in the Senate for 36 years.  He also sat through eight of these
as the Vice President, and he certainly recognizes the important
opportunity that this offers.  
   
In attendance, there will be the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
Defense, as well as — I think the Supreme Court confirmed the Chief
Justice will be in attendance.  Joining him will be Dr. Biden, the Vice
President, and, of course, the Second Gentleman.  There will not be a
First Lady’s Box, as there has been historically.  
   
While the speech will, of course, look and feel different from past
years, the President will preserve a few traditions, including the walk
down the center aisle that we have seen Presidents do for many years. 
He will, of course, be wearing a mask for that; he’ll remove the mask
when he delivers his speech.  
   
He’ll also be meeting with men and women — career staff who were at the
Capitol on January 6th — in advance of the speech.  
   
Q    And will he bring up — you know, I know he’ll have a foreign policy
piece —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Will there be a lot of talk about China in the speech?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I expect there certainly will be a foreign policy speech —
it’s never as much foreign policy as the foreign policy team wants;
that’s always the battle — but there will be a foreign policy portion of
the speech.  He will talk about our — his commitment to reengaging with
the world, taking America’s seat back in the world, what our values are
as a country.  And, certainly, I would expect he’ll talk about a number
of the priorities of this administration, including our engagement with
China.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Peter.  
   
Q    Just for clarity, since the whole Cabinet isn’t going to be there. 
In the past there would be a “designated survivor,” as they say.  Is
there a designated survivor on a night like tomorrow night, and who
would that be?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There does not need to be a designated survivor because the
Cabinet will be watching from their offices or home, but they will not
be joining him for the speech.  
   
Q    And the highest-ranking person who is not present there will — I
guess we’ll sort that out for ourselves thereafter.  
   
Let me ask you about the President’s remarks earlier.  Obviously, this
White House, this administration has spent so much time trying to get
Americans to wear masks.   
   
Right now, with only roughly a third of the American population fully
vaccinated, are there concerns that this could cause, in some form, a
resurgence — or that this relies on the honor system and thereby could
cause any uptick in COVID?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Peter, I think one of the priorities of the
President’s and Vice President’s and our entire team, of course, is
abiding by health and medical experts and guidance — but is providing
information — transparent information to the public to make clear what
the benefit —  
   
(The briefing is interrupted by a creaking sound.)  
   
Have no fear, the ceiling is not falling — that I’m aware of.  Okay.
(Laughter.)  Okay.   
   
Q    And I trust you.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — hopefully.  It’s an old building.  
   
Q    It’s Lincoln’s ghost.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  One — maybe.  Lincoln’s ghost, that’s quite something. 
Maybe it is.  
   
One of the President’s priorities is ensuring people understand — who
are vaccinated out there, who are contemplating whether they should get
vaccinated — what the benefits are.  
   
And while we will, of course, always abide by the health and medical
advice of our experts — the CDC guidelines on this — this is a step
forward because people can go out and they can take their kids to the
park and not wear masks if it’s not crowded.  You can go for a run. 
That’s what they’re telling you.  And that’s safe if you’re vaccinated
and — and not wear a mask.  
   
And, you know, this is important for people to hear as well.  So we’re
trying — we’re at the stage now where we have enough supply.  We want to
convey to people what the benefits are and this is — these are what —
some of the benefits.  
   
Q    Help me understand on the July 4th deadline that the President had
— or goal that the President said in his inaugural primetime address
from here at the White House.  He said, “If we do…this together, by July
4th, there’s a good chance \[that\] you, your friends, and family” can
have — can “get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and
have a cookout \[or\] a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    We — didn’t we sort of erase that deadline in some ways, and say,
“Right now, for those vaccinated, that day is here.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s clear that it — as it has been clear for
some time.  It’s also — the guidelines from the CDC several weeks ago
was also: If your neighbors are vaccinated, you can be inside and have
dinner with them.   
   
What he’s trying to convey to the public is: When the vaccine is
available — when he made that announcement — when the vaccine is broadly
available, which it now is — to the public — as of April 19th —
encourage your friends to get vaccinated, encourage your neighbors to
get vaccinated.  We know that that’s one of the most impactful ways to
get people to pharmacies, to their doctor’s office to do that so we can
have a barbecue on July 4th.   
   
So yes, we are — there are some communities, some people whose neighbors
are vaccinated; they can all gather if there’s a, you know, April 30th
barbecue.  But —  
   
Q    “July 4th is here for some but not for all” is the point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the incentive is to get vaccinated so that you can
enjoy the benefits of being vaccinated.  
   
Q    Let me ask, if I can, really quickly about — as it relates to
Novavax and to AstraZeneca, the White House said that it would be
providing 60 million doses to other countries.  Has the administration
communicated to AstraZeneca or to — and to Novavax that they don’t need
to rush ahead in their effort to get a EUA right now, and that you’re
going to be giving it elsewhere?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I think we see that as a separate process. 
They have not applied for an EUA.  And nor have — obviously have they
been granted one.   
   
We also have ordered 300 million doses from AstraZeneca, which we
certainly expect they will deliver on.  So, we will evaluate.   
   
What we’re talking about here is — and the reason that 300 million is
relevant is because we’re talking about 60 million here — 10 of which we
expect and hope will be through the FDA review in the next few weeks —
and the 50 million in the next few months.   
   
But, you know, they will decide when they apply for an EUA.  We’re
talking about doses that have not yet been approved, that we are going
to supply, to give to the global community.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Sort of a broader, all-of-government kind of question.  A year ago
this week, it was said in this room how sunlight might kill the virus
and make outdoor transmission unlikely.  Clearly, things are a little
different now.   
   
But why have Americans had to wait this long for today’s guidance when,
to many, it was quite obvious that this is what the next step was?  
   
MS.  PSAKI:  Well, Ed, I think we want Americans to be confident in the
information they’re receiving from the federal government.  It’s been
important to us to lead with health and medical experts, to provide them
the time they need to make these evaluations so that when the CDC comes
out with guidance, the American people know they can trust it.   
   
And, you know, where we — we are working to clean up from a great deal
of misinformation, inaccurate information that was put out by the last
administration — some of it politically tinged.  And it’s — therefore,
we’ve been really leaning into the timeline of the health and medical
team and experts.  
   
Q    And if there’s anyone out there who questions whether — this
decision coming right before the big speech and right before the 100
days — you guys would say?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can assure you that the CDC makes — makes decisions and
does evaluations on their own timeline.  
   
Q    A few other COVID things.  Can you confirm whether the
administration still plans to buy the 100 million more doses of Johnson
& Johnson’s vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think anything has changed about our plans.  
   
Q    No idea why there’s a delay then in doing so?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A delay in their delivery or a de- — delay in purchasing?  
   
Q    Both.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ll have to — I’ll check on that for you, Ed.  
   
Q    Why — the India decision this week — and the President just spoke
to it.  Why wasn’t a similar announcement to send resources or help made
when Brazil had its outbreak earlier this year and we know they too were
sort of clamoring for international assistance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Ed, I can speak to kind of where we are as a —
obviously, we’re a provider, as you know, of a great deal of public
health assistance to India, but also to Brazil.  
   
Our focus — our availability at this point of providing certain kinds of
resources, including the materials to make vaccine, may not have been at
that point several months ago.  But I’d have to talk to our team about
what the specific requests were and what they feel were not met.   
   
Q    And I’m asking this one on behalf of our Miami TV station.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    You may have seen this report about a private school in Miami
that’s telling its staff and teachers not to get the COVID vaccine, and
are threatening to terminate their employment if they do get it.  It
means teachers are being forced to choose between their job and their
health.   
   
Obviously, there’s not much the White House specifically can do.  Does
it have any comment on this situation?  And any idea if there’s anything
federal authorities can do to help the teachers in this case?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s a good question.  In terms of helping the teachers,
I’ll have to check with the Department of Education.  I’d send you to
them as well, of course.   
   
Obviously, our objective is continuing to convey that it’s important to
abide by public health guidelines; that they’re in place for a reason;
that they are not done through a political prism — they are done by
medical experts, by health experts; intended to keep children safe, keep
parents safe, keep teachers safe, keep communities safe, which is why we
recommend people abide by them.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to start with a follow-up on the COVID
vaccine, specifically the AstraZeneca doses that are going abroad.  I
want to clarify something you said yesterday about COVAX.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    And can you just say whether the U.S. is considering distributing
those doses to other countries through COVAX, or are you only focusing
on distributing them, you know, on a country-by-country basis
directly?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re — we expect it to be a combination.  It is —
we’re still developing our plans and what that looks like.  
   
And, again, as I alluded to earlier, we’re talking about 10 million
doses if it is — goes through a FDA review in the next few weeks — so
it’s not today; we have zero doses available today — and then, another
50 million in several months.  So we have some time to develop what our
plan is and meet whatever the needs are at that moment in time.  
   
Q    And then, on refugees: You know, the Washington Post reported today
that there’s now a consideration of bumping that cap up to the 62,500
number that the administration initially proposed in February.  Your
statement at the time when that was changed said that meeting that
target was “unlikely.”  So, can you just talk about what changed in the
thinking there, again, as this consideration is leading up to May
15th?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, we’ve — we’ve long said — or said for the last
several weeks that the President had every intention of announcing a cap
— a new cap, and that he would do that in advance of May 15th.  And we
are certainly — continue to be on track toward that.   
   
In terms of our considerations over time, we inherited an incredibly
broken system.  It left us with some — and the President and others —
with some skepticism about what the system would bear.  Hence, our
announcement a couple of weeks ago was meant to be a first step, focused
on announcing the resumption of flights and also the overturning of the
xenophobic policies of the last administration that prevented refugees
from applying from Africa and the Middle East.   
   
That has changed — that was the biggest hindrance to refugees being able
to apply from that part of the world — or for — in general, but from
that part of the world.  
   
One of the considerations, at this point in time, as we’re determining
what the cap will look like is what message we’re sending to the world. 
And we are a country — under the Biden-Harris administration — where we
want to send a clear message: We are welcoming refugees.  We want to
send that message to the world.  We want to send that message to the
refugee community and to organizations that have been underfunded, that
have had their muscles atrophied over the past couple of years where
that was not a primary focus.   
   
We also are sending — want to send a message that we’re — the President
has long been committed to the 125,000 cap that he has set — has always
consistently been his objective since February — for the next fiscal
year.  Sixty-two five was always meant to be a down payment on that. 
And so, we — those were the considerations as we make a determination
about the cap that we’re setting.  
   
Q    But wouldn’t you now say getting to that sixty-two five number this
fiscal year is likely, rather than unlikely?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say that whatever the cap is — if the cap is close
to that or at that — it will continue to be challenging.  But there are
considerations, including the message we’re sending to the world and
also the need to get the muscles working in the system, in the federal
government, but also with all of the important partners out there in the
United States and around the world that play an important role in
refugees traveling to the United States — help enable them to raise
money, help enable them to hire staff, and get their systems ready so we
can meet that 125 cap next year.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On India and the explosion of COVID cases there, the UK and Canada
have already instituted a travel ban in regards to India.  Why isn’t the
U.S. doing the same?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We would make those determinations based on the advice of
our health and medical team.  They haven’t made that determination at
this point.  
   
Q    And we are hearing reports of places where vaccine supply is
outstripping demand.  In Iowa, for instance, they’re now declining a new
shipment of vaccine because the demand isn’t there.  If this continues,
would the administration consider shipping more doses overseas?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we always expect it to hit that point, and we’re in a
new stage at this point in time, as you alluded to, Mary, where there
are — we’re not — we don’t have a supply challenge.  Now our challenge
is ensuring we’re meeting people where they are; we’re getting into
these communities; we’re continuing to increase confidence, which we’ve
seen an increase in, in a range of communities — Black and brown
communities, as well as more conservative white communities — which is a
good sign.  But there’s more work to be done.  
   
We will continue to evaluate what supply we have available for the
global community.  And we want to be a part of that effort, as is
evidenced by the announcement we made yesterday.  But that doesn’t mean
we’re going to pull back on or provide — give away supply that is needed
to vaccinate the American people, because that remains our top
priority.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    I had one on labor relations, and then one on the virus, if I
could.  The National Labor Relations Board has a May hearing.  It’s on a
complaint from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.  They
allege that Amazon, kind of, interfered in that union push and vote down
in Alabama.  Does President Biden feel that Amazon did in fact
interfere?  Does he support the complaint?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We would leave that to the NLRB.  They’re in place for a
reason.  
   
Q    Do you expect that to just play out?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Nods.)  
   
Q    You won’t — okay.   
   
And then, on the virus, I know we’re still fighting COVID, but what
efforts are afoot to make the U.S. more proactive if another pandemic
comes along down the road — you know, be more nimble on testing,
surveillance?  I know you’ve proposed a DARPA-like agency, the health
agency —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  APRA-H?  
   
Q    Yeah.  Would infectious diseases be part of that?  Is he going to
address at the speech — just looking down the road at what might come?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  ARPA-H is an issue — an endeavor that is close to the
President’s heart.  He’s talked about it quite a bit.  It could be a
part of the speech, but we’re still finalizing what that looks like.   
   
I will say that one of the President’s objectives, and the objective of
our national security team, is to do exactly what you said: is to
prepare for any future pandemics to make sure we are more closely
working with our national partners — international partners around the
world; that we are fully staffing agencies and positions that were
removed during the prior administration; that we are investing in
research and development; and that we are leading with health and
science.  
   
So, we are — while we are fighting this pandemic, we are also focused on
reinvesting in areas to prevent the next pandemic, including personnel,
research, and any needs to do exactly that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hey.  So, just a question.  Obviously, the President is going to
celebrate the 100-day mark with this tour.  But looking ahead to the
next 100 days in the first year of the administration — the first 100
days were quite scripted.  You know, the transition team talked quite a
bit about how they — you know, Biden set out certain goals for them, and
they tried to meet those over the course of the first 100 days.  What
does the next 100 days look like?  Can you give us some sort of preview
of what new priorities or benchmarks you’re going to set, and how that
planning process is underway?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we certainly believe we’re still going to be at
war with the virus, and there’s more work to be done to get the virus
under control, to meet people where they are, to get people vaccinated
who may not be confident in the efficacy at this point in time.  That
will be a — continue to be a priority.  
   
We are continuing to implement the American Jobs Plan and the American —
or, sorry, we’re continuing to implement the American Rescue Plan.  I
got a little ahead of myself there.  We will be working with Congress
closely bipart- — in a bipartisan way is certainly our intention — to
get the American Jobs Plan passed, to get the American Families Plan
passed.  The President would like to see progress by Memorial Day and
would like to sign it into law this summer.  So that will — those will
certainly be big priorities of our next 100 days.  
   
He also believes that police reform — getting the George Floyd Justice
in Policing Act passed — is long overdue, and he would certainly like to
see that move forward in Congress.  
   
And we’ve just — last week, we just held a — I’m not done yet — last
week, we just held an international climate summit.  There was a lot of
due outs, and a lot of work to be done from that, and I expect we’ll
continue to charge forward on addressing the climate crisis.  
   
Q    And just — should we expect more benchmarks? Obviously, he set the
200 million in 100 days; majority of schools reopen in 100 days.  Is
that, sort of, a pace that we’ll see — so those — were benchmarks set
again for the next 100 days? Do you have any —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect we’re going to continue to set marking points in a
transparent way so that we can evaluate ourselves and the American
people can evaluate our progress.  
   
Q    And just one more on the travel.  I know you said more travel could
come, but one of the things about the President’s travel so far is it
has mostly been to states that he won.  As — I covered his campaign and
he talked quite a bit — “There aren’t blue states or red states.” 
Should we expect the President to travel to states — more states that he
did not win in the presidential election or are not traditional
battleground states?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  Stay tuned.  
   
Q    Any updates on — on what those might be?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to tell you before we tell governors.  So,
soon.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  In addition to messaging the benefits of the vaccine,
launching the Community Corps, what other strategies is the
administration considering to reach out to the vaccine hesitant — to the
vaccine hesitant, the remaining 50 percent?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, we’ve seen a great deal of
improvement along these lines.  When the President took office, it was —
you know, only about 40 percent of the public wanted to get and take the
vaccine.  That has increased dramatically since that point in time.  
   
We’ve seen increases in confidence in — among Black and brown
communities.  We’ve also seen increases in confidence among white
conservative communities, which — I reference those because those are
some of the communities where there has been the higher level of — of
hesitation.  
   
But what our focus is on is — is following the data.  So what we’ve seen
is that local messengers, trusted voices — doctors, medical experts,
civic leaders, clergy, and local communities — continuing to distribute
out that $3 billion that has part of our funding to get to those
communities is going to be prime — front and center to our strategy.  So
we’re continuing to implement exactly that.  
   
And one of the challenges we’ve seen or heard most from communities or
people who are reluctant to take the vaccine is access and the challenge
of taking a day off of work or fitting it into their lives.  Some of
that is, again, meeting people where they are — mobile clinics; local
doctors; you know, making it available at pharmacies.  But some of it is
also the paid leave announcement we made just last week for businesses
of under 500 — that they can — that people can get time off and have
that covered through paid leave in order to go get a vaccine shot.  
   
So there are a number of strategies we’re implementing.  We’re seeing
progress.  We’re seeing them work.  And we know it will continue to be
harder as we vaccinate more and more people.  
   
Q    Is the administration tracking unused doses in each state?  And
what’s being done to make sure, in individual jurisdictions, doses are
not going to be wasted?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly, we are — our COVID team is.  And certainly they
work with states, localities, through our Pharmacy Program and all of
our programs, to ensure we’re doing everything possible to ensure doses
are used.  
   
Q    And then, one more on behalf of radio pool.  Is there an update on
whether the U.S. will support the special waiver to waive vaccine
patents at the WTO so other countries can make generic versions?  Of
course, there’s a meeting at the end of the month.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And I know that our ambassador — our UST- — our USTR spoke
to this.  So, how we’re looking at this is our focus is on maximizing
production and supply at the — in — for the world at the lowest possible
cost.  And there are a lot of different ways to do that.  
   
Right now, that’s one of — one of the ways, but we have to assess what
makes the most sense.  So, for example, we produce a lot of vaccines
here in the United States.  Right?  Vaccines, you know, manufactured
here.  We have manufacturing facilities that have been through — a
number of them have been through FDA approval or going through FDA
approval.  We have to evaluate whether it’s more effective to
manufacture here and provide supply to the world or the IP waiver is an
option.  There has not been a recommendation made from USTR, nor has the
President made a decision.  
   
Q    And one more follow-up on that topic.  What will go into deciding
which countries get our excess vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I expect it will be a combination of our COVID team,
working with our national security team, our team at the State
Department to determine where the requests are, where the needs come in,
where the needs are in order — and when — where we can be the most
impactful on helping get the pandemic under control.  And there is a
process ongoing now.   
   
Again, we’ll have about 10 million doses, we expect, hopefully, if they
go through the FDA review in the next couple of weeks, and then an
additional 50 several months from there.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is the White House open to some of the changes that Senator Scott
has proposed on qualified immunity?  In particular, is the White House
open to making it so that lawsuits can be brought against police
departments as opposed to just police officers?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the White House and the President are strong
supporters of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that has passed
the House.  We have every confidence in the negotiations that are
happening between members of the House and the Senate, and we will make
an evaluation once those hopefully conclude.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Thanks, Jen.  Two questions.  First, on the virus and relating to the
new guidance on the masks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Does this mean that there will also be a revision to the
President’s order on mask use in federal facilities?  For instance, will
the National Park Service be easing the guidelines for the — where you
have to wear a mask when you’re outside on a trail or at an overlook in
the national park or anything like that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, it’s a great question.  Just like many states will be
looking at the new guidance, I know, obviously, federal entities will be
very closely looking at the guidance.   
   
We’ll have to check and see what the status of that is, but obviously,
federal agencies — the National Park Service and others — certainly look
at and the President looks at the guidance put out by the CDC.  And I
expect there’ll be adjustments accordingly, but we’ll have to check on
the status of those or a timeline.  
   
Q    All right.  And on another topic: It’s been probably about a week,
I think, since someone in this room has asked the question about the
student loan forgiveness or cancellation.   
   
I know that the Department of Ener- — the Department of Education was
working on some sort of review of what was possible.  Is that review
going to be something that will be completed in time to make Chuck
Schumer a very happy senator tomorrow night?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Or is that’s something that will have to wait a little while
longer?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The review is ongoing.  Hopefully, we will make Senator —
Leader Schumer happy in other ways in the speech, but the review is
ongoing.   
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  So two questions.  My first one — a follow-up to
this.  So I understand the — that you will be — that the COVID team and
the national security team are going to consider for the vaccine —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    — sharing.  We’re not — I understand we still don’t have any
AstraZeneca doses to share, but the (inaudible) millions that will be
coming.  Can you at least say that, in order to open more quickly the
borders with Mexico and Canada, they will be at the top of the list of
the countries who will have access to these vaccines?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can’t.  You know, obviously, we have already lent doses to
Canada and Mexico.  They’re important — they’re not only our neighbors;
they are our friends.  But the process is just beginning, and I don’t
want to get ahead of the process that will be — the ongoing process. 
Once it’s concluded, we’ll let you know.  
   
Q    Okay, thank you.  And I want to try Josh’s question again about the
human right —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    — the — yeah, the Human Rights Watch report on the treatment of
Palestinians by Israel and the abuses that they underline.  It’s a very
thorough report.  You said — and the fact that the U.S. has turned a
blind eye to what’s happening over there.  That’s what they say.  That’s
what they say.   
   
You said that in the foreign — in this — in the President’s speech
tomorrow, there’s going to be a foreign policy section, and he’s going
to talk about what are our values.  Do you consider that the treatment
of Palestinians by Israel corresponds to the American values?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that the United States is committed to
promoting respect for human rights in Israel and the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.  And we’ve been an enduring partner — we also have an
enduring partnership with Israel and discuss a wide range of issues with
the Israeli government, including those related to human rights.  
   
So I was really conveying — or responding, specifically, to Josh’s
question, but it’s important to reiterate that, so I appreciate you
giving me the opportunity to do that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  Just a few questions for you.  Has the President
decided who he wants to see serve as the next U.S. ambassador to the
Holy See, and what are his criteria in choosing that person?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any personnel announcements to make.  I know
that’s, of course, an important one, but I — we’ve announced just a
couple of ambassadors, and hopefully we’ll have more in the coming
months.  We will have more in the coming months.  
   
Q    If I may follow up: Would he pick someone pro-life?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Would he pick someone pro-life?  I — I don’t have any more
details on who the President may or may not pick for that important
role.   
   
Q    Okay.  Next question.  As you well know, the administration just
lifted the ban on researchers using fetal tissue from elective
abortions.  And the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the leaders of
the President’s own faith, said in reaction, “It is…deeply offensive,”
quote, “to millions of Americans for our tax dollars to be used for
research that collaborates with an industry built on the taking of
innocent lives.”   
   
How does the White House respond to that criticism?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Look, I think the White House specifi- — or respectfully
disagrees.  And we believe that it’s important to invest in science and
look for opportunities to cure diseases, and I think that’s what this is
hopeful to do.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, and —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    A third question.  Thank you.   I don’t get in here too often
because of the COVID restrictions —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — so thank you very much.   
   
Okay.  You may be aware of this.  The LGBTQ — LGBTQ community is suing
the U.S. Department of Education, saying — they say the religious
exemption rule under Title IX is unconstitutional.  I don’t know if
you’re familiar with that case, but what is the administration’s
response to that?  In other words, will you stand behind that religious
exemption?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ll have to check with our legal team.  In — in general —
generally speaking, we support LGBTQ rights and believe that —
especially for children.  And children should be able to play sports,
including children and members of the LGBTQ community, of course.  
   
Q    That religious exemption, the White House stands behind?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything more on it.  I’ll check with our
team.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to follow up first on qualified immunity. 
Is the President committed to signing policing legislation if that
bipartisan working group that includes Karen Bass and Tim Scott are able
to come to an agreement and get something passed in Congress?  Is he
committed to signing that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he has every trust and confidence in Karen Bass and
appreciates the work of Senator Booker, Senator Scott as well.   
   
He, again, is a supporter of the George Floy- — Floyd Justice in
Policing Act that has passed the House.  And we’re not going to
negotiate from here.  We’ll see what comes through their
negotiations.   
   
Q    And as far as his speech tomorrow to the joint session of Congress
is concerned — I heard you earlier talk about some of the folks who have
been involved in helping him write that — did the Vice President help
him write that in any way, review any parts of that?  How is she
involved in the speech tomorrow?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  The Vice President always has a role in advising the
President, of course, on policy; on how he’s communicating to the
American people; on a range of issues that are huge priorities to this
administration.  And certainly, she will have a touch in the speech that
the President delivers tomorrow night.  
   
I didn’t include her only because I was including, kind of, staff and
the speechwriting team.  
   
Q    And final question, also on the Vice President: The President today
talked about vaccine skepticism or hesitancy in his speech.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    The Vice President — that was supposed to be part of her portfolio,
and she’s done issue — events on that in the past.  Has he asked her to
do anything specific to help with this problem — vaccine skepticism —
especially now that all Americans are eligible for the vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’s asked her to play a leading role both as a person who
is very prominent in the country, but — and also somebody who has, you
know, experience on the policy front — determining what the right steps
are, engaging with the COVID team, ensuring that we are taking the right
steps forward.  
   
We have a plan that’s being implemented across the country right now —  
   
(The briefing is interrupted by a creaking sound.)  
   
— a very robust — okay, it’s — maybe it’s former President Lincoln’s
ghost, so I’m going to go with that.   
   
— robust plan that’s being implemented — $3 billion focused on getting
out to communities.  You know, she’s involved in all that.  I expect
she’ll be out and doing more events around the country.   
   
So the President has just asked her to play a leading role in this
effort moving forward, which she is certainly doing.  
   
Q    So there’s nothing specific that he’s asked her to do in the near
future?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not sure what you mean by that?  Like what?   
   
Q    Maybe cut a PSA, or, you know, potentially have some other, sort
of, event here at the White House with groups.  I don’t know.  That’s
what I’m asking you to tell me.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I — whoa, okay.  I think the President has asked her,
as the Vice President, to be his partner in this and to be a prominent
leader in this effort to address confidence around the country.  She’s
doing exactly that.   
   
He’s not going to — their conversations don’t involve him directing her
to be in a PSA.  That happens at a staff level.   
   
She is somebody who travels around the country.  She’s doing events.  
I’m certain she’ll do PSAs.  She’ll continue to be involved with the
COVID team, with governors, with states, to continue to reach
communities where we need to increase confidence, and that will continue
to be a role she plays.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Democratic lawmakers have been making the case that the expanded
Child Tax Credit should be made permanent.  They say it’s the
responsible thing to do to minimize child poverty.   
   
And I was curious: What’s the administration’s take on why it’s
responsible to let it expire in 2025?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, there’ll be more details — we’ll confirm, later
this evening — about what is in the President’s speech and what is the
American Families Plan.  
   
But largely speaking, the President agrees that the Child Tax Credit has
a huge impact on helping families, helping reduce child poverty in this
country, which we’ve already seen an impact of from the implementation
of including it in the American Rescue Plan — which is something he
did.  And he also believes that it helps bring more women back into the
workforce.   
That’s why he has been engaging with Congress and why you’ll hear him
talk more about it in the speech.   
   
There is also — and we’ll discuss more what members of Congress want to
see.  Some disagree on this — about the length of time and everything. 
That will be a part of discussions.  
   
There’s also a cost.  It’s about a billion dollars a year to implement
the Child Tax Credit, and certainly that’s a — that is a part of the
discussion that we expect to have with Congress moving forward.  
   
Q    Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Has the President spoken to families of the Black men who were
killed in the police shootings in Virginia and North Carolina?  And if
not, has the White House had contact with them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any calls from the President to read out.  I
certainly — I just don’t have calls from the team, but I will check on
that for you and see if I can get back to you with more details.  
   
Q    And then, more broadly, as it relates to India, do you guys have
any good understanding of how many Americans in India right now have
become sick with COVID?  Are there any unique precautions being done to
help bring them here in some form?  How do you deal with that?  
   
And also, can you give us any better guidance, in terms of the
diplomatic situation there?  We believe a lot of Americans at the
consulates and perhaps the embassy there.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Or not Americans, but the staff there have tested positive.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  It’s — all great questions.  I would tend you to the
State Department who will have more in-depth details about this. 
Obviously, we’re working very closely with them.  But given they oversee
all the consulates, they’ll have the specific numbers, et cetera, for
you.  
   
(The briefing is interrupted by a creaking sound.)  
   
Q    Very quickly on —  (laughter).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Steve —  
   
Q    That was the State Department.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Right.  That was the State Department weighing in.  
   
Q    Very quick: Is there any update on the Iran talks in Vienna?  Is
Rob Malley back there now, and how long do you think this round will
last?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So they have been — we always expected there — the talks
would proceed again.  So Rob Malley, I believe, is either on his way to
the region or there now to take part in an additional round of
negotiations.  
   
We have felt that even though they’re direct — indirect, I should say —
that obviously a diplomatic process, diplomatic discussions are the
right approach.  And we are — have been encouraged by the fact that
they’ve been continuing.  
   
Q    Any timeframe on how long this round will last, do we know?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think we have a timeframe at this point in time,
Steve, but I will check with the negotiators and see.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    One — one thing on the mask mandate that a observant colleague just
called out.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    You have a order in place that requires masks at all — at all
federal buildings and all federal lands.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Is that being tweaked at all given today’s guidance on outdoor
masks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So this was a great question your colleague in the back, I
think, asked a version of.  Obviously, our — the federal government will
be certainly looking at the CDC as we make changes or make — implement
these policies.  I just have to check on the timeline of that.  
   
Yeah.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    While we’ve been in this briefing at the White House, someone else
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Uh oh.  
   
Q    — in this building put out a list of nominees — including Ed
Gonzalez, the sheriff in Harris County, Texas — to be the head of
Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Do you have anything to say about
that selection or about where that should be on the priority list for
the Senate’s consideration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly, we want — we encourage the Senate to not
only consider but confirm qualified nominees.  We certainly consider him
one of them.  
   
But the President looks forward to having someone in place in this
position, and it certainly indicates a priority that we put it out
today.  
   
Okay.  Yes, go ahead.  
   
Q    Anything more you can say — the President teased to more
information next week in terms of getting the country closer to normal
by July 4th.  What should we expect in terms of additional updates or
guidance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we rely on the timeline and the guidance of our health
and medical experts.  So I would — I’m not sure they will give you too
much guidelines or too much ahead of time, but the CDC — we would wait
for the CDC to provide any additional guidelines.  And we’ll continue to
provide updates from here from the President as appropriate, as we get
new advice from our health and medical teams.  
   
Okay.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you everyone.  
   
3:11 P.M. EDT
