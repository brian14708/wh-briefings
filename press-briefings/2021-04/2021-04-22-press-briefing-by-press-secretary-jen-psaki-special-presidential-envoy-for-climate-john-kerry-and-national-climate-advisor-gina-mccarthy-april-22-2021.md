title: "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki, Special Presidential Envoy for\
  \ Climate John Kerry, and National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, April 22,\_2021"
---
 
James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:44 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.   
   
Q    Hello.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Happy Earth Day, everyone.  And joining us in the
Briefing Room for the second time — I told you they’d come back and take
more questions; I deliver on my promises — is National Climate Advisor
Gina McCarthy and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.  
   
We’re, of course, very excited to have them here.  After their short
remarks, they will be able to take just a few questions because they
have a busy Climate Summit under way.  
   
With that, I will turn it over to Gina McCarthy.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR MCCARTHY:  Thanks, Jen.  And thanks, everybody.  It’s
great to be here.  Happy Earth Day.  
   
On day one, President Biden fulfilled his promise to rejoin the Paris
Agreement.  And as part of reentering the Paris Agreement, the President
launched a whole-of-government process that was organized through his
Climate Task Force to establish the 2030 emissions target, which is
known as the “nationally determined contribution” or “NDC.”  And it’s a
formal submission to the United Nations under the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.  
   
The NDC is a commitment.  And it’s — and our NDC basically says that the
United States will reduce our net economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions
by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.  
   
And this target builds on U.S. leadership at all levels of government
and programs to-date, and positions American workers and industry to
help us tackle the climate crisis.  
   
Today’s announcement is a product of this government-wide assessment on
how to make the most of the opportunity of combatting climate change and
what it presents for us and our future.  
   
To get here, we went sector by sector — electricity, transportation,
building, industry, and lands and oceans — and we looked at the wealth
of already-existing, cost-effective clean technologies and products that
are ready for deployment; and innovation trends that we see in the
marketplace that will allow us to win the clean energy future; and the
opportunities we now have to create good-paying union jobs, improve
public health, keep our communities safe, and advance environmental
justice.  
   
Over the past nearly 100 year of this adminis- — I’m sorry, 100 days —
feels like years at times — (laughter) — 100 days of this
administration, we met with and listened to cities and states,
businesses, workers, scientists, economists, young people, parents —
grandparents like me who were around during the first Earth Day and hope
to be around for quite a few more.   
   
The output of these — the bottom-up analyses and robust engagement is
this: And that is that we see multiple pathways across all sectors,
across all policy levers, across federal and state and local actions to
grow our economy and reduce our emissions.  
   
Look, President Biden has always believed that tackling the climate
crisis presents a valuable economic opportunity.  And the fact is:
Creating jobs and tackling climate change go hand in hand.  
   
We invest in the competitiveness of our industry and empower U.S.
workers to build more resilient and sustainable infrastructure and
propel us.  That is how we lead and move forward in manufacturing and
exports of clean energy technologies.  
   
In some ways, for my team, every day since January 20th has been Earth
Day and Jobs Day; every week has been Infrastructure Week and Innovation
Week.  We have marshalled the whole-of-government, the fantastic
Cabinet, and the remarkable team of climate and clean energy experts
across the federal government behind this President’s vision not just to
develop the target, but to unlock the opportunity that achieving this
target represents.   
   
Because when President Biden hears climate, he thinks “jobs.”  And it’s
no wonder.  The work we need to do is — is not just about avoiding an
existential threat — which climate change is — it’s about how we create
jobs for line workers, building thousands of miles of transmission lines
for a clean, modern, resilient grid; workers in energy communities
capping abandoned wells and reclaiming mines and stopping methane
leaks.   
   
It’s about autoworkers building modern, efficient, electric vehicles and
charging infrastructure to support them.  You can follow me right after
this briefing if you want to go hang out at Union Station; you can get a
close look at EV infrastructure in action.   
   
And engineers and construction workers expanding carbon capture and
green hydrogen to forge cleaner steel and cement.   
   
It’s about farmers using cutting-edge tools to make American soil the
next frontier of carbon innovation.  
   
So, let’s be clear: The American Jobs Plan will help us more fully tap
the economic upside here, investing in infrastructure, innovation; in
our workers and communities.  It’s something we cannot afford to pass
on.  
   
Let me close by reiterating what brings me here to work every day,
especially at this moment in my career: It’s Joe Biden’s unwavering
focus on people, on the air they breathe, and on their health; on the
strength of their communities and environmental justice; on the dignity
that comes with good work and jobs we can create; on how we keep working
together to move beyond a year we all would love to put behind us to one
of renewed hope and opportunity.  Because after all, this day is all
about investing in America and winning the future for our children. 
That’s why we’re here: Earth Day, Jobs Day — every day.  
   
Thank you.  And now let me pass it on to my good friend and fellow
Bostonian, Secretary John Kerry.  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Thank you, Gina.  Hello.  And thank you very much,
Gina.  I’m really happy to be here and share this day and this subject
matter with all of you.   
   
And I want to begin by just sharing with you what a spectacular job Gina
and her team have done.  You may remember the executive order which said
the President will aim to announce the NDC at the summit.  The aim was
not that he had any question about wanting to do that; the aim was
whether or not Gina or anybody could pull together all the parties that
had to be part of preparing an NDC — a gigantic, administrative,
organizational task, which Gina and her entire team have done really
superbly.  And I mean that.  That’s not a pro forma comment.  It is hard
to get all of the disparate elements of your government together.  
   
And the President, by issuing his executive order to make this — the
climate issue — an all-of-government enterprise and instructing every
single Cabinet officer and every single agency officer to
comprehensively factor climate consequences into every decision that
they were making.  And they have done that.  
   
And Gina created this task force.  We’ve never had an all-of-government
task force on this subject ever before.  We had it now because Gina’s
creation, and — and it’s worked.  And that’s what brought everybody
together to get this ambitious but appropriate, achievable goal in
place.  So I salute her and I thank her for that; it’s a great
service.  
   
And everywhere that I went in the world, in the course of the last
months, first question out of people’s mouths was, “What’s your NDC
going to be?  What are you guys going to do?  You’ve destroyed your
credibility.  You’ve left the Paris Agreement.  How can we trust you? 
What’s going to happen in the next four years?”  To which there is a
very, very powerful answer, which is: No politician, I think, could
change what is now happening globally in the marketplace.  And that is
part of the message of what’s happened here today and in the last few
days.  
   
You’ve had — yesterday we announced the Net-Zero Bank Alliance; we
announced that the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero; and we have
some 43 financial institutions across the world worth some — I forget
the exact sum — forty-some trillion dollars or something, in terms of
assets managed.   
   
And just yesterday, a number of banks announced — six banks, to be
precise — that they are allocating or setting — or making a commitment
that they will invest into climate-related efforts, initiatives,
investments — $4.16 trillion over the next 10 years.  That’s been a
really missing element in all of this.  
   
So I’m really happy to be here today for a number of reasons.  First of
all, just parenthetically, five years ago today, I had my granddaughter
on my knee in New York and signed the Paris Agreement.  And that was a
great moment for everybody in the world when everybody came together in
New York excitedly to set out on this venture.   
   
Regrettably — without any facts, without any science, without any
rationale that would be considered reasonable — the former President
decided to pull out.  He was the only President in the entire world —
the only Chief of State in the entire world, who, without any scientific
evidence, decided to pull out of the Paris Agreement.  
   
So, when President Biden was elected — having made climate one of the
most critical issues of his agenda — we had a big step to get up.  We
had to restore America’s credibility.  We had to prove that we were
serious.  And, I think, today does that in many ways, and not in a
chauvinistic — in a way that’s, sort of, inappropriate to our
relationship with other countries, but in a way that reinforces the fact
that this is multilateral; that we need to bring all the countries of
the world to the table; and we all need to raise ambition.  That’s the
central theme of this meeting today.  We must all raise ambition.   
   
And you heard that in, I thought, profoundly, meaningful, moving,
understandably frustrated and angry words — tame for anger — words that
came from Xiye Bastida.  And that’s where a lot of the younger
generation is today, appropriately — pretty upset at the adults — the
alleged adults who are not getting their act together to make happen
what needs to happen.  We aren’t there yet either.   
   
But today we built a huge, foundational building block in the effort to
get there.  So, the importance of today in my judgment is this: The
world came together.  President Xi, Prime Minister Modi, President
Putin, presidents of small countries and big countries, President
Macron, the Chancellor of Germany; the EU itself, independently; people
in the financial marketplace and others — all of them in agreement that
this — this is a crisis.  It is the climate crisis, and it’s going to
require an enormous lift to get where we need to go.  
   
So, what happened today — just to underscore where we are — on January
19th, we were nowhere; we were in deficit with respect to our efforts. 
And because of President Biden’s leadership in calling the summit, in
putting us on the line to do this, we now have about 55 percent of the
global GDP committed to levels of reductions that keep faith with
holding the Earth’s temperature at 1.5 degrees.   
   
That is a big chunk of difference.  And we’ve done that working with
countries — sitting down with them — with Japan; with Korea; with
Australia; with — you have Indonesia; with India; with the Middle East —
with 11 countries at one meeting where even oil-producing countries
stepped up and made things clearer; and, of course, China, included; as
well as some Latin American countries and African countries.  
   
So, I’m pleased with where we are, but I’m — I’m not sanguine.  The next
six months of diplomacy are going to be absolutely critical to the
capacity to make Glasgow what it needs to be.  
   
I do believe Glasgow remains our last best hope to be able to coalesce
the world in the right direction and to get the critical mass of
countries of the 20 biggest emitters, who are responsible for 81 percent
of all the emissions — all 20 of them were here today, and almost all 20
of them were pledging to do additional things.  So that’s our job is to
be to clarify it over the course of these next weeks and months.  
   
I’d just clarify very quickly: Japan said they’d cut emissions 46 to 50
percent by 2030 — strong efforts towards achieving a 50 percent
reduction — up from its existing 26 percent reduction.  Canada
strengthening from a current 30 percent to a 40 to 45 percent.  The
Republic of Korea terminating overseas coal finance and preparing to
update its NDC consistent with the 2050 net-zero goal.  India, in
partnership with the United States, to deploy 450 gigawatts of renewable
power.  Why is that important?  Because if we can do that — which is
where our finance component of this is so critical — if we do that,
India is on track to hold the 1.5 degrees centigrade.  So, Argentina
announced a package of important measures.  The UK, last week, just
announced 78 percent target by 2035.  And yesterday, EU announced a new
law to embed the 55 percent reduction for 2030, and also the net zero.  
   
So, you know, I think that it’s progress, but we still have a heavy
lift, and no one should doubt the challenges of the road ahead.  So, I’m
happy to be here.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  I know we’re very close to the tail end of when
Gina has to go, so let’s try to get around very quickly.  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Yeah, let Gina (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Secretary Kerry, to you, first: When it comes to the
pledge, how can you realistically make this pledge to the rest of the
world when there’s no guarantee that Republicans will get on board with
your plan once you release it?  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Well, a lot of the plan is executable through just
executive order — I’m going to let Gina speak to this — but a lot of the
plan is executable through order.  But that’s the power of having the
private sector here.  That is the real reason why I’m saying to you that
no politician in the future is going to undo this because, all over the
world, trillions of dollars, trillions of yen, trillions of euros are
going to be heading into this new marketplace.  And the future belongs
to the countries, as you heard today from any number of leaders, that
are the ones who develop hydrogen — green hydrogen fuel, or storage, or
battery storage, or direct carbon capture for the atmosphere.  Some
technology is going to break through here, folks.   
   
And one of the things I know the President is thinking about is how to
accelerate the innovation and the research and development that’s going
to push that curve.  
   
Gina, do you want to talk to that a little bit?  
   
ADMINISTRATOR MCCARTHY:  Sure.  Just to indicate to you that this is —
is really a result of understanding what our authorities are at the
federal government, but also what’s happening at the local and state
level, what’s happening in the business community, what kind of
technologies that are ready to be deployed now, how many jobs can be
created by this.  This is not just a bottoms up; it’s also a values
down.  It’s also looking at how we grow as a country and be
sustainable.   
   
The plan that the President has put in place and the plan that we’re
relying on here is a plan that we can deliver because we have the
wherewithal to do it in terms of policies and programs, but we also have
carefully looked at what we can deliver in terms of change.  And the
world is changing: It’s not going backwards; it is moving forward.   
   
And the exciting thing about this is that this plan has received
endorsements from the AFL-CIO, the Chamber of Commerce, the Edison
Electrical Institute, and the IBEW.  Does it get better than that?  You
know, this is because all of them recognize that we have to invest in
America again.  That’s what the American Jobs Plan is all about.  That’s
what we anticipate our country will do, because we know how to make this
happen, we can put people back to work, and it’s time for us to think
about hope and opportunity and get past the year that we’re finishing.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Why don’t we —  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  What —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  No, I just had a lot of people who would say — stay
here if (inaudible) — a lot of people would say, you know, if you hadn’t
— if the President hadn’t put the plan forward, you’d be asking why you
haven’t put the forward to do the building out of a transmission system
for America or whatever it is.  He put it forward, and it’s a legitimate
thing to say, “Now can it get passed?  Can you get there?”  
   
But this is the — this job future is not something conjured up out of
anybody’s imagination.  This is the most real thing in the world.  The
Bureau of Labor Statistics says there are three jobs that will actually
more than 50 percent this year.  The first is 62 percent growth in wind
turbine technician.  The second is nurse practitioners, for obvious and
unfortunate reasons.  And the third is solar panel installer at 51
percent.   
   
So, the jobs are growing there.  I’m not offering that job to somebody
who may feel, “Oh my God, I got a better job.  I don’t want to lose that
job,” et cetera.   
   
But the job market here is going to be gigantic.  And for electricians,
plumbers, pipefitters, steelworkers, heavy-equipment operators — all of
these people — building out America’s grid and transitioning us to this
new future is — is going to happen in countries all over the world.  We
need to make sure we’re not left behind — in fact, that we’re leading in
the creation of the new technologies and new opportunities.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR MCCARTHY:  And the only other thing I would I would
mention is that, you know, wind and solar had the biggest year they’ve
ever had last year.  And — and what we saw last year was a continuation
of tax credits that passed through a Republican-controlled Congress.   
   
So we all know where this is heading.  The real question is: Do we want
to have the courage to grab it here, to prosper from the jobs here, and
to stabilize our economy and our planet at the same time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can hear your staff, Gina —  
   
ADMINISTRATOR MCCARTHY:  They’re yelling at me.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — trying to pull you to Union Station.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR MCCARTHY:  And the only thing I will tell you is: Electric
vehicles are another interesting piece.  That’s actually going to be a
big part of our future.  I’m going to go check out a charging station
and look at some of those vehicles.   
   
But the thing I would encourage you to think about is that we’ve had
many of the large car companies stand up and say, “100 percent EVs by
2035.”  We didn’t say that.  I didn’t even say “electric vehicles.”  It
was the very first thing they said to me is that that’s the future.  And
that’s what this is all about: What does our future look like?  Who are
we grabbing it for?  
   
Happy Earth Day.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Do you have a few minutes?  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  I’ll take a couple more, yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Okay.  Go ahead, Peter.  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  (Inaudible.)  
   
Q    Secretary Kerry, thanks so much.  So pledges, obviously, are
important and they are great, but how do we realistically get there
without turning the economy on its ear?  As best you can, put this in
real terms for folks.  Does this mean the U.S. has to reach 40 percent
renewable power by 2030; that we have to have 25 percent of the cars on
the roads, by 2030, be electric?  What does this mean to folks listening
to you?  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  What it means is that we’re going to be investing. 
This is not an ex- — you know, this is not a throwaway.  This is an
investment in new ways of getting energy to people that’s more
efficiently delivered; that’s lower cost, in the long run; and that it’s
— it’s really going to open up a whole group of employment opportunities
that we know — that are beginning to be seen in America today.  
   
And it’s not because the government is directing those things to happen;
the marketplace is doing this.  You can’t build a coal-fired power plant
in the United States with a bank funding it, and no individual is going
to throw their money down there.   
   
Same thing in Europe today.  Now starting in other countries — you just
heard Korea to say, “We’re not going to fund any external coal.”   
   
So there’s a transition that the market has undertaken, well before
anybody proposed the program or anything.  This is a transition that’s
taking place.  And we’ve historically always gone through these periods
when, in America, we innovate, and we do the R&D, and we come up with a
new product of some kind or another.  
   
You know, I lived and represented for years — had the privilege of
representing communities like Lowell and Lawrence and Brockton and
plenty of places — you know, Fall River — that have these huge mills
that were, you know, teeming with people working in the early 1900s, and
then that changed.  And it went south in our America — in our country,
and then it went abroad.   
   
Because that’s the transition in economies.  And it happened in the
Industrial Revolution, it happened in the revolution of technology in
the 1990s, and it’s going to happen now.  We always replace it with a
different kind of — or some, you know, new opportunity.   
   
And I don’t think it’s going to mean that much dislocation, frankly. 
It’s going to mean some greater opportunity.  
   
Q    What specifically can you — you probably can’t give specific
numbers to those things on electric vehicles on the road then.  But
given what you witnessed with the last President, what — if President
Biden is not to win again in 2024, what specifically can you do now to
make sure that the next President, with a stroke of the pen, can’t
reverse progress you’re trying to make right now?  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  I’ll answer that very directly, but I want to begin by
pointing out to you that there’s a company called Tesla, which is the
highest-valued automobile company in the world.  Why?  All it makes is
one product: electric vehicles.  That is what is happening.  That’s a
signal.  That’s the market saying, “Here we are.  This is going to
happen.”  
   
And GM has now already announced, on its own, that they are only going
to produce electric vehicles, as of 2035.   
   
And Ford Motor Company — ask the president of Ford.  I heard him at an
event, standing up and saying the electric car is a better car.  They
love it.  And I don’t know if you’ve driven one, but they’re fabulous. 
They’re really great.   
   
And so, my — my feeling is that — that is going to take place because
the market is sending signals and the consumer is sending signals.   
   
Now, that said, how do you prevent somebody from coming along and
preventing the stroke-of-a-pen change?  Here’s — here’s what is going to
happen, no question about it: Because the world, as a whole, is moving
in this direction; because these companies have made this critical,
long-term, strategic marketing judgment — and that is the way the market
is moving — no politician, no matter how demagogic or how potent and
capable they are, is going to be able to change what that market is
doing, because it will have moved.  It’ll have four years of
entrenchment.  And those jobs will be there.  And people will see that
this is the product people want to buy.  
   
And they will also increasingly, I believe — more and more are convinced
by the heat in the summer, by the floods, by the weather, by the
intensity of storms, by the rising of sea level that we got to get
moving.  And I don’t think anybody is going to get back from that fast,
because we’re way behind the eight ball on that.  And the chances of
seeing more damage before we see the progress is very, very real.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We can do one or two more.   
   
Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Secretary Kerry, President Putin and Bolsonaro today
both threw a little bit of shade at the United States with their
comments about historical emissions.  I was wondering what’s your take
on their plans and your response to those criticisms, and whether or not
you have an intention to travel to those countries.   
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Well, at some point, probably, travel will be
warranted.  We’ve been in conversations with both — with their teams —
on this subject.  We’re not at a place where we feel like we’re prepared
to, you know, make the journey because there’s a sense that there may be
something concrete that we can define, but I think there may be chances
of it.   
   
I listened to President Putin today.  I thought he was pretty rational
and put some decent, visionary thoughts on about things we might want to
be looking at and cooperating together, and he talked about that
possibility.   
   
So, just as with China, where we found a way to try to at least create
this chain, this line of communication, and where we have a long way to
go — but it’s a beginning.  And that’s the nature of diplomacy.   
   
But I think that — I think that we’re in a place where we will have the
ability to be able to create enough progress with other countries that
those countries are going to come along, too.  And I sense from both of
them — I — some of the comments that President Bolsonaro made today
surprised me for their — you know, that — that’s pretty good, that works
if you do those things.  The question is: Will they do them?  And the
question is:  What’s the follow through and enforcement?  
   
Now one of the things you ought to take note of is this program — the
Trace Program — which Al Gore and different entities have been involved
in, which is now the satellite capacity to measure in real time what the
footprint is of corporations or countries all around the world.   
   
And — and so there’s no hiding anymore, and there’s going to be
real-time tracking.  And that’s one of the things that will come out of
Glasgow, I think, is sort of what’s the accountability structure going
to be here for countries to be able to move.   
   
So I think that, you know, Russia has reduced some emissions.  Their
economy is very different from ours and a lot of people on the planet. 
It’s mostly gas-based, as we know.  That presents challenges for them
going forward.   
   
So I think there’s room to hopefully have a discussion about this, and
we’ll see if we can find some common ground.  I think that’s the most
important summary of what I heard, in terms of their comments today.   
   
Q    And do think that the 50 to 52 percent that the President unveiled
today, that Gina McCarthy put together is far enough for the U.S.?  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  I think it’s — it’s doable.  It’s a tough — it’s not —
it’s not easy.  Is it doable?  Yes.  Will we probably exceed it?  I
suspect yes.   
   
I think a lot of us will wind up exceeding the predictions we’re making
because we’re measuring predictions by the economies we have today and
by the technologies we have today.   
   
But five years from now, we may have a major breakthrough on batteries,
on storage, on green hydrogen, on direct air carbon capture.  There are
so many things out there that people are chasing and working on, and
that’s part of the value of the — sort of the investment in — and the
venture capital business.  
   
I mean, people are looking to — you know, to be the — the entity that
hits pay-dirt with the patent on the best storage system that there is. 
And whoever does that will make more money than Jeff Bezos pretty
quickly.  That’s going to be a big deal.   
   
Green hydrogen — there are a whole bunch of countries working on
hydrogen and green.  And if you can bring it up to scale at a cost that
is not prohibitive so you’re competitive with other things, it starts to
take off.  I think these things are going to happen.   
   
I tell you, I’m genuinely optimistic because so much is beginning to
happen and because I believe in our ingenuity and our capacity.  I know
President Biden does.  I’ve heard him talk about it.  He believes we can
do anything.  You’ve heard him say it.  
   
And think about it: We are the country that went to the Moon.  And we
didn’t know how we were going to get there when President Kennedy
announced that goal, but we did it.  We are the country that invented
the Internet.  Some people might regret that today, but we did that.  We
also got vaccines that are working, and we’ve shown we have the ability
to get them out and put them in people’s arms.   
   
So I believe that we have the ability.  When — when, you know, you talk
to Rafael Reif, the president of MIT, and you listen to what they’re
trying to do at MIT or at Stanford or at CalTech or, you know, a number
of other tech colleges and universities in America — if we were to join
forces, as we’re going to try to, with other efforts around the world,
we think there are just great opportunities, and I believe we’re going
to — we’re going to break through.  We’re going to know how to do
hydrogen, and there’s plenty of it.  
   
And this, I think, is the — is really the future.  It’s why so many
people are chasing it.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jen, last one.  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Maybe last one.  Last one.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But I will also give you the contact information for his
team for anybody who wants to talk to him more.  He has lots of
thoughts, as you all know.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Kind of piggybacking off of Jeff’s last question: You know, there
have been some groups that have been really positive about the NDC and
the other steps that the administration has taken today — the climate
finance stuff.   
   
But there are also some who are saying it’s insufficient.  And you
referenced the young woman who spoke this morning, you know, and that
deep passion about the crisis that previous generations have put on her
generation.   
   
What do you say to those people who say that 50 to 52 percent is not
enough or that, you know, the several billion dollars that you’re
committing for climate finance for developing countries is also
insufficient, you know, when you consider just how big the U.S. budget
is — that you’re talking about, you know, under $10 billion?  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Well, let me just say to you that  
I loved her passion and I loved what she said.  I mean, I didn’t agree
with every step of it.  You can’t do some of this stuff overnight, just
physically, and there are impediments to getting some of that done. 
But, boy, do I understand where she’s coming from.  
   
I told you this was five years to the day that I signed the agreement. 
It’s also 50 years to the day that I testified before the United States
Senate and I was camped on the Mall here with a bunch of veterans
opposing the war in Vietnam.   
   
And, you know, that was a period of time when young people — our
generation — stood up and made our voices heard.  And we had — we were
part of the Civil Rights Movement — 1964-65; we were part of the women’s
movement; part of the peace movement; part of the environment
movement.  
   
The environment movement back then produced.  I was part of the first
Earth Day.  And we organized — I organized in Massachusetts, then we
organized for the election.  We targeted 12 Congress people who were
labeled the “Dirty Dozen” — the worst of the Congress — and we beat 7 of
them.   
   
And that’s when we passed the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water
Act, the Marine Mammal Protection, the Coastal Zone Management, the
Endangered Species, and we created the Environmental Protection Agency
for our country.  It all happened, folks, back then.  Richard Nixon
signed it into law — 1972, I think.  
   
So, I believe in what the young folks are doing out there today. 
They’re trying to get adults to be adults and do what we’re supposed to
do, which is take facts into consideration and respond to those facts
and, as public officials, exercise the precautionary principle of
governance that when you get information that says X, Y, and Z are going
to happen, and there’s not a 5 or 6 or 10 percent chance it’s going to
happen — like whether you might have a car accident and you get
insurance, or your home might burn and you get insurance, or you might
get sick and you get health insurance — it’s 100 percent certain that
most of these things are going to happen — that the ice is melting; that
the sea is rising; that — warming —  and yet, we’re not buying
insurance.   
   
And so you’re darn right they’re angry, and I share that anger.  It’s a
frustration.  But how do you get from here to there to get it done?   
   
And I believe what President Biden is doing is leading to get us from
here to there.  What’s happening here today is a huge step forward to
get us from here to there by setting these targets, by getting nations
invested.  By getting leaders to say publicly, “We have to do this,” you
begin to get a foothold on holding them accountable and on moving
forward and getting it done.   
   
Is it enough?  No, but it’s the best we can do today and prove we can
begin to move and get the technologies and find the easier path and
then, hopefully, get the job done.  And I really believe that.  I think
we will get the job done, as President Biden said today, because of our
capacity for innovation and research and development, and producing
great products in the future, and meeting big challenges.   
   
And we’ve always done that.  And I think Americans are really anxious to
do something like that.  That’s why I’m here doing this, folks, and not,
you know, in the private sector or retired and doing some things.  It’s
because I believe this moment is the moment, heading to Glasgow, where
we need to get on track.   
   
As I said to you earlier, over 50 percent of global GDP agreed here
today that they’re going for 1.5 degrees, and what they’re doing will
get them on track to do it.   
   
So if we’re on track to do it, that’s pretty darn good, even though we
know we need to move faster and we’re not, as a planet, as a group of
countries, where we need to be.  It’s probably a good note to end on.   
   
Thank you all.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you so much, sir.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Let me get that.  Are you now stepping out for your
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, I’ve got to do the briefing now.  I’ll call you later. 
(Laughter.)  
   
SECRETARY KERRY:  Thanks.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  See how it was so great to work for him several times
over?  Okay, a couple — I think I just have one or two more items for
you at the top.  Just one more.    
   
As you saw this morning, the latest unemployment insurance claims came
out.  They provide a welcome sign that our economy is slowly healing and
also provide a reminder of the importance of both the pandemic programs,
expend- — extended by the American Rescue Plan, and the 200 million
shots we’ve gotten into the arms of Americans in less than 100 days.   
   
While these weekly numbers can be volatile, we are encouraged by the
fact that the four-week average is also down.  It demonstrates that the
administration’s combined efforts are building confidence in our economy
and that the President’s approach can both create good-paying jobs and
address the climate crisis.  
   
With that, why don’t we go over to you.   
   
Q    Thank you.  New York Times is reporting that the next phase of the
American Family Plan will include tax increases on the wealthy to help
pay for human infrastructure, like education.  Could you confirm any of
the details that tax increases are in the offing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me just reiterate: The President remains
committed to his campaign commitment of not raising taxes for anyone
making less than $400,000 a year, and that will certainly be reflected
in his proposal he makes next week.  
   
Let me also say that you can expect that he’ll outline the details of
the American Families Plan in his Joint Session Address to Congress next
Wednesday, April 28th.   
   
But I will also say that he’s continuing to meet — despite how busy it
is around here with the Climate Summit — with his policy team, and will
be, over the coming days, to finalize the details of the package,
including the investments in areas like child care, education, and other
areas that are big priorities to him that we’ve talked about, as well as
the payfors.   
   
So I can’t get ahead.  I’m not going to get ahead of him making final
decisions, but the package will be laid out in the speech next week.  It
will focus on the areas that we’ve outlined: child care, education —
historic investments in those.  And as he ha- — did with the American
Jobs Plan, he will also propose a way to pay for it.   
   
Q    And if I could just — very quickly: Some Republican lawmakers put
out a slimmer infrastructure plan.  It includes roads, water, some
broadband — some things that the President wants in his plan, but
smaller.  Any reaction to the plan?  And is it — do you guys see it as a
legitimate starting point for a conversation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We do.  The President has said from the beginning that he
would welcome any good-faith effort to find common ground, because the
only unacceptable step would be inaction.   
   
We’ve seen some topline proposals or topline details, as you all have
reported on.  We’re looking forward to reviewing the details of the
proposal.  We would expect the next steps would be a full briefing and
conversations on a staff level that will continue over the coming days,
and an exchange of ideas from there.   
   
And then we’d also expect — or I would expect that — you should all
expect the President to invite members to the White House after — soon
after the Joint Session Address.   
   
But we certainly welcome any good-faith effort, and certainly see this
as that.  But there are a lot of details to discuss and a lot of
exchanges of ideas to happen over the coming days.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Is President Biden going to extend his call for Americans to wear
masks beyond 100 days?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, Peter, he is working and in discussions with our
health and medical experts about what we need to do to get the pandemic
under control, including providing clear guidance to the American public
about what the benefits of — are of being vaccinated, including getting
it to communities and meeting people where they are.  So I don’t have
any update on that at this point in time.  
   
Q    And so then, I guess maybe this is the same but a little bit
different: Should the CDC change its guidance right now that says that
vaccinated Americans should be wearing masks when they’re outdoors —
when they’re outside in public?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re going to leave that to them to determine and to
announce.  And obviously, we would follow and abide by their guidance,
and certainly would recommend that the American people do as well.  
   
Q    May I have a quick last one then on —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — on Armenian genocide.  Should we expect President Biden, in the
course of the next several days, perhaps this weekend, to make any
formal announcements recognizing the Armenian genocide?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly understand the question and there’s a great deal
of interest in this particular topic, but I don’t — I’m not going to get
ahead of the President and I also don’t have anything else to provide
from the podium today.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Back on trying to reach this 50 to 52 percent reduction goal, many
of the measures that you’ve pointed to are ones that are included in
this broader infrastructure plan.  If you can’t get this plan passed
though, can you still reach that target?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our view is that there are multiple pathways for each
economic sector of the economy to — that produces greenhouse gases —
including electricity, transportation, buildings, industry, and lands —
to make adjustments and changes, some through executive action, some
through passing legislation, some through the steps — as Gina and our
envoy alluded to — the private sector is taking steps on their own.   
   
So, you know, just to give you a couple of examples: You know, we, of
course, have set a goal to reach 100 percent carbon pollution-free
electricity by 2035, which can be achieved through multiple
cost-effective pathways, each resulting in meaningful emissions
reductions in this decade.  That’s a step that is already underway.   
   
We can create good-paying jobs and cut emissions and energy costs for
families by supporting efficiency upgrades; that’s another area where it
would have an impact.   
   
We can reduce emissions from the transportation sector by reducing
tailpipe emissions and boosting the efficiency of cars and trucks —
something the President has talked about that he’s committed to do.  And
we can also invest, as you alluded to, in a wide array of transportation
infrastructure.   
   
But one of the arguments that we will be making — and continue to make,
I should say, around the American Jobs Plan is that these industries are
— we are moving in the direction of these industries.  These are the
industries of the future.   
   
The big question is whether we are going to lead that effort or not — or
is China going to lead that effort.  And the last — the meetings today
and tomorrow are just a reminder that the world is moving in this
direction.  So we either get on board and lead or we don’t, and there
may be a disagreement about that.  
   
Q    You talked a lot, obviously, about job creation and the potential
for that with this plan.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    But can you put this into further perspective for Americans?  How
does this new reduction target impact their everyday lives?  What kind
of changes can Americans really expect to see.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, look, I think, as we’ve talked about a little bit — or
as I just alluded to a little bit, but let me try to get more directly
at your question: There are steps that are already underway.  Right? 
There are steps that industries are already taking: investing in the
future of electric vehicles, investing in the future of electric cars. 
That is something that if you talk to many automakers, they’re already
moving toward that.   
   
I think the question here — maybe it’s less for Americans.  It is for
Americans in the sense of: What is your government going to do to help
ensure we are on the path to create — to make this a job-creating
opportunity for the American people?  You know, how are we going to
prepare and invest in industries now so that your children and your
grandchildren have opportunities in these industries that are
growing?   
   
But this is already where the private sector is going.  This is already
where the jobs are in the future.  So what we’re really questioning now
is how we can incentivize and how we can prepare the economy and
opportunities for the next generation.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You just mentioned and Secretary Kerry mentioned the
fact that the market is already heading towards electric vehicles. 
There’s no turning back from that; it’s an unstoppable force.   
   
If that’s the case, why should taxpayers pay for 500,000 electronic —
electric vehicle charging stations?  Isn’t that something that will get
taken care of by the market?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, I think there’s a role for government to play. 
Our view, the President’s view is there’s a role for government to play
to incentivize, to ensure that there is continued movement in this
direction, but there’s also a great deal — a lot of the investment
that’s in the American Jobs Plan is about ensuring that there are
industries and jobs that are created in sectors in the future to help
the next generation survive and prosper.  
   
So, yes, there is a private-sector partnership here.  There’s a role of
the private sector.  But our view is there’s also a role of the public
sector, and that this is a — these are industries that are also going to
create jobs, and that’s part of the role we can play.  
   
You know, and I don’t think — I know there’s been criticism out — there
are questions about how this is going to impact job creation, today —
right? — and job creation in our economy today — or some criticism, I
should say, from some — some Republicans in Congress that I’ve read,
this morning — seen on the Twit- — on Twitter.   
   
But, you know, the President is somebody who has created — will be the
first in history to create a million jobs in his first 100 days in
office.  He’s on track for that, in our view.  
   
And a lot of these critics are the same people who advocated for the
policies of the last administration and the last President who oversaw
an economy that lost more jobs than any President since Hubert Herver
\[sic\] — Hoo- — Herbert Hoover.  It’s quite a — quite a name.   
   
So join us on the journey.  We feel clean jobs can be — good jobs can be
— create millions of jobs in the future.  And that’s, I think, what
we’re conveying to the American public.   
   
Q    I want to go back to taxes for a moment because the Dow is down
about 350 points on reports that the Biden administration is going to
propose doubling, essentially, the capital gains rate for high-income
Americans.  Can you tell us any more about that plan?  And do you have
any concerns that that would discourage long-term investing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re still finalizing what the payfors look like. 
But I will say that the President’s calculation is that there’s a need
to modernize our infrastructure.  There’s a need to invest in
childcare.  There’s a need to invest in early childhood education and
making our kids and the workers of the next generation more
competitive.  And he should propose a way to pay for it.   
   
His view is that that should be on the backs — that can be on the backs
of the wealthiest Americans who can afford it, and corporations and
businesses who can afford it.  And his view and the view of our economic
team is that that won’t have a negative impact.   
   
There are alternative views — or there are proposals that don’t exist
yet on how to pay for it.  That will be a part of the discussion.   
   
But he stays firm to his commitment to not raise taxes on Americans
making under $400,000 a year, and he’ll have a range of proposals on how
to pay for his plans to invest in education and child care.  
   
Q    Got it.  And then finally, can you tell us anything about these
reports that the Pentagon has been investigating suspected directed
attempt — energy attacks, likely by the Russians, against U.S.
troops?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I believe the head of — one of — a very high-level
member of the military spoke to this and denied those accusations or
allegations and said there were no — he did not have any evidence of
those reports.  And that’s in some of the stories now.   
   
So, go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  There’s been a lot of talk about innovation in the
private sector, but going back to the public sector: Today, putting out
the international climate finance plan — kind of piggybacking on another
question — when you’re giving money to developing nations, raising that
amount of money, what kind of strategy does the White House have for
dealing with maybe some opposition in Congress there and also changing
within the government?  Like is the administration planning to spend
less on fossil fuels, relying more on green energy?  What’s your
strategy for reaching Republicans in Congress?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  For com- — oh, about the importance of doing this?  
   
Q    About how to, you know, get them to raise the amount of money that
are going to developing nations and the importance of — of doing it. 
But also, I mean the wheels of government sometimes turn slowly, and
you’re talking about — a lot about the industry innovation, but getting
the government on board — the federal government — Congress on board
with the plan.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, some of this commitment — I think, as you’re alluding
to — of the climate finance announcement is asking Congress to
appropriate the $1.25 billion.  Is that what you’re talking about?  The
—  
   
Q    To get the —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  For the Green Climate Fund.  And we’re obviously going to
have to work with Congress on that.   
   
I — you know, I think our collective view here is that it is not — the
United States is a major emitter in the world.  We’re not the only
emitter.  And that, in order to address the climate crisis, we need to
work with developing countries to ensure they have the resources to help
meet those obligations.  That’s certainly the proposal and the pitch we
would be making.  We’re not saying it’s going to be easy, but that would
be the pitch we’d be making around that financing.  
   
Q    Jen, do you know when you might make a pitch like that — when that
might be coming up?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, with members or with —  
   
Q    With members, yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly we just announced it today, and I’d expect
we’d have conversations soon with members about the importance of moving
this forward.  
   
Q    And one more question from a colleague.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    I’m looking for a reaction to the apparent pullback of Russian
troops along the border of Ukraine.  Do you know if the President is
going to speak with President Putin about this reported plan to move
troops away from that border by May 1st?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President, of course, has expressed — he had a
call with President Putin just last week — if I’m remembering the date,
the timing correctly — and we’ve expressed our concerns over the course
of the last few weeks about the buildup of troops and what we had
perceived as aggression on the border, and conveyed our clear push, in
coordination with the global community, to — for troops to move back and
to reduce that aggression.  We obviously want to deescalate tensions not
only in the relationship, but certainly at the border.  
   
I don’t have any predictions of a call with President Putin to make. 
Obviously, he participated in the summit this morning, and they spoke
just last week.  Our National Security Advisor spoke with his
counterpart earlier this week.  So I would expect the conversations will
happen at that level for the time being.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I just want to circle back on Russia again.  So, Navalny’s health
is continuing to deteriorate, and I know that you had said, along with
the National Security Advisor, that you’ve made clear to Russia that
there will be consequences if he dies.  But I’m wondering if there’s
anything you can say about what the administration is willing to do now
or communicate to the Russians now about the need to get him out before
he does die.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, to be clear, Jake Sullivan, our National Security
Advisor, had a conversation with his counterpart, just a few days ago,
where this was certainly a part of the discussion and conveying not just
the consequences, but certainly our call for and our push for him to be
treated with humanity and also to be released.  And that continues to be
a message that we are conveying clearly.   
   
I will say that we have found in diplomacy that sometimes those
conversations — and the contents of them, and the level of them, and the
number of them — need to happen privately, and that is a more
constructive way to reach our outcome.  So, we are conducting our
strategy through that prism.  
   
Q    Is the administration considering any additional sanctions on
perhaps the oligarchs that Navalny had listed prior to his arrest in
January — saying that these are the people that, if sanctioned, it would
really, kind of, change Putin’s behavior definitely?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Well, as you know, because I know you cover this closely,
we issued, just earlier in May — in March, I should say — in
coordination with Europeans, a number of sanctions.  We obviously
reserve the right to issue additional sanctions in the future.  The
executive order the President signed just last week gives us authority
to do that on individuals or industries.  But, obviously, our objective
here and our focus and our hope is that — that Mr. Navalny will be
treated with humanity and kept safe and, of course, ultimately, be
released.  
   
Q    And my last one: Is there anything you can say about additional
Nord Stream 2 sanctions or what the administration is planning on
designating additional entities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to predict for you.  We continue to
believe that is a bad deal, and we continue to convey that not just
directly — with a range of counterparts, including the Europeans.  
   
Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    Jen, can you — you mentioned that the President will lay out his
plans for the American Jobs Plan.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  American Families Plan.  
   
Q    Sorry.  Thank you —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a lot to keep track of.  
   
Q    — for that correction.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I know they sound similar.  
   
Q    On next week, can you give us a sense of what else he plans to
unveil at his Joint Address?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he is currently thinking through which — what
priorities he wants to focus on in the Joint Address.  He certainly
recognizes this is an opportunity to speak directly with the American
people — one of the highest-profile opportunities that any President has
in their first year in office.   
   
So, the core of that will be him laying out the specifics of the
American Families Plan, his commitment to childcare, to education, and
to delivering on those priorities and — middle-class priorities — and
ensuring that there’s an investment in economic security from the
federal government.  
   
I also expect — or on his mind are issues like police reform, health and
his commitment to expanding access to healthcare.  So, I’d expect he’d
talk about a range of issues.  
   
I will say — because I’ve been through a few journeys with these
speeches before — that it is a very important speech — a very
high-profile speech — but it is happening around the 100th day of his
presidency, and it won’t represent or touch on the totality of every
issue that’s a priority.  So, it’s — we are working through what the
tot- — the end content will have.  Unless you want to sit through a
seven-hour speech, which I don’t think you do.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Just one other quick topic, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, go ahead.  
   
Q    The House today passed a bill to make Washington, D.C., the 51st
state.  It obviously faces some tough odds in the Senate.  What’s the
White House’s take on that?  And to what extent is President Biden
involved in that going forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, President Biden strongly supports D.C. statehood, and
he doesn’t — and we will all — our administration will work with
Congress to get it passed.  We put out a statement of administration
policy in strong support of H.R. 51 just this morning.  His view is that
we are — the denial of voting representation in Congress and local
self-government to 712,000 residents of our nation’s capital violates
two of our nation’s founding principles: no taxation without
representation and consent of the governed.  And he will continue to
advocate for this passing.  
   
I will also note an interesting detail I didn’t know until this morning
is that there are a number of members, of course, of the — of the armed
forces, retired military, who, of course, live in the District of
Columbia and are denied, as a result of having the lack of statehood,
the rights that many others around the country have.  So, there are a
number of issues why this is absolutely the right step, and the
President will continue to advocate for it.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    I wanted to follow up on the questions about the climate and the
NDC.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Secretary Kerry and you talked about how important Glasgow will be
in November —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — when all of the countries come together to meet to ratify their
NDCs.  And given the importance of that meeting and the importance, I
think, for the United States to demonstrate its commitment to action
prior to that — how essential is it that Congress passes the
administration’s infrastructure plans with the green energy investments
in it, given that you’re also up here saying the market will, kind of,
take care of this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly am not trying to imply that.  The market is part
of it, and the private sector is part of it.  And I think that’s an
important component of the very good question of, you know: How will we
ensure that these changes are engrained in the future?  But there is
absolutely a role for government to play — some through executive
action; some through legislation.  
   
The President wants to sign the American Jobs Plan into law this
summer.  So that gives us ample time — ample room between that timeline
and when Glasgow will happen.  But we also believe that there are a
number of pathways to meeting our goals and meeting our objectives, and
we certainly hope to move forward on a number of them in advance of that
meeting in November.  
   
Q    So it sounds like you’re saying that’s not the only way that the
U.S. can demonstrate its commitment to action prior to November.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Correct.  There are a number of pathways that include steps
that can be taken within each sector, or steps that can be taken by the
government or local governments in partnership with a range of sectors. 
So, we see a range of pathways to get to that — to keep moving forward
toward that goal.  
   
Q    Just one other question about your response to the initial
overtures from Republicans on the infrastructure package.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    You said you do see that as a good-faith effort.  It’s roughly a
quarter of the size — topline number that the administration is
proposing.  Back during the COVID-relief talks, when Republicans
proposed a number that was roughly a third of what the administration
wanted, you dismissed them pretty quickly.  What’s different about this
situation and this policy proposal compared to the relief package where
you seem willing to take Republicans where they are and maybe allow more
time for debate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, one, it’s the beginning of a discussion. 
Right?  And the next steps will be conversations at the staff level,
conversations between senior members of our administration, members of
Congress, appropriate committee staff through the course of next week. 
And then, as I noted, the President will invite members down to the
White House.  But there are a lot of details to be discussed.  
   
The American Rescue Plan — but we do see them differently.  The American
Rescue Plan was an emergency package.  We were trying to deal with what
we saw — continues to be a emergency fight against a global pandemic, a
situation where 10 million — more than 10 million people were out of
work.  Obviously, we’ve seen some progress.  There’s still more work to
be done.  And it — the President felt it was imperative that the size of
that package, the scope of that package met the moment and that it
happened quickly.   
   
We have a little bit more time here, and we are very open to hearing a
range of mechanisms, a range of options for moving this package
forward.  There could be smaller packages that pass.  There could be
different mechanisms for moving things forward, and we think it can be
done on a bipartisan basis.  And so we’re looking for the opportunity to
do that.  
   
Go ahead, Jen.  
   
Q    You mentioned this $400,000 a year level for — you know, nobody’s
taxes will be raised above that.  But there’s been some — some confusion
or lack of clarity around whether that’s individuals or couples or
families.  So what is the actual $400,000 definition?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Individuals.   
   
Q    Okay, so — okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But I understand the question, and there’ll be more
specifics about any of these tax proposals when we lay out the plan.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  So, it’s a question related to the President’s upcoming
speech on Wednesday.  I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about
why it was important for the President to actually deliver the speech at
the Capitol Building versus, you know, remotely here from the White
House, given everything that happened on January 6th and given the
concerns about, you know, the coronavirus.  Why is it important for him
to, you know, physically be there?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, you know, the President was in the Senate for
36 years, and he is a person who has not just a long history, but a
great deal of respect for the institution of government that is
Congress.   
   
And he also recognized — as — recognizes, as we all do, that it’s an
opportunity to speak to the people who you will work with in partnership
to get business done for the American public, but also to speak directly
to the American people, as this will be a primetime, timed address, as
it always has been throughout history.  And so, it is an opportunity
that he’s been eager to take advantage of.   
   
Obviously, we’ve been working in partnership — or in cooperation with
the Speaker’s office for the last several months.  And as you touched
on, certainly there were unique factors this year.  You know, obviously
we always take into account security.  But — and doing this in a way
that is COVID safe is something that the Speaker’s office and leaders in
Congress are very cognizant of.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi.  Two questions.  First, from someone who can’t be here due to
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    — coronavirus restrictions.  The New York Times is reporting
neither drug pricing nor health coverage will be part of the American
Families Plan proposal.  Is that accurate?  And is the President still
committed to getting those done and discussing them in his speech next
week?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I expect the President, as I noted, to talk about the
American Families Plan in his Joint Address, as well as a number of
other issues — as you know I answered in response to Jeff’s question —
important him, including healthcare, the need to put in place police
reforms.  
   
He’s made clear his commitment to expanding access to healthcare.  It’s
why he opened a special enrollment period during this pandemic.  We’re
excited by the progress we’ve made.  More than 500,000 Americans have
signed up for coverage since the President was inaugurated.  It’s why he
put into the American Rescue Plan subsidies to make it more cost
effective for many Americans.   
   
And, of course, the President’s number one priority has been tackling
the greatest health crisis our country has faced in generations.  And
just a reminder, again, this is a speech; it will — it is an important
moment, it is an opportunity to lay out his agenda, but it will not
represent the totality of every proposal he wants to achieve during the
course of his presidency.   
   
It is also still being finalized.  And the President will do some
thinking work himself on it over the coming days.   
   
Q    On a very different note: Obviously, the President played golf over
the weekend.  Is there anything else you can tell us about how he spends
his evenings and weekends?  Is he — is he reading books?  Is he
listening to music?  Is he — is he watching movies?  What does he do?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.)  Look, one, the President is very close with his
family — not just Dr. Biden, of course, but his grandchildren.  And he
has the opportunity to see them, at times, over the weekend and also see
his kids.  And that’s important to him and an important way of how he
spends time.  Like many Americans, of course, he enjoys movies.  And he
has two dogs he loves.   
   
And, you know, I would say, you know, I think he likes to spend time
with family and loved ones, and take a moment to take a breath — just
like most people across the country do — when he has the limited amount
of free time you have as leader of the free world.   
   
Go ahead, George.   
   
Q    Yeah.  Thanks, Jen.  Has everyone on the White House staff now been
vaccinated, especially those who come in contact with the President?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s been a priority, George.  I’ll have to get back to you
on the specific numbers — and we’ve tried to be quite transparent about
that, and I’m happy to do that.  It’s been a priority, of course, to
ensure that the White House staff, especially those who have close
contact with the President, are vaccinated.   
   
But every member of the White House staff — as you well know from
covering this place — I don’t think that would be accurate at this point
in time, but we’ll check on the numbers.  I will just reiterate or
restate that we also take a number of precautions, including, of course,
wearing N95 masks when we are in meetings.  We have very limited
meetings.  There’s a very limited footprint in the White House.  We
have, also, a number of staff who are working from home still who would
normally be working on the complex.   
   
So — but we’re working to vaccinate staff.  I’ll see if we can get an
updated number to you and others who are interested.  
   
Q    Acknowledging that the White House is not a normal workspace —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — what are you looking for that would allow you to make the
decision that the President doesn’t have to wear a mask when he’s around
people who have been tested and vaccinated?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect, just like all of you and like many Americans
across the country, we’re going to wait for the health and medical
experts to provide guidance on when it is safe to do exactly that.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Two Climate Summit questions.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Secretary Kerry, yesterday, said, “Without China at the table,
there is simply no way to resolve the climate crisis.”  How will the
U.S. work with China in the field of climate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Secretary Kerry has already had discussions, and I
expect we’ll have — I was talking to him right before we came out here —
we’ll have follow-up questions after President Xi’s remarks this morning
— or follow-up conversations.   
   
And there’s no question that China has an important role to play in
working with the global community to help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, address our climate crisis.  That was the case when the Paris
Climate Agreement was signed five years ago and continues to be the case
today.  
   
Q    And also, the credibility issue: Market matters, but government
matters too.  Can you guarantee the United States can follow through its
commitment until 2030?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s absolutely what our commitment is: is to not just lay
out goals, but to take steps to achieve it, and we have a number of
pathways to get there.   
   
The President has identified the climate as one of the four crises
facing his presidency, and the fact that we are hosting a global climate
summit under 100 days of his presidency certainly speaks to how
important it is.  
   
Go ahead, in the —  
   
Q    (Inaudible) administration in office in 2030, the U.S. will carry
out its commitment?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I think as my colleagues here allu- — spoke to,
this is where the private sector is going. This is where government is
going.  This is — these are industries that are going to create jobs in
the future.  And we certainly have every expectation and hope that
future administrations will deliver on the groundwork we do over the
next several years.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I have a couple of questions, if I may.  One on —
today is the first anniversary of the murder/disappearance of the
soldier, Vanessa Guillén, of Fort Hood, Texas.  That family is still
asking — they held a press conference today, asking this Biden
administration for justice.  They want to meet with the President.  Is
the President aware of the case, and would he be willing to meet with
the family?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’s certainly aware of the case, as we all are, and know
the — the family has been heartbroken.  I didn’t see the press
conference this morning but have certainly followed the case myself.  I
don’t have any planned meetings or commitments to read out from here.  
   
Q    And then, on Tuesday, when the Hispanic Caucus was here, they said
that the President committed to putting together sort of a task force on
an emergency basis to send to the border when there are surges of
migrants coming in.  Is this something that the President would work on
right away?  Could we see such a task force go to the border in the next
few months?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to check on what the specifics of that are.  I
mean, we have already sent DART teams to some of these countries in the
region to help address and provide additional humanitarian assistance. 
I don’t know if there was a reference to that.  
   
We’ve also worked with a number of countries in Central America to help
increase personnel and resources at the border, to reduce the influx or
movement of migrants to our own border.  But I’d have to check on what
the specifics of that actually are.  
   
Q    And the last one on the Climate —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — Summit today.  Do you have any idea why the Mexican young lady
who spoke, Xiye Bastida, came in before she was supposed to — why she
was moved up on the agenda today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to check on her schedule.  I don’t — I don’t know
why things — sometimes things move in the schedule.  As you saw this
morning, there was an enormous herculean, technological effort underway
here, and sometimes there are movements in schedule because of that. 
But we’re happy to check on that for you too.  
   
Great.  Thanks, everyone.
