Via Teleconference

   
3:09 P.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  Great.  Thank you, everyone, for joining.  As a reminder,
this call is on background.  It’s attributable to senior administration
officials.  And the contents of the call are embargoed until the call
ends.  
   
We wanted to take an opportunity to give you guys some thoughts on the
coming travel and then also take some questions.  
   
As you guys know, we’re going to have more information to share with you
on other bilats and events as we get closer to the trip, but just wanted
to be able to start the conversation sooner rather than later.  
   
So, for your awareness and not for reporting, our speakers on the call
today are \[senior administration official\], \[senior administration
official\], and \[senior administration official\].  
   
So we’re going to do some remarks at the top.  We’re going to go through
each leg of the trip, so just bear with us.  And then we’ll take as many
questions as we can. 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  So, the President will head
to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Friday, where the U.N. Climate Conference
— COP27 — is underway.  
   
While he’s on the ground, he’ll give a special address about our efforts
to build on the unprecedented work by the U.S. to reduce emissions and
advance the global climate fight, and help the most vulnerable build
resilience to climate impacts.  
   
And the President will also have a bilateral meeting with President
El-Sisi of Egypt, who, of course, is hosting the COP.  
   
The Biden administration is proud to be heading into this COP with
historic momentum.  We’ve seen the United States go from a global
laggard to a global leader in less than 18 months.  
   
And last year, President Biden set an ambitious goal of reducing
emissions by about — by at least, rather, 50 percent in 2030.  And
that’s from a 2005 baseline.  And this year, we’re on track to do
that.   
   
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, and more, we’re really well-positioned to meet the goals that we’ve
set in a way that we’ve never been in the past.   
   
We also just saw the Senate vote on a bipartisan basis to ratify the
Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which in itself could help
prevent a half-degree Celsius of warming this century.  
   
The President will arrive in Sharm at the end of what they call
“high-level week.”  And his speech will be an opportunity to set the
tone for the following week, where the negotiations really get underway
in earnest.  
   
He’ll have the opportunity to showcase U.S. leadership in tackling the
climate crisis at home and abroad and to demonstrate how we’re
mobilizing unprecedented levels of public and private finance to partner
with developing countries in reducing their emissions and, in
particular, in adapting to climate impacts, as well as the efforts that
we’re leading to decarbonize the so-called “hard to abate” sectors like
shipping, and to drive multilateral progress through a number of
targeted efforts such as the Global Methane Pledge, which the President
announced last year.  
   
And the President will also speak to the need for the 196 parties to the
Paris Agreement to really keep their eyes on the ball when it comes to
accelerating ambitious action to reduce emissions, to keep within reach
the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.  We need to remain
focused.  
   
So, a lot to cover, but it’ll be an important visit at a really critical
time.  So I’ll turn it over to you, \[senior administration official\]. 
Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you very much for that laydown. 
I am here.  Sorry, I forgot to unmute myself.  
   
So, after Sharm, the President will travel to Pnom Penh, Cambodia, from
November 12th to 13th to participate in the annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit on
November 12th and then the East Asia Summit on November 13th.  
   
The President will also have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Hun
Sen of Cambodia, which is the 2022 chair of ASEAN.  
   
And I think that, you know, this reflects a following through on an
institutionalization of the very stepped-up engagement with ASEAN and
with Southeast Asia that we have seen so far in the administration.   
   
And I would just remind everyone that in May — so, last year, at the end
of October, the President spoke at the virtual U.S.-ASEAN Summit and
virtual East Asia Summit meetings that took place at the end of October,
chaired by Brunei, which did not have in-person attendance.  And then,
in May, the President hosted the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit, which was
held for the first time in Washington, D.C., and included dinner at the
White House.  
   
I think those two engagements — so last October, the President announced
over $100 million in investments in things that are significant for
U.S.-ASEAN relations, significantly expanding our cooperation on health,
climate, science and innovation, trade facilitation, education, and
more.   
   
And then, in May, the President announced $150 million in additional
funding in many of these same areas, including trying to step up our
engagement in the maritime domain.  
   
I think that we see this as following through on the administration’s
commitment to the Indo-Pacific, which I’m sure you saw was highlighted
as a top priority in the National Security Strategy.  And — but it also
reflects the very strong and longstanding U.S. commitment to the
Indo-Pacific region that goes back centuries and was really stepped up,
obviously, at the end of World War Two.

I think that in Cambodia you can see the President lay out our vision
for keeping up a pace of enhanced engagement and trying to also address
concerns of importance to ASEAN in ways that they — that they are
looking for.

And so we’ll also focus on efforts to promote respect for human rights,
rule of law, and good governance, the rules-based international order,
and also to address the ongoing crisis in Burma.

I would just note that this follows as part of a broader level of
engagements in the region that include the President traveling to Korea
and Japan in May — the host — the in-person Quad leaders meeting that
took place in Tokyo in May — the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework; the engagements with the Pacific Islands, including the Vice
President’s virtual address to the Pacific Islands Summit; as well as
the hosting of the U.S.-Pacific Islands Summit in the — at the end of
September. 

Also, the Vice President’s travel to Korea — to Japan and Korea.  And
then, as I’m sure you saw, the Vice President will also be going to
Thailand for APEC as well, so the Philippines. 

So in our — and this is just in addition to a whole host of engagements
and visits in both directions at the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet levels.

So I think that we also want to highlight the enduring commitment to the
rules-based international order, including in the South China Sea, as
well as talk about the importance of peace and stability throughout the
region, including, of course, across the Taiwan Strait.

So, with all these things, we feel like this is a good way to continue
to advance and to really show that we’re serious about
institutionalizing the stepped-up levels of engagement.

Thank you.

MODERATOR:  Great.  \[Senior administration official\], over to you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[moderator\].  So, I’m going
to talk about the President’s time in Bali and, in particular, around
the G20.

Since coming into office, President Biden has been focused on delivering
for American families and building a resilient global economy.

Thanks to the President’s economic plans, we have driven a historically
strong economic recovery and given families at home breathing room while
also serving as the engine of (inaudible).

You all know the history of the G20: Fourteen years ago, as we faced a
global financial crisis, the G20 came together as a result of U.S.
leadership and allowed the world’s major economies to not only enable us
to recover together, but also to create a more resilient global
financial system.  
   
Today, we face challenges as well: a global economy that faces serious
headwinds as a result of Russia’s war against Ukraine, with rising food
and energy prices impacting low- and middle-income countries the most.  
   
The President will head to Bali to work with G20 partners to lay the
foundations for a more sustainable and inclusive global economy that
will support American families and vulnerable countries and economies
alike.   
   
He will begin his time in Bali with a bilateral meeting with our G20
host, President Widodo of Indonesia.  He will thank President Widodo and
Indonesia for the incredible work that they are doing to host a
successful G20 and to underscore the importance of the U.S.-Indonesia
Strategic Partnership.  
   
I can just say, in terms of my own travels to Indonesia as part of the
G20 process, that focus, that energy, that leadership from Indonesia has
been on full display.  And I know that the President looks forwards to
visiting and seeing that firsthand.

G20 leaders will focus on a broad, in-depth agenda over the course of
their few days together.  And I can guarantee you that the United States
will show up and be at the table.  We will be unapologetic in our
defense of Ukraine.  We will be unapologetic in calling out Russia for
its brutal war.  And we will also work closely with our partners to
address the impacts of the war.

As we think about the President’s affirmative agenda with the G20, I’d
highlight three broad categories.

One is, you know, working to address the immediate impacts of Russia’s
war on the global economy.  And, obviously, here, food security and
energy security are the top of that list and will continue to be.

Secondly, I think you’ll hear the President talk about investing in the
inclusive economies of the future, around delivering game-changing
projects to leverage private financing and close the infrastructure gap
between the advanced economies and the rest of the world.

In fact, President Biden will co-host an event at the G20 Summit in
which the United States and partners will be advancing the Partnership
for Global Infrastructure and Investment, PGII.

This is an effort, as many of you know, that was launched this summer in
Elmau, alongside the G7, to mobilize $600 billion in financing over five
years in low- and middle-income countries.

The President will announce new projects to deliver quality, sustainable
infrastructure that makes a difference in people’s lives around the
world, strengthens and diversifies our supply chains, creates new
opportunities for American workers and businesses, and advances our
national security, in addition to lifting up and providing opportunity
to economies around the world as well.  
   
And then, lastly, you know, you’ll hear the President talking about
steps we can take to build a new economic ecosystem where every nation
gets a fair shot.  This includes important issues like debt relief for
vulnerable countries.  Obviously, we’ve seen significant headwinds
gathering, especially for vulnerable lower- and middle-income
countries.  Debt is an important part of that equation.  I expect the
President will speak to that.  
   
This agenda includes leveraging the multilateral development banks to
fund global challenges.  And it also includes issues like global health,
including the U.S. and our $450 million pledge to the pandemic fund to
close the global gap in financing for pandemic preparedness.   
   
So, countries representing more than 80 percent of the world’s GDP will
be in one place for the G20 Summit.  President Biden has demonstrated
again and again that we’ll focus not just on building prosperity for our
people, but people everywhere around the world.   
   
We believe, the President believes it’s critical for the G20 to act in
this critical moment and that there’s a plan to do just that when the
President arrives in Bali next week.   
   
I’ll go ahead and pause and hand this back to \[moderator\].   
   
MODERATOR:  Great.  Thank you, guys.  If we could ask our moderator to
please give out the directions to ask a question, please.  
   
(Instructions given to ask questions.)  
   
Q    Thank you.  I had a question about two of the three bilats that you
announced, with El-Sisi in Egypt and then Cambodia.  Will the President
bring up Alaa Abd El-Fattah’s case in Egypt as well as Theary Seng’s
case, who’s a U.S. citizen, in Cambodia?  
   
And then secondly, is there any other bilats that you guys can speak of
that are being set up for any of the summits, including the one we’ve
been anticipating with Xi Jinping?  
   
Thank you.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can take the first question about the
Egypt bilat.  Obviously, the President is attending COP27 to build on
the significant work the U.S. has undertaken to advance the global
climate fight and help the most vulnerable build resilience.   
   
He’ll be engaging with Egyptian leaders to discuss developments in the
Middle East and the U.S. commitment to stability through
broader-integration diplomacy to end conflicts in the region and
deescalate tensions.   
   
Human rights will feature prominently in those discussions, as the Biden
administration is the first not to issue a national security waiver for
the FMF funding on human rights grounds.  And we have and will continue
to urge the Egyptian government to release political prisoners and
undertake human rights-related legal reforms.  And this process has had
some significant success, but we aim to see more progress over the
coming months.  
   
And to the case of the Alaa Abd El-Fattah, we remain concerned about
that case and the reported condition of his health.  And we have raised
repeated concerns about his case and his conditions in detention with
the government of Egypt.   
   
As the President has stated repeatedly, he will never shy away from
raising human rights with foreign leaders.   
   
\[Senior administration official\], I don’t know if you have anything
you want to add on to (inaudible)?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I would just absolutely agree with what
was just said.  And I think that, you know, we don’t want to get ahead
of the actual discussion.  But I think you can anticipate that the
President will raise our views on the importance of supporting the
aspirations of the Cambodian people for a prosperous, democratic,
independent country, and the importance of respect for human rights,
including, I think, that — you know, our concern about some specific
cases.   
   
So, I don’t want to get ahead of it, but I think that you can certainly
expect that that would be the intention to raise.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I would say, in terms of any other news
on additional bilats, there’s nothing additional to report at this
time.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.   
   
Q    Hey, guys, thanks for doing this.  Two about Cairo.  One, can I
just follow up the question about Alaa?  Will the President call for
Egypt to release Alaa, as British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak did in his
meeting with President Sisi?  
   
And I want to ask about climate and loss and damage.  I know Special
Envoy Kerry has talked a little bit about this.  But can you go into
what your response is to developing countries’ calls for specific dollar
pledges on loss and damage? It’s on the agenda.  Of course, this year,
that’s a decision that’s been made, including by this administration and
others.   
   
But can you speak to some of the resistance, it seems, that Kerry has
been suggesting — and others — about getting to those specific numbers
with specificity on how the countries who are calling for loss and
damage can receive compensation?  
   
Thanks.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  On the human rights concerns,
I don’t have anything to add in order to get ahead of a meeting that
hasn’t happened yet, other than — you know, again, this is this is
something that has certainly been raised multiple times frequently, and
the President has made clear he will not shy away from raising human
rights concerns with foreign leaders.  
   
On loss and damage, we are absolutely committed to engaging
constructively on this issue and understand, you know, the depths of
what climate-vulnerable countries are facing here and the reason they
are so focused on the loss and damage aspect of the Paris Agreement
negotiations.  Absolutely, we have a strong interest in doing whatever
we can to help address the problems in solidarity with vulnerable
countries and with those communities.  
   
You know, there have been a number of really useful discussions in the
last year around finance for averting and minimizing and addressing loss
and damage.  And we are supportive of doing what we can to find the way
to scale up related finance, including public finance, and recognizing
that this is a multifaceted challenge — loss and damage — and it
requires similarly multifaceted solutions.  
   
So, I think some of the reaction is that we’re not yet at a point where
there’s something that we’re, you know, agreeing to or disagreeing to. 
There are a lot of different ideas being floated around, and at this
point, all we can say is that we understand the depths of this challenge
and we are committed to working constructively, including at the COP, to
figure out a way for the international community to make sure that the
needs are met and that we are addressing these problems in solidarity.  
   
Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks for doing this.  I just wanted to take another
crack at Aamer’s question about a possible meeting with the Chinese
president while we’re there.  I know you guys can’t confirm anything or
say that it’s happening, but obviously, this has been in the ether and
something that you guys have said that you’re trying to set up.   
   
So, I was wondering if you could just talk maybe generally about what
your hope for a best-case scenario in terms of engagement with the
Chinese during this trip is.  Is there hope that you might get a rebuke
of Putin and Russia out of the Chinese in the way that the Germans were
able to recently?  Any commitment on Taiwan?  Anything on trade?  Just
trying to get an idea of what the agenda with China is.  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  (Inaudible) — I think it’s just
premature to speak to that when there’s news to report on this.  We’ll
be back in touch at that stage.   
   
Q    Thank you so much.  I’m sorry to pile on you with these questions
about bilats with Chinese officials, but is there a potential for a
bilat with the Chinese outgoing premier?  
   
And just in general, when meeting with high-level Chinese officials,
what are going to be the administration’s priorities?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I would just, you know, repeat what
we’ve said — what I’ve said previously, which is: I don’t have news to
report on additional bilaterals beyond what we’ve already announced.  If
there is news on that score, we’ll be back in touch and talk more
extensively then.   
   
MODERATOR:  Yeah, thank you.  I know everyone has that question, but if
there is news to announce there, we will make sure to do — have a
conversation with you all on what that would look like.  
   
Let’s go to our next question, please.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks for doing this.  I have a question about the G20.  A
lot of diplomats and foreign leaders have sort of questioned the
usefulness of the G20 over the last years, just given the inability to
achieve consensus with countries like Russia and China.  And I’m
wondering what the President’s view of the usefulness of the G20 is,
heading into this summit.  
   
And if I could ask a second question.  Former President Trump is
suggesting he may announce a second run for — third run for president on
November 15th, which is when President Biden will be at the G20.  Given
what the President has said in the past about foreign leaders
questioning how long America will be back, does the President anticipate
this dynamic to play any role in his discussions at the G20?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  In terms of your first question, you
know, the President believes very centrally in the ongoing importance of
the G20.  And as I said in my own remarks, the United States was
critical to lifting the G20 up to the leaders level 14 years ago in the
midst of the global financial crisis and continues to see the G20 as the
forum where 80 percent of global GDP is under one roof, where, you know,
the world can come together to talk through the important challenges
that we face.   
   
And I think that, in particular, as I laid out in my own remarks, I
think the President has crafted an agenda out for this G20 that is
really focused on listening to and providing a plan for addressing some
of the stresses that, in particular, the non-G7/G20s of the emerging
world faces, (inaudible) whether that’s immediate issues around energy
and food security, which have been prominent in our discussions with
countries around the world since Russia’s invasion, the pressures that
those issues are putting on households, on businesses, on economies. 
Secondly, focused on issues like closing the investment gap,
particularly around challenges like the clean energy transition and
digital infrastructure, global public health, and gender inclusion.   
   
These are things that, you know, require action from the world but also
require U.S. leadership, and that’s what the President is going to be
speaking to there, including at the side events that I mentioned.  And
then a set of steps that can be taken to enhance our — the world’s
multilateral toolkit for grappling with and addressing shared
challenges.   
   
You know, Jake and many others have spoken to the centrality of shared
transnational challenges as a core defining feature of this moment and
of our national security strategy.   
   
And the G20 is a place to really highlight and underscore the work that
we’re doing there — whether that’s around reform of the World Bank and
other multilateral development institutions; whether that’s working to
launch and put into place a strong pandemic preparedness fund; whether
that’s, again, kind of taking steps with respect to things like closing
the infrastructure and investment gap.   
   
You know, these are all issues that are and have — that really speak to
the moment that we’re in and also require a gathering like the G20 to
speak to that in terms of the fullness of the countries in parts of the
world with the impact.   
   
So, all that goes back around to the fact that, you know, the G20 is a
vital forum.  It’s a forum that — that has no real substitute in terms
of the breadth of countries that are able to come together and speak to
these topics.   
   
And lastly, it’s also a forum where even as we address each of these
core issues, you know, we’re going to, you know, kind of not shy away
for a second from calling out Russia’s war of aggression, calling out
the fact that that war has caused massive disruptions in the global
economy, in particular for vulnerable countries.   
   
And this, too, is an important part of what the President will be
looking to do at the G20 as well.  
   
Q    Thanks so much.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how
the President plans to approach the relationship with Saudi Arabia at
the G20, given the broader review of the relationship that’s taking
place and also the scrutiny he came under for the fist bump he gave MBS
during his visit over the summer.  And could you also say if the
President will participate in a family photo if Vladimir Putin does
attend the conference?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, you know, no specific news here
beyond what you’ve already heard from the President on Saudi Arabia.  I
think that, you know, he has articulated his perspective with respect to
the decisions they’ve made through OPEC+; has articulated that this is a
relationship broadly that he is — that he’s, you know, reconsidering the
different dimensions of.  
   
And, you know, I’m not going to get ahead of anything that — beyond
that, other than to say that — you know, that the President has stated
that and that’s ongoing.  I think what he is going to be focused at the
G20 is exactly the list of issues that I just walked through.   
   
And those are the — the issues that define our moment, define the
concerns that we hear day in and day out from countries around the
world, and the issues that are core to having an affirmative agenda that
can allow countries to address those.  
   
Q    Yeah, thank you so much for doing this.  And sorry about not
unmuting.  I have a question.  It’s more about the G20 and about the
mood with the Europeans.  The EU is pretty upset about that Inflation
Reduction Act and especially about electric car subsidies.  They’re
looking for ways to answer.  And the German finance minister recently
said, and I quote, “I’m not sure whether the administration is aware of
our concerns.”   
   
So my question is, basically: Is the administration aware of this
concern?  And is this something the President will discuss with European
partners at the G20?  And are you concerned that it might impact the
broader transatlantic relationship and maybe evolve into a — you know,
an open trade war?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:   So, I guess a few thoughts here.  You
know — one, you know, the President, the administration as a whole has
been absolutely committed to transatlantic unity not just since the
start of the administration, but, of course, especially since the start
of Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine.  
   
That has reflected itself across any number of different priorities,
whether it’s been our shared approach on sanctions.  But it’s also
reflected itself in some core economic priorities.  Obviously, this has
been an extremely challenging moment for Europe’s energy security.  We,
in the United States, for our part, have turned over every stone to help
Europe meet its energy challenges.  
   
You know, if you kind of look at, for example, U.S. LNG exports now
versus 15, 16 months ago, our overall LNG exports are up by over 20
percent.  Our LNG exports to Europe are up by almost a factor of three,
reflecting the massive reallocation that’s been underway from Asia to
Europe, in terms of the destination, for U.S. LNG exports.

That just, I think, highlights the extent to which transatlantic unity,
the extent to which helping Europe meet the challenges that Russia’s war
has presented to their economy has been, kind of, very front of mind for
President Biden and a core priority for this administration.

You know, with respect to the IRA, you know, yes, we are, here, aware of
those concerns.  In fact, you know, I would point you to — \[redacted\]
was in Berlin two weeks ago.  There was — \[redacted\] sat down with
President von der Leyen’s chief of staff, Bjoern Seibert, there.  Coming
out of that meeting, we announced a dialogue between the EU and the
United States to speak to both opportunities that the IRA presents for
EU economies, for EU firms, as well as challenges and concerns that some
of those same countries and those same firms feel with respect to the
IRA.

We had our first meeting of that — of that grouping last week.  We
expect additional conversations to follow on as soon as this week, in
terms of, you know, really continuing to further that dialogue —
further, both, again, this kind of understanding around the concerns and
challenges that Europe faces and feels, but also the opportunities that
are — that are provided by the Inflation Reduction Act.  And this is
just a dialogue that we expect to continue to remain a constructive,
focused partner on.

Because, again, end of the day, the most important thing is that we
maintain focus on transatlantic unity on facing these common challenges
together.  And that’s precisely why we’re working to (inaudible) these
out through channels like the dialogue I just mentioned.  
MODERATOR:  Great.  Thank you, all.  So, we’re out of time.  But as I
said earlier, we will continue to find opportunities to talk more about
the trip and make additional announcements, so we will be in touch with
you on that.

As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to  
“senior administration officials.”  And the contents — the embargo on
the contents of the call have now lifted.  Have a good rest of your day.

3:45 P.M. EST
