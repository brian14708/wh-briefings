Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Fort Lauderdale, Florida

1:24 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  So, today, the President travels to
Florida, where he’ll lay out two contrasting visions for the American
people.  
   
He will be joined by Democratic officials in Broward County to discuss
how he’s lowering costs for the American people.  
   
Through the Inflation Reduction Act, the President and congressional
Democrats have taken on Big Pharma to allow Medicare to negotiate
prescription drug costs for the first time, capping seniors’ drug costs
at the pharmacy, the cost of insulin, and lowering health insurance
premiums for people who got — who get coverage through the Affordable
Care Act.  
   
Republican officials, Florida’s own — with Florida’s own Senator Rick
Scott at the helm, have a very different and very bad vision.  
   
Under their plan, millions of Americans would lose healthcare coverage,
benefits, and other long-held protections.  They have promised to
deliver Big Pharma a win and strip Medicare of the right to negotiate
drug prices.  
   
And if it couldn’t be any worse, Rick Scott has championed a plan to put
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security on the chopping block every five
years.  
   
The President will de- — will drive that contrast today, as he has been
doing almost every day for the past several months.  He will be
introduced by a Florida resident and Medicare recipient who will benefit
from the Inflation Reduction Act Medicare drug pricing provisions. 
He’ll also reaffirm his and Democrats’ committed — commitment to
strengthening Medicare and Social Security.  
     
 Before I turn — turn it over to questions, you may remember that the
last time the President was here, he committed to supporting the people
of Florida as they recover and rebuild from Hurricane Ian.  To date, the
administration has provided more than $1.74 billion in federal grants,
disaster loans, and flood insurance payments to the state and people of
Florida to help jumpstart their economy — their recovery, pardon me.  
   
These resources are providing temporary housing for thousands of
households and supporting initiatives like Operation Blue Roof, through
which he — we have installed over 17,000 roofs.  We will continue to do
everything we can to support the people of Florida at each step of the
way as they recover and rebuild from the devastating storm.  
   
With that, Zeke, you want to take us — take us away?  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  A couple for you.  First, has the President spoken
with Speaker Pelosi since the other conversation over the weekend?  Has
he been receiving updates on the investigation into the — into the
attack on her husband?  And has he considered any — whether he has any
authority to step up security for lawmakers or taking any steps to
address the nation’s threat level as a result of that attack?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a few — you’re right, that was a few questions. 
The first thing is: As you all know, this President spoke to — to the
attack on Speaker Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, a couple times this
weekend.  He has spoken to Speaker Pelosi, as you all know — he said
this himself — about the horrific attack on her husband and let her know
— and let her know his prayers are with Paul and their entire family.  
   
And so, we’re grateful that Paul is expected to recover.  I don’t have
any — any new phone conversations to share at this time.  
   
I think he spoke to this just — just —  
   
Q    Saturday.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Saturday, right?   
   
So the attack was simply unconscionable, and we all have a
responsibility to call out this kind of political violence.  
   
Law enforcement — they have spoken to this and have held press
conferences, as you all know.  And they’ve been very clear and
transparent in the details they’ve released about the attack.  We’ll let
them speak to the facts.  
   
Clearly, the President has been kept up to date on the facts.  And he’s,
you know, watching just like all of you, and has clearly kept up to
date, as I just mentioned.  
   
As it relates to extra protection to lawmakers, I would — I would send
you to the Capitol Police.  They’re the ones who provide any protection
to congressional members.  I would point you to the specific candidates
that you all may have in mind and talk to them about what they’re doing
for — for their own candidate as far as it relates to protection.  I
just don’t have anything else to share on that piece.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) briefed the President on the investigation.  And the
President has talked a lot about political violence — we’re a week out
from the midterm elections — another instance now of political violence
against the husband of the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  Why
isn’t the President taking a more urgent tone?  Why hasn’t he received
more briefings on this?  And why are you deferring us to agencies and
Capitol Police?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Because that’s not — I mean, that — the Capitol Police
is known to protect congressional members and campaigns.  That is — and
candidates, right?  They’re — they are their own campaign, right?  So,
they’re not — some of them are not elected officials.  And so, it is up
to their campaign to provide that protection.  
   
I think the President has spoken about this very forcefully.  At the
beginning of his speech in Philly, it was the first thing that he talked
about in a very forceful way.  And just — just condemning all types of
political violence is something that the President has done very
consistently.   
   
And he has spoken about this.  If you guys go — if you go back to
Charlottesville and the soul of a nation and talking about what he saw. 
And we all saw this in Charlottesville and how — how there was a mob
that marched down a street and a young woman died, and how — how
political — how that political violence has no place in any type of
political discourse.  
   
And we — and he also has talked about the importance of protecting our
democracy, the importance of strengthening our democracy.  He’s spoken
about that many, many times — multiple times over the past couple of
years.  
   
So this is something that the President is taking very seriously.  It’s
one of the reasons, when you think about our democracy, when you think
about what we saw — what we all saw, not — back in — a few years ago,
back in 2017, it is about this.  It is about speaking against this.   
   
It is about continuing to work with Congress to figure out how can we —
how can we deal with this issue in a real way.  And it doesn’t matter if
you have a “D” or “R” behind your name, he’s going to continue to call
this out.  
   
Q    One last one — one last one from me just on the same topic.  What’s
the President’s message to voters who may have seen incidents of
political violence, threats against election poll workers, concerns
surrounding the midterms?  You know, when — you know, if they have
concerns about their own safety going to the polls, should they feel
comfortable casting — you know, going (inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have to be very careful, because you’re asking me
about midterms, you’re asking me about voting.  And I just want to be —
put that out there.  So I don’t want to speak specifically to that.   
   
But the — clearly, the President cares about and believes in the sacred
right to vote and Americans being able to — to be able to, you know,
have that — have that right.  I don’t want to get too far into — into
the question.  
   
But he has — one thing that I can say is that he is taking that very
seriously, even with putting out an executive order, on — back in — back
in his first year of this administration, on the anniversary of Selma,
on all — everything that he can do from the federal government on how we
expand the right to vote and also protect the right to vote.  
   
But I don’t want to get too far into it.  I understand the question. 
He’s going to continue to condemn political violence.  You’re going to
hear that from him.  Anytime there’s an opportunity to do that, he has
done that — about three times since we heard about the awful, horrific
attacks on Paul Pelosi.  
   
Q    Just a quick question.   
   
Q    But, Karine, did he —  
   
Q    Sorry.  Thank you.  Just a quick question on the President’s
remarks yesterday on oil and gas companies paying higher taxes or facing
other restrictions if they do not help lower prices.  Is the White House
envisioning kind of more of an — sort of an ad hoc tax here or something
that is perhaps a more permanent fixture of the tax structure?  And how
do you sort of — how does the administration plan to get such a tax
passed if Republicans control the House?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, so I don’t want to get ahead of what may happen
in a couple —  
   
(An inner door on Air Force One opens.)  Okay.  That’s — all right. 
Okay.  Sorry, the doors are opening.   
   
But the President was very clear yesterday.  He — if oil companies do
not change their behavior, he will engage with Congress to hold them
accountable.  
   
Those who — who needed to hear this message heard it loud and clear.  I
don’t have any additional meetings or — or calls to read out or any —
any specifics on what will happen next, but he wanted to make sure, as
he has done many times, to call that out.  
   
Of course, the President’s team has been meeting regularly with the
industry — as it relates to meetings, I know folks tend to ask that
question.  
   
So in response to the letter the President sent to oil executives in
June, Secretary Granholm convened a meeting with oil companies to work
through solutions and encourage them to increase output.  And you heard
from those oil companies and they themselves said it was — it was a — it
was a beneficial, effective meeting.  
   
Since then, the Department — Department of Energy has held multiple
meetings and calls, and White House officials have participated in many
of those conversations.  
   
But what the President wants to see is action from oil companies.  And
if he doesn’t see that, he will engage directly with Congress.  I don’t
have anything else to share.  
   
Q    What kind of talks — tax was he talking about, though, yesterday? 
I mean, you know, he spoke about windfall —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — you know, a tax.  But like what — what structure, what form —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not — I’m just not going to —  
   
Q    — will that take?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Once — once the President is ready to — to speak to
that, I’m going to let him lay that out — what his vision and what his —
his thinking is on that.  Certainly not going to get ahead of him.  
   
But, again, he wanted to send a very clear message, as he has done many
times and has said if he — if he does not see action or change,
accountability, he’s going to work with Congress.  
   
Q    And one on the trip today, you know, just in terms of — last time,
the President was there assessing damage from Hurricane Ian, you know,
he — he said he worked really well with Ron DeSantis.  
   
You know, the — all the material we’ve seen from the White House kind of
talks about how he plans to contrast his plans with congressional
Republicans — you know, talk about Rick Scott — but we’re not hearing
anything about Ron DeSantis.   
   
I mean, is he — is he planning to mention DeSantis in his speech?  Is he
planning to sort of draw a contrast with him?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m not — I’m just not going to get ahead of what
the President is going to say.  He’s going to — you guys are going to
hear directly from him.  I gave you a little bit of flavor of what — of
why we’re here.  And, look — and I also want to be very careful in not
getting into the politics here.   
   
But, look, he’s coming to Florida today, as I just laid out, to talk
about the two contrasting visions for the American people, whether they
be in Florida or any state around the country.  And so, you’ve heard him
do that for — for, you know, almost every day for the past several
months.  
   
One side — and he’s been very clear, you know, and I’ll say this again —
the President is focused on, which is the President and congressional
Democrats are focused on lowering costs for the American people through
the Inflation Reduction Act.  And he’s taken on Big Pharma and won,
which lowered drug prices and more.  
   
Meanwhile, on the other side, with Rick Scott at the helm, as I said at
the top, they want — the first thing that they want to do is repeal the
Inflation Reduction Act, which will increase costs for when — when you
look at healthcare, when you think about energy costs, and also put on
the chopping — on the chopping block Medicare, Social Security.  And
that is something that will hurt American people and so he’s going to
make that contrast today.  I’m going let him speak to it more — in more
detail.  But that’s what you’re going to hear from the President
today.  
   
Q    Karine, on Haiti: The Secretary of State spoke with his Chinese
counterpart and visited Canada recently, where Haiti was at the top of
the agenda.  Is the President personally involved in trying to corral
members of the Security Council around a resolution for a multilateral
force?  What does he want to see?  And what kind of timeline are we
looking at, given everyone has been saying it’s an urgent matter?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, as you know, the President — the security — when
it comes to what you’ve seen, the action by our U.N. ambassador at the
U.N., of course, that is something that the President signed off on. 
Right?  That is something that the President believes as we- — as a way
forward with Haiti.  
   
Look, we are — we remain committed to supporting the people of Haiti. 
We are devastated as well at what we’re seeing in the country. 
Conversations are ongoing with partners on the U.N. Security Council to
advance the draft solution authorizing under Chapter 7 — as you know,
the U.N. non- — the non-U.N. mission.  We recently delivered Haitian
government-purchased security equipment, including tactical and armed
vehicles and supplies that will assist the Haitian National Police in
their fight against criminal actors.  
   
And USAID staff is on the ground now, working alongside Haitian health
workers and NGOs to respond to the — to the outbreak and deliver care to
those who need it.  
   
We will also continue to engage the international community on
additional actions we can take at the United Nations.  Clearly, this is
something that the President supports.  It is his direction that you’re
seeing this action at USAID and also as you’ve heard from the — our U.N.
ambassador there.   
   
And so, again, we’re going to — the conversations are ongoing, and we’re
going to play our part in doing everything that we can for the people of
Haiti.  
   
Q    To follow up on what Zeke was asking earlier, is the administration
worried about increased violence and threats of violence in the next
week?  And what are they doing to protect democracy, as you said, which
the President so values?  Like, what steps are being — is the federal
government taking?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, it’s fundamentally important that people
exercise their right to vote.  That is something that I can say and will
say here.  
   
The federal government is committed to working with our state and local
partners to ensure the security of our election system from voter
registration all the way to vote tabulation.   
   
So, you know, the administration takes the issue of threats to the
safety of election officials very seriously.  Last week, the agencies
tasked with protecting the security of our elections, including the
Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and
the Capitol Police issued a notice to ensure that local law enforcement
is — is alerted to the threat posed by domestic violent — violent
extremists so they can deploy their resources accordingly.  
   
Look, we have faith in the efforts of these agencies that are all
involved and all hands on deck to work alongside state and local
election officials to take necessary steps to keep people safe.  Any
specifics I would certainly refer you to those individual agencies.  
   
But again, this is a President that fundamentally believes in the
importance of American people exercising their right to vote.  
   
Q    And will the President do a press conference the day after the
midterms, as several previous presidents have done?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I am very sure that you will — that you will be
hearing from the President after — after the — he’ll be delivering
remarks after the — after Tuesday, after the elections.  I don’t have
anything else to share.  
   
Q    Karine —  
   
Q    Will he take questions?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have more to share on that.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    On the policy differences that the White House has been
highlighting, how does the President see that message resonating with
one week to go?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, if you think about all of — all of the issues
that I’ve just laid out, what we’re trying to do — right? — we are
trying to protect Medicare, we are trying to protect Social Security, we
are trying to lower costs for the American people.   
   
These are issues — again, and you guys, you know, ask me about polls all
the time.  You guys see this over and over again.  These are issues that
are important to the American people, that are critical to the American
people.  And so that’s what we’re trying to do.  That’s what the
President has been working on practically every day with congressional
Democrats and, hence, the Inflation Reduction Act, which will help with
healthcare and energy costs.  
   
And you, literally — I mean, just look at Rick Scott’s 12 Point Plan. 
That 12 Point Plan says it will sunset, after five years, Medicare and
Social Security.  These are — these are — if you think about it, these
are programs that are helping American people, helping our seniors.  And
so, the contrast could not be starker, and the choice could not be more
clear.  
   
Q    And do you think the message is getting through? That’s the
question.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We believe the message is getting through.  You — you
just have to hear and see what — you know, the President when he’s in
these different states.  We do.  When you see — when you see that the
American people react to these programs are important to them, yes, we
do.  We do think this it’s getting to them.  
   
Q    Karine, can you — we got a Fed decision coming up tomorrow, but on
inflation broadly — putting aside the Fed — what is the administration’s
reading of the current situation on inflation?  Has it peaked?  Are you
hopeful?  How do you see the lay of the land?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, last week, the new economic reports, as you know —
I know you follow this very closely — including GDP and PCE showed we
are making progress on our economic plan: lower inflation, higher
incomes, higher wages, and solid economic growth.  
   
In the last quarter, we saw 2.6 percent economic growth as it relates to
the GDP.  Inflation slowed in the — in the third quarter, as I just
mentioned.  With energy prices coming down, gas prices have declined
over $1.20 since the summer’s peak.  
   
AIR FORCE ONE CREW MEMBER:  So sorry.  Sorry, I’m going to have to ask
you to (inaudible) seat.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, thank you.  
   
And so we know we have more work to do.  The President understands that
the American people are feeling that squeeze, which is why he’s worked
every day, especially during the summer, to lower those gas prices.  And
that’s why the Inflation Reduction Act is so critical as well to lower
prices.  
   
Q    Do you have any view on addressing the debt limit in the lame
duck?  This is one of the tools with Social Security and Medicare.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, and I know you guys have asked me this
question.  We’re not going to get ahead of — of next week.  But,
certainly, stay tuned.  
   
All right guys, we got to sit.  Thank you, everybody.
