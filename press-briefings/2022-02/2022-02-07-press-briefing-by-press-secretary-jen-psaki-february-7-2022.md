James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:55 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  Hi, everyone.  I know we have a time
limit because of the press avail with the Germans, so we will get to as
many people as possible.  I just have a couple of items for you at the
top.

Today, the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment,
led by Vice President Harris as Chair and Labor Secr- — and as well as
Chair — as Chair and Labor Secretary — as well as Chair, and Labor
Secretary Walsh as Vice-Chair – released publicly the report it
delivered to President Biden that includes nearly 70 recommendations to
promote worker organizing and collective bargaining.

The recommendations include ways to increase private-sector workers’
access to information about their existing right to join or organize a
union — a hugely important issue for the President.

The President accepted the recommendations, and as a follow-up, the task
force will submit a second report to the President in six months, which
will describe progress in implementation and contain additional
proposals for further action.

I also wanted to note that, today, the Secretary — Secretary of
Agriculture Tom Vilsack will be announcing that the Partnerships for
Climate-Smart connection — Commodities program, in which the Department
of Agriculture will invest $1 billion in partnerships to support
America’s climate-smart farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. 

So these funds will go to projects that promote farming, ranching, and
forestry practices that either remove carbon from the atmosphere or cut
greenhouse gas emissions.  And the investment is the latest Biden
administration initiative aimed at combatting climate change with a goal
to cut the farm sector’s greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and
put the United States on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050.

Finally, I wanted to note: I have a Team USA water bottle out here today
and a Team USA pin out here today.  As you all know, we made a decision
— the United States — not to send a diplomatic or official delegation to
Beijing given the PRC’s ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in
Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.  And that was a clear statement
and a clear policy made by our government.

But at the same time, we wanted to note Team USA has our full support. 
We’re behind them; we’re watching from home.  And we want to thank them
and their families for everything they have sacrificed over the course
of time. 

Lots of athletes to watch.  I’ll just give a plug, because I’m an
Olympics-obsessed person: Nathan Chen, we’re going to watch him; Chloe
Kim; Mikaela Shiffrin, you’ve got lots of more chances.

Anyway, we’ll be rooting for our U.S. athletes even as we made a very
important statement about our concerns about Beijing’s and the Chinese
human rights abuses.

With that, let’s go ahead.  Colleen, kick us off.

Q    Okay.  So, regarding Dr. Lander, I wondered if he should have been
reprimanded more strongly, given the President’s pledge on his first day
in office to, you know, fire anybody who mistreated their employees.

MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me just give you an overview of what we have done
to date.  And I know there may be more questions on this, of course,
which we welcome. 

The President has been crystal clear with all of us about his high
expectations of how he and his staff should be creating a respectful
work environment.

And one of the steps we took early on in the administration was to
institute a Safe and Respectful Workplace Policy across the Executive
Office of the President — something that was done early on.

It was because of this policy and this process that when these — when
the complaint was filed, a full and thorough investigation was conducted
pursuant to that policy.

In addition, following the conclusion of the thorough investigation into
these actions, senior White House officials conveyed directly to Dr.
Lander that his behavior was inappropriate and the corrective actions
that were needed, which were — which the White House will monitor for
compliance moving forward.

I’d also note that Dr. Lander also sent a message to his staff outlining
some of the steps he’s intending to take to build a respectful work
environment.  And certainly, we would encourage those.  And again, the
team — the senior team will be watching for compliance to these steps.

Q    It looks like he’s had a history of, you know, possible
mistreatment of his employees over a long period of time.  How can you
be sure that this reprimand will stick?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would just reiterate, again, that — well, let me
start with the first part of your question.

Each nominee undergoes a thorough vetting process as a part of their
nomination and confirmation process.  And, of course, we look carefully
to ensure each candidate’s suitability for the role they’re chosen for. 

Dr. Lander’s record was thoroughly examined as a part of his
confirmation, and he received bipartisan support, including final
confirmation with a voice vote.

But again, once we were made aware of the complaint, we launched a
thorough investigation, and compliance with the recommendations is —
will be — will be required in this regard.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Jen.  On Ukraine, Zelenskyy’s office said yesterday that a
diplomatic solution seems much more likely than war, and then we saw
Jake Sullivan say yesterday that an invasion could come at any day.  Can
you help us square the difference here and why there still seems to be
such a dark assessment — a stark difference in assessing the threat?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, what our National Security Advisor also conveyed
during some interviews with a range of your networks yesterday was that
we’re pursuing a two-track approach, which includes deterrence and
diplomacy, but that we are ready either way for whatever decision
President Putin might make.  And we don’t have a new assessment of his
decision and where he stands on it.

We also need to be prepared.  Being prepared is exactly what we can do
from the U.S. government, in coordination and in partnership with our
NATO Allies, our partners in Eastern Europe, and of course, the
Ukrainians.  And that is what we’re focused on.  So, we don’t actually
see it as a conflict.

Q    Is Kyiv wrong, then, on this?

MS. PSAKI:  In terms of the preparations?  Or —

Q    A diplomatic solution being more likely than war.  It seems hard to
square that with Sullivan saying that an invasion could come at any day.

MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we would certainly prefer a diplomatic
solution.  I think that’s everybody’s preference and everybody’s hope.

But again, this is up to — remains up to President Putin to make a
decision about which path he is going to take.  We don’t have an
assessment of that, so what our focus is on is preparing for a range of
contingencies, including in coordination with the Ukrainians, making
sure they have the supplies they need, the humanitarian assistance they
need, the security assistance they need.  And we’re doing that — we’re
doing that consistently, even while we are closely watching the buildup
of troops on the border.

Q    To switch topics if I may, Delta’s CEO is asking for the
administration’s help in creating this no-fly list for unruly
passengers.  Is that something the administration supports?

MS. PSAKI:  I have not had a chance to talk to our team about that.  I
can see if there’s any opinion on that from here.

Q    Okay.  And, quickly, a housekeeping thing: Do you have a sense of
when the President will start meeting with SCOTUS candidates?  And if
any of these meetings happen in Delaware, where the President — where
there are not visitor logs, does the White House pledge to disclose that
those meetings took place?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, at this point, I don’t have any more details
about the process to outline for you.  As you know, what the President
has been focused on over the course of the last several days is
reviewing and consulting with internal team members on a group of
qualified nominees.  He also has been engaging, as you all know, with
Democrats and Republicans and consulting closely to — as a part of the
“advice and consent,” “consent” part of his — the role of picking a
nominee to move forward.  
   
After last week’s meeting with Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member
Grassley, the President and Vice President and their senior teams,
including White House Counsel Dana Remus, have also spoken to the range
of additional members of Congress and outside legal experts, and that
engagement will continue.   
   
There, is of course, a vetting process that takes place.  We have not
outlined that in detail from here.  And, of course, we will venture to
be as transparent as possible, even as we are working to protect the
process as the President is making his decision.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  With the meeting today between the President and the
German Chancellor, does the President view Germany as a reliable partner
on this issue?  When it comes to troop movements or sending weapons to
Ukraine or talking publicly about sanctions, they’ve been much less
aggressive than other NATO Allies.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’d also note that Germany is the second-largest donor
to Ukraine and Europe.  The President has also noted, as we have noted,
that different countries make different contributions.  I think that the
Chancellor also did an interview with the Washington Post this morning
where he spoke to that in more detail.   
   
We have a close, abiding, important relationship with the Germans.  That
includes having forces stationed in Germany, which has a huge strategic
value to the United States.   
   
So today is an opportunity for the President to build on the
relationship with the Chancellor, to continue to build on the long and
abiding relationship with the Germans.  And we are united in our view of
the actions — the potential actions of Russian leaders and united in our
efforts to hold them accountable.  
   
Q    What’s your understanding about where the Chancellor stands right
now when it comes to including Nord Stream 2 in potential sanctions if
Russia invades.  They’ve really danced around that issue and haven’t
given a clear answer about whether they would, in fact, be willing to
put that pipeline on hold.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know you all will have the opportunity to, I’m sure,
ask him this question himself.  And I, of course, don’t speak for him. 
But what I can reiterate here is that we said we’d work with Germany to
ensure that Nord Stream 2 does not move forward should Russia invade,
and that remains the position — agreed position.  
   
Q    And Emmanuel Macron is meeting with President Putin today, and
Chancellor Scholz will be meeting with him in the coming weeks.  So, has
President Biden asked either of them to deliver a message to Putin when
they meet with him?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s important to remember that there are a
range of different diplomatic talks happening at the same time through
different formats.  Some are leader to leader; some are through NATO;
some are through the OSCE.  And this is reflective of that — these
conversations that are happening.  
   
As you know, the President spoke with President Macron yesterday.  And,
of course, that close discussion and coordination with a range of
leaders is part of how we’re approaching this.  
   
But this is multilayered diplomacy at work here.  So — and we are also
directly in touch with the Russians ourselves.  So, I wouldn’t — I
wouldn’t look at it through that prism.   
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You guys are — said in a background call that part of
the discussion with Germany today was about continuing to prepare this
robust sanctions package, but we’ve been talking about sanctions for
months.   
   
So if Germany is as aligned with its Allies as they — you all are
conveying, why isn’t this sanctions package already complete?  Why isn’t
that done already, in terms of figuring out what it looks like?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our internal sanctions package?  Or what sanctions
package?  
   
Q    Because you’ve said consistently that the sanctions that you’re
preparing are in close consultation with Allies, including Germany.  And
that conversation is, you know, obviously happening again today, as
we’re getting warnings that Russia could at any moment take significant
action.  
   
So the discussion about sanctions has been over the course of several
months.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Why isn’t it done yet if Germany is as on board with the rest of
the NATO Alliance as they’re projecting to be?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, Jacqui, I mean, as we’ve said before: One, I
think there is alignment that we will work with Germany to ensure that
Nord Stream 2 does not move forward, which is obviously a key — a key
point of discussion.   
   
I’d also note, just — and reiterate that it’s not operational at this
time, and there’s no oil flowing through the pipeline.  That has been a
key point of discussion, and that is agreed to.   
   
I would also reiterate what we’ve said in here in the past is that:
While we have our own sanctions package prepared, which we’ve been
consulting with and briefing members of Congress on, and others do — and
we’re united in the effort to put forward an economic sanctions package
that has significant consequences, as are our European partners — it
doesn’t mean it’s identical.  So —  
   
Q    One point to clarify: You said that that is agreed to on Nord
Stream 2.  I just want to clarify: The Germans have — are you saying
that the Germans have committed not to bring Nord Stream 2 online if
Russia invades?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I’m not going to get into the private
diplomatic conversations, but it — we have said a number of times that
if they invade, it will not move forward.  
   
Q    And then, I wanted to ask about Dr. Lander again.  I know you got a
question on this earlier, but does the fact that Dr. Lander has a job,
still, cheapen the President’s promise to fire anyone who treats
colleagues with disrespect on the spot?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I would just reiterate that the President takes
his commitment to having a respectful work environment incredibly
seriously.  And it’s something that he conveys clearly to all of us on a
regular basis.  That is why we put in place — in part put in place a
safe and respectful workplace policy, which is how — which is the
process through which this thorough investigation proceeded through and
the process through which, again, that there was an internal
investigation.   
   
Dr. Lander — obviously, his behavior was inappropriate, and corrective
actions needed to be taken, and that was clearly conveyed through this
process.  And he will be held to account for delivering on that.   
   
Q    And then, real quick — one third topic.  We got announcements that
in Delaware and New Jersey, the governors are going to be ending mask
mandates coming up pretty soon.  What is the White House view on these
kinds of announcements, given that in Virginia, Governor Youngkin faced
a lot of pushback from Democrats for making similar changes to the mask
policy?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, but they weren’t actually that similar because what
happened here in New Jersey and a couple of other states you mentioned
is that they pulled back the requirement.  They didn’t make it more
difficult for schools, school administrators, and local officials to
keep requirements that they made a determination would keep their
schools safe.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Do you expect that President Macron and President Biden will have a
follow-up conversation so that he can relay any, sort of, impressions
that he got from his face-to-face meeting?  And would you commit to
letting us know if that conversation happens?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We certainly would.  On the latter, I would say that, as you
know, the President spoke with President Macron just yesterday.  Again,
there’s multilayers of diplomacy happening at many times.  Sometimes
those readouts happen at the Secretary of State level or National
Security Advisor.   
   
But I can assure you we are in close contact with the French; of course,
the Germans; and all of our NATO partners and Allies.  
   
Q    At the Pentagon, John Kirby has talked about the possibility of
additional U.S. forces being moved to Europe.  Has the President
requested any additional recommendations from Secretary Austin?  And is
he reviewing any other plans along those lines?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would just say that we are in constant contact, of course,
with the Defense Department but also with our NATO partners about what
their needs are.  So, I don’t have anything to predict for you other
than to reiterate what was said last week, which is that we leave the
door open to that possibility.  
   
Q    So that’s an active possibility at this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It always has been.  And I would remind everyone that there
are thousands of troops that are on the — in Eastern European countries
as a part of our NATO Alliance, so this is to bolster up the troops that
are already there.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Back on the mask mandate question in New Jersey and other states:
The CDC is still recommending universal masking in schools, so —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s correct.  And that still remains our
recommendation.  
   
Q    So are you pleased with and fine with the New Jersey governor’s
decision?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, our advice to every school district is to abide by
public health guidelines.  It continues to be, at this point, that the
CDC is advising that masks can delay, reduce transmission.  There are
also a number of other mitigation measures that we’ve put in place, but
that continues to be CDC guidance.   
   
It’s always been up to local school districts to determine how they
implement.  
   
Q    What does it say, then, that a governor like Phil Murphy, who’s
been so closely aligned with the policies of this administration, would
get ahead of the medical experts and say, “Never mind what they say;
school districts, you decide”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s always been up to school districts.  That’s
always been our point of view and always been our policy from here.   
   
And our policy from the federal government is to continue to advise
everybody to abide by public health guidelines.  
   
Q    Do you think it signals that perhaps the public believes it’s time
for a change in the federal guidelines — the CDC’s guidance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we certainly understand and have seen in polling that
the public is tired of COVID.  We understand that.  So are we.   
   
And there has been some good signs recently where there has been a
decrease in hospitalizations around the country.  And again, we’re in
constant touch about — about what it looks like moving forward.  
   
But our responsibility, as the federal government, is to rely on the
data and the science that is being analyzed by our public health
experts.  And we’ll continue to rely on that for what recommendations
we’re making.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah.  A couple things.  So, we’ve reported that U.S. officials are
losing patience with the Chinese in these negotiations about them
fulfilling their purchase commitments under the phase one trade deal
signed by Donald Trump.  What is the perspective from the White House in
terms of what can you do?  And does the President intend to weigh in on
this issue?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s a good question, Andrea.  I mean, we — as you
know, they did not abide by their purchase agreements.  We know that
factually; we’ve seen that.  This is really under the purview of the
USTR and our Trade Representative, Katherine Tai.  We remain in close
touch with her about that, but I’d really point you to them for any
updates on the process.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then, this situation on the Canadian bor- — or in
Ottawa, the truckers protest: There does seem to be evidence that these
truckers are getting support from conservative forces or right-wing
forces in the U.S.  Are you investigating that at all?  Is there any,
kind of, you know, involvement of U.S. authorities in looking at those
money flows going to these truckers?  And are you concerned about it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say a couple of things.  This doesn’t answer
your question, but I just want to get this out there too on this
particular topic, and then I’ll come around — I promise.  
   
We have been engaged since the outset — well, some of it hopefully
answers your question, I should say — of the protests.  There have been
zero impacts to CBP operations, which is a question people have
understandably been asking us.  Some — some shipments were rerouted by
our law enforcement partners to other points of entry due to road
closures.  Some shippers have had to reroute.  But CBP has been in
communication throughout to ensure shipments can be cleared and onto the
normal routes.  
   
In terms of an assessment of any other engagement from here, we have —
we don’t really have any update on that or any investigation to read out
at this point in time.   
   
Q    And then, you know, the Federal — the Federal Reserve nominees have
run into a little bit of criticism from Republicans, in particular Sarah
Raskin.  Are you concerned that you’re — I mean, especially given the
absence of Senator Luján, are you concerned that you might not get all
those nominees through and that you may have to withdraw Sarah Raskin? 
There’s just been another dust — dustup overnight?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  She is one of the most, if not the most, qualified person to
ever be nominated to this position.  She just gave extensive answers at
a hearing last week, and she would be someone the President would be
proud to have in that role, as independent as it may be.   
   
So, no, that is not an assessment or a prediction we’re making.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, two questions for you.  One, the Secretary-General of NATO has
recently talked about the possibility of a more permanent military
presence in Europe in response to Russia.  Where does the Biden
administration stand on that issue?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ve had a permanent military presence in Europe.   
   
You mean in addition?  
   
Q    Oh, a longer — a longer-term, more permanent presence in Europe.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve always had one.  But you mean a plussed-up
one?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would really point —  
   
Q    And the language that was used was “longer term.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, but we’ve always had one, so it’s been very
long term to date.  But I would say: If — if he is asking — and I have
not seen his comments about increased, plussed-up presence in some of
the places from U.S. troops that we’ve had — I would really point to the
Department of Defense.   
   
Obviously, we would — we would be in touch with our NATO Allies and
partners about that.  But that is really related to the aggression at
the border that we’re seeing in Ukraine, but there’s been tens of
thousands of troops in Europe for some time now.   
   
Q    And just on the topic of masking in schools, if you could just
clarify — I know you’ve talked about this a little bit already: Do you
think that at some point in the future, even if that point isn’t now, it
would be appropriate for there to be updated federal guidelines just to
avoid confusion?  I think the administration has been clear that on
other issues, there are sort of messaging issues that could have been a
little bit more clear coming from the administration.  So on this issue,
do you think that that might be appropriate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the guidance is very clear, which is that we recommend
masking in schools.  That is the recommendation from the CDC.  It is
also true that at some point, when the science and the data warrants, of
course our hope is that that’s no longer the recommendation.  And they
are continually assessing that.  But the guidance is very clear.   
   
It is also true that it has always been up to local school districts to
make determinations about how to implement these policies.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Just to follow on that, you had said that you guys
are in “constant contact” with the CDC about what it looks like to move
forward.  Can we expect the President to provide some sort of roadmap
for how states can transition out of a state of emergency — kind of akin
to what he did with the winter strategy?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re in constant discussion internally about the moment
we’re in, as it relates to COVID.  And, of course, as the President
said, I think during his press conference just two weeks ago — a week
and a half ago — you know, we certainly don’t see this moment now as the
new normal, right?  And we — but we want to get to a point where we are
not — where COVID is not disrupting our daily lives.   
   
And I’m sure you will hear more from the President about that, but
that’s — we’re constantly discussing that internally.  
   
Q    And can I ask one more just for our colleague?  The Education
Department announced Friday it was going to withdraw its appeal for a
$100,000 student loan forgiveness court decision.  I’m wondering if you
could shed any light on why the Biden administration reversed its
decision to appeal the case and if there’s any plans to fight other
bankruptcy cases.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would really point you to the Department of Education and
the Department of Justice, potentially.  But I will check and see if
there’s anything more we can offer on that from here.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I got one more on masks.  I just — I was wondering if I could just
ask it this way —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   
   
Q    — the President’s wife is an educator.  He just heard from
governors across the country last week, many of whom were saying, “This
is enough.  It’s time for a new normal.”  Where is he on this after
taking all of these inputs?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President is not a private citizen; he is
President of the United States, right?  So his —  
   
Q    But you’re his spokesperson, so I’m asking you —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, but I guess I’m saying it’s different than asking kind
of a person on the street.  Right?  I mean, I’m just — you know, it is
different because he is the President; he needs to project the — what
the data and the science is telling us.  And the data and science —
where we get that guidance from is the CDC and our health and medical
experts.  Their guidance remains — continues to be that, in schools,
people should mask up.  So that is what we are continuing to convey and
recommend.   
   
Q    And then, can you tell us any more about where he will be going on
Thursday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not quite yet, but hopefully — maybe by the end of the day. 
We hope to have some more details very soon.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Going back to Dr. Lander, “the investigation found
credible evidence of multiple women having complained to other staff
about negative interactions with him,” with a pattern of abusive and
disrespectful behavior.   
   
Again, the President, at the outset of this administration said, “I will
fire you on the spot.  On the spot.  No ifs, ands, or buts.”  So why is
he not being fired?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Matt, let me first say that no one is suggesting that
this behavior is acceptable — quite the opposite.  
   
And that since he’s — he made the comment he did — which I think was one
of the first few days in office, if I remember correctly — we put in
place this “Safe and Respectful Workplace Policy” to ensure there was a
mechanism — right?  — to conduct investigations, as was conducted in
this case, that can be thorough, that result in some actions and some
steps.   
   
That’s exactly what happened here.   
   
But again, this is not acceptable behavior.  Dr. Lander is expected to
comply.  And he will be monitored for compliance, because having a safe
workplace environment is imperative to the President, the Vice
President, the First Lady, the Second Gentleman — all of us who work
here.  
   
Q    But are there ways in which he’s being held to account if he’s not
being fired?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, as I outlined a little bit earlier, but let me
reiterate a little bit: In addition to a full and thorough
investigation, he was — it was conveyed through meetings with senior
White House officials directly that his behavior was inappropriate,
corrective action was needed, and we will monitor for compliance to that
— to those actions that were required.   
   
Again, I think you may have also seen, or it was reported, that he also
sent a note to his staff conveying his commitment to abiding by that. 
And we certainly hope that that is the case.  
   
Q    But it doesn’t sound like a zero-tolerance policy if that’s the
case.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our objective and the President’s objective is to
prevent this behavior from ever happening again.  
   
Q    So —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On the Supreme Court.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    I just — I wanted to ask about the President’s efforts to engage
with Republicans —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — and whether that’s the best use of his time, considering what he
has said about the public not wanting him to be the “President
Senator.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That is true.  And I think he has — he has not been the
“President Senator” over the course of the last period of time.   
   
It’s also true that he takes his role as President and going through the
process of selecting and nominating an eminently qualified nominee very
seriously.  And in his experience as the former Chairman of the
Judiciary Community \[sic\] — Committee, that includes consultation with
key members of the Senate, and that is an important part of the process
in this case.  
   
I think what he was referring to in those comments was hours and hours
and hours of endless closed-door meetings as it related to negotiating
through the course of the fall.  But this is a opening to a lifetime
appointment — an opening on the Supreme Court, which is a lifetime
appointment — something the President takes very seriously.  And
consulting with Republicans and Democrats is an important part of that
process, in his view.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    On Nord Stream 2, you have — you’ve made clear the administration’s
position.  I did want to understand, though: Is the administration ready
to take some type of action without Germany to stop Nord Stream 2?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I understand your question.  I just am not in a position to
detail further, other than to convey that it will not move forward if
Russia invades.  
   
Q    On Dr. Lander, if I may.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Can you talk about what some of the specific corrective changes
that were ordered — what some of those were?  And also, has the
President spoken with Dr. Lander since the investigation was completed? 
And does he worry about this overshadowing Moonshot?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that the President’s hope — all of our
hope — is certainly that Dr. Lander will abide by — making changes, that
he will be held to account to — to comply fully with the steps that
needed to be taken.  
   
I can see if there’s more specific details.  I certainly understand why
you’re asking.  But overall, it’s ensuring that he is creating a work
environment that people feel safe, they feel supported, and that is
respectful.  And that is the overarching policy that needs to be
implemented moving forward.  
   
You saw him send a note to staff last week, and now it is whether he is
implementing those policies moving forward.   
   
Q    Have they spoken?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any conversations between them to read out.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Just following up on a question asked earlier about the —
what you said isn’t a split between Ukraine’s messaging and your guys’
messaging —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q    — on the risk of an invasion.  
   
Can you walk us through the communication strategy — like what you’re
trying to highlight, given the risk of invasion, and why you’re trying
to highlight it more strongly than Ukraine?   
   
Do you see it as — you know, sounding the alarm more vocally, is there
an advantage that you see in sort of preventing Putin from taking any
further steps here?  Have we —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, it’s a good question.  And I can’t — I can’t speak for
the communication strategy of the Ukrainians; only they can speak to
that.  But I can tell you that what we have been trying to do — we
obviously have a range of information — a broad range of information
that we have been able to gather here and also through partnership with
our allies across the country.   
   
Our objective, as we talked about a little bit on Friday, is to deny
Russia the opportunity to use some of the tactics, sometimes some of the
lies that they have done in the past to justify an invasion of Ukraine. 
That’s straight out of their playbook.   
   
We have seen tactics they have used in the past, where a few years ago,
Russia’s Defense Ministry falsely accused the United States of running a
clandestine biological weapons lab in the country of Georgia, enabling
them — their efforts to destabilize the Georgian government.   
   
They used to fabricate stories in Syria about how attacks on
international aid convoys were undertaken by rebels or terrorists.   
   
We’ve — so we have undertaken an effort to, in some cases, declassify
information; in other cases, describe in as great of detail as we can
without putting at risk sources and methods what we’re seeing, what
information we’re evaluating so that they are — it is — it makes it more
difficult for them to lay a predicate for invading Ukraine.   
   
So that is why we’re doing it.  I’d also note that a number of your news
organizations of course have reporters near there who are seeing the
troop buildup.  Right?  So there is justification and validation from
even that, but also from our partners around the world as well.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Senator Manchin expressed confidence over the
weekend that reforms of the Electoral Count Act will pass.  Would the
President be supportive of signing reforms to the Electoral Count Act if
it were to pass?  Or would he require that there be elements of the bill
— voting rights bill included in order to do so?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would really point you to Senator Klobuchar, who is
really one of the point people leading this effort.   
   
Obviously, we have said many times that the Electoral Count Act, while
we support the effort, is not a replacement for voting rights
legislation for a range of reasons.   
   
I know there’s a lot of discussions on the Hill about what that may look
like or want a final package.  I can’t outline that from here.  
   
Q    Okay.  And China used a young Uyghur athlete to carry the Olympic
Torch during the Opening Ceremony of the Games in Beijing.  What did the
administration make of that, given the ongoing genocide against Uyghurs
in Xinjiang?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know that our U.N. Ambassador, Linda
Thomas-Greenfield, spoke to this yesterday.  So let me reiterate what I
thought were some very powerful comments — if I’m remembering — I know
someone spoke to it, but I believe it was her — that we can’t allow this
to be a distraction from, exactly as you said, the human rights abuses,
the genocide that we’re seeing in parts of China.   
   
That is why we did not send a diplomatic delegation, even as we’re
cheering for our U.S. athletes.  Diplomacy is complicated, as we know,
but we can’t allow it to be a distraction from what we know is happening
to many people in China.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just to reiterate, on Inauguration Day, President Biden said he
would fire anyone that treated another colleague with disrespect, talked
down to someone — and they would — he would fire them “on the spot” —
“No, ifs, ands, or buts.”  So what is the White House’s message to
people that work in this building and throughout the federal government
that took the President at his word and don’t understand why Dr. Lander
has not been fired?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our message — and thank you for your question — is that the
President has crystal-clear expectations with all of us about how we are
to treat our colleagues, treat people who work for us, and that is what
he expects for people across the building.  
   
It is because of those comments that he made early on, in part, that we
put in place a Safe and Respectful Workplace Policy that was the
mechanism for which this thorough investigation went forward.  And it
also — it is based on that that their investigation — from that came the
meeting that Dr. Lander had with senior White House officials where it
was made clear what steps he was required to take and that we will be
complying and watching for compliance with those steps. 

And our objective is, of course, to prevent any of this behavior from
happening again in the future.  That’s the overarching objective.

Q    But those weren’t comments; those were a promise.

MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  That’s why he — we put in place a policy to
ensure there is a mechanism for investigating and a mechanism for
preventing this type of behavior from repeating itself. 

Q    But he promised to fire people that did this, and he hasn’t fired
the individual the White House found violated what he said. 
(Inaudible).

MS. PSAKI:  I understand.  And, again, let me just reiterate: Nothing
about his behavior is acceptable to anyone here — at all.  Quite the
opposite.  Let me be clear about that. 

But there is now a process in place, that was not in place at the time,
to evaluate and determine what the next step — the steps should be taken
in the event that any behavior like this occurs to prevent it from
happening in the future.  That is exactly what happened in this case. 

Q    So, fellow federal employees shouldn’t expect that people will be
fired if they treat colleagues with disrespect? 

MS. PSAKI:  Again, I think I’ve outlined very clearly what the process
was. 

Go ahead. 

Q    You’re just saying it’s legal — that it’s legal what you’re doing. 
Correct?

Q    Two questions, Jen.  Two questions for you.  Excuse me.  Two
questions — 

MS. PSAKI:  It’s more than — it’s more than that.  I think it’s clear
that we are putting in place — we had put in place a process — an
internal process — to ensure that there was a thorough investigation,
that the — that it was evaluated, that steps were taken for this
individual, Dr. Lander, to meet with senior officials to make clear that
there were requirements that would be put in place and he was expected
to comply with them to prevent this behavior from ever happening again. 

Go ahead. 

Q    Two questions.  First, on Senator Manchin, on Build Back Better: He
reiterated again his view that that structure is done.  And he said he
wants regular order for any pieces of that (inaudible); that means
potentially weeks — hearings, all of that.  Is the President on board
with that idea of hearings, markups?  And if not, what’s his plan for
elements of Build Back Better to move forward?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can’t speak for Senator Manchin; I know you’re not
asking me to, but what there is broad agreement on and support for is
taking steps to lower costs for the American people, whether it’s
Medicare or whether it’s the ability to negotiate the price of
prescription drugs — something broadly supported; whether it’s lowering
the cost of childcare, eldercare; making sure that the tax system is
more fair.

In terms of the mechanisms and the legislative process, I just don’t
have any more predictions for you in terms of how it will proceed. 

Q    And then, on jobs, a positive report on Friday, by and large. 
However, Black unemployment is still twice the rate of white
unemployment.  What is the White House doing?  What does the White House
think needs to be done to deal with that, especially for Black men?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, just as a reminder, that there is still —
as much as the President oversaw the largest creation of jobs — job
creation ever in one year in American history, it means there’s more
work to be done, because there are still a lot of work that needs to be
done to level the playing field, to ensure that small businesses have
the assistance they need, including Black-owned small businesses; that
we are doing everything we can to ensure there is opportunity for a
range of parts of the economic world.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Jen.  A few on the Supreme Court.  Congressman Clyburn says
that the President will need bipartisan support for his Supreme Court
pick, citing Senator Luján’s stroke and hospitalization.  Is it the
White House’s position that Republican votes would be helpful in the
Senate, or do you view them as necessary?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve, I think, conveyed from here that we haven’t set
a deadline for when a vote should be.  We have said we want it to happen
as expeditiously as possible.  We have also said, and I’ll reiterate,
that because the President has every intention of nominating an
eminently qualified Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, that this
is a person who should warrant bipartisan support.  And that is
certainly what we hope for. 

Q    Speaking of the timeline, the President has said that he intends to
make that announcement by the end of the month.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Has that timeline shifted in any way?  Might he make this
announcement before President’s Day weekend? 

MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything — February is February, so I don’t
have anything to predict for you in terms of when in February, quite, at
this point, it will be.

Go ahead. 

Q    Thank you.  And one more question, if you don’t mind.

MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.

Q    As far as where and when he could meet with the potential nominees
— he’s going to Camp David this weekend.  Is the President going to meet
with potential Supreme Court justices at Camp David this weekend?

MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything for you on the process of how the
President will interview nominee — potential candidates. 

Go ahead. 

Q    Thanks, Jen.  Does the White House have a reaction to the death of
the Navy SEAL candidate who died after completing what’s known as “Hell
Week”?  And has the President spoken to his family, or does he have
plans to?

MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have — not — not yet, Karen.  I will — we will check
and see where that is at this point.  Obviously, there’ll be an
investigation here.  I’d point you to the Department of Defense for any
specifics. 

As a starting point here, obviously, our heart goes out to the family
members, the community, the friends, and we look — we will look for more
details to come out of an investigation. 

Q    And would there be any thought given to reexamining that training
as part of that?

MS. PSAKI:  It’s a good question.  I would really point you to the
Department of Defense, and the President would certainly look to his
Defense Department and leadership to make any recommendations in that
regard. 

Go ahead. 

Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two questions.  First, on the Olympics: Does the
White House agree with Speaker Nancy Pelosi that American athletes
shouldn’t speak out against Beijing for their own safety?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know we saw those comments, obviously.  I think they
were last week, if I remember correctly.  The President’s view is that,
first, we support our athletes 100 percent.  (Holds up Team USA water
bottle).  Yay.  All athletes have the right to freely express
themselves, and that is the case in Beijing at the Olympics; it is the
case anywhere.  They will make those choices as individuals. 

It’s the responsibility of China to live up to its own obligations to
maintain a safe environment for all athletes at these games.  The world
will be watching. 

But we leave it up to individuals.  We certainly support the right to
peaceful protest. 

Q    And then, on the First Lady’s comments this morning about — she
said — she conceded that free tuition for community college is dead;
it’s out of Build Back Better. 

I’m wondering, kind of, what was the thought about having her give that
message.  Is the White House trying to restart negotiations on Build
Back Better?  Was there some sort of underlying intent to have the First
Lady come out and say that this morning?

MS. PSAKI:  I think it was speaking from her heart about her view that
free community college would benefit kids, young people, level the
playing field across the country.  It’s something the President agrees
with. 

I think you all have seen many, many iterations of the Build Back Better
legislation — or options — in recent months.  It hasn’t been in there in
a while, so I think it was speaking — she was speaking from her heart
about how beneficial she thinks that funding and that support would be. 

Go ahead, April.

Q    Jen, two topics.  One, recently, a Black man was killed in
Minnesota over a no-knock warrant.  Has the White House taken note of
this?  And does this bring a fresh — a renewed call for this executive
order — this police reform executive order, as well as the standalone
pieces that are potentials on police reform on Capitol Hill?

MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  And it should.  Let me reiterate, because I
asked a little bit about this, this morning, as well.    
   
So, one, let me first say that we mourn the tragic death of Amir Locke,
and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.   
   
The President is committed to ensuring fair, impartial, and effective
policing in keeping our communities safe.  These goals go hand-in-hand,
in our — in his view, with what we can achieve by building trust between
the police and communities they serve.   
   
So, back in September, Attorney General Garland issued a new policy
impoving \[sic\] — imposing restrictions on the use of no-knock
warrants, chokeholds, and carotid restraints by federal agents. 
Obviously, that’s for federal agents, so that’s limited — not to local.
 But — you know, I know you follow this closely but for others.  
   
President Biden — the reason he has been such a strong supporter — one
of the reasons — of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is that it
would further restrict the use of no-knock warrants across the country,
incentivizing funding — by using funding as an incentive.   
   
We have been engaging with, as you know, civil rights groups, a number
of law enforcement groups.  All agree on the need to reform the use of
no-knock warrants.  That is — there’s a lot of agreement on that to keep
both citizens and law enforcement officers safe.  
   
And the President is examining the possibility of extending those
restrictions to other federal agencies through actions — executive
actions that he would have the power to do.   
   
I think you all saw Susan Rice convey last week that we’re not there
yet.  We want to make sure we do any action through the administration
the right way and it’s thorough, but certainly, that’s part of what’s
being looked at.  
   
Q    All right.  And on the second topic: There is a serious shroud of
secrecy around the nominees of the Supreme Court, understandably.  And
I’ve got two questions on this.  One, what’s traditional about the
process?  And then, what is very unique to the process because of the
historical nature?  If you can tell us.  And I’m sure you can give us
something.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, no, no, it’s a good question.  It’s a very thoughtful
question.  I was just trying to —  
   
Q    Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There you go.   
   
I walked right into that one.  
   
Q    Yes, you did.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I walked right into that one.   
   
What I think is unique in this moment is that the President is someone
who has served as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as the
Vice President when there were a number of nominees — historic — many
historic — a number of historic nominees who were nominated and
confirmed by the Senate.  And he takes the process and the seriousness —
the need for it to be thorough — he’s very focused on it.  
   
You know, I don’t know that that’s unique.  Obviously, every President,
I would hope, takes the process seriously.  But he also takes, as is —
there was a question earlier about this — the component about advice
part of it very seriously, in terms of consulting with Republicans and
Democrats in the process.   
   
You know, what is unique about this moment?  You know, that’s a good — I
want to read your article about this to hear what you have to say.   
   
Q    Oh, you — we’ve got a lot of articles already.  (Laughter.)   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Well, your next article about it.  
   
Q    Yes.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, I think it’s safe to say that there are some
criticisms that have been out there, without any names being confirmed,
that are unique to — to having the possibility, the likelihood, the plan
for a woman of color being nominated for this position.  And the types
of language that are used by some to describe who the President might
pick as a nominee are unique to that.  
   
Q    And you just spoke, a moment ago, about advice on —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — his nominees.  We know the internal advice, particularly from the
Counsel’s Office, as well as the Vice President.    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    But externally — when is the last time the President talked to
Anita Hill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  To Anita Hill?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would have to check on that for you, April.  
   
Q    Is she part of this process?  Because we know there are — we know
that he talked, and they had a very real conversation before he, you
know, became President-elect.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   
   
Q    Is she — I want to know, one: Has he consul- — when is the last
time he consulted with her?  And if she is part — because the names of
those who are on the outside are dribbling out — and is she one of
those, and he respects her opinion.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will check with our team who are overseeing the process. 
And you — you’re familiar with who that internal team is.   
   
I know we probably have to wrap up soon here.  Go ahead, Ed.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Two things.  On gas prices: So, if President Biden has said,
with oil prices, that he released the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and
that brought down prices — actually, on that day, the price of oil
actually rose and went down for the Omicron variant as the fears of
lockdown.  Today, oil prices are $91 — more than $91 a barrel.  Is there
any consideration by the administration to reversing any of the policies
or regulations or removing some to encourage more drilling in the U.S.
for future demand?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me tell you what we are doing.  Of course — we, of
course, tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; sometimes they take some
time to be digested into the system.  We’ve also worked with a number of
countries around the world to do something similar.  We’ve been engaged
with OPEC nation countries about the need for the supply available to
meet the demand.   
   
We’ve also called out the record profits made by oil companies, which
should not be lost as an issue as consumers are looking at the price
that they are paying at — the prices they are paying.   
   
And then I would also note that you should check with oil companies on
whether they are tapping into all of the land leases they have available
at their disposal.   
   
Q    But what about the — what about —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t believe they are.  
   
Q    What about encouraging the investment in drilling in other places
in the U.S.?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I think the President’s view is that we are — it is a
huge advantage to us to be a leader in the clean energy transition.  And
over the course of years and decades, we’ve become a clean energy
superpower because, ultimately, that’s such — not just where the jobs
are, it’s where the strategic advantage will lie in 10, 20, 30 years.   
   
I would note again — and you can ask the oil companies this — there is
land they’re not all drilling on.  Every lease is not used.  I’d
encourage them — you to ask them that question.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, the President provided to continue (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, in the middle.   
   
Q    Is this time for him to —  
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Can we — just finish.  I think we just — go ahead, in the
middle right there.  
   
Q    I’m asking if it is the time for the President to —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Simon, let me just — let me just —  
   
Q    — (inaudible)?  His approval rating continues to sink.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — let me just — let me just have him ask his question. 
Okay?  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Is the American people (inaudible) sending a different message?  
   
Q    Thank you.  Quickly back to Nord Stream 2.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    We know the American position to that; you made that crystal
clear.  Did the pro- — did the President know the German position before
the talks in the Oval Office began?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I’m sure this will be a part of the
discussion.  I would bet someone will ask about this when we’re having a
press conference in just a little bit here.   
   
But what I can just reiterate is that it will not move forward.   
   
Q    Jen, one on Russia.  
   
Q    And quick question on President Macron’s visit in —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — Moscow today and the Minsk agreement.  What is the White House’s
position on the question of autonomy or more autonomy for the different
regions in Ukraine?  For instance, the Donbass with a majority Russian
population, should they have an increased say in the Ukrainian national
politics, including the question of which alliance Ukraine wants to be a
member of?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, our position on this has not changed.  Obviously, the
Minsk agreements is part of the discussion, as has been reported,
between President Putin and President Macron.  We’ll wait for those
discussions to conclude.  And we certainly support any means of
diplomatic engagement.   
   
All right, thanks, everyone.   
   
Q    Are you going to give us water bottles?  (Laughter.)   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have enough water in here for everybody.  (Laughter.)   
   
2:43 P.M. EST
