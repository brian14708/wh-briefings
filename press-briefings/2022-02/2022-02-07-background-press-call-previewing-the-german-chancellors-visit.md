5:09 P.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on this background
press call previewing the German Chancellor’s visit tomorrow.   
   
As a reminder of the ground rules, this briefing will be on background,
attributable to a “senior administration official,” and embargoed until
5:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow, Monday, February 7th.  
   
For your own awareness but not for reporting, the senior administration
official on today’s call is \[senior administration official\].  
   
\[Senior administration official\], I’ll turn it over to you for opening
remarks, after which we’ll do Q&A.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\], and thanks to everybody for joining.  Delighted to have the
opportunity to speak with you tonight about the Chancellor’s visit to
Washington tomorrow.  
   
President Biden is very much looking forward to welcoming Chancellor
Scholz on his first visit to Washington and the White House, and sees it
as a good opportunity to affirm the deep and enduring ties between the
United States and Germany.   
   
Germany is one of our closest and strongest Allies in Europe.  The
President and the Chancellor had the opportunity to interact last
October in Rome at the G20 Summit.  Scholz, at the time, was serving as
Finance Minister and coalition negotiations were going on.  But it was
clear that he was the presumptive chancellor, which is why
then-Chancellor Merkel brought him along to the meeting of the <s>P3</s>
\[Quad\] countries, so it gave the President an opportunity to have an
initial conversation with him as part of the handover from Chancellor
Merkel to ensure continuity.

The President had a very early congratulatory call with Chancellor
Scholz, and they have since consulted together with other European
leaders a few times over the last two months since he became
Chancellor.  
   
The President is looking forward to getting to know Chancellor Scholz
personally on this first official visit to Washington as head of state. 
And I would say that the fact he is coming here almost two months to the
day from taking office illustrates the continued importance that the
United States places on our bilateral relationship with Germany and the
importance of this relationship between these two leaders.  
   
The leaders have a very full agenda to discuss tomorrow.  We expect them
to talk significantly about the situation in Ukraine and Russia. 
They’ll likely discuss their shared concerns about Russia’s military
buildup on Ukraine’s border and their shared commitment to both ongoing
diplomatic efforts to encourage Russia to de-escalate tensions as well
as ongoing efforts to ensure deterrence to further Russian
aggression.   
   
Related to that, they will discuss our ongoing efforts to prepare a
robust sanctions package that would impose severe costs if Russia
further invades Ukraine.  
   
Germany, at the start of the year, assumed the presidency of the G7, and
so I expect that will be a significant part of their conversation as
well, including Germany’s agenda and the way our two countries can work
together with fellow G7 members to address global challenges.    
   
Many of the things that comprise Germany’s G7 agenda are priorities for
the Biden administration as well, including the importance of continued
close cooperation on ending the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the threat
of climate change, and promoting economic prosperity and international
security based on our shared democratic values.  
   
In addition, I expect the leaders will want to discuss their support for
the Western Balkans, which is a priority region in Europe for both the
United States and for Germany, and how we can continue to promote
stability in the region, as well as continue to make progress on the
further European integration of the Western Balkans; as well as our
collective response to undemocratic moves by China and continued efforts
within the transatlantic relationship, including in our bilateral
relationship, on how we can work together to address China’s nonmarket
economic practices and human rights abuses.  
   
And so, just closing thought: The United States and Germany have long
worked together to address the world’s most important challenges, and we
see the meeting tomorrow as an opportunity to ensure the continuity of
close relations between the United States and Germany, to give the two
leaders an opportunity to get to know one another personally, and an
opportunity for them to discuss all of the pressing global challenges
that both of our countries are facing today.   
   
So, let me stop there with opening comments and happy to turn it over to
questions.  
   
Q    Hi.  Hey, \[senior administration official\].  Thank you so much
for doing this — and \[senior administration official\].  I wanted to
ask about Nord Stream.  You know, there’s been a lot of tension over
that.  The President has opposed that project for a long time.  What
role do you think Nord Stream will play in this discussion?  
   
And if I could just follow up on the sanctions question as well — or the
sanctions issue: Can you say what the German position is now about
SWIFT?  There’s been, kind of, a lot of back and forth.  But is that a
serious option for, you know, imposing costs on Russia?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks very much for the questions.  In
terms of the — to take your second question first, in terms of the
German position on SWIFT, I don’t want to characterize what their
government’s view is, so I would refer you to them to set out what their
position is on the package of sanctions.  
   
But certainly, what I can say is: We have been coordinating very closely
with Germany — including in advance of the Chancellor’s visit and just
more generally over the last number of weeks, as we have with our other
European partners — on a swift and severe package of sanctions that the
U.S. and Europe would both impose on Russia in the event of an invasion
on Ukraine.  
   
So, lots of conversations with Germany and very much welcome the unity
that we have been seeing from our European Allies and partners on their
readiness to join with us in imposing swift and severe consequences on
Russia if there is further aggression.  
   
And on Nord Stream, this, as you alluded to, is a topic that we have had
numerous conversations with the German government about — with the
Merkel government, as well as with the Scholz government.  I would
assume that it is going to be a topic of conversation between the
leaders tomorrow.  
   
And what I can say is that we have made our position very clear, which
is that: If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2
will not move forward.  
   
Q    \[Senior administration official\], have the Germans assured you
that they are in agreement with this position?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, again, I’m not going to speak on
behalf of the Germans, and we’ll let them for themselves tomorrow, and
we’ll let the Chancellor speak.  
   
But, you know, what I — what I can say is that we’ve had extensive
common- — conversations with the Germans.  We’re confident that the
Germans share our concerns with Russian aggression, that they’re very
involved in our ongoing efforts on both deterrence and diplomacy.  
   
We have made our position very clear, as I laid out.  And what I can say
is that we will continue to work very closely with Germany to ensure the
pipeline does not move forward.  
   
Q    Hey, thank you so much for doing this call on a Sunday.  You know,
I mean, the narrative that’s out there is that Germany has kind of been
the outlier, in terms of the NATO nations, in not being particularly
specific or aggressive in laying out the costs that they would
impose.   
   
So, I’m wondering if the White House is satisfied with the new German
government’s, you know, approach so far to laying out costs if Russia
were to invade and will the President be encouraging the Chancellor to
play more of a leadership role in the, sort of, NATO/Western diplomatic
effort to deter a Russian invasion.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks for that question.  And
certainly recognize that — that that’s the narrative that’s been out
there.  You know, what I can say from the perspective of the White House
is that we have been engaged very closely with our German partners,
including the new German administration over the two months since
they’ve taken office.  
   
As I said earlier, we’ve been coordinating with them very closely on the
packages of sanctions that we would put into place.  We’re coordinating
very closely with them within NATO.  
   
I know there’s been a lot of churn over this question about: Is Germany
going to send arms?  What sort of role is it playing on the security
side?   
   
And I would point out a number of things:  
   
First, Germany, after the United States, is the second-largest donor to
Ukraine and to Europe.  
   
Second, Germany has been very supportive of the things that the United
States has done militarily.  Most recently, as we announced last week,
supporting our ability to move a battalion from Germany into Romania to
reinforce and ensure our Ally in Romania, our Allies in the eastern
flank are feeling a sufficient reassurance and deterrence to Russia.  
   
And third, as an overarching point, the beauty of having an alliance
with 30 NATO Allies is that different Allies step up to take different
approaches to different parts of the problem.   
   
So really, across the board, we have continued to work in close
cooperation with Germany on the sanctions front.  Germany, as I said,
has been a significant donor to Ukraine, including doing a lot on the
humanitarian assistance side of things, and, finally, has facilitated a
lot of what we have been able to do in terms of our own military
deployments of an additional number of troops that are heading out to
Germany as part of our “assure and deter mission,” as well as enabling
us to get a striker squadron of 1,000 service members very quickly to
Romania, because they were already based in the theater in Europe, and
specifically in Germany.  
   
And so, I really think, across the board, Germany continues to be an
important member of the transatlantic Alliance, with all of us working
together to address different parts of the same problem.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks.  I guess I would ask to see if you could expand on that
a little bit.  And, you know, we’re seeing more public and more strident
pronouncements of the — of a looming invasion — some of the stuff in the
last day or so.  And I’m wondering: Do you expect that you’ll share —
the meeting will share intelligence to kind of help Germany see, maybe,
closer to the view of the U.S. of the dangers?  And do you, kind of, see
— I know that there’s consensus on some level but not on others, do you
— are you sensing a coalescing a little bit more of the views between
the U.S. and the German government?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  So, I absolutely think that
our countries are unified in terms of awareness of the risk of further
Russian aggression to Ukraine.   
   
We have been, for a long time, sharing intelligence with Germany, with
the rest of our Allies.  We are engaged in very regular conversations —
both by the White House, the State Department, our embassy in Berlin,
our other agencies — on the situation.  And I think there is absolutely
— absolute agreement that if there is further Russian aggression that
there’s a number of things that need to be done — in terms of deployment
of additional troops to the eastern flank, and to the imposition of a
large package of economic sanctions.  
   
And Germany has been completely on board with the statements that have
come out of the European Council meeting, the European Foreign Affairs
Council on this.  There was a statement that came out by G7 Foreign
Ministers a number of weeks ago, and NATO has spoken to this as well.  
   
So, I’m absolutely confident that Germany shares our concerns over
Russian aggression, shares our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity.  
   
We’re continuing to work closely with them and the EU on what this
package of severe economic sanctions would look like.   
   
And equally, we are both committed to trying to make diplomacy work. 
One of the things I should have mentioned in talking about the
comparative advantage a few minutes ago is that Germany has also played
a very significant diplomatic role through its leadership, along France,
in the Normandy Format.  And those meetings have continued both at
foreign minister level and at national security advisor level by the
French and Germans in recent weeks, with more engagement expected in the
coming week.  
   
So, certainly, across the board on all of these things, I think there is
very much unity of purpose and agreement on the need to be able to
respond either diplomatically or in terms of sanctions and deterrence,
depending on which path Putin chooses.  
   
Q    Thanks so much for doing this call.  You said that if Russia
invades, you know, one way or another Nord Stream 2 won’t happen.  Are
there also conversations underway about how to block Nord Stream from
becoming operational if Russia does not invade in the next few months
and if, you know, it makes its way through the German regulatory
process?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I — you know, I’m not going to engage
in hypotheticals.  I — certainly, everybody hopes that that Russia does
not invade, and then that’s going to be a question that — that we’re
going to have to deal with.  
   
I mean, the one thing that I will point out is that there is not
currently any gas flowing through the pipeline.  And there won’t be any
gas for months, in part because of the diplomacy that the United States
has been able to do on this issue with Germany.  
   
The — Germany’s Federal Network Agency, as you know, has suspended the
certification process of Nord Stream 2.  So, the pipeline is not
currently operational and no gas is expected to flow through that
pipeline anytime soon.  
   
And as you noted, there are steps that need to be taken by the German
regulatory agency.  There’s also steps that need to be taken by the EU
regulatory agency.  So, you know, more broadly, our position remains
what it has been, which is that we’ve — we’ve always been opposed to
Nord Stream 2.  The President has made this — this clear for several
years now, which he views as a Russian geopolitical project that
undermines the energy security and national security of a significant
part of the Euro-Atlantic community.  
   
We engaged in significant diplomacy with the Germans last summer,
leading to agreement on a joint statement that sets out a number of
things that we intend to do to ensure that Russia does not use energy as
a weapon.   
   
You know, so I’ve spoken to what our position is now — if there is
Russian aggression against Ukraine — in terms of ensuring that one way
or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.   
   
If we are in the happy situation where there is not a Russian invasion
and we are able to move along the diplomatic path, we will continue to
engage in conversations with Germany and our European partners about
this issue more broadly.  
   
Q    Hi, \[senior administration official\].  Thank you so much for
doing this.  
   
I know that you’ve answered several questions on Nord Stream; I was just
hoping to try to put a finer point on it as well.  Over the summer when
Chancellor Scholz’s predecessor visited with President Biden, there was
an announcement about an agreement that the U.S. and Germany had reached
about the operationality of Nord Stream 2, and I’m wondering if that
agreement still holds up under the new administration and if you could
detail exactly what that agreement is.  
   
And second, in the statement between the U.S. and the EU a couple of
weeks ago, it said that tomorrow would also see a meeting of the U.S.-EU
Energy Council.  And I’m wondering if you could detail a little bit more
about whether that meeting is still taking place and what it is.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, that meeting on the U.S.-EU Energy
Council is being chaired by the State Department along with the EU, so I
would refer you to the State Department to be able to get more
information on that.  This is something that had been set up a number of
years ago, which provides an opportunity for the United States and the
European Union to come together at the level of Secretary of State here
in the United States, as well as the Energy Secretary, with their
counterparts on the EU side.   
   
Obviously, lots to talk about and — in general terms and with energy
issues, with our shared commitment to addressing climate change.  And in
the current context, I would expect that Ukraine is going to be a
significant part of that discussion as well.  
   
In terms of the statement, this was agreed, as you said, between the
Biden administration and the Merkel administration.  It was published on
July 21st.  And I just pulled it up on my computer here as we were
talking, and the joint statement is actually on the State Department
website, so you can take a look at that and read it in full, and it
outlines the commitments that our two governments made.   
   
This is certainly something that we continue to view as an operative
agreement that — that holds.  We are continuing to have conversations
about this agreement with the new Scholz administration, and they are
continuing to implement the agreement.  
   
There’s a number of things that are included in here in terms of, you
know, commitments that they have made to address energy security issues,
to abide by the spirit and letter of the Third Energy Package with
respect to Nord Stream 2, you know, including climate change, to setting
up a new climate and energy partnership, to German commitments to
establish and administer a Green Fund for Europe, as well as the
readiness of both of our countries to take a number of steps in response
to — I’m looking at — sorry — “…to ensure the U.S. and the EU remain
prepared, including with appropriate tools and mechanisms to respond
together to Russian aggression, malign activities, including Russian
efforts to use energy as a weapon.  Should Russia attempt to use energy
as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine, Germany
will take action at the national level and press for effective measures
at the European level, including sanctions to limit Russian export
capabilities…This commitment is designed to ensure that Russia will not
misuse any pipeline, including Nord Stream 2, to achieve aggressive
political ends by using energy as a weapon.”  
   
So, sorry for the lengthy quotation from that.  You can see the entire
document on the website.   
   
But yes, we very much still see this as an operational agreement.  We
see it as something that the Scholz administration remains bound by,
even though it was negotiated by his predecessor.  Scholz, of course,
was part of that government as Vice Chancellor.  And we continue to
discuss with the German government the implementation of the provisions,
including in this joint agreement.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you all.  Again, this is all the
time — that is all of the questions we have time for.  I appreciate you
joining the call.  
   
As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior
administration official,” and is embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern
tomorrow morning, Monday, February 7th — February 7th.  
   
Thank you, and I hope everyone has a wonderful day.
