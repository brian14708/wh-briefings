  \ Jake Sullivan, February 11,\_2022"

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:00 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.   
   
Q    Happy Friday.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Happy Friday.  So, we are joined by our National Security
Advisor, Jake Sullivan, today.  He will give a brief update and then
take some questions from all of you.  
   
And with that, I will turn it over to Jake.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Good afternoon.  Thanks, everybody, for giving me the
opportunity to be here.  I’d like to make a few comments on the
situation in Russia and Ukraine, and then I’d be happy to take your
questions.  
   
We continue to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces
arriving at the Ukrainian border.  
   
As we’ve said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin
at any time should Vladimir Putin decide to order it.  I will not
comment on the details of our intelligence information.  But I do want
to be clear: It could begin during the Olympics, despite a lot of
speculation that it would only happen after the Olympics.  
   
As we’ve said before, we are ready either way.  We are ready to continue
results-oriented diplomacy that addresses the security concerns of the
United States, Russia, and Europe consistent with our values and the
principle of reciprocity.   
   
We have continued to make that clear to Russia in close coordination
with our European allies and partners.   
   
We are also ready to respond decisively, alongside those allies and
partners, should Russia choose to take military action.  Our response
would include severe economic sanctions, with similar packages imposed
by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries. 
It would also include changes to NATO and American force posture along
the eastern flank of NATO.  And it would include continued support to
Ukraine.  
   
The President held a secure video conf- — conference today with key
allies and partners to coordinate our approach to this crisis.  The
participants were the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Poland,
Romania, the Secretary General of NATO, and the presidents of the
European Union.  
   
We have achieved a remarkable level of unity and common purpose — from
the broad strategy, down to technical details.  
   
If Russia proceeds, its long-term power and influence will be
diminished, not enhanced, by an invasion.  It will face a more
determined transatlantic community.  It will have to make more
concessions to China.  It will face massive pressure on its economy and
export controls that will erode its defense industrial base.  And it
will face a wave of condemnation from around the world.  
   
If, on the other hand, Russia truly seeks a diplomatic outcome, it
should not only say so, it should pursue that diplomatic outcome.   
   
We are prepared to do that.  We have put concrete proposals on the
table.  They are now out there for the world to see.  We’re prepared to
engage on them and to discuss the principles and parameters of European
security with our European partners and with Russia.   
   
Whatever happens next, the West is more united than it’s been in years. 
NATO has been strengthened.  The Alliance is more cohesive, more
purposeful, more dynamic than at in any time in recent memory.  
   
In terms of immediate next steps, President Biden and his team will
remain in close contact with our allies and partners to coordinate both
on the potential for diplomacy and on any response that is necessary
should Putin decide to order military action.  
   
We are continuing to reduce the size of our embassy footprint in Kyiv.  
   
And I want to take a moment to echo what both President Biden and
Secretary Blinken have already said: We encourage all American citizens
who remain in Ukraine to depart immediately.  
   
We want to be crystal-clear on this point: Any American in Ukraine
should leave as soon as possible, and in any event, in the next 24 to 48
hours.    
   
We obviously cannot predict the future.  We don’t know exactly what is
going to happen.  But the risk is now high enough and the threat is now
immediate enough that this is what prudence demands.  
   
If you stay, you are assuming risk with no guarantee that there will be
any other opportunity to leave and no prospect of a U.S. military
evacuation in the event of a Russian invasion.   
   
If a Russian attack on Ukraine proceeds, it is likely to begin with
aerial bombing and missile attacks that could, obviously, kill civilians
without regard to their nationality.  A subsequent ground invasion would
involve the onslaught of a massive force.  
   
With virtually no notice, communications to arrange a departure could be
severed and commercial transit halted.  No one would be able to count on
air or rail or road departures once military action got underway.   
   
Now, again, I’m not standing here and saying what is going to happen or
not happen.  I’m only standing here to say that the risk is now high
enough and the threat is immediate enough that prudence demands that is
the time to leave now while commercial options and commercial rail and
air service exist, while the roads are open.  
   
The President will not be putting the lives of our men and women in
uniform at risk by sending them into a warzone to rescue people who
could have left now but chose not to.  So, we are asking people to make
the responsible choice.   
   
With that, I’m happy to take your questions.   
   
Q    Jake?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  I know you don’t want to get into the intelligence,
but can you give us any sense what has changed over the past 24 or 48
hours to lead to your new level of concern?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, I would say: When I appeared on the Sunday
shows last weekend, I made the point that we were in the window, that
Russian military action could begin any day now.  And that remains
true.  It could begin any day now.  And it could occur before the
Olympics have ended.   
   
I’m not going to get into intelligence information.  But if you look at
the disposition of forces in both Belarus and in Russia — on the other
side of the Ukrainian border, from the north, from the east — the
Russians are in a position to be able to mount a major military action
in Ukraine any day now.  And for that reason, we believe that it is
important for us to communicate to our allies and partners, to the
Ukrainians, and to the American citizens who are still there.   
   
I want to be crystal-clear though: We are not saying that a decision has
been taken — a final decision has been taken by President Putin.  What
we are saying is that we have a sufficient level of concern, based on
what we are seeing on the ground and what our intelligence analysts have
picked up, that we are sending this clear message.  And it remains a
message that we have now been sending for some time.  And it is — yes,
it is an urgent message because we are in an urgent situation.  
   
Q    But just to clarify: So you now believe that Russia has all the
forces it needs to mount a full-scale invasion of Ukraine?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  What I’m saying is that Russia has all the forces it
needs to conduct a major military action.  I’m not sure exactly what you
mean by, quote, “full-scale invasion,” but Russia could choose, in very
short order, to commence a major military action against Ukraine.   
   
Yes?  
   
Q    Has NATO told the President that it will call up the NATO Response
Force of Americans who have been put on that short leash?  And is the
President prepared to send additional unilateral forces to our partners
in the border region of Ukraine?  
   
And is it your judgment and the judgment of U.S. intelligence and the
U.S. government that Putin is behaving as a rational actor in his
judgments at this point?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, on the question of the President authorizing more
unilateral U.S. forces to Europe: He’s been clear all along that he is
open to doing so as circumstances warrant.   
   
But I want to be very clear about something: These deployments of U.S.
service members to Poland, to Romania, to Germany — these are not
soldiers who are being sent to go fight Russia in Ukraine.  They are not
going to war in Ukraine.  They are not going to war with Russia. 
They’re going to defend NATO territory, consistent with our Article 5
obligation.  They are defensive deployments.  They are non-escalatory. 
They are meant to reinforce, reassure, and deter aggression against NATO
territory.  
   
In terms of the U.S. forces that have been put on heightened readiness
to be deployed in the event of a NATO decision to deploy them: The
President had the chance, as part of the discussion today, to hear from
the Secretary General.  No decisions have been taken in that regard, but
those forces standby should a decision be taken by the North Atlantic
Council to call up the NATO Response Force and a request comes in for
American forces to be a part of that.   
   
Finally, I can’t get inside the head of President Putin.  I’m not going
to speculate as to his motivations, his intentions, or, at this point,
his decisions.  All I will say is that we are ready either way.   
   
If President Putin wants to engage in diplomacy, we are prepared to
engage in diplomacy.  We would like to find a diplomatic path forward,
and we’ve sketched out the parameters and principles for that.   
   
If President Putin chooses to move forward, we will work in lockstep
with our allies and partners to respond decisively.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  It sounds like you’re saying that the assessment
previously — that Putin has not yet made a decision — still stands.  So,
I guess based on that, is it your estimate that it’s more likely that an
invasion could happen now than previously believed?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, it’s hard to assign percentage probabilities to any
of this.  We have to think about the range of scenarios that we
confront, and it’s our job to be ready for all of them.   
   
So, what I will say is that the way that he has built up his forces and
put them in place, along with the other indicators that we have
collected through intelligence, makes it clear to us that there is a
very distinct possibility that Russia will choose to act militarily, and
there is reason to believe that that could happen on a reasonably swift
timeframe.  
   
Now, we can’t pinpoint the day at this point, and we can’t pinpoint the
hour, but what we can say is that there is a credible prospect that a
Russian military action would take place even before the end of the
Olympics.  
   
Q    In the warning that you just delivered to Americans who are in
Ukraine, saying that they should get out now while they still can, do
you have a picture of how many Americans right now are in Ukraine?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I would refer you to the State Department for the
specifics on this because —  
   
Q    They said they don’t know.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  — I don’t want to do it off the top of my head.  There is
basically two categories: There are those who have registered with the
embassy and those who have not registered with the embassy.  In the
first category, obviously, they have a number, although some of those
folks have already left and didn’t deregister.  In the second category,
we don’t know because, of course, no American is obligated or
required.  
   
So, you can’t fix a perfect number.  But they’re the ones who are best
positioned to be able to explain what our current picture is of American
citizens in Ukraine.   
   
What I can do is stand before the world media and send a very clear
message to all Americans.  And to any American who’s in Ukraine right
now who needs help — needs financial help or needs logistical help to
take advantage of a commercial option to get out: Please call the U.S.
Embassy in Kyiv because we stand ready to provide that help.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  I got two quick questions.  One, are you looking at
this being some kind of attack on Kyiv, on the Donbas, on another
region?  Do you have any sense of that?   
   
And then, what is the level of confidence that the intelligence
community has in what they’re hearing about this plan, especially about
the potential for it to come before the end of the Olympics?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  When you say — I’m sorry, can you repeat the second
question?  
   
Q    Just around the confidence that the intelligence world has around
whether this will happen before the Olympics.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The intelligence community has sufficient confidence that
I can stand before you today and say what I have said, which is that
there is a distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin would order a
military action and invasion of Ukraine in this window, in this time
period, and that could include the time period before February 20th,
before the Beijing Olympics have been completed.  
   
And so, they believe that that — everything I have just said is
well-grounded in both what they are seeing on the ground and what they
are picking up through all of their various sources.   
   
Now, to your question about what type of action it would be: We’ve been
clear that it could take a range of different forms.  But I want to be
equally clear that one of those forms is a rapid assault on the city of
Kyiv.  That is a possible line of attack, course of action that the
Russian forces could choose to take.  They could also choose to move in
other parts of Ukraine as well.   
   
The last point that I would make — and I know this has been the subject
of a fair amount of back-and-forth between the administration and the
press over the course of the past week: We are firmly convinced that the
Russians, should they decide to move forward with an invasion, are
looking hard at the creation of a pretext — a false-flag operation —
something that they generate and try to blame on the Ukrainians as a
trigger for military action.   
   
And we are calling that out publicly because we do believe that if
Russia chooses to do that, they should be held to account; the world
should not believe that a false-flag operation that they conducted is a
legitimate casus belli for going into Ukraine.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Thanks, Jake.  You mentioned that you do not want to say
that Putin has made a decision.  But can — does the United States
believe that the President — pardon me, that President Putin has made a
decision?  Because PBS NewsHour just reported a little bit ago that the
United States does believe that Putin has made a decision and has also
communicated that decision to the Russian military.  Is that accurate?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The report that you just referenced, which I have not
seen yet, it does not accurately capture what the U.S. government’s view
is today.   
   
Our view is that we do not believe he has made any kind of final
decision — or we don’t know that he has made any final decision.  And we
have not communicated that to anybody.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    To follow up on that — it’s my colleague, Nick Schifrin, who’s
doing that reporting.  And he’s citing three Western and defense
officials who say the U.S. does believe that Putin has made up his mind,
has communicated that to the military, and that they’ve been shown
intelligence on that.  You’re saying that’s not true?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  What we have communicated to our Allies and partners —
all 30 Allies in NATO, plus a range of other partners — our latest
intelligence information.  And it does not include a statement that
Vladimir Putin has definitively given an order to proceed with the
invasion.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    You haven’t been shown anything from your NATO Allies either?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m sorry?  
   
Q    You haven’t been shown any evidence or briefed on intelligence that
speaks to that from NATO Allies?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We have not seen anything come to us that says a final
decision has been taken, the go order has been given.  
   
What I will say — and the reason I’m up here talking in the way I am to
American citizens, the reason we are taking the various actions we’re
taking, the reason the President convened our closest Allies and
partners from across the NATO Alliance and the European Union is because
we believe he very well may give the final go order.  That is a very
distinct possibility.  but we are not standing here before you today and
say, “The order has been given.  The invasion is on.”  
   
It may well happen.  It may well happen soon.  But we are not saying — I
think the way that you’ve just characterized it — and I have not seen
this PBS report yet, but as you’ve characterized it, that does not
capture the communication that we are making to our NATO Allies, nor
what we understand internally.  
   
Q    Jake —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  
   
Q    Given the risk that you’ve laid out, the fact that you’re not 100
percent certain that Putin has made a decision yet — we have seen other
world leaders meeting with Putin.  Has there been any more thought to
President Biden engaging with him directly?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I would expect that President Biden will engage by
telephone with President Putin, but I don’t have anything to announce
for you on that right now.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    And just — because this is getting so close now and the concern
that you’re weighing towards the American people, is there a need to
provide some underlying evidence of just what you’re seeing that shows
Americans — this is a country that went through Iraq — and concerns
about what the intelligence is showing?  Does the administration see a
need to just provide underlying intelligence?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, let me just start with a fundamental distinction
between the situation in Iraq and the situation today.   
   
In the situation in Iraq, intelligence was used and deployed from this
very podium to start a war.  We are trying to stop a war, to prevent a
war, to avert a war.  And all we can do is come here before you in good
faith and share everything that we know to the best of our ability,
while protecting sources and methods so we continue to get the access to
intelligence we need.  
   
But there’s another big difference between what happened in 2003 and
what’s happening in 2022, and that is — in that case, it was information
about intentions, about a hidden thing, stuff that couldn’t be seen. 
Today, we are talking about more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed
along the Ukrainian border, with every capacity out there in the open
for people to see.  It’s all over social media.  It’s all over your news
sites.   
   
So you can believe your own eyes that the Russians have put in place the
capabilities to conduct a massive military operation against Ukraine,
should they choose to do so.   
   
And then, finally, I would just say: If you look at the course of the
past few months, as we have said, we predict there will be a buildup of
this kind.  Our information is telling us that the Russians are likely
to move in these ways.  Thus far — in November, in December, in January
— that has borne out.  
   
So I think when you take all of that together, we put forward a credible
case.  But it’s not my job to stand up here and convince any of you of
anything.  It’s your job to ask the questions and do what you can do. 
All I can do is, based on the best information I have available — that I
can share, that the President can share, the Secretary of State can
share — put that out there in close consultation with our Allies and
partners.  That’s what we’ve done.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    At what point, Jake, would you expect the country would hear
directly from the President on this and the risk to world order of
Vladimir Putin rolling tanks or bombing a foreign capital?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, the country has heard from the President
directly on the Ukraine subject many times over the course of the past
three months, and they will continue to.  
   
So it’s not like President Biden has been silent on this question.  He
has been very vocal on it.  He has spoken to every aspect of it.  He has
read out his calls on it — with world leaders, his meetings, et cetera. 
But he will continue to speak directly to the American people as we
watch the situation unfold.  
   
Q    But no plans for any kind of address to the nation from the Oval
Office?  No kind of speech specifically about this issue with prepared
remarks?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t have anything to announce in terms of a speech or
prepared remarks at this point.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  So, you and other administration officials have
been quite transparent in describing the strategy towards Ukraine to us,
the press.  Do you believe that that strategy is actually helping to
reduce tensions?  Or do you feel that that may be part of the reason why
it’s boxing Vladimir Putin even further in airing your strategy so
publicly like this?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, only one country has amassed more than 100,000 troops
on the border of another country with all of the capabilities and
capacities to conduct an invasion.  That country is Russia; that country
is not the United States.   
   
So, the fastest way to deescalate this situation for all involved would
be for Russia to choose to deescalate its mobilization of forces.   
   
The United States is responding to the active, sustained buildup of
military pressure on Ukraine.  We are doing so in lockstep with Allies
and partners.  And at the same time, we have been extremely
forward-leaning in our willingness to engage in diplomacy to address the
mutual concerns of Russia, the Europeans, and the United States when it
comes to European security.  
   
Yeah?  
   
Q    Thank you so much, Jake.  Two questions for you.  Next week, the
Vice President is going to Germany for the Munich Security Conference. 
Why isn’t President Biden going?  Wouldn’t it be a good time to engage
with his allies in person?  Is he doing enough to avoid a war?   
   
And the second question: Next week, the Brazilian president is going to
Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin.  How does the White House see this
visit and the timing of this visit?  And do you guys expect anything
from the Brazilian president during his meeting?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  If you simply looked at a catalog of the engagements the
President has had with his allies and partners, including the engagement
he had today, that catalog alone would be a rebuttal to the proposition
that he’s not doing enough to rally the West and to offer Russia a
credible diplomatic path out of this.  That’s included phone calls. 
It’s included meetings.  It’s included video conferences.  It’s included
just countless sustained effort over the course of months, and we will
continue with that.   
   
And we’re also very proud to have the Vice President representing the
American delegation at the Munich Security Conference.  
   
Q    But what about the question about the Brazilian president meeting
with Vladimir Putin next week?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The Brazilian president is obviously, you know, free to
conduct his own diplomacy with other countries, including with Russia,
and I really don’t have anything else to add on it today.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  You mentioned the possibility of an assault on Kyiv,
specifically.  What is your sense, if Putin does decide to invade
Ukraine: Is he looking to invade and take over the entire country or a
part, like Crimea in 2014?  
   
And just one follow-up as well.  How do you explain the disconnect
between the rhetoric that we’re hearing — or the warnings we’re hearing
from you and other Western countries and what seems to be a playing down
of the risk from Ukraine itself?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I won’t speak to the decisions that the Ukrainian
leadership is making in terms of how they’re communicating on this
issue.  I will only say that we are coordinating extremely closely with
them.  President Biden has spoken multiple times with President
Zelenskyy.  I speak nearly every day with senior aides to President
Zelenskyy.  Secretary Blinken is deeply engaged with both his
counterpart and the President in Kyiv.  
   
So we will continue that level of coordination, sharing of information
across every dimension of our government.  But I can’t characterize why
it is that they’re choosing their course.   
   
I can only say that, based on the information we have, we’ve chosen to
be as transparent as possible with what we see as a significant risk of
military action in Ukraine.   
   
And as to your other question, I can’t obviously predict what the exact
shape or scope of the military action will be.  As I said before, it
could take a variety of forms.  It could be more limited.  It could be
more expansive.  But there are very real possibilities that it will
involve the seizure of a significant amount of territory in Ukraine and
the seizure of major cities, including the capital city.   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m going to let Aamer go.   
   
Q    The President’s departure is at 2:25.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    And so, if people want to leave, they need to leave now?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  If people want to leave, they should leave now.  We’ll
proceed, but —  
   
Q    Jake is not one of those people.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Jake, you’re good.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  People that are going to the departure for the President,
you should depart now.  But Jake will —  
   
Q    Jake, real quick.  Do you think that — do you —  
   
Q    Jake?  Jake?  Thank you.  
   
Q    — do think that Russia —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Sorry, I’m just going to give people a moment to, I
guess, if they have to.   
   
Q    Yeah, the pool has to depart.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Okay.  Yeah, all right.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  I’ll wait until people get out.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Okay.   
   
(Members of the press depart the briefing room.)  
   
Q    Thank you for taking my question.  Did the U.S. wait too long to
arm Ukraine, especially with respect to weapons that could defend
against an airstrike like you laid out?  Did they wait too long to move
U.S. forces to NATO countries?  And does the President still view the
idea of pre-invasion sanctions as a stupid question?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, as to the question of waiting too long on arming the
Ukrainians: Over the course of the past year, the United States has
provided more than half a billion dollars — $650 million — in defensive
assistance to Ukraine.  That’s more than has ever been given by any
President in any year at any time.  And that began more than a year ago
under the presidency of Joe Biden.   
   
Second, we have made good on the commitment to get those deliveries into
the hands of the Ukrainian armed forces.  Those are defensive weapons
intended to defend Ukraine against aggression.  They are not meant for
offensive purposes against any country.   
   
So we feel very proud of the contribution and commitment that we have
had to helping the Ukrainians be able to defend themselves.  
   
With respect to the question of the deployment of forces to defend NATO
territory: Our view is that, in addition to the 80,000 strong U.S. force
presence in Europe today, that — showing in Poland and Romania, in
particular, but also through the deployment of air squadrons to the
Baltics, as we had a few days ago, and other significant moves we’ve
made — a carrier in the Mediterranean that, for the first time in 30
years, actually flew the NATO flag as well as the American flag — that
we have been forward-leaning and robust in defending and reassuring our
NATO Allies.   
   
And you don’t have to take it from me.  You can talk to the President of
Poland or the President of Romania about the satisfaction they have with
the fact that the United States has stepped up alongside other NATO
Allies to deter and reassure and reinforce our presence along the
eastern flank.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    What about the pre-invasion sanctions?  You didn’t answer that part
of my question.  Is the President looking at sanctions ahead of an
invasion any differently than he has been up until this point, given the
escalation that we’re seeing from Russia?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The President believes that sanctions are intended to
deter.  And in order for them to work — to deter, they have to be set up
in a way where if Putin moves, then the costs are imposed.  We believe
that that is the right logic, both on its own merits, but equally
importantly, we believe that the most important fundamental for anything
that unfolds in this crisis, whether through diplomacy or as a result of
military action, is that the West be strong, be united, and be
determined to operate with common purpose.   
   
And he believes that the sanctions approach he’s taken in lockstep with
our European partners, the Canadians, and others puts us in a position
for the West to be able to respond to this contingency in the most
united and purposeful way possible.  That will pay dividends for us in
this circumstance, but it will also pay enormous strategic dividends for
the United States in the years and decades ahead.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  Our understanding is that there was a sudden meeting
last night in the Situation Room to talk about Russia.  And now you and
Secretary Blinken are obviously using sharper rhetoric about the timing
of the invasion.  I know you don’t want to get into specific
intelligence, but is there something that prompted the meeting last
night and that has changed the administration’s assessment overnight?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So I’m not going to speak to internal deliberations, and
I’m not going to get into the specifics of intelligence information.   
   
What I am going to say is that for some time now, including out of my
own very mouth, we have been talking about how we had entered the window
where any day now a military action could be taken.  That was the
formula I was using several days ago.   
   
Now, as we gain more information, our view that military action could
occur any day now and could occur before the end of the Olympics is only
growing in terms of its robustness — so that I can stand here and say
that is a very, very distinct possibility.   
   
But I just want to say two things.  First, we can’t predict the exact
determination that Putin would make if and when he makes a
determination.  So all we can say is that the strong possibility of
action, the distinct possibility of action in a relatively near-term
timeframe — including along the timeframe that I’ve laid out, that
Secretary Blinken talked about — that is backed up by our view of what’s
happening on the ground, and it’s backed up by information that we
continue to acquire day by day, including over the course of the past
few days.  
   
All right, yes.  Yes.  
   
Q    Do you believe that —  
   
Q    Jake, why would — why would — can you delve into a little bit more:
Why would Russia risk provoking China with an action during the
Olympics?  And secondly, can you just speak more broadly to the
China-Russia — what looks like an emerging alliance here on certain
issues?  And how much does that concern you?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So I’d say three things about this.  First, you know,
Russia’s calculus vis-à-vis China — whether they’re going to make
Beijing upset or not — you know, that’s kind of between Russia and
China.  And Putin will obviously have to decide what he wants to do on
that front.   
   
China also has its own decisions to make.  And to the extent that they
are giving a wink and a nod or a green light to a Russian invasion of
Ukraine for no justified reason — I believe that China will ultimately
come to suffer consequences as a result of that in the eyes of the rest
of the world, most notably in the eyes of our European partners and
allies.   
   
And then, finally, I would just say that we do not believe that China
can compensate Russia for the economic losses that would be sustained in
the event of an invasion, due to sanctions and export controls and the
like.   
   
Just one more thing on the broader issue of China and Russia, because
there was quite a bit of hype about the statement that they put out. 
And it was a notable statement that we have taken careful — a careful
look at.  
   
I’ve said this before, I want to say it again — and then I’ll leave
because Jen is now standing up, and I think it’s — (laughter) — it’s
well past my time to go: The United States, under the Biden
administration, has confidence in us and in the West.  We are 50
percent-plus of global GDP.  China and Russia are less than 20 percent. 
We have innovation.  We have entrepreneurship.  We have freedom.   
   
And when you put all of that together, the tools and capacities that we
can bring to bear — now that we are more united, more purposeful, more
dynamic than we have been in a very long time — we are well situated to
be able to deal with any threat or challenge that would be posed to us
by any autocracy in the world, including the two that you just
mentioned.  So let me just leave it at that.  
   
Thank you, guys.  
   
Q    You don’t think China can bail them out from sanctions, right,
Jake?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  To be clear, you can come as long as you want.  (Laughter.) 
I just don’t want to get in trouble with your team when we ask you to
come back the next time.  
   
Q    Can we get a read on the pool situation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  I apologize for the confusion.  So he’s — the
President is still in a meeting.  Karine here is going to monitor when
he gets out of the meeting, when you all need to depart.  Aamer or
others, if you want to come back.  Sorry, we did not want you to miss
the President’s departure, but we had a little miscommunication
internally.   
   
Q    This is for the chopper?  I just want to make sure.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We — yes.  And he is still meeting, so it will not leave
without him.  We have been assured of that.   
   
Okay, I don’t have anything at the top.  I know you’ve covered a lot of
topics, but I know there’s a lot going on in the world, so why don’t we
go to whatever else — or that — that you’d like to discuss.  
   
Q    Well, on that — if you could just stay on that — what should we
expect this weekend?  Things have obviously escalated or moved forward. 
Is the President going to be talking to European leaders?  What should
we expect this weekend as this moves forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, as you know, the President just spoke with a
number of his European counterparts, as well as Prime Minister Trudeau. 
I believe we put out — did we put out — have you seen a readout yet of
our — of his call with Prime Minister Trudeau?  If not, I will give it
to you right now.  Have you seen it yet in your inbox?  
   
Q    I don’t think.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, this is what happens when you don’t bring your phone
out here.  (Laughter.)   
   
So here you go: Today — Prime Minister Trudeau was obviously a part of
the planned meeting as well.  He also had a separate meeting with him
where he — they discussed the ongoing blockade of key bridges and
crossings between the United States and Canada, including
Detroit/Windsor, Sweetwater/Coutts, and Pembina/Emerson.  
   
The two leaders agreed that the actions of the individuals who are
obstructing travel and commerce between our two countries are having
significant direct impacts on citizens’ lives and livelihoods.   
   
The President expressed his concern that the United States — that United
States companies and workers are experiencing serious effects, including
slowdowns in production, shortened work hours, and plant closures.  The
Prime Minister promised quick action in enforcing the law.  And the
President thanked him for the steps he and other Canadian authorities
are taking to restore the open passage of bridges to the United
States.   
   
In turn, the Prime Minister also thanked the President and his
administration, the Governor of Michigan, and U.S. officials for all of
the assistance that we have provided to resolve the disruption.  And the
two leaders agreed to stay in close touch.  
   
In terms of this weekend — I just wanted you to have that component;
another important thing happening right now.  In terms of this weekend,
as you know, the President will be in Camp — at Camp David, which is
fully equipped to have engagements of all sorts, includings with his —
including with his national security team or European counterparts.   
   
We are making these decisions about who he’ll engage with on a
day-by-day basis.  We will keep you all abreast of that as we have done
to date.  But he is — he’ll be at Camp David, and I would expect that
he’ll be engaged closely with his teams here, as well as his foreign
counterparts.  
   
Q    And on Supreme Court.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    When will President Biden meet with Senate Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee?  And also, just a point of clarification —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — from the interview with Lester Holt.  About — I believe he said
“about four people” that he’s doing the deep dive on.  Three and a half,
four and a half?  (Laughter.)  Where —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There’s no three and a half people, Aamer.  
   
Q    If you could just offer — are we down to four finalists?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to build on what the President said.  It
is natural that as this process has proceeded, that the list would
become smaller.  That’s a natural part of the process.   
   
But again, as he said many times, he is looking at a range of qualified
individuals, strong legal minds, individuals with strong credentials who
have strong character and a dedication to the rule of law.   
   
But in terms of the specific numbers: I understand your question.  It’s
natural to be growing smaller.  But I don’t have any — anything to build
on to what he said.  
   
Q    And as far as Senate Republicans?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He will continue to consult closely with Democrats and
Republicans.  That will continue into next week.  But I don’t have
anything to preview for you at this point in time.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  The diplomats that are being moved out of the U.S.
embassy in Ukraine, where are they going?  Are they going to other
countries?  Are they being taken to safer locations within Ukraine? 
What can you tell us?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question.  I’d really refer you to the State
Department.  Typically, when we reduce a presence at an embassy, that
means they depart the country, but I can certainly check with them and
get you more details on that.  Typically, it means they would return to
a home base.   
   
Q    And then, what’s the administration’s current assessment of Putin’s
strategy in the Black Sea?  Is it to cut off Ukraine’s naval access?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  In terms of the exercises?   
   
Q    Mm-hm.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I mean, our assessment is that this is a part of ongoing
escalatory actions, whether it’s military exercises or the buildup of
more troops that we have seen at the border.  
   
In terms of what it means and what he’s preparing for, I would point you
to what our National Security Advisor just said, which is that, you
know, we continue to watch closely, to assess.  Our role here is to
prepare for a range of — a range of steps he might take.  But beyond
that, I don’t have any prediction of what that means.   
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Has the U.S. shared the latest intelligence with
Ukraine?  And do — does the U.S. feel that the Ukrainian government is
properly preparing its citizens for the possibility of a war?  Because
it seems like they keep downplaying it.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to speak for how the Ukrainian
officials, leaders speak or engage with their citizens.  But we do
engage very closely with them — sharing of information — as we do with
our European counterparts.  And that has been the case at every point in
this process.  
   
Q    And is the State Department doing anything right now to help
Americans get out of Ukraine, or just warning them to get out on their
own?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we have been warning for several weeks now, if not
longer, that American citizens should depart.  And I think you heard our
National Security Advisor give a pretty stark warning of what would
happen — on purpose — what would happen if Russia were to invade, and
the difficulty of not just being in the middle of a military zone, but
also the difficulty of departing or getting out, and the fact that
departure — means of departure could be cut off.  And that was, we feel,
important for American citizens in Ukraine to understand.  
   
We have been conveying that if American citizens don’t have the means to
depart, that we would provide assistance for those purposes.  That has
been the case for several weeks now.  
   
Q    If we don’t know if Putin has made up his mind, why are we hearing
this warning from Jake Sullivan that Americans should get out, ideally
within the next 24 to 48 hours specifically?  I don’t believe we’ve
heard that window from him before.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Because I — we recognize that if President Putin were to
decide to invade, that this would make it a very difficult circumstance
on the ground for American citizens.  We don’t have an assessment, as he
— as you heard him say, of him making that decision.  But he could make
that decision at any point.  And we want to be very clear and direct
with American citizens about the risk that that would pose to them, that
the risk — the risks that would be posed to any civilian if they remain
in the country.   
   
Q    And this is now the second evacuation of Americans in the course of
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s not actually an “evacuation.”  To be clear, American
citizens can depart Ukraine.  There are means of departing Ukraine. 
This is not a country where we are at war, where we have tens of
thousands of troops who have fou- — been fighting a war for 20 years. 
So, it’s incredibly different.  
   
Q    Correct.  You are correct in that.  But you’re — it’s the second
time we’ve urged American citizens to get out of a country.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Actually, we’ve urged American citizens to depart a number
of times.  And that is —  
   
Q    Well, I’m referring to Afghanistan —    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think this —  
   
Q    — because the question is —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — but let — let me finish here, because I think it’s
important for people to understand: We urged American citizens to depart
Kazakhstan.  We urged American citizens to depart Ethiopia.  This is a
responsibility that the State Department and our diplomat — diplomats
who are serving there and serving around the world take on to keep
American citizens safe.   
   
And it may — it may not be front and center on the news in the United
States, but those are conflict areas and zones where we are constantly
monitoring.   
   
Q    But these are the two major events that have happened under this
administration.  And what does the —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say the —  
   
Q    — what do you guys say —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — people in Ethiopia would differ with that, as would the
people in Kazakhstan or other parts of the world where there has been —
they have been under dangerous circumstances and they look to the United
States to provide up-to-date information of their safety and security in
the country.  
   
Q    The President has frequently talked about getting out of
Afghanistan as a major event.  It has impacted his polling.  This isn’t
a current event that is underway.  The question is: What does the
administration say to critics who are looking at these two events and
questioning his administration’s foreign policy approach?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Who is questioning us?  Give me names.  
   
Q    Plenty of Republicans.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Like who?  
   
Q    I could name off any number of Republicans.  I think that —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d love to know a name.   
   
Q    Goodness.  Mitch McConnell.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Well, here’s what I would say to Mr. McConnell: The
President ended a 20-year war in Afghanistan — a war that had cost us
thousands of American lives, billions — trillions of dollars, and was a
failed enterprise after 20 years.  He was the first President to do that
after many of his predecessors failed to take exactly that step.  We
knew it would be complicated.  We knew it would be challenging.  He had
the courage to get our troops out of there and end a 20-year war.   
   
This is entirely different because we are not ending a 20-year war.  We
are trying to prevent war here.  We are trying to keep American citizens
safe in Ukraine by encouraging them to depart, by providing them
information about what the security circumstances are on the ground.   
   
And I think it’s important for the American public to understand the
significant differences between these different scenarios.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Back to the Supreme Court for a moment.  Can you rule out that the
President would be meeting with any of his candidates this weekend at
Camp David?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Here’s what I can tell you: There’s not plans for that.  But
I can tell you that it could be as early as next week.  I would not echo
reporting that it is definitely next week.   
   
Q    Given the heightened state of concern about Russia and Ukraine,
does that at all affect the timetable for the President on his Supreme
Court pick, simply because of the time and attention he would need to
devote to that?    
   
And because Senate Democrats were very upfront saying they were
encouraging the President to move quickly, do you sense that there is an
increase in the tempo for the President to move on his selection
process?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We remain on track for the President to make a decision and
an announcement on who he’s going to nominate to the Supreme Court this
month — in the next few weeks.  That was his intention from the
beginning, remains his intention now.  And he will continue to read a
range of cases, study the materials about a range of candidates.  That
has not been changed by whatever decision President Putin makes.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, in the NBC interview, the President said he rejected the
findings of the after-action report about the State Department and the
military response to Afghanistan.  Does that mean the President has
ruled out any action that might be viewed or read as accountability?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Steve, I think it’s important for people to understand
there was no “after-action report.”  The Washington Post report was not
an after-action report; it was based on a range of FOIA documents —
which is their right to do — based on individual interviews of members
of the military, including many who were not a part of policymaking
decisions in the Situation Room — some were, many were not.  But that is
not an after-action report.   
   
There was also a report from CENTCOM on the attack at Abbey Gate, on
Friday, which the President certainly stands by.  And that was important
work — vital work, a formal report and review that was done
internally.   
   
So, I just want to separate the two for people’s understanding.  
   
What the President was rejecting is the notion that there weren’t a
range of preparations done in advance over the course of last spring and
last summer.   
   
And it’s important to remember that we made the decision — he made the
decision to end a 20-year war.  He came into office without any plan —
well, there was a — there was a deadline, but without any plan for
departure or for helping the — the Afghans who had served by our side
for 20 years.  We put in place — and this is in the same documents —
beginning last spring, a plan — a range of contingency plans should we
need to bring American citizens out or bring Afghans out.   
   
We put in place — we positioned military troops on the ground, working
with Department of Defense, back in early summer, to ensure that we
could execute on that plan.   
   
And in every single meeting last August, the President asked the team
and often ended the meeting with this: “Is there anything you need to
implement what your plans are?  Is there anything you need on the
ground?”  He always ended with that.   
   
I’d also note that he always raised the question of whether we needed to
evacuate our embassy and people — our Americans who were serving in our
embassy there.  That decision was always posed to the group at the
table.  That decision was not made until August 12th.   
   
So, reporting that suggests otherwise is incorrect.  That is the — that
is the state of play that happened last summer.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    A question on inflation, since this is the first time we’ve —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — had a briefing since those numbers came out.  The President has
said the administration is going to continue to be all on deck to try
and bring prices back down.  Can you give us a sense of what that really
looks like?  Because, you know, you’ve pointed many times to parts of
the Build Back Better agenda.  That remains stalled.  In fact, one of
Senator Manchin’s big objections to the bill was the high rate of
inflation.  So, if the Build Back Better plan sort of remains at this
impasse, what’s plan B to try and bring down some of these costs?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there’s a couple steps that the President is very
focused on as it relates to addressing inflation.  One, I would note
that economists and the Federal Reserve still predict that inflation
will come down — will moderate over the course of the year. 

And the President has also said that he supports the steps that the
Federal Reserve — an independent body — has announced about
recalibrating over the course of the coming months.  And he’s obviously
nominated a number of individuals to fill the board, which is an
essential part of addressing this. 

But I would also note: Beyond that, how the President really looks at
this is how you’re addressing core costs for the American people. 

So, you referenced the Build Back Better plan.  First, we believe
there’s a path forward, and the President is going to continue to fight
for it.  Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone to Virginia earlier this week
and talked about negotiating the price of prescription drugs. 

So, his view is that in order to address costs that have been affecting
inflation but also affecting families for many decades — the cost of
prescription drugs, the cost of child care — we need to move that
forward. 

But it’s not just that.  We also need to address supply chains in the
short term at the ports, rebuild our manufacturing infrastructure, make
sure that we are implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and
continuing to press for the competitiveness legislation that will help
ensure we have funding for chips for manufacturing of cars here in the
United States. 

And you’ve also heard him talk a fair amount about promoting
competition.  And that addresses issues — like we’ve seen price
increases in the meat industry and others.  And that will help bring
down costs for Americans. 

So, there is certainly a significant, an important, a vital role that
the Federal Reserve plays.  They are independent.  He wants that board
to be completely filled. 

But there are a number of other steps we are working to take to lower
costs for the American people.  
   
Q    And just one follow-up on the question about the embassy in Kyiv. 

MS. PSAKI:  Yeah. 

Q    You said that you’re continuing to reduce the size of the embassy. 
To be clear, you’re not talking about closing the embassy just yet, so
what size are we talking about?  How much of a reduction here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would really — I can check with the State Department. 
It’s a good question.  But they really have purview over those numbers. 
And that’s where we are in the process at this point in time. 

Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, what does the White House make of the reporting that former
President Trump is still in touch with Kim Jong Un?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, former President Trump is not the President.  And we —
President Biden is the President, and he is the one who conducts
diplomacy on behalf of the United States.  
   
Q    And on one other topic: I see that the President spoke with the
Prime Minister Trudeau —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    — about the blockade.  What is the White House doing to help, sort
of, alleviate that — the trade issues that he raised in that call?   
   
And more broadly, is the White House or is the government preparing for
any kind of similar types of demonstrations here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, so two different questions. 

Q    Yes.

MS. PSAKI:  So let me try to answer them both.  So, we’ve continued —
obviously, the President speaking with Prime Minister Trudeau about this
is part of our effort.  But our team — Liz Sherwood — Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall, other members of our administration have been in close
touch with their Canadian counterparts over the last few days about how
to address this blockade and the challenge it is posing to the supply
chain. 

I mean, fundamentally, how we view this is that the impact of these
protests, while we certainly believe in peaceful protest, is impacting —
has the potential to impact — and this is why we are very focused on
this — communities; workers being able to travel back and forth across
the bridge who are going to work, who may work on different sides of the
border; the ability to get food on the table to American families, to
get auto parts to manufacturers who are trying to make vehicles. 

So, this is — whatever their intended, stated purpose is, this effort is
going to have — has the potential to have a huge impact on workers and
the American public. 

But to go back to your question: We are in very close contact with
Canadian officials.  We’ve also taken steps to help detour routes so
that a number of these trucks can move in different routes and be able
to cross the border. 

So, for example, while the Windsor-Detroit Ambassador Bridge continues
to remain closed, Port Huron is fully operational.  Customs and Border
Patrol is rerouting traffic to Port Huron where all nine commercial
lanes are open.  The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel is open, which is a way that
individuals who are trying to work on different sides of the border are
able to travel as well.

And Secretary Mayorkas has also spoken with local officials in affected
and potentially affected states, as has — Secretary Buttigieg has been
deeply involved with this as well. 

On your second question: You know, we are, of course — on reports of a
similar “Freedom Convoy” — I think you’re asking about, right? — in D.C.
— event in D.C. in early March, the Department of Homeland Security,
obviously, put out a statement on this the other night.  They’re aware
of these reports.  They’re taking all necessary steps to ensure that the
convoy does not disrupt lawful trade and transportation or interfere
with federal government and law enforcement operations.

On reports that this convoy is causing disruptions at the Super Bowl,
the Department of Homeland Security — or  
could, I should say — the Department of Homeland Security is surging
additional staff to its incident command post.  There’s strong
cooperation with the California Highway Patrol, the Los Angeles Police
Department, and state and local authorities. 

And the Department already has a lead field coordinator and emergency
operations center in place, as would be standard protocol, given this is
a large event — the Super Bowl.  And they will build on that.  There’s
already 500 DHS personnel providing extensive air and maritime security
resources. 

So, we are in both close touch with our Canadian counterparts, also with
local officials through our Department of Homeland Security.  Our
Secretary of Transportation is also deeply involved in this.  And we’re
working to address this on all fronts.  
   
Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Jen.  Just to follow up on Jeff’s question — is it still
accurate to say that the Biden administration has not heard back from
the North Koreans, despite the outreach?

MS. PSAKI:  Correct. 

Q    Okay.  And on the conversation that President Biden is expected to
have with President Putin, is that happening today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to predict in terms of the timing. 

Okay.  And I think we have to wrap it up.  You want to do the last one,
quick?  
   
Q    Yeah, Jen.  Real quick.  Well, can I ask you on two things, first
of all?

MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.

Q    First of all, following up on what you said earlier, confirming
that interviews with Supreme Court candidates could begin as early as
next week, does he have in mind how many he wants to interview?  Is it
just a few?  You know, is there a number that he has in mind?  And how
long do you expect that process — the interview meeting process to go?
 Just next week or further?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what I can tell you is that the interview process for
any president typically happens very late in the process.  And in terms
of a specific number, I’m just not going to get into that level of
detail.  
   
Q    And then one more question — I’m asking for a colleague — regarding
his position on the bankruptcy law for student loan debt.  President
Biden voted repeatedly as a senator to make it harder for student loan
borrowers to erase their debts through bankruptcy, like other secured
debts, such as credit cards.   
   
Two years ago, as a presidential campaign \[sic\], he campaigned on
overhauling the bankruptcy law to ease student debt, in addition to his
pledge to forgive $10,000 per student in federal student loans.  Why
hasn’t he acted, to this point, on the bankruptcy law, in addition to
the pledge on debt forgiveness?

MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to check on the status of that legislation.  I
don’t know where it is in the process.  But what I could reiterate for
you is that the President has forgiven $15 billion in student loans,
benefiting more than 675,000 student loan borrowers since he took
office.   
   
No one has been required to pay a single dime in federal student loans,
and he extended the hiatus of payment until May to give people some
extra breathing room.  I’ll check and see the status of that.

Thanks, everybody.

Q    Pfizer pulling the application for the authorization for the
vaccines for under five.  Is there a White House reaction to that?

MS. PSAKI:  I know they’re going to do a briefing — the FDA is.  So, I
will leave it to them to speak to their data.

Thanks, everyone.
