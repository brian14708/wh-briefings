James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:50 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Happy Friday.  Okay, a
couple things at the top.  
   
So, yesterday, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
a non-profit organization representing more than 60,000 physicians,
sounded the alarm about a nationwide abortion ban proposed by Republican
officials that would put doctors in jail for providing women with
essential healthcare.  
   
Under Senator Graham’s ban, doctors and providers could be criminalized
and sent to jail for performing an abortion to save a woman’s health,
providing an abortion to a woman carrying a fetus with little to no
chance of survival, offering critical care in the event of a
miscarriage, or even treating a rape or incest survivor who has not
compiled — complied with medically unnecessary delays or reporting
requirements.  
   
The ACOG found that bills like Senator Graham’s have no basis in
science, that doctors would become less skilled if such a ban was in
effect, and it would interfere with patients’ ability to get timely and
critical medical care.  
   
Now, separately, Jen Klein, the Director of White House Gender Policy,
released a memo discussing how, if passed and enacted, this bill would
create a nationwide health crisis, threatening the health and lives of
women in all 50 states.  
   
I said it before and I’ll keep saying it again: This extreme national
ban and plan to criminalize doctors is wildly out of step with the
American people, and President Biden and Vice President Harris will
continue to do everything in their power to protect women’s reproductive
rights and expand access to healthcare.  
   
Today, the White House hosted a Recovery Month Summit and announced over
$1.5 billion in funding to beat the opioid crisis and support people in
recovery across the United States.  This funding will go to lifesaving
programs and policies like expanding access to medic- — to
medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder; to dispute
\[sic\] — to distribute naloxone to prevent overdoses; and programs to
prevent substance use in our communities.  
   
President Biden recognizes the devastating impact the overdose epidemic
has had on our nation, reaching large cities, small towns, Tribal lands,
and every community in between.  
   
That’s why, in his first State of the Union, he made beating the opioid
crisis a key pillar of his Unity Agenda.  Our major pillars of work to
combat — other major pillars of work to combat this crisis include the
Treasury Department’s efforts to sanction traffickers and disrupt the
global trade — drug trade — and expanded access to programs and
treatments for people in need.  
   
To support these and other efforts, President Biden’s fiscal year 2023
budget request calls for a historic investment of $42.5 billion for
national drug control agencies.  
   
Tonight, as you all know, we will be welcoming Sir Elton John.  The
President and the First Lady, they look forward to hosting him at the
White House for a spectacular performance on the South Lawn.  
   
The President and the First Lady will celebrate the vast contributions
Sir Elton has made across his lifetime as an artist and an advocate. 
And they are particularly thrilled to welcome to the White House an
audience of around 2,000 fans and compri- — comprised of teachers and
nurses, frontline workers, mental health advocates, students, LGBTQ+
advocates, and so many others.  
   
Tonight’s performance has been organized and — in collaboration with,
and is paid for by, the A&E and History channels — network channels, and
will air on television at a later date.  
   
Now, this is a — I think I can speak for the entire press team.  This is
a very sad day for the press team.  It is finally happening: We are
losing today — but not really losing — but Chris is leaving us today. 
Today is his last day at the White House as part of the press team.  And
we are also sad, as I said, to see him go.   
   
But we are also thrilled that he is staying in the Biden family and will
be starting as the Assistant to the Secretary of Public Affairs at the
Department of Defense in the coming days.  As you know, that is a very
big job that Chris is about to take on.  
   
So we will — we will miss Chris’s good humor, his sharp political
instincts, and his just easy- — easygoing demeanor.  He’s one of the
most chillest, coolest cats that I know around town.  
   
Chris has been a leader on our team.  We wouldn’t have made it through
these — this past year or so without — without Chris by our side and
helping to lead the team, as I mentioned, from our earliest days here in
— in the White House.  
   
And we know that all of you in this room will miss him as well.  You’ve
worked very closely with him.  Chris has gaggled on Air Force One;
spoken to all of you from this very podium, as you know — it has
happened a couple of times for him — to have done that; and dealt with
hundreds, if not thousands, of important stories incoming from all of
you here at the White House.  
   
Chris, we are so proud of you.  We will miss you dearly.  As — as I know
— this is an inside joke — it is — we will see you later, pal.   
   
And so, until we see you again, we hope you have some time to do your
very, very favorite thing that I know that you love to do, outside of
hanging out with your wife, is play golf.  Chris loves to play golf.  I
always ask him to tell me — to take me to play golf, and he still has
not done that.  
(Laughter.)  
   
But anyway, to help send you off to your next adventure, I know you’re
going to take some time off — you told me that you’re going to hit the
links; I don’t know what the lingo is here.  But we wanted to make sure
that we got you something.  
   
(Ms. Jean-Pierre presents Mr. Meagher with a gift.)  
   
MR. MEAGHER:  Thank you, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Thank you, thank you.   
   
All right, with that, it’s all yours, Zeke.  I know you’re waiting.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you for indulging us on that.  
   
Q    If we could start with the Ukraine — the so-called “referenda”
taking place in Russian-occupied areas there.  Is the administration
considering any additional costs to be imposed on Russia or those who
are involved in organizing those referenda — new sanctions or other
sorts of responses?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things I do want to lean into as the
votes are happening today — you know, clearly over the next five days.  
   
We are prepared to impose additional swift and severe economic costs on
Russia, along with our allies and partners, in response to these actions
if they move forward with annexation.  
   
As we said in today’s G7 Leaders’ Statement, the United States will
never recognize this territory or — as anything other than part of
Ukraine, because it belongs to the people of Ukraine.  We stand with our
partners around the world in rejecting whatever fabricated outcomes
Russia announces.   
   
As the President spoke about at the U.N., as you heard from him very
clearly, very boldly, these referendums are a flagrant violation of
international law and an affront to the principles of sovereignty and
territorial integrity that underpin the international system and are the
foundation of the United Nations Charter.  
   
We will continue to stand firmly with the people of Ukraine and continue
to provide them with historic amounts of security assistance to help
them defend their territory, to help them defend their freedom.  
   
Q    And then, on a different topic there as well: these dramatic scenes
of Russian fighting-age males who are subject to those conscription
orders leaving the country.  Would the President’s support providing
political asylum to Russians who are fleeing their country to avoid
serving in the armed forces in Ukraine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I don’t have anything to preview for you, as it
relates to your question, Zeke, about what we would  
offer.  
   
But, you know, we’ll say this: What we’re seeing — what we’re seeing in
Russia, especially with the protests, and what we’re seeing with
Russians leaving their country is that this is an unpopular war.  We
have to remember this is an unpopular war that was started by the
Kremlin — a brutal war that was started by the Kremlin, an unprovoked
war against Ukraine.   
   
That is why you have heard from this President — he’s been very clear,
especially during his U.N. — most recently during his U.N. address —
that we will continue, with our allies and partners, to offer the
assistance that Ukraine needs to fight against the aggression of
Russia.  
   
So, again, what you’re seeing is — is not — what Russia is doing, what
Putin is doing — he’s not coming from a place of strength.  He is coming
from a place of weakness.  And now the Russian people are being very
loud and clear.  This is, again, an unpopular war.  
   
Q    And just domestically: It’s been several days now; the power is
still out in parts of Puerto Rico.  Does the President plan to visit? 
Can you update us?  And does he have any plan to go there?  
   
And then, separately, there’s another storm that appears to be bearing
down for parts of Florida next week.  Will that affect the President’s
travel plans for Tuesday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, your last question first.  We are monitoring the
forecast in close coordination with the National Hurricane Center and
also with FEMA.  As always, FEMA has supplies staged at various
distribution centers across the country to deploy as needed.  So, this
is the case here as well.   
   
As you remember, the President was also briefed at the start of the
hurricane season — some of your — some of your colleagues were there —
on preparedness effort and what — how we were going to move forward in
this hurricane season.  And we will continue to maintain a
forward-leaning posture throughout the remainder of this hurricane
season.   
   
As far as the President’s travel plans, I don’t have any changes to read
out at this time.  
   
Q    And Puerto Rico, as well?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, just a little bit — so, yesterday, as you know,
the President joined the New York Governor, Kathy Hochul, and New York
Mayor Eric Adams to receive a briefing from FEMA Administrator Cris- —
Criswell and Puerto Rico Governor, as well.  
   
As you all know, FEMA — FEMA Administrator Criswell was on the ground
earlier this week to assess emergency recovery and response efforts.   
   
Yesterday, the President announced the federal government is covering
100 percent of the cost of debris removal, emergency protective measures
for the next month in this recovery.  The President also increased
critical needs assistance from $500 to $700 to support individuals and
families with immediate or critical needs as a result of being displaced
from primary dwelling.   
   
As of today, there are more than 900 federal response workers on the
ground in Puerto Rico supporting operations, planning, power
restorations, debris removals, and urban search and rescue.   
   
And so, we will continue to monitor what’s on — on the ground and
continue to help Puerto Rico — our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico
as best as we can.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  First, a follow-up on the referendum in Ukraine.  If
Russia does annex these parts of Ukraine, could it put the U.S. in a
more dangerous situation, especially if Ukraine uses American weapons in
those areas?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, just to be very, very clear here — we spoke about
— I spoke about this just now: We have sent a loud message — and our
allies, as well — about this illegitimate vote that we’re seeing today
across the next several days.   
   
We will never recognize this — if they go forward with the annexation,
we will never recognize that.  That’s not just coming from us.  That is
also coming from G7 leaders I mentioned; they put out a statement.   
   
And so, we will continue to be very — speak very forcefully about that. 
We will be — continue to be very clear.   
   
We know that these referenda will be manipulated.  We have information
that shows Russian officials setting targets for voter turnouts and
approval rates for the referendums.   
   
For example, in some regions, they have reportedly already set the
required figures for voter turnout and support for a session into Russia
at over 75 percent.   
   
So Russia is rushing to conduct these sham, again, referenda, but these
are not acts of confidence or strength.  They are complete opposite.  We
will continue to speak loudly.   
   
Again, I don’t want to get into hypotheticals.  I’m about to answer your
question.  I’m not getting into hypotheticals, but we are making sure
that we are loud and clear with our G7 leaders.  
   
Q    If — I understand how the United States is not going to view the
outcome of, like you said, a sham election.  But if Russia views the
outcome as now annexing more Russian territory, is there a risk of
escalation?  
   
The — their foreign minister said today they strongly urge the U.S. to
avoid a situation capable of leading to direct military clashes with
Russia.   
   
So if they start saying that now American weapons are being fired into
what they are considering Russian territory, does that risk
escalation?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So what — we have said this before and we’ll say it
again: We do not seek conflict with Russia.  Of course, we are attentive
to managing escalation in this conflict, as always, as we have been for
the past six months or more of this war, and so — throughout this
year.  
   
But to reiterate, there is only one country that is responsible for this
war, and that is Russia.  They are the ones who — who are causing this
brutal war.  They started this conflict and could end this at any
time.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  What is the White House’s take and the President’s
take on World Bank President Malpass’s comments on climate change?  Does
the President still have confidence in Mr. Malpass?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’ll take your — I guess — well, I guess I’ll take
both your questions first.   
   
So, we disagree with the comments made by President Malpass.  We expect
the World Bank to be a global leader of climate ambition and
mobilization as well, of significant — of sigvican- — significantly more
climate finance for developing countries, as is the business of the
World Bank.  
The Treasury Department, which oversees our engagement with
international financial institutions, has and will continue to make that
expectation clear to the World Bank leadership.   
   
Q    And with regard to the confidence that the President has or does
not have?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, we disagree with the comments of the
president.  I’ll leave it there.   
   
Q    Okay, I have one other —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, sure.  
   
Q    — question on today’s news.  The markets are falling — the stock
markets are falling.  The dollar is strengthening significantly; the
pound has dropped.  What is the White House’s take on that and the
broader implications for the U.S. economy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the stock market, as you’ve heard us say many
times, is just one measure of the economy that — that shows how the
economy is doing.  And so, we are watching — always watching these
different indicators closely, including the stock market.   
   
It’s also important to look at what’s happening on Main Street.  This is
something that we think is important, as you’ve heard us talk about, to
also look at.  
   
We have one of the strongest job markets on record, with 3.7
unemployment rate.  And we’ve created 10 million new jobs in the
President’s 19 months in office.  More people are looking for work.  And
we think those indicators are important as well.   
   
So because of the economic plan, the bus- — the businesses are investing
in America at a record — at record rates, and we are making more in
America.  And that is important to note, as well.  
   
We always know, you know, we — there’s always more work to do.  But the
President, with his economic plan — whether it’s the American Rescue
Plan that got the economy started, which we see this historic economy;
or the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is going to create millions
of jobs and fix our infrastructure, fix our supply chain; or it’s the
Inflation Reduction Act — all of these are pieces of the President’s
economic plan that we’re going to continue to work through and is going
to make sure we don’t leave anybody behind.   
   
But again, this is one of the strongest job markets that we have seen on
record.  And — and so, what we are seeing — and I’ve said this before;
you’ve heard this from Brian Deese — is a transition to a more steady
and stable growth.  And that’s what we’re currently seeing and in the
process of moving the economy into.   
   
Q    Karine, protests are still underway in the wake of the death of
Mahsa Amini in the hands of Iran’s morality police.  I know the Treasury
Department yesterday issued those sanctions.  Are there other tools the
U.S. feels they have at their disposal to try to respond to this?  
   
And I was also hoping you could possibly speak to the President’s
personal response to it as well.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Mahsa Amini’s death after injuries, as you all
know, sustained while in police custody after — for wearing an
“improper” hijab is an appalling and egregious affront to human rights. 
Our thoughts are with Mahsa’s family and loved ones.   
   
And as President Biden clearly stated at UNGA — he spoke to this: “We
need…” — and this is quote — “We need…” — “We stand with the brave
citizens and brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to
secure their basic rights.”  End quote.  
   
Women in Iran should have the right to wear what they want, free from
violence or harassment.  Iran must end its use of violence against women
for exercising their fundamental freedoms.  
   
There must be accountability for Mahsa’s death.  Again, you mentioned
the sanctions; that was announced by the Department of Treasury just
yesterday.  And Treasury also designated seven senior Iranian security
officials as well, including Iran’s Minister of Intelligence, for their
roles in the suppression and killing of peaceful protesters since
2019.   
   
And so, we will continue to use all available tools at our disposal to
make sure that we pursue accountability.   
   
Q    And on this storm that’s approaching Florida, I know that FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell today spoke with Governor DeSantis.  Does
President Biden himself plan on speaking to the Governor?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any — I don’t have any calls to preview
at this time.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Are you declining to say whether or not the President has
confidence in David Malpass?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just stated very clearly where we stand on that.  
   
Q    And has the President or any of his advisors spoken with anyone
else —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a call to preview at this time.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Another one on Iran.  Has the situation forced the
administration to reevaluate its pursuit of a nuclear agreement?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we have been very clear that our number one goal
is to make sure that — look, I’ll start here: We have concerns.  We do. 
We have concerns with Iran.  But the JCPOA is the best way to — for us
to address the nuclear problem.  And we have been very clear that our
goal is to make sure that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.   
   
So as long as we believe pursuing JCPOA talks is in the U.S. national
security interest, we will do so.  We will continue to use other tools
to address other problems with Iran’s behavior.  But we believe this is
the best path forward, to make sure that we go — we have these
negotiations.  
   
Q    And the UK Prime Minister, Liz Truss, is pursuing an economic
program, including tax cuts for the wealthy, that’s causing some
economic headwinds in that country.  And is the U.S. concerned about
broader economic fallout from that plan?  And are you monitoring what
Prime Minister Truss is trying to push through there?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I can’t speak to the plan.  I have not read it.  I
would need to speak to our team.   
   
You know, I’m not going to really, at this time, speak to another
country’s plan on what they — what they plan or not plan to do on their
taxing the wealthy.  So I’m not — I’m just not going to respond to it at
this time.   
   
Go ahead, Steve.   
   
Q    Thanks.  A number of outlets matched the Washington Post report
this morning that in addition to the public warnings to Moscow, there
have been private communications.  What more can you tell us about the
communications to Russia warning against the use of nuclear weapons?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m not going to speak to any private or —
discussions at this time.  We’ve been very clear.  The President was
loud and clear during his UNGA address about what we’re seeing.  We will
not — it — the votes that we’re seeing — this sham referendum is
illegitimate.  We’ve been very clear.  I’m not, again, going to comment
on private communications.   
   
Again, you’ve heard the President.  He not only said it at UNGA, he said
it during his “60 Minutes” interview, in his New York Times op-ed on
Ukraine a few months ago.  And so we’ve been very clear.  And we have
warned — we have actually warned about the sham referendum for many,
many months.  And so now we see the playbook of Putin, what he’s doing
right now.  
   
It is not — he is not moving forward with any strength here.  This is
weakness that we’re seeing from him.  He has — he has — he is losing
ground in the battlefield.  And this is a playbook of his that is not
surprising.  But we’ve been very clear about what — if he moves forward
with annexation, we will not recognize it and we will continue to
condemn those actions.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Can you share a little bit about what the U.S. assessment is of how
serious Vladimir Putin is about his threat to use nuclear weapons?  He
has threatened it before but, of course, it was at the beginning of the
war, and the dynamics are very different now.  So if you could just
share a little bit about what your thinking is of how serious that
threat is.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we — we obviously take these threats very
seriously, but we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear
posture at this time.   
   
Look, you know, the consequences of a nuclear use by Russia — the
President was very clear about this, especially during his “60 Minutes”
interview — would be disastrous for the world and Russia would be a
pariah on the world stage.   
   
But again, we are not seeing any reason to adjust our — our own posture,
but we take this threat very seriously.  
   
Let me move around.  Go ahead, Peter.   
   
Q    Karine, on the Iranian President, who was here in the U.S. just
recently.  Why did the Biden administration grant a visa waiver for
President Raisi to come to the United States, given the crackdown that
we’re witnessing take place in his own country?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Because he — because he attended the U.N. — you mean —
the UNGA.   
   
Q    He was here as part of the United Nations.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No — no, I know.  I’m just talk- — you’re talking
about —  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — UNGA specifically?   
   
Look, you know, it is — UNGA is an opportunity for, as we know, heads of
states, world — global world leaders to come together and talk through
their agreements, disagreements, how they’re going to move forward.  And
that’s what you saw.  And everyone had an opportunity, as you know, to
speak to the hall, but also to speak to the global — it was a global
stage.  And — and we believe everyone has that right to do that as — as
a part of the U.N. Charter.   
   
I’m not going to speak any — any specifically on his — on his visa.  
   
Q    But for clarity, though, there was no engagement between the United
States and Iran while he was here?  While it comes with the ability to
do that, we did not take up that opportunity to engage with him
directly, correct?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share on that front.  We have
been very — we have been very clear and forthcoming on who he engaged
with — who the President engaged with while he was in New York this past
week.  
   
Q    You were asked something to this effect a little bit earlier, but
we’ve heard from the State Department that the U.S. is doing what it can
to expand Internet access for those Iranians right now to still have
access to the outside world.  Is there anything beyond that the United
States is doing presently to help those protesters and others in that
country?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I don’t have any more to share on what else we’ve
been doing, but happy to clearly update folks if we have more on that
piece.  
   
Okay, go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Do we have any updates on the process to get a
permanent U.S. ambassador in Moscow?  Obviously, John Sullivan, who was
there, had to come back.  Do you know where you are in that process? 
Have you submitted a name to the Russians?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I don’t have anything to — we don’t have anything
to update you on that piece.   
   
Q    Is there — is that hindering your ability to effectively do foreign
policy, the fact that you don’t have a Senate-confirmed ambassador there
right now?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, not at all.  We have been very effectively —  
   
Q    You announced your new ambassador.   
   
Q    You named an ambassador (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m sorry.  I might have misunderstood the
question.  What was the question?   
   
Q    I’m here to help.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.) I appreciate that.  So what was the
question?   
   
Q    I’m asking where you are in the — where you are in that process.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, okay.  
   
Q    Because there’s a — you know, you have to submit credentials, and
they have to come back.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Got it.  
   
Q    And it’s a bureaucratic process to get that approved.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Got it.  So —  
   
Q    I was wondering if you had timing updates or where you were on
that.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, yeah, she’s asking me where we are in the
process.  So we have announced someone.  I don’t have anything — an
update on the process.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Do you have another question?   
   
Q    I — it’s been answered a little bit, but I was going to ask — I
think you’ve addressed this.  But — so you’re taking the timing of these
referendums in Ukraine, being held by Russia, as a sign of insecurity,
not confidence, right?  You’re — you’re saying that this is not Putin
thinking he can permanently hold these areas, and that’s why he’s having
these referendums.  You’re interpreting it as this timing is the
opposite: He’s feeling insecure, and that’s why they’re holding them
now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, we’ve been very clear on that.  And we actually
have been saying for months that this is an action that Putin would
take; this is part of his playbook, doing these sham referendums, these
illegitimate voting process.  
   
So we have been very clear on that, that he’s — he would take this
action.  But again, you — we saw the G7 statement earlier today.  You
heard from the President at UNGA.  He’s been very clear as well: These
are sham referendums.  We will not recognize any — if — if they move
forward in this fashion, we would not recognize any annexation of
Ukraine.  Ukraine belongs to the people of Ukraine, plain and simple.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  So, the Federal Reserve is saying that the economy
will significantly slow down to growing just 0.2 percent for the
entirety of this year and then 1.2 percent for next year.  Is this the
stable growth the President is moving us towards?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re talking about what — what he said yesterday? 
The —  
   
Q    Yeah.  It was the projections the Federal Reserve came out.  They
projected the economy would grow at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2
percent next year, which is pretty slow growth.  And I’m just curious:
Is this the stable growth that you’re talking about?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean, I talked about this a little bit already,
how we’re coming off of last year’s historic economic growth.  A lot of
that is because of the work of this President and Democrats in Congress
passing the American Rescue Plan, which put us in a position where we
saw the most stable growth — strongest growth that we have seen in
modern — in modern history.   
   
So it’s no surprise that the economy at this point is going to slow
down, is going to cool off just a bit as the Federal Reserve takes
action to bring down inflation.   
   
So the Fed’s projection, as you mentioned, of growth over this calendar
year implies growth between 1 and 2 percent in the next two quarters.  
   
So our goal is to bring down inflation.  That’s what we’ve been doing
for the past several months: making sure that we’re doing everything
that we can to give the American public a little bit more breathing room
without sacrificing all of the historic gains that we made this past
year and life-changing economics gains this country has made over the
last 19 months — this past year, year and a half.   
   
So, given the encouraging initial signs that we have seen on inflation
and the continued strength of growth in the job market — so we believe
in — the transition remains possible.  We believe that we will get to a
strong and stable growth.  We believe that we’ll — we will see that
cooling that you hear economists talking about.  
   
Q    Now, on inflation, one more if I could.  Americans are making tough
choices related to inflation.  And last week, they saw the President do
the celebration during the Inflation Reduction Act, when core inflation
rose for the first time in five months on that day.  
   
This week there’s another celebration 48 hours after the Fed Chairman
said there’ll be more economic pain.  Is that optics of those two
celebrations insensitive to what Americans are going through?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the President has always in — when he talks about
the economy, has made clear to understand what the American families are
going through, what the American people are going through.  He
understands that the economy and inflation in particular, high cost, is
— is giving some pain, to your point, to Americans.   
   
That is why we passed — that is why Democrats in Congress passed
Inflation Reduction Act.  By the way, no Republicans supported that. 
And as you know — you’ve heard me say it many times; you’ve heard the
President say it many times — it is going to lower cost when it comes to
prescription drugs.  It’s going to lower healthcare costs and energy
costs.  And it is one of the most — the most historic investment to
fight climate change.  
   
As we are talking about extreme weather, I’ve gotten multiple questions
on Puerto Rico and what the people — people of Puerto Rico, our brothers
and sisters, are going through; what may happen in this hurricane
season.  A lot of that is — is going to be helped by the work that this
President has done — Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; again, the Inflation
Reduction Act.  
   
So, we are doing the work.  We’re going to continue to do that.  We’re
going to continue to work.  We’ve seen gas prices go down for 14 weeks
straight.  And that, again, is because of the work that this President
is doing.  So, yes, we understand what the American people are going
through.  But our job — the President’s job is to do everything that he
can in his power to give Americans a little bit more breathing room.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Can you tell us a little bit about Tuesday’s
trip to Florida?  Is the President going to be going after DeSantis a
bit?  Is he one of the MAGA — or not really, in a way — but you see what
I mean.  Is he part of the MAGA or the alternative MAGA scene that the
President is going after?   
   
And also, could you — could you just come back to the President’s
reelection decision, because —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You like asking me that question, Sebastian.   
   
Q    No, no — you were asked this like a few months ago because everyone
was going crazy over, “Is he going to — is he going…”  And you said,
“Yes, he is.”  And that was meant to stop the whole thing, but —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I said that — look, I’m — I’m —  
   
Q    Five days ago, he said it’s way too early.  So which —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Whoa, whoa, wait.  Hold on.  I’m going to answer your
question.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m at the podium, right?  There’s a Hatch Act.  We
have to — I have to be very mindful when talking about 2022 and even
2024, which is worlds away, as you all know.  You cover this.  This
media cycle changes every second.   
   
So, look, the President was clear even during that “60 Minutes”
interview.  And I have been clear.  He has been clear multiple times
that he intends to run.  He said that.  He said that in that same
interview that he intends to run.   
   
I have to be careful as I’m standing in front of you.  I don’t want to
get more into that.   
   
But the President’s goal right now, as we look at today, as we look at
the next coming days, is to make sure that we — that we continue to
deliver for the American people.  That is why we talk about the
Inflation Reduction Act.  That is why we talk about CHIPS Act.  That is
why we talk about Bipartisan Infrastructure legislation.   
   
And not just him.  You hear it from the Vice President.  You hear it
from his Cabinet Secretaries.  It is so important to make sure that the
American public understands what we have done here these past 19 months,
and that’s going to be our focus.  
   
As it relates to Florida and Governor DeSantis, look, I don’t have
anything to preview at this time of what the trip will look like.  We
will share more as we get closer to the day.  
   
Look, we have talked about this as well.  You know, when it comes to
extremism, when it comes to behaviors that is inhumane and cruel — that
is what we’re seeing from Governor DeSantis.  That is what we’re seeing
in — specifically to how he is using people who are leaving communism,
people who are freeing — trying to free, get away from political
persecution — talking about Venezuela, Nicara- — Nicaragua, Cuba.  They
are fleeing those countries.  And he is using families, children, and
women as a political ploy, as a political stunt.  We will continue to
call that out.   
   
But as far as what that day will look like, we’ll share more as we get
closer.   
   
Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Back to Puerto Rico.  When the President said
yesterday that the federal government would cover 100 percent of the
cost for the next month of the efforts down there, do you have an
estimate of what that cost is going  
to be?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, that’s a good question.  We don’t have an estimate
at this time.  But the President is committed, as you know.  You heard
him from speaking — from New York yesterday.  He is committed to doing
everything that he can for Puerto Rico.  He has spoken to the governor
several times.  Our team has been in touch with the governor and local
officials throughout this time.   
   
And so, he’s committed to doing everything that he can, and this is how
he sees his role.  He’s done this multiple times when we’ve seen this
extreme type of weather, these disasters hit communities.  And as
President, he’s going to continue to be a loud voice in that and use the
resources of the federal government to make sure that we — we help the
people of Puerto Rico at this time.  
   
Q    And a follow-up on Iran and the Internet.  Has the administration
heard from any American tech companies that will move forward with
offering Internet services in Iran?  And is there any way to estimate
how much of an impact that will actually have on the Iranian people?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let me go back and just say, look, we are aware of
the — what the Iranian authorities are doing in blocking Instagram and
also WhatsApp, as well as slowing down or stopping access to the
Internet in general, as you all are asking.  
   
If accurate, this is shameful and — but also not an unsurprising step in
the wrong direction by Iran’s government to prevent the world from
watching the Iran government crack down on peaceful protesters.  That is
what is happening here.  
   
We continue to work with private sector and Department of Treasury to
identify additional measures that we will support and facilitate the
free flow of information to the Iranian people.  
   
As you — as I just mentioned earlier, the Department of Treasury took
action just yesterday, and we will use what is available to us to make
sure that we — there is accountability.  
   
I’m going to go back a little bit because I haven’t been. Go ahead.  And
then I’ll come back up.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Two quick ones.  First of all, on this weather, has
there been any — have we been in contact — has the U.S. been in contact
at all with our Canadian neighbors about the — what I believe will
technically not be a hurricane, but the major storm is supposed to hit
the Atlantic provinces, Canadian Maritimes in the coming hours?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Clearly, that’s something that we are monitoring from
here.  We would have to check in with our friends at NSC, our colleagues
to see if we’ve been in close touch with Canadian officials.  But that
is something that FEMA is continuously monitoring as well.  And when we
have any updates on that, we’re happy to share.  
   
Q    And the second thing is we’re — we’re a week away from the end of
the government’s fiscal year.  And are there — is there any reason why
anyone should be concerned that there might be a lapse in funding?  Or
is the President and the White House confident that whatever is going
back and forth with Senator Manchin’s permitting bill and the rest of
the CR negotiations, that that will all be worked out by next Friday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we have — you know, we believe — and I’ve said
this before, there’s still time for lawmakers on the — on the Hill to
enact a short-term funding bill by the — by the Friday deadline.  We
remain confident that Congress will get to — get this done so we can
continue to deliver vital services, to your — to your point of your
question, to the American people.  So, we encourage for that to
happen.   
   
We have continued, I’ve mentioned this before, to stay in close touch
with Congress to — in a bipartisan way.  But we believe we have been
here before.  We were here just last year during this time, and we think
that there’s still time to get something done.  And we’ll call on them
to act.  
   
Q    I just want to follow up again on the World Bank president.  You
said that you disagree with the comments that he’s made.  But in terms
of having confidence in him or supporting him, you know, there are
reports suggesting that some in the administration have tried to oust
him.  So, you know, given that contest \[sic\] — context, does the White
House still support him or have confidence in him?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, removing him requires a majority of shareholders,
so that’s something to keep in mind.  The U.S. believes the World Bank
must be a full partner in delivering on the aggressive global climate
agenda, poverty reduction, and sustainability development.  
   
Again, Treasury will hold Malpass accountable to this position and
support the many staff working to fight climate change at the World
Bank.   
   
But again, it would — removal would require a majority of stakeholders
here.  So, it is — it is a partnership, is how we see this.  
   
Go ahead, Peter.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Following up on your topper, does President Biden
favor any limits on abortion?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ve been very, very clear here.  Since you’re
talking about my topper, I was talking specifically about Senator
Lindsey Graham.  
   
Q    And your position on his plan is clear: 15 weeks is unacceptable.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And I was — I was speaking to — directly to what
Republicans are trying to do.  
   
Q    So Republicans —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  They are calling — they are calling for a national
ban, which takes us backwards.   
   
Q    A limit at 15 weeks, right?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Which will — which will — it’s a national ban which
will take us backwards and will put at risk the health of women.   
   
And here’s the thing about this, Peter, it’s not just national ban on
abortion.  We’re talking about privacy.  We’re talking about
contraception.  We’re talking about marriage.  That is what extreme
Republican officials are trying to do.  That’s what we’re speaking
to.   
   
I’m not going to get into specifics here.  I’m just going to lay out
what — what they have said that they’re going to  
do.  
   
Q    Why not get into specifics?  The Republicans are saying, “We don’t
want abortion after 15 weeks.”  Why can’t you say how many weeks the
President thinks the limit should be?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — so, as you know — as you know, Kevin McCarthy put
out the GO- — GOP agenda.  
   
Q    I am not asking about Kevin McCarthy.  I’m asking about Joe Biden
and his —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I am answering — I am answering — Peter —  
   
Q    — position on abortion.  How many weeks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Peter, I’m answering your question.  What Republicans
are trying to do is take us backwards.  They’re trying to take away the
rights and freedoms of Americans.  That’s what we’re calling out and
that’s what we’re going to continue to call out.

House Republicans oppose a pharmacy bill that would deny women essential
medications.  As of September, 166 House Republicans have signed on to a
heartbeat bill that would decide abortion at the federal lev- — level,
even though 28 of those members have since said decisions on abortion
should be left to the state.   
   
And this week, a Michigan GOP official said he wa- — he — he wants to
ban contraception.

So we should really listen to what Republicans are trying to tell us. 
And that’s what we are speaking out against.  And that’s what we’re
going to talk about — about the national ban that Republicans are
continuing — continuing to push when majority of Americans do not want
that.

Q    We are all covering the Republican —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.

Q    — plan.  I’m just —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Q    Why can’t you say how many weeks —

Q    Thanks, Karine.

Q    — for Biden?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Q    But — no.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.  Go ahead. 

Q    Karine, why can’t you say?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I answered.  I answered your question.

Q    You did not answer my question —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Courtney.

Q    — Karine. 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I did.

Q    Why can’t you say —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Courtney.

Q    — how many weeks?

Q    I wanted to ask you — the President announced that he was elevating
Jennifer Klein to a more senior role.  What does that do for her
resources, for her portfolio?  What’s the purpose of doing that,
especially when you’re dealing with so many gender issues that you’ve
been talking about?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Jen Klein — who, as you know, is a colleague of
mine, and I’ve worked — I’ve worked closely with her, as well as our
team here — has been leading on the Gender Policy Council since the
beginning, since day one.  And she has had all the resources available
to her.

She has worked diligently on — on delivering the agenda of this
President.  It is a — it is a — as you know, a historic office that
deals with — with such an important issue as we talk about gender —
gender rights, as we talk about equality. 

So I wouldn’t say there are — there’s going to be any differences,
really.  I mean, it is an — she is — she is an — really, an assistant to
the President, as the role — as her new title lays out.  She runs an
office here.  And again, she has had all the resources that have been
provided to her.

She works closely with multiple agencies across — across the federal
government to make sure that we live up to what the goal of the gender
policy is.

And so, again, she is — we’re very happy for her.  This is well deserved
for — for Jen.  And she — we are lucky to have her in that role.

Q    Can you also provide an update — I know the Justice Department had
a task force that some of the White House folks were participating on
responding to the Dobbs decision, how you were going to proceed with
litigation or whatever it is you wanted to move forward.  Can you
provide an update on that group’s work?  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, we can — we can go back to the G- — GPC and our
other partners to get an update for you on where we are.

Q    Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Go ahead.

Q    Just another follow-up on the World Bank.  If a majority of the
stakeholders wanted to oust President Malpass, would the United States
support that?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into hypotheticals.  I’ve said
already that we condemn the words of the president.  And — but, again,
was just laying out what the process would be.  But I’m not going to get
ahead of — of what that process is potentially going to look like if
there is a majority. 

Again, this is a partnership.  This is not — this is not something that
we will just do on our own.

Q    And then, in New York this week, did any of the President’s
discussions with other world leaders touch on the proposed oil price cap
for Russia?  And can you give us any updates on what was discussed?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, that’s a good question.  We don’t have anything
to read out for you on that particular issue.  It is something that the
President has led on, as you know.  It came up when he was in Europe
very recently.   
   
And it is — it is — you know, it is an issue that we feel that is
important in dealing with really giving, you know, another, kind of,
blow to Russia.  But I don’t have anything to read out for you at this
time on any further conversations and where we are in that — in that
space.

Go ahead.

Q    There’s videos out there of drunken men in Russia brawling and
resisting going to the front.  Do you — in light of the conscrip- — this
conscription order.  So do you assess that Putin is going to have
trouble producing 300,000 members of the armed forces, or do you think
he’s going for far more than that?  And is he capable of doing it?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I can’t speak to what he’s capable of doing or
not doing, but I can speak to what these acts that — these announcements
and his speech, laying out what he wants to do — right? — whether it’s
300,000 more personnel.

Look, again, this is not an act of strength.  This is not coming from a
place of confidence.  It’s really quite the opposite.  What we’re seeing
from Putin is weakness.

He has — he’s been losing on the battlefield.  He is not — he has not
made any gain, as we have known, this past couple of weeks.  They have
not been able to achieve any of their goals.  And — and they are losing
their positions, again, on the battlefield.

So what we are seeing is Russia that is scraping for personnel to throw
into this fight.  And we are seeing thousands of Russians protest
against this mobilization, against this brutal war and unjust war that
Russia forced — that Russian forces are carrying out in Ukraine and — on
President Putin’s, you know, whim, on his orders.

So, again, he — this is — you know, this is not a strength or confidence
here that we’re seeing.  This is coming from a place of weakness.

It is — you know, it is — we’ll — we will — it is up to Putin to see
what he’s capable of doing.  But we’re seeing from the protests, right? 
We’re seeing very clearly that people are protesting in the street
because this war is incredibly unpopular.  This war, again, that Putin
has started, that Putin put onto the people of Ukraine.

Q    There’s that report out of the U.N. today about potential alleged
war crimes in Russia, including sex crimes of very young and very old
Ukrainian people.  In light of what the President has said calling Putin
a war criminal in the past, what is he doing now?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we are engaging the Ukrainians to learn more about
what’s happening on the ground.  We have been clear that war crimes
Russian forces have committed need to be investigated and that Russia
needs to be held accountable.

So the recent discovery of mass graves in Izyum is horrifying, as are
the atrocities Russia has committed in Bucha and many other places
throughout Ukraine.  We’ve been very clear about that.

We have been working closely with Ukraine on this issue and welcome
Ukrainians’ perspective on this process, how we move forward.   
   
We are also supporting a range of international and national efforts
underway to document war crimes and atrocities committed by Russian
forces in Ukraine, including through International Criminal Court and
investigation through the Human — U.N. Human Rights Council, the OSCE
Moscow Mechanism, and the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office.  
   
We are helping document, preserve, and analyze evidence of war crimes
and atrocity through our Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group for Ukraine, the
State Department’s Conflict Observatory, and the Department of Justice
War Crimes Accountability Team.   
   
It is past time for this war to end, and it is up to Mr. Putin to end
this war.  This war was started by the Kremlin.  He can end this war
today if he chooses to.  He can end the brutality that we’re seeing in
Ukraine if he chooses to.  And it is up to him.  He can end this
today.   
   
I’m trying to see who I have not called on.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead. 
Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Two Americans who were captured while fighting
Russia in Ukraine were released this week.  They arrived back on U.S.
soil today.  What involvement did the U.S. have in that prisoner
exchange?  Is there anything else that you can tell us about that?  And
has the President spoken yet to either the men or their families?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything to read out on any
conversation that — that the President has had specifically with these
two — two Americans.  
   
The United States welcomes the negotiated prisoner exchange between
Ukraine and Russia, which includes the two U.S. citizens, as you just
mentioned, captured while serving in Ukraine’s military.  We are
appreciative of Ukraine including all prisoners of war, regardless of
nationality, in its negotiations.  And we look forward to these U.S.
citizens being reunited with their families.   
   
We also thank the Crown Prince and the government of Saudi Arabia and
the Turkish government for facilitating the exchange of prisoners
between Ukraine and Russia.  We once again reiterate the State
Department’s travel advisory warning U.S. citizens not to travel to
Ukraine, and that those who do participate in fighting there — in the
fighting there, face a significant risk, and the United States cannot
guarantee their safety.  We’ve been very clear about this from the very
early days of this war.  
   
We continue to encourage Americans to devote their energies toward the
many other opportunities that exist to help the country of Ukraine and
also the people of Ukraine.  
   
Q    On another topic really quick.  The President, over the summer, was
considering declaring a public health emergency over abortion rights. 
He was also at one point thinking about taking executive action when it
comes to DREAMers.  And he was also considering declaring a national
emergency over climate.  Can you provide us with a status update on
potential executive actions relating to those items?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We don’t have any updates on those particular items,
and when we do, we will be happy to share them.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Karine, what’s the President Biden message to the people of
Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua that are now on their way to the U.S.
border or thinking of coming to the U.S. border?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  And we have said this before; Secretary
Mayorkas has been very clear on this as well: It is a dangerous
journey.  We understand the political persecution.  We understand what —
what the people of Ukraine — I’m sorry — not Ukraine — I was just
talking about Ukraine — what the people of Nicaragua, Venezuela, and
Cuba are going through.  But, again, these are very, very dangerous —
this is a very dangerous journey.   
   
We — you know, we recommend that they don’t put their lives at risk. 
But, again, you know, what we’re seeing — how they are being used as
political pawns — is something that we’re going to continue to call on. 
It is inhumane.  It is unacceptable how folks who are fleeing, again,
political persecution, who are fleeing communism are being treated.   
   
And that is something that you’ll continue to hear President Biden
condemn, you’ll continue to hear us condemn.  What Republican governors
are doing is unacceptable.  It is shameful.  And not only that — it is
causing chaos and confusion.   
   
And that is not how we fix the system.  If we want to fix the system,
the President put forth, on his first day in the White House, a
legislative solution, a comprehensive immigration reform to deal with
these very issues.   
   
In the meantime, we’re going to continue to work with our partners and
our allies in the region in the Western Hemisphere, because this is
indeed a new type of migration that we’re seeing.  We’re seeing a jump
from those three countries — about 121 percent in just a year.  And that
is a different scenario that we’re dealing with.  So, we’re going to —
that is causing — that is causing havoc across the Western Hemisphere.  
   
Q    I have a follow-up.  President Biden said last week that it’s not
rational to send these people from Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua back. 
Does that mean that President Biden is in some way — or the White House
— in some way encouraging them to come to the U.S.?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What the President is saying is that these folks —
these mothers, these children, these families — are leaving the country
because of communism.  They’re leaving the country because of political
persecution.   
   
And he was saying that they should not be used as a political pawn by
Governor DeSantis or any Republican governor.  That’s what he was
speaking to.  He was calling out the inhumane nature of the way that
they were being used because of a politi- — for a political headline,
because of someone’s political future.   
   
And so, he’s going to continue to call that out.  It is, again — I’ll
say this again: It is inhumane.  You hear the President talk about this
many times throughout his career, not just as President: It is important
to treat people with dignity.  It is important to make sure that — you
know, that — again, that folks who are fleeing communism are not treated
this way.  And so we’ll continue to call that out.   
   
Thanks, everybody.
