Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Detroit, Michigan

10:10 A.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi, everybody.  Hello.  Okay.  President Biden’s
economic plan has fueled an electric vehicle manufacturing boom in
America, and we’ll see that on full display in Detroit, Michigan,
today.   
   
Since President Biden took office, companies like Toyota, Honda, Ford,
GM, and Panasonic have announced $85 billion in investments to make
electric vehicles, batteries, and chargers across America.  They are
making investments in states like North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio,
Missouri, and Kansas.  And the number of electric vehicles sold in
America has tripled.  
   
While in Detroit, President Biden will tour the Detroit Auto Show, where
Stellantis will be showcasing two new hybrid electric Jeeps, General
Motors will be highlighting their entire EV portfolio and their new
electric Equinox, and dozens of other — of automakers will be showing
off their laste- — their latest offerings.  
   
The President will then deliver remarks on how his auto vision and
leadership — including through his Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act — have positioned the
United States to lead the electric vehicle future and how we are now
creating more jobs, and manufacturing more in America, all while
fighting climate change.  
   
Throughout the day, he’ll get a chance to talk with union workers, CEOs,
and local leaders.  He’ll also be joined by Secretary Buttigieg, EPA
Administrator Michael Regan, Governor Whitmer, Senator Stabenow,
Congresswoman Dingell, and other members of the Michigan congressional
delegation.  
   
I also want to note, for the second day in a row, that while President
Biden is in Michigan today focusing on strengthening our economy and the
American people, extreme MAGA Republicans are consumed with their
efforts to rip away rights from wom- — from millions of women.  
   
Yesterday, Senator Graham introduced a radical national ban on abortion,
which would strip away women’s rights in all 50 states.  And last night,
West Virginia passed another extreme abortion ban, which we expect to be
signed into law shortly.  
   
As I said yesterday in the briefing room, these actions are wildly out
of step with what Americans believe and want from their government.  The
President and the Vice President won’t stop fighting to restore the
protections of Roe in the face of continued radical steps by elected
Republicans to put personal healthcare decisions in the hands of
politicians instead of women and their doctors.  
   
And West Virginia’s bill is another signal of the importance that
Congress acts to codify Roe into law.  
   
With that, Colleen, welcome back.  
   
Q    Thanks.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good to see you.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Can you tell us why the President went to
Wilmington yesterday to vote in the primary when he could have had an
absentee ballot or he could have voted in person, early voting, when he
was there last weekend?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, it’s multiple things.  I know there has been a lot
of interest in this.   
   
So every American, as you know, has a sacred and constitutional right to
vote.  The President exercised that right, alongside other Delawareans,
last night.  That’s what you saw, just a couple — to answer your
specific questions.  
   
Look, as you know, the President has a very heavy schedule.  He’s the
President of the United States.  It worked out best for him to vote
yesterday, to vote on Tuesday.  He thought it was important to exercise
his constitutional right to vote, as I just mentioned, and set an
example by showing the importance of voting.  
   
He also had the opportunity to say hello to poll workers and thank them
for their work.  And we know how under attack poll workers have been
these past several years.   
   
And as some of you noted — some of your colleagues noted that many
Presidents — it’s not — it’s not unusual — head home to vote in their
local elections.  And he thought it was important to do so yesterday.  
   
Q    Do you think that it would have been better then to make it more
of, like, a public event, for him to sort of, like, tout it a little bit
more?  It was sort of a surprise — right? — until we — until he landed
there.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, the President has been voting in Delaware for
decades.  And this is something that was important to do.  He wasn’t
going to miss an opportunity to vote — to vote yesterday, and he did
that.  It is not unusual for him.  He’s done that for — again, for many
decades.  
   
And so — so, you know, he had an opportunity to thank the poll workers. 
He had an opportunity — I think by the President going to vote, that
sends a very strong mesh- — message to the American public.  
   
Q    Karine, can you give us an update on the railway strike
possibility, what the government is doing, and what the latest is on
talks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the latest is — so, this morning, Secretary Walsh
is hosting the rail companies and unions in Washington, D.C., at the
Department of Labor.  You guys may all already know that.  It’s
happening literally as we are flying to Detroit at this moment.  The
President and members of Cabinet have been in touch with both union —
unions and companies involved multiple times in order to try to avert a
rail shutdown.   
   
Our administration has been engaged in these negotiations for months, as
I mentioned yesterday in the briefing room, in the early days of
spring.  All parties need to stay at the table, bargain in good faith to
resolve outstanding issues, and come to an agreement.  A shutdown of our
freight sys- — rail system is an unacceptable outcome for our economy
and the American people, and all parties must work to avoid just that.  
   
Q    Are you putting any contingency plans in place in case it does come
to a shutdown?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, you know, we’ve been — we’ve been talking to
both sides.  The President — I mentioned this yesterday as well — while
he was in Boston, had a conversation with both sides of this issue.  And
our continued message keeps — stays the same, which is that they need to
continue to — to negotiate at the table in good faith.  
   
Again, Secretary Walsh is at the Department of Labor, hosting both
sides.  And we’re going to continue to work to make sure that we don’t
put another burden — another burden on the American fam- — American
people and the American families.  
   
Q    Senator Burr put forward a resolution urging the — both sides to —
or urging, I should — sorry — urging that both sides accept the Biden
board’s recommendation on the rail strike — in other words, that the
President get behind backing those recommendations.  Do you have a
position either on Senator Burr’s resolution or more broadly about the
intervention with respect to the recommendations of the board?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the negotiating process of the — of the
Presidential Emergency Board, which the President formed back in July —
on July 15th, to be exact — puts the onus of resolving differences on
the parties themselves.  
   
And so, this is an issue that can and should be worked out between the
rail companies and the unions, not by Congress. In fact, parties are at
the table right now, as I just said, at the Department of Labor — of
Labor.   
   
Look, this is — they have been able to come together and negotiate in
the past.  And that’s what we’re expecting this time around as well.  
   
Q    And very quickly, is there any update you can give us on the SPR? 
We’ve given — had some reporting yesterday that the administration may
begin announcing buybacks as the price — if the price dips further.  Can
you say at what point will the administration step in to help alleviate
a price if it thinks it gets too low?  And on the flip side, at what
point would you think the price is getting too high?  And are further
releases down the line on the table as well?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, Josh, the Department of Energy,
they’ve put together an outline — its plan to replenish the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve just a few months back.  And that plan is currently
going through the standard regulatory review process.   
   
And so, as the Department said then, a few months ago, it anticipates
that replenishment would not occur until well into the future, likely
after fiscal year 2023.  I don’t have any new steps to share at this
time or to preview.  So, we would refer you to the Department of
Energy.  
   
Q    So if oil cost prices really drop, you’re not worried about that? 
The administration wouldn’t step in.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I would — this is a process.  They — the
Department of Energy put forward a plan on this.  And this is a process
that they’re running.  And it’s going through, again, a review.  So I
would definitely refer back to the Department of Energy.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Any updates on the London trip?  Do you know if he’s going to be
meeting with the new prime minister or with King Charles?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I do have an update for you on that.  Well, not
your specific question, but an update on — on the UK more broadly.   
   
But so, first off, I don’t have an update on the — on who he is going to
be meeting or anything like that.  We don’t have more to share outside
of that the President and the First Lady are going to be attending the
funeral on Monday the 19th.   
   
But what I will share is: The President today “spoke with King Charles
III to offer his condolences on the passing of Queen Elizabeth II.  The
President recalled fondly the Queen’s kindness and hospitality,
including when she hosted him and the First Lady at Windsor Castle last
June.  He also conveyed the great admiration of the American people for
the Queen, whose dignity and constancy deepened the enduring friendship
and special relationship between the United States and the United
Kingdom.  President Biden conveyed his wish to continue a close
relationship with the King.”  
   
This is a readout that just went up moments ago, so that is what
happened this morning.  
   
Q    Do you know if he or the First Lady has talked to Prince Harry?  I
know they’ve obviously done events before in the past and are seemingly
close.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any — you’re talking about First Lady,
Dr. Biden?   
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t — I don’t have anything to preview at this
time.  I would probably just refer you to her office.  I don’t know of
any calls at this time.  
   
Q    Karine, on Taiwan, maybe, if I may.  There’s going to be a
preliminary vote today in the Senate on the so-called Taiwan Policy
Act.  Does the President support this text?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — so, I know this was asked in the briefing room. 
Just more broadly, our — our legislative teams have been — have been in
touch with members — in touch with Congress, to be more specific.  We
will continue to communicate directly with Congress on this legislation,
like we do with legislation just across vari- — various topics — a
variety of topics.  
   
The Biden administration has deepened our partnership with Taiwan and
will continue to do so with effective diplomatic, economic, and military
support.   
   
Look, we appreciate the strong bipartis- — bipartisan support for Taiwan
and want to work with Congress to strengthen that support.  But again,
this bill — as we understand it or as I understand it — is still being
worked out through the Senate and will run through a whole process, as
you know, as the Senate works.  And so, we just don’t want to get ahead
of that process at this time.  
   
Q    But still, today, do you think this bill is coherent with the One
China policy as it stands?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m going to let the process continue.  It’s
going to go through multiple processes before it reaches an end.  So
we’re going to let that go through.   
   
But we appreciate the bipartisanship that we have seen when it comes to
Taiwan specifically.  
   
Q    Karine, on the economy, how concerned is the President about the
state of the economy?  And given what we saw yesterday with the Dow, is
the President at all remiss about the split-screen moment that he had on
the South Lawn?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let’s not forget the moment that we saw on the
South Lawn of the President and thousands of people coming together who
helped get the Inflation Reduction Act done was a celebration for the
American people.  It was a win for the American people.   
   
When you think about how long elected members — Democrats, in particular
— in Congress have been fighting for decades against special interest
groups — in particular, pharma — to bring costs down for Medicare,
that’s what you saw yesterday.  That’s what you saw in this fight:
lowering costs for Medicare, lowering costs for healthcare, lowering
costs on energy co- — on energy itself.  
   
As it relates to the stock market, it’s one measure of how the economy
is doing, and we are watching this closely.   
   
It’s also important to look at what’s happening on Main Street.  We have
one of the strongest job markets on record — 3.7 unemployment rate — and
we’ve created 10 million new jobs.  More people are looking for work.   
   
Because of the President’s economic plan, businesses are investing in
America at record rates, and we are making more in America.  
   
Just last week, the President visited Intel for the groundbreaking of
their new facility in Ohio that will manufacture semiconductors.   
   
And we’re — and we went to Detroit — or we’re going to Detroit, where,
because of his economic plan, the three — the Big Three car companies
are investing in new manufacturing in the United States.   
   
So we understand there’s more progress to be done.  We’re going to
continue to do that — do that work.  Gas prices, as you’ve heard us
tell, has gone down more than 90 days at — it’s gone down by $1.30 per
gallon.  And that’s the work — because of the work that this President
has done because we wanted to make sure that we’re lowering costs for
people.  
   
I know you haven’t asked a question yet.  
   
Q    Any update on UNGA: who the President will be meeting with, any
bilats, when he will be speaking?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything for you at this time. 
Nothing to — to preview.  But as I’ve noted before, he is going to be
attending UNGA.   
   
We’ll have more to share as we get closer.  
   
Q    In the past, you said food security was going to be an issue.  Any
other issues — how much Ukraine will be part of this, Russia, China?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, look, as far as Ukraine, I would point you to
their government on how they’re going to be involved in UNGA.  We’re not
going to speak for them or any other country.  
   
We can say for ourselves: The President is going to be attending, and
we’ll have more details to share down the road.  
   
Q    Is he planning to meet Prime Minister Truss either in the UK or
around UNGA or in Washington?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I don’t — just don’t have anything to preview. 
Once we do, as we always do, we will share that with all of you.   
   
Thanks, everybody.   
   
Q    Is he going to test-drive cars today?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, my gosh.  I don’t know.  I guess we’ll — it
remains to be seen.  That’ll be — I want to test.  I want to test one of
those.  (Laughs.)   
   
Q    We do too.  (Laughs.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know, right?  Okay, guys.  Thank you.
