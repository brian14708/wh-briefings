*Tokyo, Japan*

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good evening, everybody.  So I will
just give a brief recap of the Vice President’s meetings and then we’ll
give you some preview about tomorrow and then take questions.   
   
Obviously, as we said before, a core piece of the mission here was to
pay homage to Prime Minister Abe and attend the state funeral.  I think
the Vice President and the entire delegation was moved by the ceremony
and some of the speeches that were made about Abe.  And again, she
appreciated the opportunity, herself, to pay her respects to the
government and the former Prime Minister’s wife, and to the country of
Japan.   
   
She was also grateful, by the way, after the bilat — which I’ll describe
in a minute — with Prime Minister Kishida to attend a dinner along with
the presidential delegation.  It was very generous of the Prime
Minister, who’s organizing this big state funeral, to take the time to
host a dinner for the Vice President and the entire U.S. presidential
delegation.   
   
But as we also said, in addition to paying tribute to the former Prime
Minister, the Vice President was also here to strengthen our relations
with Japan and beyond in this region.  She had the opportunity to meet
not just with Prime Minister Kishida, but also Prime Minister Han of the
Republic of Korea, and Prime Minister Albanese of Australia.   
   
And without, you know, walking you through all the topics of each
meeting, I’ll just sort of give an overview of the core messages because
they were very similar in each one.   
   
She was here in Japan, in the region, to underscore our commitment to
the Indo-Pacific region that ties in with Prime Minister Abe’s legacy,
which was important in strengthening the U.S-Japan alliance, but also
coining this notion of a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”   
   
So it was actually nice for the Vice President to meet with the leaders
of Japan, South Korea, and Australia.  And in all of those meetings, she
underscored the strength of those security alliances.   
   
Obviously, this is a turbulent time in the region.  There are security
challenges in a number of places — most recently, ballistic missile
tests from the DPRK; recent Chinese provocations, we think, in the
Taiwan Strait.   
   
And so in all these meetings she was interested in underscoring for the
leaders, for our counterparts, the strength of our alliances.  And I
think what was clear in the discussions is a real alignment between the
United States and these three countries on the security challenges that
we face and on the responses that are appropriate.   
   
And she really emphasized something that’s been a key theme of the
Biden-Harris administration from the start, which is cooperation with
allies and partners on key challenges around the world, including
security challenges.   
   
And we’ll let those other countries themselves characterize their views,
but I think it’s probably fair to say that they appreciated her presence
here.  Certainly, the Japanese expressed gratitude to the Vice President
to coming — to coming here — again, not just for the state funeral, but
to build on our bilateral alliance.  They expressed appreciation for the
U.S. role in the region — which I think they all see as critical — and
an interest in deepening our ties, which is an interest that we
expressed as well.  
   
On one specific issue that I know is of interest to everybody, and I’ll
just mention because it came up in all the meetings, which is Taiwan. 
And the Vice President reiterated our consistent view that Chinese
actions have been provocative and unnecessary.  And the United States
policy is to oppose any unilateral change in the status quo.  We
continue to support Taiwan’s self-defense.   
   
It’s important to us to work with allies and partners on this issue. 
And that’s one of the reasons that she brought it up in all of these
bilateral meetings and why they discussed it, because we need to be
aligned.  And I think we are significantly aligned.  Our allies share
the concerns that I articulated.  And I think there was a mutual
commitment by all the countries involved to peace and security in the
Taiwan Strait.   
   
That’s what I wanted to offer in terms of the summary of the meetings. 
I think what we’ll do now is ask \[senior administration official\] to
give you a preview of tomorrow’s activities, and then we can take
whatever questions you might have.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay, so for tomorrow, as most of you
are tracking, we have two main events, which the way we’re sort of
thinking about it is: You’ve heard the Vice President speak a lot over
the trip about security and prosperity — sort of a two-pronged approach
— so tomorrow’s events are sort of bringing that to light.   
   
The morning is obviously focusing on the economic front.  The afternoon
— with our CEO roundtable.  And the afternoon is more focused on the
security front, going to Yokosuka Naval Base.   
   
So for the CEO roundtable, we will get you a list of participants and
companies.  But the idea is that these are Japanese business executives
who are active in the semiconductor industry — different forms of the
supply chain related to semiconductors.   
   
The Vice President feels very strongly in the power of — the convening
power of the office.  So she is bringing together these executives for a
discussion on a few things, all sort of based on the CHIPS and Science
Act.  She will tout the accomplishment of the Biden-Harris
administration, including signing the CHIPS and Science Act, but then
sort of talk about next steps and how it will work in practice and what
it means in the Japan and Indo-Pacific context.  
   
So there’ll be a conversation on — sort of a three-part conversation, I
should say.  One is about investment in the United States manufacturing
— semiconductor manufacturing — and the benefits of that, how it will
work under the CHIPS Act, and the associated incentives.  
   
Two will be on supply chain resiliency and the importance of
diversifying supply chains to prevent against disruptions.   
   
And three will be a focus on innovation and the research and development
component of the CHIPS and Science Act.  The U.S. and Japan have a long
history of collaboration on this stuff.  So the Vice President views
this and the investments that we’re making in R&D as sort of a next
phase of our cooperation on science and technology stuff.  So she’ll be
very interested to hear their thoughts on where this goes next, et
cetera.   
   
And I would say, I think the Vice President feels very strongly in the
connection between domestic and foreign policy.  So when she travels
abroad, you will see more of this, and she wants to do more of this:
this idea of, you know, making the case to the American people of why
our engagement overseas benefits them.  And I think this is sort of case
in point on that.   
   
The afternoon, we will go to your Yokosuka Naval Base, which is the
largest naval installment here in Japan.  And she will board the USS
Howard and take a tour, meet with commanders, meet with service
members.  And then the main, sort of, draw will be remarks to service
members.   
   
So, as you can expect, she will generally thank the service members
assembled there for their service and their work.  But I think the crux
of the remarks will be to connect what they do every day to our broader
national security and foreign policy goals, which are, one, sort of, you
know, protect the freedom of the seas, freedom of navigation, uphold
international law, and make the case about international commerce — the
free flow of commerce and how their work is really, you know, protecting
the billions of dollars of trade that go through the waters of this
region every day.   
   
And then she’ll talk about their work strengthening our alliances, how
their presence here is really a pillar of our security alliance with
Japan.   
   
And then, as you’ve heard her talk about many times, the sort of — the
international rules-based order — she will speak about how she views
that, its importance, and then she will get into, sort of, the threats
to the international rules-based order and how she sees them, both
recent provocations across the Taiwan Strait, other coercive behavior
which we find disturbing that seeks to — and those that seek to
undermine the rules-based order.  So she’ll speak about that and what we
are doing to sort of push back against those efforts and stand up for
the international rules and norms that have guided this region for the
past 70 years.   
   
So, with that, I think we’ll open up for a few questions.  
   
Q    Can I kick off with — I mean, you mentioned — you brought up Taiwan
and, kind of, similarities across allies.  I wanted to talk a little bit
about, maybe, some differences in emphasis across these alliances.  
   
President Yoon, for instance, in an interview that aired on Sunday,
spoke about how he thinks there might be a little bit of a difference in
terms of where you see the primary threat being China, Taiwan; him
seeing the primary security threat being North Korea and thinking that
that’s where the priority should be in dealing with that.  
   
Could you talk a little bit about that?  
 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I would say that we don’t see those two
things as “either/or.”  I think we agree with President Yoon that North
Korean ballistic missile tests and potential nuclear tests are
destabilizing, and we condemn them.  And the most recent ones are yet
another violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions, and we
absolutely stand by our commitments to the Republic of Korea, which is
something the Vice President reiterated in the meeting with the Prime
Minister.   
   
So I use the word “alignment,” and I think it applies.  We recognize
those threats and stand by the Republic of Korea in dealing with
them.   
   
But we also have concerns about Chinese actions in the Taiwan Strait, so
I don’t feel like it’s a question of, you know, which one is a bigger
concern, which ally ranks one above the other.  I do think it’s fair to
say, as I’ve described it, as increasing the alignment on both of those
and other challenges.  
   
Q    The Biden administration has — I mean, President Biden said
recently to “60 Minutes” that he would be prepared to send troops if
China did invade.  Have you received assurances or any commitments from
the Japanese on this trip on what they would do as well if China’s
aggression continues and, specifically, if there is progress on
increasing defense spending?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it’s only for me to
characterize what the United States would do, and that’s something that
the President addressed himself.  Japan can speak for itself on
hypotheticals and contingencies.   
   
What I think I can say is that, in discussing the issue, like us, they
are concerned and oppose any potential unilateral changes to the status
quo and are aligned with the United States in standing for peace and
security in the Taiwan Strait and deepening relations with Taiwan.  
   
Q    Did the Vice President also make any commitments or, you know,
discuss any specifics with the South Korean Prime Minister when it comes
to the tax credit issue with electric vehicles?  I know the readout said
they discussed it and she would continue (inaudible), but was there any
sort of plan finalized, any commitments made by the U.S. when it comes
to that?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The Vice President was not there to
negotiate an approach to the issue of electric vehicles that they did
discuss.  
   
     The readout said they discussed it because they did, which won’t
surprise you.  The South Koreans have articulated concerns about what is
in the law.  We were well aware of that, obviously; they’ve been public
about it.   
   
What the Vice President did was explain our view, which is as follows:
that this law is really a good thing for Americans, the world, and the
planet, in terms of what it does for clean energy and climate.   
   
We think that the South Koreans and all of our partners in this region
and beyond recognize that, so it’s a hugely important step on the
climate front and dealing with the climate crisis.  
   
It has, again, we think, many benefits for American workers, for
American jobs, for American exporters, but also for other countries,
including South Korea and Japan will be able to benefit from this.   
   
 It also has a particular provision that the South Koreans have concerns
about and raised with the Vice President.  And we have heard those
concerns widely.  She listened very carefully and made clear our
commitment to work in the U.S. government — the U.S. Trade
Representative, the Treasury Department — as we look at the
implementation of this law to help address that issue.  And that process
is going on now, and extensive conversations have taken place.   
   
Q    Can you preview what those talks might look like this week with
South Korean officials?  And is there any possible workaround on this? 
I mean, it doesn’t seem — it seems pretty clear there’s not going to be
a change to the actual legislation.  But is there any workaround,
possibly involving, like, state governments or local governments working
with South Korean companies (inaudible)?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don’t want to speculate on what could
come out of these talks.  All I can say is that we listen carefully,
because it’s such a close and important ally; we take the concern
seriously; and we pledged to put our experts together to work on the
issue.  But I’m not going to speculate about what could come out of
those talks.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) about the trilateral relationship — you know, U.S.,
Japan, South Korea, (inaudible).  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  
 

Q    But obviously, there’s issues within Japan and South Korea.  How do
those issues affect the U.S.’s efforts to kind of bolster the trilateral
if you don’t have a good bilateral between Japan and South Korea?  And
what is she doing to advance that on this trip?  

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So we think a strong and close
relationship between Japan and the Republic of Korea is in our
interest.  You mentioned there are issues between those two countries. 
There obviously are — historical.  There are issues between lots of
countries.   
  
In this case, we’re gratified to see that both countries seem determined
to address those issues, I think, you know, with a new vigor.   
  
President Yoon has made a real priority of addressing this issue.  He’s
been quite public about it.  And it feels to us like Japan is interested
in reciprocating because they see a mutual interest in strengthening
their relationship.   
  
It’s not for us to mediate or negotiate or broker what that relationship
and how it advances should look like.  But as I said at the top, it is
certainly in our interest, in this geostrategic environment that I
described, to see two of our closest allies in the world working even
better with each other, so bilaterally and then trilaterally with us.  
  
So, we’re going to continue to encourage that.  The Vice President did
it in her meetings here in Tokyo.   
  
Q    On Taiwan, just to clarify, did she bring up the Taiwan (inaudible)
meeting?  Or did the other countries bring it up?  
  
And more specifically, did the President’s “60 Minutes” interview come
up or the Speaker’s trip to Taiwan come up at all?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think the Speaker’s trip to Taiwan is
the backdrop to the discussions that took place in some of these
meetings, in the sense that when I said that they talked about Chinese
overreaction, that’s what they were overreacting to.    
  
And the most recent developments in and around Taiwan was what we
consider to be Chinese overreaction, and firing missiles over the island
and so on.  
  
So it came up in that sense. It wasn’t a discussion of the Speaker’s
trip, per se. But obviously, that’s the context that has set off the
most recent set of discussions and focus on this issue.  
  
I don’t believe that the President’s “60 Minutes” issue — or interview
came up. There was a broader discussion of — you know, in the context of
a discussion of the geopolitical environment and security challenges we
all face, this was among– among the top ones.   

Q    And, I’m sorry, just one last thing on the trilateral thing.  You
said that the Vice President has been encouraging this, this better
relationship.  What did she say in that meeting?  What is she doing to
do that, just specifically?  
  
     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Made clear what I summarized,
which is the United States wants to see it’s — it’s —  
  
     Q    But she didn’t say like, “Hey, we’ll host a meeting.  We’ll —
we’re going to — you know, you should do this.  You should think about
that”?  Like, nothing — I’m talking like as specific as you can get on
that.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Like I said, we don’t see it to be our
role to —  
  
 Q    But she didn’t say, like, “Hey…” —  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  She wants — she wanted both sides to
know that we welcome the process that we’re seeing and what the
leadership on both sides was doing.  
  
Q    Can you talk a little bit about the trip to the DMZ, like how long
it’s been in the works, whether the Prime Minister stepped on her moment
in announcing it, whether that came up in some of the talks and
conversations?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, no, I mean, the — what is typical —
my understanding of what is typical for DMZ: We typically wouldn’t
announce that that far in advance for a variety of reasons.  But we are
obviously planning to announce that today, and we are happy to announce
that.  And as you saw in the statement we put out shortly after, we are
prepared to announce that.  
  
The planning behind it, I would say — look, any trip to South Korea, any
U.S. official comes, it’s always an option.  It’s always on the table. 
And so based off the discussions both internally and with the embassy as
we’ve structured it over the — this trip over the past two weeks, we
sort of came to the conclusion that it made sense and that it was
advantageous to go to signal the support for the Republic of Korea; to
signal, you know, our commitment.  
  
The key messaging that she’s talking about on this trip is how our
defense commitments are ironclad.  We know there’s been a lot of
discussions with the Koreans about extended deterrence commitments.  And
to really put those words into action, we believe it’s a powerful signal
of that.  
  
So after, you know, discussions internally, we sort of came to the
conclusion that this was an important stop for her to make.  

Q    Was the test launch — I’m sorry.  Go ahead.  
  
Q    Was there any exchange in the bilat though about, you know, this is
our news to announce or, you know, (inaudible) came up.  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were comfortable with it.  We were
going, obviously, to announce it soon anyway.  But I would just
reinforce the policy point.  And I think, you know, you can check with
the South Koreans themselves in terms of welcoming it — because, going
back to your very first question, you know, about the different threats,
this is a demonstration of our interest in this issue.

And I think the Vice President showing up there makes very clear to our
friends and allies in South Korea that even when there are other threats
in the region — you know, to Taiwan — which is more important, whatever
— we’re not losing sight of the fact that the DPRK remains a real
threat.  I mentioned the recent ballistic missile tests.  
  
And so there’s no issue there in terms of, you know, announcing it and
differences over announcing it.  We get the impression that they are —
they will be very happy to see the Vice President demonstrate our
solidarity in this way.  
  
Q    I’m curious if, in any of your conversations with Japanese
officials on this trip, you discussed Russia’s move to expel one of
their officials and accuse them of spying this week.  Did that come up
at all?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don’t recall that coming up.  But
the issue of Ukraine and Russia’s unjust and unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine certainly came up.  And if I didn’t say that at the top, you
know, let me say it, because we’ve been mostly focused on the security
picture here in the region and alignment on Taiwan, DPRK.  But we feel
there’s also alignment on responding to Russia’s invasion.  And we’re
grateful for that.  
  
Europe is a long way away.  But, one, we want to see our allies in
Europe and Asia cooperate with each other.  And we mentioned before the
Vice President’s emphasis on international rules and norms, and
certainly sovereignty and territorial integrity is in that category,
just like it is for countries in this part of the world.  And the
Japanese and South Korean solidarity, in terms of imposing costs on
Russia and demonstrating support for Ukraine, which was invaded, has
been really impressive.  And so we appreciate that from these close
Asian allies.  
  
Q    Is it still accurate that China has not crossed your red lines with
respect to the support for Russia, either militarily or in terms of
sanctions evasion?  

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that’s fair to say.  
  
Q    There’s been some discussion about AUKUS and where the
nuclear-powered submarines are going to be built.  Any progress in
building those in the United States?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don’t have anything for you on
that.  
  
 Q    Okay.  Is that under consideration?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the issue of building those
submarines is obviously a key part of the AUKUS discussions, and those
conversations go on.  
  
Q    Okay.  
  
 Q    When are we going to get the list of CEOs and companies for
tomorrow?  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we can do it shortly right
after this.  
  
 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, we’ll send you an email on the
companies that are participating after this.  
  
 Q    Bloomberg is intensely interested in that.  (Laughter.)  
  
 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It will be in your inbox soon.  
  
Q    Is it fair to say the test launch kind of sealed the deal on the
visit to the DMZ?  I mean, was the — North Korea’s test launch.  I mean,
was that kind of the moment where it was like, we have to do this — we
have to do this (inaudible)?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think our commitment to the
Republic of Korea and its security and our concerns about — you know,
there have been a lot of ballistic missile tests recently.  So, no,
that’s not the case.  That’s not the case.  
  
  Q    And clarification: When she was discussing Taiwan, did she echo
the President’s recent language in describing what the U.S. would do if
China were to invade?  Did she say that we’re prepared to send in U.S.
troops?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Like I said, the President’s particular
remarks in “60 Minutes” didn’t come up.  What she said was reiterating
all of our policy, as the President has articulated, but they didn’t
interrogate her on that specific (inaudible).  
  
 Q    But was she forthcoming in saying that the U.S. would send U.S.
troops if China invaded?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They didn’t get into detail on military
contingencies.  She expressed our clear and resolute support for
Taiwan’s self-defense, and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. 
But there was no specific discussion of who would do what in a military
contingency.  
  
 Q    So she didn’t mention sending U.S. troops?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There was no specific discussion of
that issue.  
  
Q    Did she seek their support for some kind of a deterrence package,
whether that be sanctions or whatever, to prevent the Chinese from
moving in that direction?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don’t want to get into details of
responses discussed.  I described earlier an alignment on how to
preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.  
  
 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we have time for about one
more question, and then we got to run.  I know everyone is tired.  
  
Q    Do you see any room for, like, trilateral cooperation on military
signals, especially as it relates to North Korea?  I mean, I know the
Vice President specifically brought up trilateral cooperation today. 
You made a lot of comments about that.   
  
It seems that South Korea very much wants, sort of, signals of U.S.
military strength and South Korean military strength.  Japan seems
interested.  Do you think this is something that everybody could work
together on and show some — signal deterrence or something moving
forward?  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You know, I described generally the
interest in trilateral cooperation and alignment on security issues, but
on specific North Korean contingencies, I don’t have anything to add to
the general point I made.  
  
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, I think that about does it. 
We’ll talk more tomorrow, but that’s where we are.  
  
Q    Thank you.  
  
                               END
