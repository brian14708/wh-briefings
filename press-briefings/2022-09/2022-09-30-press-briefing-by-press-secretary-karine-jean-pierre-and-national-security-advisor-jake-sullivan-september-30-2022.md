  \ Advisor Jake Sullivan, September 30,\_2022"

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:01 P.M. EDT   
      
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Happy Friday.

Q    Happy Friday.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So, today was a historic day for the country. 
We should all be proud of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and her historic
investiture to the United States Supreme Court.  
   
More than 100 justices have served on the — on the United States Supreme
Court over the past 200 years.  But today, for the first time, Americans
and people across the world will see four women sitting on the bench. 
And today, for the first time, Americans will see a Black woman serving
on our nation’s highest court.  
   
This is a proud day for America, for our democracy, and in particular
for women and Black women.  
   
This fulfills major promises President Biden made — to help make sure
our Supreme Court bench reflects the diversity of our nation, and, more
broadly, to strengthen the judiciary by fighting to nominate and confirm
federal judges at a fast rate.  
   
He promised his nominees would be experienced, committed to the rule of
law, and that they would represent diverse personal and professional
backgrounds.  
   
Since taking office, President Biden has made 143 nominations. 
Eighty-four have been confirmed, which is stand-out progress.  And of
his 143 nominees, 68 percent have been women and 66 percent are people
of color.  
   
He’s nominated groundbreaking “first” who would be the first Black,
Latino, and AAPI judge to serve in their circuit or district around the
country.  
   
Today, as we celebrate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson investiture, we
also want to celebrate the many others across the country making
history.  And the President is going to keep building on what he sees as
one of his proudest accomplishments, and he thanks the Senate for their
leadership on this issue as well. 

Finally, as I — as you heard directly from President — from the
President a short time ago, our hearts are with everyone impacted by
Hurricanes Ian and also Hurricane Fiona.

The President remains in regular touch with the state and local
officials, and spoke with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and South
Carolina Governor Henry McMaster this morning.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell is also on the ground in Florida
today.  Since before the storm made landfall, President Biden has been
clear that it is a priority for the entire administration to get those
impacted by the storm help that they need.

One week ago, the President issued an emergency declaration for Florida,
which meant we could pre-position teams and resources like food, water,
and generators on the ground.

Yesterday, the President did the same thing for South Carolina in
anticipation of the storm hitting there.

Currently — currently, efforts are focused on saving lives and search
and rescue as part of an unprecedented level of coordination with the
Florida National Guard and state and local responders.

Teams started search and rescue missions before daylight yesterday and
are continuing that effort today.  By the end of yesterday, they had
already saved hundreds of lives and completed thousands of structural
assessments, allowing people to safely return to their homes.

Federal teams are continuing to assess damage and work to restore
critical services, ensuring emergency power is available to critical
infrastructure like hospitals, and evaluating bridges, airports, and
ports as well.

We’re also continuing to support the people of Puerto Rico as they
recover from Hurricane Fiona.  We’re providing support for emergency
response, recovery, and power restoration efforts and recovering one hu-
— and covering 100 percent of the cost of public assistance, debris
removal, and more.

We have a — we have over 1,000 federal response workers on the ground,
and we are providing millions of dollars to repair highways and bridges
as well.

We are also investing millions of dollars to make Puerto Rico’s
infrastructure, including its power grid, more resilient to climate
change.

The people of Florida, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and everyone
impacted by these storms have the full support — the full support of the
federal government.

And as you can see, today, finally, we are joined by National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan at the podium to talk about the United States’
response to Russia’s attempts to annex parts of sovereign Ukraine.

And with that, I will let Jake take to the podium.  Go ahead, Jake. 
Thank you for being here.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Karine.  As Karine said, I will have an update
for you all on Russia, but first I want to take a moment, just as Karine
did, to acknowledge the devastation of Hurricane Ian and the millions of
people who have been impacted by this terrible storm.  And as Karine
said and the President said earlier today, our hearts are with the
people of Florida, South Carolina, and the southeast.  
   
As President Biden made clear, we’re going to do everything we can
across this White House and across this government to support the people
who have been impacted by this storm with the full resources of the
federal government as communities endeavor to recover and then to
rebuild.

I also want to say a special word of thanks to our first responders at
every level of our government for everything they are doing and for the
lifesaving and dangerous missions they have undertaken over the last two
days to keep people safe.  
   
And if you’ll indulge me just a word on what was a very important
foreign policy development yesterday, President Biden hosted a historic
U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit.  He released the first-ever
U.S.-Pacific Island Strategy.  He announced over $810 million in
additional expanded programs to help these countries combat the climate
crisis, provide development assistance, enhance maritime security, and
more.  

And finally, President Biden and all 12 Pacific Island presidents who
joined him here at the White House for this summit issued a joint
declaration to strengthen our partnership and to chart an affirmative
vision for the region.  
   
Today, as you all saw just a little bit ago, President Biden issued a
strong condemnation of Russia’s fraudulent attempt to annex sovereign
Ukrainian territory.

This act is a flagrant violation of international law, and it has no
legitimacy.

Unfortunately, it’s also not surprising.  It’s straight out of Putin’s
playbook of deceit, disinformation, and aggression, and we’ve been
warning about it for months.  In fact, I’ve stood at this podium and
warned about it several times, including as recently as last week.

Based on our information, every aspect of this process was pre-staged
and falsified under orders from the Kremlin.  
   
The sham referenda were held at gunpoint.  Ukrainian civilians were
forced to cast ballots through coercion, intimidation, and, in some
cases, under the watch of armed guards.

Saying that it somehow reflects the will of the people is an
absurdity.  
   
The United States will never recognize these actions.  The world will
never recognize these actions.

And we still stay the course, as the President told you earlier today. 
We have built, led, and maintained an extraordinary and coordinated
response with our allies and partners, and that response will continue. 
As President Biden said, we will not be deterred.  
   
So, what does that mean specifically in reaction to what has just
happened?

First, as we saw from the Treasury Department and as the President
underscored, we are sending a clear warning from the United States
government, supported by all of our G7 partners, that we will sanction
and impose export controls on any individual, entity, or country that
provides political or economic support to these attempts at annexation. 
We have put in place authorities to enable us to do that rapidly and
efficiently.

We are also announcing new sanctions today that target additional
Russian government officials and leaders, including State Duma members
who are accomplices in these fraudulent actions, and including the
central bank governor.   
   
We are also sanctioning Russian and Belarusian military officials, and
we have specifically targeted defense procurement networks, including
international suppliers supporting Russia’s military-industrial
complex.  
   
Second, we will continue to provide military equipment so that Ukraine
can defend its territory and its freedom.

Today, President Biden will sign legislation from Congress that contains
more than $12 billion in additional funding for Ukraine.  And we are
grateful for the continued support.  There is no stronger, more
bipartisan rebuke of what Russia has just done, no more timely rebuke,
and no more assertive statement that we can make through resources, and
not just through words, that we are going to continue to help Ukraine
defend its territory and to de-occupy those parts that Russia has
occupied.  
   
Earlier this week, we announced a significant new billion-dollar arms
package, which included 18 new HIMARS for Ukraine as part of our
long-term commitment to strengthening Ukraine’s armed forces over the
years ahead.  And we expect to have another announcement of immediate
security assistance to announce next week.  
   
Next, the United States and the international community have been
crystal-clear that we will use diplomatic tools at our disposal to
fundamentally reject Russia’s attempts to take its neighbor’s territory
by force.   
   
Today, the United States is supporting a resolution at the U.N. Security
Council to condemn these sham referenda and to call on Russia
immediately to withdraw its forces from Ukraine.  
   
If Russia seeks to shield itself at the Security Council, the United
Nations will work with partners around the world to take action next
week at the U.N. General Assembly.  
   
Leaders around the world have spoken out about what’s at stake: the
independence of the democratic nation of Ukraine, the principles of
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the very foundation of the
United Natio- — United Nations Charter and the modern international
order.  
   
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations said yesterday, quote,
“It must not be accepted.”  And it will not be accepted.  To put it
simply, the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia
remain Ukrainian territory.  
   
Ukraine has every right to continue to defend its sovereignty, which the
people of Ukraine are doing bravely and courageously every day with the
support of the international community.  And the United States, for our
part, under President Biden’s leadership, will support them at every
step along the way for as long as it takes.  
   
And with that, I’d be happy to take your questions.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Ukraine is seeking accelerated membership in NATO.  Is that
something that’s possible or something you would seriously consider?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The United States has been clear for decades that we
support an open-door policy for NATO.  Any decision on NATO membership
is between the 30 Allies and the countries aspiring to join.  
   
Right now, our view is that the best way for us to support Ukraine is
through practical, on-the-ground support in Ukraine, and that the
process in Brussels should be taken up at a different time.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  In his speech this morning, the President called the
Nord Stream pipeline attacks, quote, “a deliberate act of sabotage.” 
And he said, “…now the Russians are pumping out \[mis\]information and
lies” about it.  Should we take that to mean that the U.S. now believes
that Russia was likely responsible for this act of sabotage?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, Russia has done what it frequently does when
it is responsible for something, which is make accusations that it was
really someone else who did it.  We’ve seen this repeatedly over time.  
   
But the President was also clear today that there is more work to do on
the investigation before the United States government is prepared to
make an attribution in this case.  One of the practical reasons for that
is that because gas is emanating from these pipelines, the Danish
authorities and other authorities in the Baltic Sea can’t actually get
down to the source of the leak to do forensics on what appears to be an
explosion.   
   
So we will have to wait until a combination of physical inspection,
intelligence gathering, and consultation with our allies to make a
definitive determination.  
   
But what we can say unequivocally is the suggestions Russia has made
about the United States and other countries are flat-out false.  Russia
knows they’re false.  But, of course, this is part of their playbook.  
   
Q    But how many countries or entities are even capable of carrying out
the kind of attack that we saw with hundreds of kilograms of explosives,
250 feet below the surface of the sea?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Not many.  And I think this is obviously an act of
sabotage that took place, we believe, in the neighborhood of 70 to 80
meters — 230 to 270 feet — under the ocean.  You know, that takes some
degree of sophistication.  
   
But I don’t want to get ahead of myself in terms of asserting how
exactly this happened or who exactly did it until we’re standing on
solid ground.  We will continue to work with our allies and partners to
gather all of the facts, and then we will make a determination about
where we go from there.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Jake, two questions.  Putin clearly had nuclear weapons on his mind
today when he was giving this speech.  He said the West is “deceitful,”
“hypocritical.”  “The United States is the only country to have used
nuclear weapons.”  And he said, “By the way, they’ve created a
precedent.”  How worrying is that to you?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ve been clear myself, President Biden has been clear,
our administration has been clear that there is a risk, given all of the
loose talk and the nuclear saber-rattling by Putin, that he would
consider this.  And we’ve been equally clear about what the consequences
would be.  We have communicated that directly to the Russians.  
   
We do not presently see indications about the imminent use of nuclear
weapons.  We are, of course, monitoring that carefully and staying in
close consultation with allies and partners.  
   
But this is something that we are attuned to, taking very seriously, and
communicating directly with Russia about, including the kind of decisive
responses the United States would have if they went down that dark
road.  
   
Q    Is the risk of that higher now than it was six or seven months
ago?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, what’s interesting is that at various points over
the course of this conflict, including right at the outset, Putin has
brandished the nuclear card.  He’s doing it again.  So the risk has been
there from the start.  It’s there today.  I’m not going to characterize
its exact level, only to say that we have been taking this seriously for
some time, and we continue to take it seriously now.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    And can I ask one broader question before you move on?  What
lessons from 2014 and from Crimea are you using now?  What did you learn
from that that you’re — that you’re applying here?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, there’s a number of — just in terms of the tactics
of how things unfolded in Crimea, including the fact that you didn’t
have the kind of sustained military conflict associated with it that you
do in these cases, that means you cannot draw the analogy too far.  
   
On the other hand, one of the things that we have been clear about from
the start of this conflict — and even in the months that preceded it,
when I stood at this podium and warned that it was coming — is that we
were going to be prepared with clear, swift, and very certain
responses.  
   
And so when I stand here before you today to talk about sanctions, to
talk about new funding, to talk about new transfers of military
equipment, and diplomatic initiatives that are unfolding the very day
that Putin gives his speech, that is all the product of months of
planning and coordination with our allies and partners so that we do not
allow time to elapse, so that we seize the diplomatic initiative, and so
that we communicate very clearly: We will not accept this, and we will
help equip the Ukrainians to push back aggressively against it, even as
we rally the international community to condemn it.  
   
That has been our strategy from the start.  We have tried to be as clear
and transparent about that as possible, warning what was going to come,
indicating what we would do, and then following through and doing it. 
And that’s what we’re doing today.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  Would the U.S. actively enter the war if Putin used
nukes on Ukraine?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I have said before that we have had the opportunity
to communicate directly to Russia a range of consequences for the use of
nuclear weapons and the kinds of actions the United States would take. 
I have also said before that we are not going to telegraph these things
publicly.  
   
And so, all I can tell you is that the Russians understand where things
stand on this issue.  We understand where things stand on this issue. 
And I will leave it at that.  
   
Q    Does it — do we run the risk, though, if we’re not moving more
firepower to Europe right now, that we would be unprepared for a serious
response if he were to take that kind of action tomorrow?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  President Biden, even before this conflict began, moved a
substantial number of additional U.S. forces on land, sea, and air to
Europe.  
   
After the conflict got underway, within 72 hours, he had ordered the
movement of even more forces beyond that.  So we are standing at a level
of enhanced force posture across the eastern flank, in the major
maritime domains.   
   
And with all of the capabilities we need in the air as well, we feel
that we have in place, right now, the capacity to effectively deter and
respond to any contingency and to make good on what President Biden
emphatically reinforced today — that we will defend every inch of NATO
territory.  The United States has put in place the pieces for that.   
   
And if you look at what our NATO allies have done, in terms of surging
their own capabilities to eastern flank allies, upping their own defense
expenditures, we are at a level, a state of readiness to take on any
contingency, and we’re doing the active coordination and scenario
planning to be prepared for whatever comes our way.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    And is there anything we can do to protect energy infrastructure
now, before something that’s actually in use gets attacked in Europe?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The President mentioned today, actually, in response to a
question, that we have, in fact, begun coordinating with allies to
increase surveillance and monitoring of energy infrastructure, including
pipelines in the Baltic Sea.  And we will continue to work closely with
Norway and other countries that have come out publicly and announced
that they are stepping up their efforts in that regard.  
   
The United States has capabilities to be able to bring to bear, and we
are bringing those to bear.  
   
Q    Can you describe a little for us about the scenario planning?  I
would think that when this war began, there was a certain category of
planning that has gone on.  And how significantly has that changed as
the facts have changed, as these threats have changed?  
   
And does it suggest that this is a very dynamic situation where — is the
President engaged in approving new plans on a frequent basis?  Or is
this something that is part of a ready playbook that would already be at
the disposal of the Department of Defense?  Or is this something that’s
being retooled in real time?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  There are elements that are consistent and elements that
are dynamic.  And what I mean by that is: From the very beginning, we’ve
known the broad categories of forms of escalation that Russia could
conceivably undertake.  We’ve known the broad categories of
contingencies that we might face, our allies might face, and Ukraine
might face.  
   
But of course, as time goes on and circumstances change on the
battlefield and broader diplomatic circumstances change, and as we
gather new intelligence, we can refine the contingency planning within
those broad categories to be more specific about different scenarios.  
   
And so, over time, the President gets updates on the intelligence,
updates on the likelihood or lack — lack of likelihood of different
circumstances, and refinements in the planning that’s taking place
across every element of our government, including the Defense
Department, the intelligence community, the State Department, USAID, the
Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation.  
   
We have people — experts from across our government working on a range
of contingencies.  And the President is in regular touch with his
National Security Council principals to get updates on this and to give
direction about how to continue to refine and sharpen these plans.  
   
The other thing that’s happened is you’ve seen this steady stream of
engagement — engagements President Biden has had with foreign
counterparts, particularly in NATO, the G7, the European Union.  That
has been an opportunity to engage on different scenarios and to make
sure that the leaders of these countries are directing their teams to
coordinate together so that we can have a common playbook for how we
respond in different circumstances.  
   
That’s been a very important planning function that’s almost
unprecedented in the intensity and frequency of engagement at the leader
level in a circumstance like this.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Jake, I — I wanted to ask you about the sanctions.  I know we’ve
had batches of sanctions rolled out for last six, seven months.  And I
wanted you to help us understand what makes you all confident that these
latest sanctions would deter or change Putin’s behavior when thus far we
have not seen his behavior change.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, so, first, one of the key elements of our sanctions
strategy has been to reduce the capacity of the Russian military machine
to regenerate its ability to threaten Ukraine.  And we think we have had
an impact on that, denying inputs to the weapons of war that Putin wants
to manufacture and place on the battlefield.  
   
Second, we have wanted to undermine Russia’s major sectors in
technology, in industry, and, of course, in defense so that its capacity
to project power, threaten and coerce its neighbors, and wage wars of
aggression is reduced over time.  And we think that there is
demonstrable progress on that front as well.  
   
Third, we want to send a clear message to the rest of the world that
those companies, those individuals, and those countries that are going
to stand beside Russia on this issue of illegal annexation, they will
subject themselves to sanctions. And we do believe that that will have a
considerable deterrent effect and have seen that in other
circumstances.  
   
So, for all of these reasons, we feel that the sanctions element of our
strategy, the economic pressure that we are placing on Russia, and the
denial of their ability to gather what they need to be able to
regenerate their war machine, this has been a critical element to how we
have prosecuted our strategy so far.  And the impacts of it will
continue to be felt month on month as we go forward and put us in a
stronger position and Russia in a more disadvantaged position as this
unfolds.  
   
Q    Jake, one follow on annexation.  Can I just ask, real quick, on —
on sort of the broader view of U.S. policy on annexation: Is it U.S.
policy that any land gained by defensive or offensive war cannot be
legally annexed?   
   
MR. SULLICAN:  It is the U.S. policy that the attempt to annex at the
point of a gun to conquer territory, hold sham referenda, and then
declare that territory your sovereign territory and not your neighbor’s
sovereign territory is as flagrant a violation of the U.N. Charter as
possible.  
   
And this case is cut and dried.  And it’s for that reason that the U.N.
Secretary-General — who has been a careful voice, a neutral arbiter in
multiple efforts on diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine over the last
six months — came out with an absolutely unequivocal statement in this
regard yesterday.  And every word of it is something that the
international community can collectively stand behind.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Do Russia’s actions give you any second thoughts about enacting the
oil price cap policy, which essentially would, you know, encourage
countries to buy Russian oil at a discount as opposed to a full-out
global ban?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We’re continuing down the road of negotiating alongside
our G7 partners and working with countries who are purchasers or
prospective purchasers of Russian oil — what the parameters in terms of
a price cap would look like.  
   
We are not currently discussing a change in that policy, but rather
continuing to find ways to both protect global energy markets and to
deny revenues to Putin to feed his war machine.  
   
That is our fundamental objective.  We believe this is the best method
by which to achieve that objective.  And we’re not looking at a
fundamental course correction on that at this time.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Are you concerned there could be attacks on U.S. and Western
infrastructure after the Nord Stream 1 incident?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We have to be concerned about the possibility of Russian
action, Russian aggression against Western infrastructure, Western
facilities.  We have been concerned about that from the beginning of the
war.  
   
We don’t have any specific intelligence to share with you today on
that.  But that is the reason we do contingency planning.  It is the
reason that we send strong deterrent messages like the President today
saying that the United States will defend every inch of NATO
territory.   
   
And it’s why the President said today that we’ve elevated our
surveillance and monitoring of critical infrastructure in NATO
territory, in the event that it is put at risk, either physically or
through cyber means or otherwise.  And we will continue to do that.  
   
Q    So you would say there is a heightened concern about that
possibility?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, before this war even began, I stood at this podium
and said the possibility that we could see attacks in the United States
— cyberattacks — or we could see attacks in Europe, whether physical or
cyber, was real.  It was real then.  It remains real today.  And what
happened with Nord Stream 1 and 2 only reminds us that it is real.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you.  There is a clear nexus between Russia and Iran
regarding the drone program that threatens Ukraine.  How worried are you
about this?  And is there any way to stop it?   
   
And will you impose more sanctions on Iran in the aftermath of the
killing of Ms. Amini that you yourself condemned?  And also, they issued
some sanctions, but do we expect more sanctions on the Iranian regime?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We continue to condemn the brutality and the repression
against the brave citizens of Iran, the brave women of Iran, who are
simply marching for their rights and their dignity and their justice. 
And we continue to stand with them — not just in word, but in deed.   
   
We have issued several sanctions against Iranian entities for what they
have done in this killing and brutality.  And, yes, we will continue to
look for targets to impose sanctions in response to these brutal human
rights violations.  
   
We have also issued sanctions with respect to the transfer of UAVs from
Iran to Russia.  And we are looking for additional methods to reduce
Iran’s capacity to be able to manufacture and then to sell these kinds
of systems to Russia.  We will continue to work on that.  
   
And the entire world should see that Russia, as it runs into problems
being able to regenerate its own capabilities, has to turn to other
countries to try to get a hold of whatever kind of precision munition it
can, including Iranian UAVs; that this is a move Russia has been forced
to make because it is being denied inputs.   
   
And we’re going to try and cut off other countries who Russia would seek
to go out and approach to get these kinds of weapons to be able to feed
their war machine in Ukraine.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Can I very quickly ask whether the profile of weapons and stuff
being sent is changing and, in particular, whether you have a view on
whether tanks should be provided to Ukraine, either by the U.S. or by
other countries facilitated by the U.S.?  
   
And separately, while we have you, it’s been about a year since that
AUKUS deal was announced.  I’m wondering if you have any update on the
status of that.  Are the Australians going to be buying American
submarines, British submarines, or a combination of the two?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Actually, our leaders just recently put out a statement
following the one-year anniversary of the AUKUS announcement, which took
place last September, just over a year ago.  And we’ve made substantial
progress over the course of the past year.  
   
We feel very good about the trilateral cooperation on the submarine
program.  We think that we have a good path forward.  
   
I’m not going to get into specifics on exactly what the nature of the
platform will be.  That — some of the details of that need to continue
to be worked out.  But even more importantly, I need to protect the
sensitivity of it.  
   
I will just say that our three countries are very much on the same page
about the path forward.  And there has been significant progress from
concept, one year ago, to now the process of actually putting this in
place.  
   
We also are pursuing a significant number of advanced capabilities
through the AUKUS partnership in cyber, artificial intelligence, and
other areas.  
   
We’ve seen significant progress on those as well, and there are certain
areas where we are looking to bring in other partners as well, as part
of an open platform approach.  
   
With respect to tanks, we actually have facilitated the provision of
tanks to Ukraine from some of our Eastern European partners who have
provided the same type of Soviet-style tanks that the Ukrainian army
trained on and is in possession of, and we will continue to do that.  
   
In terms of other weapons systems, what the President announced this
week was a further provision of HIMARS, which we have provided before. 
We expect the next package will be a re-up of many of the capabilities
that the Ukrainians have moved so effectively.  And I don’t have any
announcements of new and additional capabilities beyond that.

Q    What about NATO stand- —

Q    Mr. Sullivan —

Q    Jake, what about NA- — sorry — on NATO standard tanks — the Abrams
tanks, Leopard tanks — like a higher, more modern tank.  That’s what is
being sought by either the Ukrainians or advocates for it.  Is — are you
ruling that out or is NATO ruling that out?

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I’m not ruling anything out.  I will say I don’t have
any announcement on a U.S. tank today.  And in terms of German tanks, I
would refu- — refer you to the Germans, who were in their own
consultations with the Ukrainians on that. 

Q    Yeah, thanks, Jake.  Senators Blumenthal and Graham introduced
legislation yesterday that would cut off U.S.  military and economic aid
to nations that recognize Putin’s annexation of Ukraine.  Does the White
House support this proposal?  Or would it consider such a policy move
like this?

MR. SULLIVAN:  So I haven’t had a chance to read the legislation, and in
these circumstances, the details end up mattering.  But at a broad
level, the basic proposition that we should be imposing economic costs
on countries, individuals, and entities that are providing political and
economic support to these annexations not only do agre- — we agree with
that, I just announced that from this podium today.  We are going to do
that ourselves under executive authority.

And I want to issue a clear warning to those who would think about
providing political and economic support to these annexed territories or
to Russia’s efforts to justify and defend the annexation: You can be
subject to U.S. sanctions as a result of those activities.

We look forward to working with Senators Graham and Blumenthal on an
approach in the Congress that could be consistent with and help drive
that forward.

Q    Jake?

MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.

Q    Thank you, Jake.  A couple of questions on Ukraine, and then a
follow-up on Iran, if I may.

I’d like to get the administration’s reaction on President Zelenskyy’s
statement saying that “We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with
another president of Russia.”  That’s my first one.

And then the second one is, we understand that U.S.  diplomats have been
pressing Russia’s allies to convince Putin to deescalate.  Can you be
more specific about those kinds of overtures?  In what ways does the
administration believe that China and India can apply more pressure on
Moscow to de-escalate, not go the nuclear route?

MR. SULLIVAN:  So, on your second question, we think any country that
believes in the principles of the U.N. Charter — and, frankly, that
should be every country that signed up to the U.N. Charter — should be
taking on its measure of responsibility to communicate directly to the
Krem- — Kremlin that what it is doing is wrong, it is unjustified, and
it must stop.

And we are asking that of countries around the world.  We’d like them to
speak out publicly.  And we would like them to convey things privately
diplomatically.

With respect to the first question, which was — I’m sorry —

Q    President Zelenskyy saying that he’s ready for a dialogue with
Russia but with another president of Russia.

MR. SULLIVAN:  President Zelenskyy has consistently said throughout this
conflict that the war ultimately will end through diplomacy, and we have
consistently backed him up in that.

I would have to refer you to him on that precise statement and what he
means by it, but what I will tell you is that we have had daily
engagement with the President, his chief of staff, his foreign minister,
his defense minister, and much communication, of course, between our
military and their military, to make sure that we are understanding one
another well, that we are transparent about the support we’re providing
and the strategy they’re pursuing.  That continues today.  And that will
continue every day from here on out.

Q    But does the President share the sentiment of President Zelenskyy
that a dialogue is only possible with another president and not Vladimir
Putin?

MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t know the context of the statement, unfortunately,
so I can’t answer it in the characterization you’ve just provided it.

What I will say is that President Biden believes that a diplomatic
solution in Ukraine is possible but it is only possible according to the
basic terms of the U.N. Charter that everybody signed up to.

That’s what he said in his U.N. speech last week.  He continues to
believe that quite strongly.  And in his conversations with President
Zelenskyy, they’ve been of the same mind on that point.

Q    And a follow-up on Iran, please.  A follow-up on Iran, Jake.

Q    On the pipeline — on the pipeline and a broader question — on the
pipeline, did I hear you correctly to say that the U.S. government has
ruled out the involvement of any European allies, including Eastern
European countries, some of whom are very angry about that pipeline and
— in the sabotage?  And then —

MR. SULLIVAN:  We do not believe that this was the work of any NATO
Ally.

Q    All right.  And then more broadly, Putin, in his speech, cast this
as a kind of cultural struggle with Russia standing for tradition, and
the U.S. and the West standing for Satanism, attacking the family and
traditional values and things like that.  How do you — how do you answer
that argument?

MR. SULLIVAN:  It’s — it’s raving.  This — the fact that he’s using
words like “Satanism” is, to me, precisely the kind of over-the-top
rhetoric and ranting that you hear from someone who has no basis to
justify what is a colonial and imperial land grab.

And so, rather than fill in any kind of logic or moral defense of what
he has done, he has to resort to these kinds of absurd arguments.  And I
think that can be plain for the entire world to see.

Q    Jake?

MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  And I’ll —

Q    Thanks so much.

MR. SULLIVAN:  This will be the last one, so —

Q    Thank you, Jake.  On another topic, what is your expectation for
the election in Brazil this Sunday?  What are you going to be watching
for?  And how fast is the White House going to recognize the result once
it’s announced?

MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t make predictions about American elections, so I
promise you I will not make predictions about Brazilian elections or the
elections of any other country. 

Thank you, guys.

Q    Thank you, Jake.

Q    Thanks for coming.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you so much, Jake.

We don’t have much time, because I know folks have to gather.  But,
Colleen, you want to kick us off?

Q    Sure.  Karine, can you give us an update on the President’s plans? 
Will he go to Florida?  Will he go to Puerto Rico?

And then, also, do you have any idea how much money you’ll have to
request from Congress yet to replenish the disaster fund?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’ll say this: The continuing resolution in
Congress, as you all know, is voting — they’re voting on this all
today.  So we’ll help ensure that FEMA has the resources it needs to
address immediate response and recovery needs, including those in Puerto
Rico and also in Florida.

So we will remain in close touch, obviously, with Congress on — on
continuing that — continuing to evaluate that.

As far as — as what’s currently happening.  Look, the President has been
very clear.  He wants to focus on what Florida needs, what Puerto Rico
needs.  And we — they both have the full force and the full support of
the federal government.  And we will continue to have close
conversations with the officials on the ground to make sure that they
have — that the people in Puerto Rico and the people in Florida have
what they need.

As you heard, he — he spoke to the South Carolina governor today,
offering those same kind of — that same support.

One of the things that I just want to reiterate, which is really
important about what we have seen these last couple of days — more —
actually more than a week — is, if you think about what the President
was able to do in Florida and what the President is going to be able to
do in South Carolina, which is pre-position employ- — federal employees,
responders on the ground in a way that we have not seen before.

It is unprecedented what we’re seeing — the type of coordination that
we’re seeing on the ground.  And so that is because the President has
made this a priority.  And he wants to make sure that we are — you know,
we are offering all of the support.

Just to name a few — because this is, we think, important — it’s the
FEMA Urban Search and Rescue, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of
Defense, DHS, the Department of the Interior working hand in hand with
the Florida National Guard, and state and local responders.  And these
teams are doing the work day and night to make sure that they’re
rescuing folks on the ground but also offering water, food, and
generators as well.  
   
Q    Karine, when the President does go to Florida, whenever that might
be, does he want to meet with Governor DeSantis personally?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, you know, I want to be very clear about this. 
This is not about politics, right?  This is about — this is about the
people of Florida and what they need.  
   
When we saw Surfside — the horrible, catastrophic, you know, building
falling in Surfside and killing so many Floridians not too long ago,
over a year ago — you saw Governor DeSantis and you saw this President
sit side-by-side talking about how they were going to work together to
make sure that that community got everything that they need.  
   
So this is not about politics.  I don’t have anything to share about a
trip that the President is going to be making.  He spoke for himself
yesterday.  He — it’s something that he wants to do when it’s
appropriate, in Florida.  He does want to also go to Puerto Rico.  And
once we have an announcement to make, we surely will make that
announcement.  
   
Q    There’s apparently a meeting today between the administration and
oil executives.  Could you tell us a little bit about that?  What’s that
for?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  For sure.  So, from what I understand — like, as you
stated, there is a — there is a meeting that happened with the
Department of Energy, with the oil companies.  I don’t have anything to
share at this time as to how that meeting went or what’s — what the —
what was on the agenda.  But certainly it is an important meeting as we
look at continuing to keep those gas prices and oil prices down for the
American people.  
   
As soon as — I’m sure there’ll be a readout and some more information to
share to all of you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yesterday, President Biden said that Governor DeSantis, when they
spoke, complimented him and praised the immediate response from the
federal government.  Is that a sentiment that the President returns? 
Does he think Governor DeSantis has handled the response to this well,
so far?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I can’t — I can’t — I can’t speak to the specifics
of a private — private conversation.  I can say that, you know, we gave
a readout from our end about how the conversation — how the conversation
went.  
   
Again, we don’t want to make this about politics.  We don’t want to make
this about, you know, red states versus, you know, blue states.  This is
— this is about the American people that are, you know, families and
everyday people who are on the ground who need the assistance.  And they
are going to continue to coordinate.  They’re going to continue to have
conversations.  They had, I believe, three conversations in just a
week’s time about what they can do to help the communities in Florida.  
   
But I don’t want to get into politics here because this is not about
that.  
   
Q    Right.  I’m not asking about politics.  I’m just asking if the
President thinks that Governor DeSantis has done a good job so far.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to — look, I haven’t had that
conversation with the President.  What I can tell you is that they are
working closely together.  The FEMA Administrator is down there
currently with the governor.  They are traveling the state together and
looking at what is currently happening on the ground.  I’m not going to
get into particulars of who’s doing a good job and who’s doing, you
know, I don’t know — I don’t know — could do a better job, I should
say.  
   
Right now, we are working closely, hand-in-hand, with the officials on
the ground.  We have had multiple conversations, not just this
President, but also the FEMA Administrator.  And you can see the fact
that they’ve had conversations, the fact that the FEMA Administratio- —
Administrator is on the ground, that this is a working relationship that
is about the people of Florida.  I’m not going to get into score cards
here.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  I don’t think you got called.  
   
Q    Yes.  Thanks.  Just real quick: Is the President — the President
will sign the CR today.  Is that the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any — that’s a very good question.  I
don’t have any specifics on that.  I know it takes some time.  Like,
there’s mechanics that need to be handled on the Congress side before a
bill gets here.  I don’t have any specifics on when that gets signed. 
Clearly, he will sign it as soon as he’s able to do that.  
   
Q    Okay.  And that is the White House still committed to an early
October timeline for the application for student loans to go public? 
Because yesterday there was a — there was an email that went out to some
borrowers that said October generally; it didn’t say early October.  I’m
wondering if the timeline has slipped at all.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I do have a little bit — I don’t have a specific
date in October, but let me just — since you mentioned the email. 
Yesterday, we began the first of what will be regular updates to
borrowers interested in debt relief.  
   
We shared information of what people can expect in the coming weeks
around the program and process for applying.  We shared the following:
The application for debt relief will be available next month in
October.  No date set yet, but we will — next month — it’s this month. 
We are in October, right?  Or tomorrow.  
   
Q    Tomorrow.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Tomorrow we’re in October.  
   
The application will be a short online form.  Borrowers won’t need to
upload any documents or use their FAFSA ID to support their
application.  The application will be available from October 2022
through December 2023.  
   
Once an individual submits a form, the Department of Education will
review the application, determine if the individual is eligible for
relief, and will work with their loan server to process the relief.  
   
Our goal, as you all know and we have said this, is to provide borrowers
a seamless and simple experience working closely with the server — the
servicers who will actually process the relief.  We will have additional
information for borrowers in the upcoming days.  
   
Again, I know you’re asking for a specific date, but that was what we
provided in the email, and we should have more soon to share.  
   
Q    And just really briefly: Do we have any week ahead guidance for
next week?  I know that you don’t want to say anything about the trip to
Puerto Rico or Florida.  But, you know, typically on Fridays we get —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We usually put out our week aheads — for those who —
who follow their week aheads — coming out of here on Sundays.   
   
If there is a trip next week, we certainly will — we’ll share that with
you.  Don’t have anything to announce at this time at the podium.  
   
Q    I’ll just put a plug-in for on Fridays as much as possible, trying
to give some week ahead —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I understand.  We’ve been here for 19 months, and
we’ve always done the week aheads on Sundays.  I —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I hear you.  I get it.  But I’m just —  
   
Q    Can you give us just a little bit of a heads up (inaudible)?  
   
Q    Jen used to do that on Fridays.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, yeah, that’s right.  We just don’t have — I hear
what you’re saying.  We just don’t have anything today, for Friday, to
share.   
   
I get the question.  I got it.  But normally, yes, we do our week aheads
that we send out on Sundays.  And you’re right, we used to do that on
Fridays.  I just don’t have anything to share.  
   
And we will — we will try and be more proactive in doing that on Fridays
for sure.  
   
Go ahead, Jacqui.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, Karine.  A couple times this week, the
President came after oil and gas companies.  He threatened again to
investigate instances of price gouging.  But John Kirby said yesterday
that there — he hadn’t seen any evidence of that happening.  And I
remember the President first put out this — this call for the FTC to
investigate possible price gouging in November of last year.  
   
So my question to you is: Why does he keep throwing that out there?  And
does it have anything to do with the possibility that OPEC will announce
a production cut next week, and we might start to see prices come up? 
Is he trying to deflect away from —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, we’re not going to speak to OPEC,
OPEC+.  We are clearly not — not a partner or part of OPEC+.  So we —
they are an independent entity, and we allow them to make their — make
their news and their announcements on their own.  
   
What we — what we’re saying is: We’re just making sure that while we’re
— while people are dealing — while we are all dealing with a hurricane,
that gas and oil companies don’t take advantage of it.  It’s just — it’s
just a little bit of a, “Hey, we want to make sure in this time, when
people are losing their homes, when people are dealing with an
incredibly difficult time, that we shouldn’t take advantage of it.” 
That’s it.  It is just coming from the President.  And we feel that
coming from the President is a powerful voice.   
   
And so, look, we don’t — we know that disruptions from hurricanes can
pose challenge to markets, but the latest projections show that major
refineries should not be impacted by Hurricane Ian.  And so — so we’re
just making it very clear to the oil companies.  The President is making
it very clear to the oil companies.   
   
So there’s nothing more to it than just — being just vigilant about
that.  
   
Q    Does it at all run the risk of further fraying the relationship
between the administration and these — there’s been, you know,
obviously, some space between, you know, their position — industry
heads’ position and the White House in terms of attitudes toward fossil
fuels and, you know, sort of casting of blame from side to side.  They —
the companies will say, “Well, the Biden administration is hostile, and
that’s why, you know, we can’t ramp up production.”  So does this kind
of rhetoric —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I mean, I —  
   
Q    — make it worse?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — I don’t think so.   
   
As you know, the oil companies are currently meeting with — with
officials — White House officials and the Department of Energy.    
   
And so, look, I think the President thinks that he is standing up for
the American people and making sure that oil companies are passing on
the savings that they’re getting to consumers.  And we have said that
time and time again.  And this is something that the President thinks
it’s important to use his platform to do so.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Can you give us — I know you’re going into the
week ahead.  But for the weekend, President Biden is in town.  He’s
going to the Congressional Black Caucus dinner tomorrow night.  Are
there other things he’s doing this weekend?  Anything related to the
hurricane that he’s planning to monitor?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, he is getting regularly — daily updated on
Hurricane Ian, as you’ve heard him say many times.  If we have anything
else to share, we certainly will.   
   
As I mention, Administrator Criswell is in Florida.  So she’ll — when
she — either before she gets back or when she gets back, she certainly
will give the President an update on what she saw on the ground.  So
that’ll be very important.  And she has spoken to him ma- — many times —
multiple times this week.   
   
So, again, he’ll get a daily update, as he has been for the past week or
so, on both Hurricane Fiona, when that was happening, and currently with
this hurricane.  And we will have more to share if there’s any other
calls that he makes on the ground with officials as well.  
   
Q    The other thing I wanted to ask was: You had said the other day
that Jackie Walorski’s family was going to be here today for a bill
signing.  Has that happened?  Is it happening?  It wasn’t on his
schedule, so —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  And as you — as you all know, we don’t put
every bill signing on — on the schedule.  As you can imagine, this is a
personal — a personal moment that — that the President was doing.   
   
You know, like I mentioned in the briefing a couple of days ago and as
you just stated, the President has been, you know, looking forward to
hosting the late representative’s family and other lawmakers to honor
her legacy.  And he is signing the bill naming a post office in her
memory.  And that is happening; it was happening when we started the
briefing, so I haven’t gotten an update on how that went.  But clearly,
this is a — this is an important — this is an important moment for her —
for her family.   
   
And so, I can give you a little bit of who was in the meeting so that
you all know.  It included the late representative’s husband, mother,
brother, staff, and several bipartisan members of Congress — Speaker
Pelosi, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Representative Jim Baird,
Representative Jim Banks.   
   
So this, again, happened while we were — while I was coming to the
podium.  And, as you know, the majority of bill signings are not
necessarily always done in public, and so this is that example as
well.  
   
Q    So, Kevin McCarthy was here for the bill signing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Is that the first time he — has he met —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a — kind of a, you know, a data or — on
when he’s — how many times he’s been here.  So I can’t — I actually
can’t speak to that at this time.  But he was here for this particular
bill signing.  
   
We have to remember that the issue that she fought so hard for, on — on
ending hunger — ending child — child hunger, specifically, has been an
issue that’s been bipartisan.  And that’s what we saw a couple of days
ago from that summit.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, thank you.  The Education Department, yesterday, tweaked some
eligibility issues with the student loan forgiveness plan that —
basically saying that borrowers with federal loans that are owned by
private banks are now ineligible.  It will affect perhaps 770,000
borrowers.  I’ve also seen “a couple million.”   
   
Just curious — is that a disappointment for the White House that you
have to make this change seemingly around some legal issues?  And could
there be future changes before applications are made that could narrow
eligibility further?  Or is the plan final now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, first, I just want to make sure, because I know
this was out there, that the number of borrowers impacted are — are —
change — in this change is much smaller.  I know there was a number of
“millions,” but it’s actually —  
   
Q    Yes, so I hear.  Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s actually much smaller.   
   
So our goal from day one has always been to deliver relief to many
borrowers as possible as quickly as possible.  And this change helps us
achieve that.  So we will continue to make sure we zero in on that.   
   
Look, the Department of Education continues to explore alternative ways
to provide relief to those borrowers with commercially led — held — held
loans.   
   
I do want to say that, you know, when you think about what we’re trying
to do — right? — we’re trying to give relief to — to everyday
Americans.  Right?  We’re trying to give relief to working families. 
We’re trying to give relief to working Americans.   
   
And the fact that you see folks out there in Republican states that are
making it very hard for us to do that, for us to give a little bit of a
breathing room to working Americans, I think it’s a — it’s — it’s really
unfortunate, because what we are doing is actually popular with
Americans.  What we are doing is actually giving Americans an
opportunity to put money down on a house, an opportunity to start a
family.  And so that is what — unfortunately, we’re seeing that red —
these red-state Republican officials are doing.   
   
And remember, this is going to help 40 million Americans who truly,
really need just a little bit more space.  
   
Q    Do you anticipate, though, that the plan is now final?  Or could
there be other modifications like this before the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t want to — I can’t speak to that.   
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I can say is: We’re going to do everything that
we can to explore alternative ways to give relief to those borrowers —
-these particular borrowers that you were asking me about that are —
that are — that are with commercially held loans.   
   
And so we’re going to do everything that we can.  The Department of
Educa- — Education is going to do everything that they can.  
   
Again, this is about giving relief, a little bit of breathing rooms,
some extra — extra kind of opportunity for folks to really, you know, be
able to get that house, again, to start that family.  And so that’s what
we’re going to continue to focus on.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think I have to — to go.  I’m getting the — but I’ll
see you all next week.  And we will — we will have a week ahead as soon
as we can.   
   
Thanks, everybody.  
   
3:54 P.M. EDT
