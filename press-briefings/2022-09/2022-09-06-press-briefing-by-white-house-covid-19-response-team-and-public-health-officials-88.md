11:12 A.M. EDT

DR. JHA:  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  My name is
Ashish Jha, and I’m the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.

Today I’m joined by Secretary Xavier Becerra, to my right, and Dr. Fauci
and Walensky remotely.

In addition to providing our perspective on the state of the pandemic,
we are going to focus today on a major milestone — a major milestone we
marked heading into the Labor Day weekend.  The FDA authorized and the
CDC recommended new updated COVID-19 vaccines for all Americans 12 and
above.  This makes us, the United States, the first nation with new
vaccines that match the version of the Omicron variant that is currently
dominant — dominant both here in the U.S. and around the world.

For the first time since December of 2020, these vaccines — our vaccines
— have caught up with the virus.  And as Secretary Becerra and I will
discuss, the Biden administration has been preparing for this moment in
close partnership with state and local health departments, with
pharmacies and community health centers, rural health clinics,
physicians and other healthcare providers.

This is a moment when people can keep themselves healthy and safe as
they think about the road ahead.

So we have worked extremely hard to make sure we have ample supply of
these new updated vaccines available for the American people.  And these
vaccines will continue to remain free.

Now, we have been working over the weekend to get these vaccines out to
tens of thousands of convenient, trusted locations around the country. 
And before we get into talking more about the vaccines, the vaccination
programs, let me first turn to Dr. Tony Fauci — everybody knows Dr.
Fauci — to discuss the importance of this milestone.

Dr. Fauci?

DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Dr. Jha.  I’d like to take the next few
minutes to walk through certain aspects of where we are now with
COVID-19 vaccinations. 

It is becoming increasingly clear that, looking forward with the
COVID-19 pandemic, in the absence of a dramatically different variant,
we likely are moving towards a path with a vaccination cadence similar
to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual, updated COVID-19
shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the
population.

However, some — particularly vulnerable groups — may continue to need
more frequent vaccination against COVID-19.

Let us review what we know about the safety and efficacy of mRNA
COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the benefits we expect from the recently
updated vaccines.

First, safety.  More than 600 million doses of mRNA vaccines have been
administered in the United States alone, with billions more given to
people globally.  Through robust safety monitoring systems, we now have
an extensive body of safety data as good or better than what we have for
any prior vaccine.  In addition, in clinical trials, more than 1,700
people have received bivalent mRNA vaccines with no additional safety
concerns.

Regarding effectiveness, data from the pivotal COVID-19 mRNA vaccine
efficacy trials in 2020 showed a remarkable 94 to 95 percent efficacy
against symptomatic disease.

We later learned through real-world evidence that vaccine protection,
particularly against infection, wanes over time but that additional
doses enhance protection particularly against severe disease leading to
hospitalization or death.

Now, what should we expect from our recently updated vaccines?  Data
from Moderna and Pfizer have shown that vaccines containing sequences
from both the original SARS-CoV-1 virus and the Omicron BA.1 variant
induced higher antibody titers against Omicron than did the original
vaccines.

These bivalent vaccines also induced higher antibody titers against all
SARS-CoV-2 variants than did the original vaccines.  In addition, the
bivalent vaccines induced even higher levels of neutralizing antibodies
in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19.

And so we fully expect that the updated bivalent vaccines containing
BA.4 and BA.5 sequences will offer better protection against currently
circulating strains than the original vaccines, although it is difficult
to predict at this point how much better that protection will be.

In conclusion, we know that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe.  We
know that receiving the recommended vaccine dose is critical to
maintaining optimal protection against severe COVID-19, particularly for
the elderly.  And we expect that the updated vaccines will offer better
protection against the SARS-CoV-2 subvariants that are currently
circulating.

And so my message to you is simple: Get your updated COVID-19 shot as
soon as you are eligible in order to protect yourself, your family, and
your community against COVID-19 this fall and winter.  I certainly will
do so.

Back to you, Dr. Jha.

DR. JHA:  Great.  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.  I want to pick up where Tony
left off.

For the last two years, this virus has continued evolving while our
vaccines have stayed the same.  But now we have a vaccine that matches
the dominant strain out there. 

By the way, let me be very clear — achieving this was no small feat, but
what it means is this: It is reasonable to expect, based on what we know
about immunology and science of this virus, that these new vaccines will
provide better protection against infection, better protection against
transmission, and ongoing and better protection against serious illness.

And, importantly, as Dr. Fauci said, this also marks a significant
progress in terms of our ability to protect people and manage the virus
moving forward.

So, barring any new variant curveballs — we’ve seen curveballs — but
barring those variant curveballs, for a large majority of Americans, we
are moving to a point where a single annual COVID shot should provide a
high degree of protection against serious illness all year.  That’s an
important milestone.

Now, let me be clear: For our highest-risk individuals — and here, I’m
thinking about my elderly parents, for instance, who are in their 80s,
or one of my close friends who recently had a liver transplantation —
individuals like that may need more than annual protection, and we will
ensure in this administration that they get whatever protection they
need.

Now, I know over the past 18 months figuring out what you need and when
you need it hasn’t always been super simple.  That all changes.  These
new vaccines make it easy for us to think differently.

So here’s the simple version: If you’re 12 and above and previously
vaccinated, it’s time to go get an updated COVID-19 shot.

Now, here are a couple of caveats, because there are always a few
caveats.  If you got a recent infection or were recently vaccinated,
it’s reasonable to wait a few months.  Now, we expect millions of people
to get the shot this month as folks get back to school, get back to
work, and get back into their regular routines after the summer.

And as the annual flu vaccination campaign kicks into high gear later
this month and into early October, we expect millions will choose to get
their COVID-19 shot at the same time, or over the course of the fall
when people go in for routine checkups.

The good news is you can get both your flu shot and COVID shot at the
same time.  It’s actually a good idea. 

I really believe this is why God gave us two arms — one for the flu shot
and the other one for the COVID shot.

But our goal for this fall is we will make sure — we, the
administration, will make sure that vaccines are free, that they’re
widely available, and they are easy to access for everybody.

But we’re also focused on taking targeted actions to reach those at the
highest risk to ensure we’re meeting those individuals where they are.  
   
We will put special efforts to reach older Americans, those living in
congregate care settings like nursing homes, and others who are
particularly vulnerable.  
   
The pandemic isn’t over.  And we will remain vigilant, and of course, we
continue to look for and prepare for unforeseen twists and turns.  
   
But this week marks an important shift in our fight against the virus. 
It marks our ability to make COVID vaccines a more routine part of our
lives as we continue to drive down serious illness and deaths and
protect Americans heading into the fall and winter.  
   
So, now, let me turn the floor over to Secretary Becerra to provide an
update on the specific efforts.  
   
Mr. Secretary.  
   
SECRETARY BECERRA:  Dr. Jha, thank you very much.

Right now, we are working hard to ensure that these new, updated
vaccines are widely and equitably available to all Americans.  
   
We are engaging trusted partners and messengers to help spread the
word.  We’re launching a national coordinated effort to collaborate with
national, regional, and local community-based organizations to help meet
people where they are.  
   
We want to make sure that the work that Dr. Jha, Dr. Walensky, Dr. Fauci
— that all of us are doing is clearly having an effect.  So we’re going
to ramp up to get updated COVID-19 shots nationwide to all Americans.  
   
Immediately after the FDA authorized our team to begin the process of
packing and shipping millions of pre-ordered doses of tens of thousands
of these locations nationwide, we started to act.  
   
Doses should start arriving — in fact, actually, I think as of this past
Friday they started arriving.  And by the end of this week, over 90
percent of Americans will live within five miles of these new updated
vaccines.  
   
Americans can start to visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near them
with new updated vaccines.  
   
CVS, Walgreens, and other pharmacy partners began making appointments
over the weekend, and we expect appointments to be widely available
within the next week or so.  
   
As we work to deliver vaccines equitably, our focus is on reaching the
highest-risk Americans, particularly people ages 50 and up.  
   
We’ll be ramping up our education and outreach efforts this month as we
head into October, when we expect more people to get their updated
shots, potentially together with their flu shot, as Dr. Jha has
mentioned.  
   
And heading into Thanksgiving, we’ll emphasize the importance of getting
an updated shot.  
   
So, for example, in the coming weeks, the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services will reach out to the more than 16 million people who
will receive Medicare emails to share information on these updated
vaccines, including when and how to get them.  And we’re engaging
trusted partners and messengers to help spread the word.  
   
To date, we’ve closed rates of disparity throughout the country.  We
have closed a 10-point disparity gap in our nation’s vaccine rate
between white Americans and Black and Latino communities.  
   
We’ve engaged well over 1,000 organizations that have reached over 26
million people and held hundreds of community events.  
   
And we launched the COVID-19 Community Corps, a national network of
nearly 20,000 community leaders and volunteers who serve as trusted
voices.  
    
Finally, we’re launching a national coordinated effort in collaboration
with national, regional, and local community-based organizations to help
meet people where they are.  
   
So, in September, the local chapters of the national PTA — the Parent
Teacher Association — will host “Shots to Go” vaccination clinics
throughout the month.  
   
Organizations with strong reach among racial and ethnic minority
communities, including the National Coalition of 100 Black Women,
Montague Cobb, and the National Hispanic Pastors Alliance, will host
community health expos and vaccine drives throughout America in various
cities.  
   
Faith-based groups, such as the Women’s Missionary Society Foundation,
will host a series of vaccine events at AME churches in several
states.  
   
And groups with strong reach across rural communities, such as Healthy
Trucking of America, will host pop-up clinics.  
   
We have an — have another opportunity to get ahead of this pandemic, and
the Biden-Harris administration will continue working with — with you,
with all Americans every day to get everyone protected from COVID.

Dr. Jha, I’ll pass it back to you.  
   
DR. JHA:  Mr. Secretary, thank you.  And thank you for your
leadership.   
   
And let me just take one minute to highlight a point that you made, sir,
which I think has been not adequately appreciated, which is the
administration’s commitment to ensuring that all Americans have
equitable access to these vaccines.  The fact is that when you look at
our booster rates, when you look at vaccination rates, we have closed
the gap based on race and ethnicity.  And that has been proactive work
by this administration and through your leadership.  
   
So I just want to say, Mr. Secretary, thank you for centering equity in
this effort.  
   
Let me take a moment to zoom out and provide a bit more perspective on
the state of the pandemic.  
   
And I will ask Dr. Walensky for the data around that, but let me
underscore a couple of key points.  First, we are clearly in a far
better place today than where we were when the President — when
President Biden took office 19 months ago or over — or even 9 months
ago.  
   
This summer, we demonstrated that we know how to manage fluctuations in
COVID-19 and move forward safely.  We did a briefing here early in the
summer about the BA.5 subvariant as it became dominant.  
   
And while it did drive rises in infections, we had far lower rates of
hospitalizations and deaths than we did with Delta last summer or
Omicron this past winter.  
   
We know that there is a potential for an increase in infections this
fall, in part due to waning immunity from vaccines and prior infections,
but really because what we know is that as the weather gets colder,
people spend more time indoors, and we know respiratory viruses like
COVID-19 spread more easily.  
   
The good news here is that we go into this fall with a whole host of
capabilities.  We have a matched vaccine.  We have great treatments that
save lives.  We have widespread availability of testing.  And we have
been working diligently with organizations around the country — schools,
offices, buildings — to make large improvements in indoor air quality
that many, many places have — have invested in.  
   
Obviously, we have much more to do on all of those fronts, but we are
clear at a point — we are at a point where in most instances we can
prevent serious illness and death, we can keep businesses and schools
open and running, and we can get people back to a more normal set of
routines.  
   
But as the President has said from day one, everyone has a part to
play.   
   
So, today, we’re calling on all Americans: Roll up your sleeve to get
your COVID-19 vaccine shot.  
   
If you don’t think you need it because you are healthy, do it for your
grandmother, do it for your vulnerable uncle or for your friend.  
   
And to state and local leaders and employers and school leaders: Please
help your communities get vaccinated this fall.  
   
Vaccines are not partisan.  They are not political.  We want everyone in
your community, in your business, in your school to stay healthy and
safe without disruption.  
   
And to our friends in Congress: You have been such great partners for so
much of this pandemic; it is now critical that you step up and provide
additional COVID-19 funding so we can stay ahead of this virus and help
Americans get back to their lives with less suffering and less
disruption.  
   
Because to protect the progress we have made and to keep moving forward
safely, we need everyone to step up.  
   
And with that, let me turn it over to Dr. Walensky.

DR. WALENSKY:  Thank you, Dr. Jha.  And good morning, everyone.  It’s
great to be back with you today.   
   
As always, I’d like to start with walking you through the latest data. 
As Dr. Jha has mentioned, Omicron continues to be the dominant
circulating variant with the BA.5 sublineage accounting for over 88
percent of circulating viruses and BA.4 sublineages accounting for over
11 percent of the remaining circulating viruses.  
   
The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 4,500 per day, a
decrease of about 14 percent over the prior week.  
   
Since April, we have seen a greater increase in hospitalization rates in
older adults relative to other age groups.  For the week of September
3rd, over 63 percent of hospitalizations are in those 60 and older, and
about 46 percent of hospitalizations are in those 70 and older.   
   
The seven-day average daily deaths are still too high, about 375 per day
— well above the around 200 deaths a day we saw earlier this spring and,
in my mind, far too high for a vaccine-preventable disease.  
   
Data have repeatedly demonstrated that being up to date on your COVID-19
vaccination provides protection against severe illness and death from
COVID-19, especially for those most at risk, including those over the
age of 50 and others at high risk of severe disease.  
   
Additionally, a recent JAMA article also demonstrated that healthcare
workers who received one, two, or three doses of vaccine were less
likely to have long COVID compared to those who were not vaccinated.  
   
Last week, following FDA’s emergency use authorization, CDC’s Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices recommended Pfizer-BioNTech updated
COVID-19 vaccine for people ages 12 and older and Moderna updated
COVID-19 vaccine for people ages 18 and older.  
   
CDC and ACIP recommend that everyone, regardless of the number or type
of previous COVID-19 doses, receives a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine this
fall.  You can receive an updated vaccine dose at least two months after
your last COVID-19 vaccine dose.  
   
As 99 percent of circulating viruses in the United States are BA.5 or
BA.4, updating our COVID-19 vaccines to match the circulating variants
helps us to better be protected against these variants and future
variants that might be closely related to Omicron.  
   
Getting an updated vaccine this fall will help restore protection that
has waned since previous vaccination.  And laboratory data suggests that
the addition of the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 spike protein components may
help broaden the spectrum of variants the immune system is ready to
respond to.   
   
Finally, modeling projections show that an uptake of updated COVID-19
vaccine doses similar to an annual flu vaccine coverage early this fall
could prevent as many as 100,000 hospitalizations, 9,000 deaths, and
save billions of dollars in direct medical cost.   
   
The benefits of being up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines are clear. 
If you are eligible, I strongly encourage you to get your fall COVID-19
shot.  And remember, if you’re so inclined, it’s perfectly safe and
similarly effective to get your flu shot at the same time.   
   
Thank you.  And now I’ll turn it back to you, Dr. Jha.  
   
DR. JHA:  Great.  Dr. Walensky, thank you.  Let’s go ahead and open it
up for questions.  
   
Kevin.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thank you.  First, let’s go to Adrianna Rodriguez at USA
Today.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you so much for taking my question.  Now that there’s,
you know, so many di- — an array of vaccine bottle caps, labels, and
doses, on expiration dates and dilution requirements with, you know, the
new vaccines, plus the old vaccines that we’ve been having, there’s some
concern that this has probably led to some errors and is likely to lead
to more with the new vaccines.  Is there anything that federal officials
or agencies can do to reduce the confusion and ensure that everyone gets
the proper dose?  
   
DR. JHA:  Yeah, I’m — I’m happy to start.  I don’t know if — Dr.
Walensky, I know this was some conversation on this — about this at ACIP
as well.   
   
Look, FDA — let’s just take a step back here.  FDA, when it comes to
regulatory agencies, is the gold standard in the world.  And ensuring
safety of products is its number-one goal.   
   
So FDA scientists are — I know have been engaged on this topic very
closely, continue to make sure that people get proper — pharmacists get
proper education — not just pharmacists; obviously, other people who
administer the vaccines as well — and continue to work with companies to
identify and create strategies to make sure that the bottle caps and the
bottles are all such that people can get the right vaccination.   
   
We have not seen any evidence of wide-scale mistakes or people getting
the wrong vaccine.  I am confident that the system is continuing to work
effectively, but I know the FDA continues to monitor this very
closely.   
   
I don’t know if anybody else — Dr. Walensky or Secretary Becerra or if
anybody else wants to add to this.   
   
I wish we had Dr. Califf or someone else from FDA here.  But I do know
we’ve spoken about this.  This is ongoing work the FDA is very engaged
and aware of.   
   
DR. WALENSKY:  And maybe I’ll just add, Dr. Jha, that this is a concern
that has been raised.  And one of the things that we’re actively working
to do is taking close pictures of those bottle caps, doing all of that
education that is needed, minimizing the amount of product that is on
the shelf to minimize confusion, but recognizing that we are doing an
extraordinary amount of education for those who are administering the
vaccine for exactly that reason.  
   
DR. JHA:  Great.  Kevin?  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Alex Tin at CBS.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Following up on Dr. Fauci’s
opening remarks, can you address why the primary series wasn’t updated
as well, as well as shots for younger kids?  When do you expect that to
happen?   
   
And then, separately, can you address what you’re hearing from the early
jurisdictions and pharmacies that are now rolling out the shots, in
terms of demand?  Thanks so much.  
   
DR. JHA:  I’m happy to start.  Dr. Fauci, I don’t know if you want to
talk at all.  Why don’t you — yeah, let me just start off very quickly
saying: We know FDA is working on both updating the primary series and
making booster shots for kids under 12 — the bivalent.  But that work is
ongoing.   
   
Obviously, in every one of these decisions, FDA looks at the totality of
the evidence, and the FDA scientists make an independent decision.  What
I’m aware of is that they’re looking at the evidence, they’re making
assessments.  I expect that there may be updates on the booster for kids
under 12 at some point down the — later in the fall.  But I don’t have
any specific timeline or specific thing to offer.   
   
Dr. Fauci, any — anything else you want to add to that?  
   
DR. FAUCI:  Yeah.  You know, Alex, I think what people need to
appreciate: Although it’s very important that we are now matching the
new updated vaccine with the circulating, that the original ancestral
strain vaccine created a very broad degree of coverage that did very
well against many of the variants, as you know, from the D614G to the
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and even Omicron.   
   
So we don’t want to deprive the population of getting that broad
coverage at the same time as we give them the added benefit of a
variant-specific that’s circulating.   
   
So I think it’s a very positive thing that when you get people to get
their primary vaccination, you give them the benefit of that initial
broad coverage.  So there’s a good reason to do that.  
   
DR. JHA:  That’s a great point, Tony.  Thank you.  
   
Next question.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Betsy Klein at CNN.  
   
Q    Thanks, guys.  Dr. Jha, as you mentioned, we learned last week that
the administration is re-upping its request to Congress for COVID
response funding down just a hair from that $22.5 billion request
earlier this year to $22.4 billion.  Just wondering if there have been
any meetings or communication over the recess that would indicate
there’s any new appetite for this in Congress.  
   
DR. JHA:  Yeah.  What I can say — and, again, Mr. Secretary, you may
have more to add on this — is that we are obviously in constant dialogue
with our colleagues on the Hill — both Democrats and Republicans in the
House and Senate.  
   
And so they’re — I think they know that this request was coming.  The
request has critical pieces of our response.  Look, we are in a much
better place because we’ve been able to respond effectively.  Congress
is aware that if we do not continue to fund the response, we can easily
go backwards.  That’s what we are committed to making sure doesn’t
happen.  So, yeah, those conversations have been ongoing.  
   
Mr. Secretary, I don’t know if you want to add anything to that.  
   
SECRETARY BECERRA:  I will simply add that Congress has been a very
responsible partner in this whole effort.  The fact that we are today
able to give Americans access to a vaccine that now can go after this
latest variant is a sign of what happens when you have a partner that
gives you the resources you need.  
   
We obviously need more resources.  We want to continue work with a good
partner in Congress to make that happen.  And we want to make sure that
we could tell the American people we’re looking around the corner to
what comes next.  And with the help of Congress and the resources that
they’ve provided in the past, and hopefully will continue, we’ll be able
to tell Americans, “We’re going to keep you safe.  We’re going to stay
ahead of this.”  
DR. JHA:  Kevin.

MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Alex Nazaryan at Yahoo.

Q    Thanks.  Thanks, everyone.  Just a question broadly about how we
avoid playing catch-up to new variants or subvariants of the vaccine. 
Because unlike the flu, we’re probably not going to have the kind of
indication we get from the southern hemisphere of the variants, or at
least not a very — or at least not an indication with any kind of useful
lag to develop those vaccines.

So are we just hoping that the new subvariants continue to have spike
protein mutations that allow this new bivalent vaccine to work against
them?  Or is there going to be some — I mean, can we expect some
curveballs just because of what this virus tends to do?

DR. JHA:  That’s a great question.  Let me start, but I would love
Tony’s thoughts on this as well.

So, we — you know, the line that we use is “hope is not a strategy.”  So
we’re not planning or hoping on any one specific outcome.  Obviously, we
all hope that the viral evolution slows down.  But here’s the way I’ve
been thinking about this — I think we’ve been thinking about it inside
the administration:

First of all, right now we have a vaccine that exactly matches the
variant that’s out there.  We may see more evolution of this virus.  To
the extent that that evolution comes off of BA.5, this updated vaccine
will continue to provide a very high degree of protection.

One of the things that we’ve been thinking about — and you’ve heard me
talk about it, we held a summit here at the White House on this — is
that we need to get to a point where we have variant-proof vaccines, we
have mucosal vaccines.  We need to play the long game against this
virus.

That is going to require additional resources from Congress.  So part of
what’s in the request to Congress is funding for that next generation of
vaccines that’s so critical if we’re going to be able to ultimately get
this virus behind us.

So I remain confident that the bivalent vaccine we have right now will
provide a high degree of protection with, you know, some durability. 
But in the long run, we’re going to need a different game in terms of
much more durable vaccines.

Tony?

DR. FAUCI:  Well, just to underscore what Dr. Jha said about the long
game: We totally agree; we want to get a pan-coronavirus type of a
vaccine with either a different platform or a better immunogen to do
that, hopefully even with mucosally administrated.  But that’s the long
game.  I believe, Alex, you’re asking the short game question, like in
the next year or so.

Now, one of the defining aspects of what we’ve all said is: Barring the
out-of-left-field curveball, I mean, there’s nothing we can do about
that, except know that we have vaccine platforms that will allow us to
quickly move to address that.

But let’s say we don’t get a real big difference over the next year. 
You would expect that BA.5, if it stays with us, in the sense of being
the dominant one for a considerable period of time, or if there is a
minor drift from it, the BA.5 updated vaccine that we’re talking about
very likely would hold a substantial degree of protection against a
minor sublineage change from BA.5.

So that’s what we’re talking about.  If we can do that, at the end of
each year, for most of the population — and again, to underscore what we
said, for those who have underlying conditions, immunocompromised, we
may need to do it more.  But for the bulk of the population, we can look
at it on a yearly basis and see, are we still close to what we’re doing
now where we match pretty closely?  If so, good.  If not, then you’d
want to make the modification.

Thanks.

DR. JHA:  Great.  Kevin.

MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Let’s do a few more questions.  Let’s go to Zeke
Miller at the Associated Press.

Q    Thanks, all, for doing this.  I just wanted to follow up on the
projections Dr. Walensky was referring to earlier about the modeling
showing a decline in cases and deaths this winter if there’s significant
uptake of these updated boosters.

Can you elaborate on sort of how — what level of population coverage you
need to get in order to achieve those — those unnece- — the sort of
production in unnecessary deaths and serious illnesses?

And then, sort of, what is the general outlook that you’re looking at
for — now that we have these boosters — for the fall?  What is the range
of disruption, serious illness, and death that Americans should be
preparing for over the coming — coming seasons?  
   
DR. WALENSKY:  Yeah, thank you for that question.  This was a — not a
CDC-based modeling study; it was a modeling study done by others.  But
it was critically important, and it does demonstrate if we can get
uptakes similar to a flu vaccine uptake — similar to what we get every
single year from a flu vaccine — we could avert over 100,000
hospitalizations.  
   
In terms of projections, we, of course, know where we are with around,
you know, 4,500 hospitalizations right now.  And many of these
projections anticipate what we might see, as Dr. Jha indicated, with
respiratory viruses in leading to more cases and potentially more
hospitalizations.  But those projections very much depend on everyone
going out — going out and doing exactly what we’re recommending, which
is getting your updated COVID-19 vaccine now, which can avert all of the
challenges that we, you know, otherwise might anticipate.  
   
DR. JHA:  And let me — let me just add one more thing to this because I
think it’s really important and builds on Rochelle’s points.   
   
If we think back to where we were two years ago, compared to where we
are today, we have a virus out there that’s still circulating, still
killing hundreds of Americans every day.  We now have all of the
capability to prevent, I believe, essentially all of those deaths.  If
people stay up to date on their vaccines, if people get treated if they
have a breakthrough infection, we can make deaths from this virus
vanishingly rare.   
   
And as I think about the fall and winter ahead — you know, many people
are predicting that flu is going to be back after two years of being
largely away because of all the mitigation — we are looking at an
opportunity to prevent lots of people getting infected, lots of people
getting sick, stressing our healthcare system at a point where
healthcare workers are exhausted.   
   
If people go out and get their annual COVID shot, that is the
opportunity in front of us.   
   
And I think we all as Americans have to pull together to try to protect
Americans this fall and winter and do what we can to get our healthcare
system through what might be a difficult fall and winter ahead.  
   
Kevin?   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Lauren Gardner at Politico.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  This was addressed a little bit
a couple questions ago, but I kind of want to get a finer point on it. 
You know, versions of Omicron have been dominant now for nine months or
so, give or take, in the U.S.  So can you explain maybe in more detail
for Americans — you know, given the length of time we’ve had with this
lineage of the virus — how does that make you confident enough to say
that you think we’re heading towards that annual booster cadence for
your average healthy American, given that, you know, you also just
acknowledged that we never know what kind of curveball we’re going to
get with this virus and what it can develop into at any given time?  
   
DR. JHA:  Yeah, let me — let me start, and then I’d love it if, Tony,
you could sort of chime in and fill in the critical details here.   
   
We have watched Omicron over the last nine months.  We’ve watched it
evolve.  It has taught us a lot about this virus and how it is evolving
right now.   
   
What we have also seen is — again, taking those high-risk individuals
off the table for a second — if you’re an average-risk person and if you
have stayed up to date on your vaccine, your risk of getting into
serious trouble against this virus is really pretty low, if you’ve
stayed up on your — again, if you stayed updated on the vaccine.  I
think that gives us a lot of confidence.   
   
Now, on the issue of the curveball, you know, variant, I always remind
people: We have an annual flu vaccine that holds us in good stead when
people get it.  We know that there could be some curveball pandemic flu
that shows up in February.  We always know that that is a possibility. 
It is a possibility we’re going to get some crazy curveball, but it is
not that — I think what — you know, we plan for what we think is the
median, the most likely scenario.  But we’re always watching for that
unusual event, and if that happens, we will address it and we will
adjust to it and we’ll account for it.   
   
But I think the most likely scenario is we’re going to see ongoing
evolution off of BA.5.  And we believe that these vaccines should
continue to provide a high degree of protection.   
   
But, Tony, do you want to either expand, change, edit any of that?  
   
DR. FAUCI:  No editing or changing but just — Ashish — but maybe to
expand a little.   
   
Lauren, it relates to a little bit what I said before and what Dr. Jha
has just mentioned: If you look at the original introduction of Omicron
in November of last year, we’re almost a year now — almost a year of
Omicron sublineages.  And the boosts that we’ve had — the first and
second boost — have done pretty well in reconstituting the waning
immunity even against the evolution of the different sublineages of
Omicron.   
   
So, again, you’ve got to put the wildcard of a way-out, out-of-left
field variant coming in.  If that happens, all bets are off, and we
change.  
   
But if we continue to have an evolution of what we used to call and
still do call an “influenza adrift” — not a major change, but just sort
of drifting along to BA.5 sublineage — I believe that that would fit in
well with what we’re talking about the likelihood that we’ll get into a
cadence that on a yearly basis for most people we’ll be able to cover
what is out there as the dominant variant.  
   
DR. WALENSKY:  And if I might just add: You know, one of the very for
this bivalent vaccine is not just because it keeps the great protection
of the original strain and because it improves the protection against
the BA.5 variant, as laboratory data suggests, but also that it — the
laboratory data suggests it will improve protection against other
variants as well.  So it gives us that breadth of protection that we
might anticipate should another variant come through.

DR. JHA:  Great, thank you, Dr. Walensky and Dr. Fauci.

Okay.  Kevin, back to you.

MR. MUNOZ:  Last question.  Let’s go to Cheyenne Haslett at ABC News.

Q    Thank you.  I wanted to go back to the funding quickly. 
Collectively, you’ve all warned again and again that we wouldn’t have
enough bivalent boosters for everyone because Congress didn’t allocate
more COVID funding during the last request.  But they now do seem to be
widely available to everyone who’s eligible.

So can you explain if the calculus has changed there, or if people
should still be concerned that there are not enough for everybody?

DR. JHA:  Yeah, so let me start off.  And I suspect, Mr.  Secretary, you
may have some thoughts on this as well.

I had warned that we did not have funding for enough vaccines.  We found
ourselves in a — what I would say is an impossible situation of looking
at the fall and winter and asking, even though Congress has failed to
act, can we really go into the fall and winter without having vaccines
for Americans, watching Europeans watching others have access to these
bivalent vaccines?  And we thought that was unacceptable.

And so we have gone and pulled resources out of critical public health
efforts.  We had planned on having an adequate stockpile of PPE, of
personal protective equipment, should there be another surge.  We will
not have that stockpile.

We had to shut down COVIDTests.gov, a wildly popular program, where two
thirds of American households had ordered tests — shut it down because
we do not have enough tests in our stockpile.  We do not have the
ability to continue.

We will not have enough tests in our Strategic National Stockpile should
we see another Omicron-like event.  We had promised the American people
we would make sure that we did not get into that.  But with — but we
needed Congress to step up; Congress has not stepped up.

So we are constantly making what I think are impossibly difficult
decisions.  But our commitment is to absolutely make sure that vaccines
and treatments are widely available, easily accessible, and free.  And
that’s where we are.  And that is a set of decisions we’ve made.

We’re — we think this is the right set of decisions, but it certainly
has not been easy ones.

Mr. Secretary.

SECRETARY BECERRA:  Dr. Jha, I’ll just add that the actions we execute
today are meant for tomorrow, so the announcement of today was really
executed far earlier.  And so we’re constantly trying to stay ahead of
this.  And we forecast based on the resources we have and what we see
coming at us from Omicron itself.  And so we are trying to constantly
stay ahead of this.  We’re trying to be able to look around the corner. 
It gets tougher and tougher as you get fewer and fewer resources and
have fewer and fewer resources in your pocket. 

But what we’re announcing today didn’t get executed today. It got
executed far — far in advance.  And what we’re suggesting now is that to
be able to continue that, we need the resources that we’ve requested
from Congress.   
   
And so, while we may have the vaccines today for folks, for this fall
vaccine effort, we don’t know what’s coming next.  We don’t know what
the next generation of vaccine will look like if we don’t have the
resources to continue that research going.  
   
And so, it’s all a matter of preparing.  And what we don’t want to do is
act today — execute today for today.  That would put us way behind. 
We’re going to keep our weight on our front foot as much as we can so we
can be ready to see around the corner.  
   
DR. JHA:  And let me just add one last thing on this point. You know,
one of the things that we learned — we’ve learned throughout the
pandemic — we certainly learned this during the Omicron wave of last
winter — is that it is always more expensive to be responding than it is
to be prepared.   
   
And one of the things that we have wanted to do — we thought it was
responsible and important — was to build up that stockpile so that if we
do get a surge, that we can get these tests out.  
   
Let me be clear: If we get another surge, Congress likely at that point
will step up.  It will cost the American taxpayer twice as much and will
be less effective.  One of the reasons to be prepared and to be on the
front footing, as the Secretary said, and to be looking around the
corner is it’s much more effective and it’s much more cost efficient. 
And that’s one of the reasons we’re back at Congress this fall saying,
“You’ve got to continue supporting this.  You’ve got to allow us to
continue preparing for what’s next for the American people.”  Thank
you.  
   
Kevin?  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  That was the last question.  
   
DR. JHA:  Okay.  Great.  Well, I want to just finish off by saying thank
you — thank you to my colleagues on the screen. Tony Fauci — Dr. Fauci,
thank you for joining us.  And, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC Director,
thank you.  Mr. Secretary, always a pleasure to share the stage, and
thank you for your leadership in this.   
   
I want to remind us it has been two years — more than two years.  We’re
heading into the third fall winter since this pandemic began.  We are in
a totally different place because of the leadership of this
administration, of the President, and because of what we know — now have
in front of us: We have a vaccine that matches the variant that’s out
there.  
   
It’s critical that Americans protect themselves, protect their families,
protect their loved ones.  And if people step up and do what is
necessary, we can get through this fall and winter with far less
suffering, far less death, far less disruption.  And that should
absolutely be our priority and goal; it is in this administration.  And
I hope everybody joins us in that effort.   
   
Thank you all for joining us today.
