  \ Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital\_Assets"

Via Teleconference

(September 15, 2022)

MODERATOR:  Thank you, everyone, and thanks for joining.  Today we’re
doing a press call on the new Comprehensive Framework for Responsible
Development of Digital Assets.   
   
The first part of the call is on the record so we’re going to go ahead
and get that started.  And I’m going to turn it over to Director of the
National Economic Council Brian Deese.  Over to you.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Thanks, and thank you all for joining here today.  I’ll be
brief at the top and them I’m going to turn it over to my colleagues,
Secretary Yellen and Director Nelson.  
   
Just to start, the bottom line here is that the responsible development
of digital assets is vital for American interests, from the well-being
of consumers and investors to the safety and stability of our financial
system, and for our financial and technological leadership around the
world.   
   
And we’ve seen in recent months substantial turmoil in cryptocurrency
markets, and these events really highlight how, without proper
oversight, cryptocurrencies risk harming everyday American’s financial
stability and our national security.  And it is why this administration
believes that now more than ever prudent regulation of cryptocurrencies
is needed if digital assets are going to play a role that we believe
they can in fostering innovation and supporting our economic and
technological competitiveness.  
   
This starts back — to, you know, dial the clock back to last March when
the President recognized with the issuing of EO 14067 that this needed
to be a priority for the entirety of the executive branch.  And that
executive order tasked agencies with doing deep analysis of digital
assets’ risks and opportunities in submitting policy recommendations so
that we can build a framework that harnesses the potential benefits
while decisively mitigating the risks.   
   
And I — you know, what we’re here today to do is to mark, after 180 days
of work, where we are and, in particular, to highlight the release of
many of the reports contemplated under that executive order.   
   
Across the government — Department of Treasury, Commerce, Justice, and
the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy had been the
primary authors and drivers of these reports, and they are the result of
an extensive interagency process that reflect input and expertise of
diverse stakeholders across government, industry, academia, and civil
society.  And I want to thank all of our partners for their
contributions.  
   
I’m just going to very quickly highlight a couple of the topline
findings from these reports before turning it over to our leaders who
can highlight the findings in more detail.   
   
Three quick points.  First, these reports underscore and advance our
understanding of the policy implications and technical choices
surrounding a potential U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency should one be
deemed to be in the national interest, and they facilitate further
analysis and experimentation.  As an administration, as Secretary Yellen
will detail, we encourage the Federal Reserve to continue its ongoing
research and experimentation around a potential CBDC, and we look
forward to continuing the work at the technical level with our
interagency partners to support this effort.  And that the team’s
principals and deputies at the Federal Reserve, the National Economic
Council, the National Security Council, OSTP, and the Treasury
Department will meet regularly to discuss the working group’s progress
and share updates on CBDC and other payment innovations.   
   
The report that is being released also calls for continued and more
engagement with international partners on CBDC systems, which is a
critical priority.  And as an administration, we will prioritize those
engagements.   
   
Second, today’s report articulates a comprehensive strategy for
mitigating digital assets’ harms, especially the harms to consumers and
the environment.  I want to highlight that the report’s proposed steps
for countering cryptocurrencies use in illicit finance activity in
particular, and these steps reflect the administration’s focus on
illicit finance threats and builds on the progress of prior work with
agencies including with our international partners.  For example, we
convened a counter-ransomware initiative with over 30 countries this
month for a virtual summit addressing global strategies to disrupt
ransomware activities.   
   
And third, the reports provide a roadmap for reaping the fruits of
responsible innovation and digital asset development, and to do so — and
to advance innovation, the reports call for the federal government to
craft a digital asset research and development agenda.  Through that
initiative, government agencies will kick start new scientific and
technical research, collaborating with key partners in academia,
industry, and civil society.   
   
And additionally, we will develop cross-government strategies for
proactive global leadership on digital assets, as I mentioned.  And we
believe that continued global leadership will reinforce the pivotal role
that the U.S. plays in the world financial system and help global
digital asset development proceed in a way that reflects American
values.   
   
Each of these steps — these are just three steps — many others outlined
in the report helps to make progress toward responsible development of
digital assets, which is our core goal, as I started with.  And they lay
the groundwork for what we believe can be a thoughtful and comprehensive
approach to mitigating the risks and, where proven, harness the
benefits.  And we look forward to continuing this work.   
   
I will end by saying: Consistent with the President’s direction in the
executive order, we will continue to prioritize this critical work
across the executive branch.   
   
So with that, let me turn it over to Secretary Yellen, who can provide
more detail around the Treasury Department’s report being released. 
Thank you.  
   
SECRETARY YELLEN:  Thank you very much, Brian.  And I’d first like to
recognize President Biden’s leadership on digital assets and for
convening experts from across the administration to ensure a coordinated
and comprehensive approach to digital assets policy.  And I’d like to
thank him for charging the Treasury Department with a leadership role in
this work by calling on us to develop reports that address fundamental
issues in this new and rapidly evolving area.   
   
Innovation is one of the hallmarks of a vibrant financial system and
economy.  But as we’ve painfully learned from history, innovation
without adequate regulation can result in significant disruptions and
harm to the financial systems and individuals.  And this is especially
true for communities that are most vulnerable to these risks.   
   
Tomorrow, the Treasury Department will be releasing three reports on key
issues surrounding the responsible development of digital assets for
financial services.  The reports clearly identify the real challenges
and risks of digital assets used for financial services.  At the same
time, if these risks are mitigated, digital assets and other emerging
technologies could offer significant opportunities.   
   
The first report is about the future of the U.S money and payment
system.  Right now, some aspects of our current payment system are too
slow or too expensive.  The report encourages continued work on
innovations to promote a system that is more competitive, efficient, and
inclusive, and that also helps maintain and build on the United States
global financial leadership.   
   
The report makes several recommendations to achieve these objectives. 
The first recommendation is to advance policy and technical work on a
potential central bank digital currency, or CBDC, so that the United
States is prepared if a CBDC is determined to be in the national
interest.   
   
To advance this work, Treasury will lead an interagency working group to
coordinate and consider questions necessary for a potential CBDC.  The
working group will leverage expertise from across the administration and
support the ongoing work of the Federal Reserve on the CBDC.  It will
engage in information sharing with our allies and partners to promote
responsible development of CBDCs.   
   
The report also encourages the use of instant payment systems and
efforts to improve cross-border payments.  The report recommends
establishing a federal framework for payments regulation to protect
users and the financial system while supporting responsible
innovations.   
   
The second report reviews current use cases for crypto assets and their
effects on consumers, investors, and businesses.  And this includes
effects on underserved communities and those who are most vulnerable for
the risks of crypto assets.  As we’ve seen over the past few months,
risks stemming from improper conduct related to the trading of crypto
assets continue to present an especially grave area of concern.  This
includes frauds, thefts, and scams.    
   
We recommend that agencies continue to rigorously pursue their
enforcement efforts focused on the crypto-asset sector.  Agencies should
use existing authorities to issue additional supervisory guidance and
rules to address current and emerging risks.  Further, we recommend that
agencies work to ensure that American consumers, investors, and
businesses have access to trustworthy information on crypto assets.  
   
The third report builds on the foundation established by the National
Illicit Finance Strategy and the National Risk Assessments published
earlier this year.  It carries forward the principles of the strategy
and lays out a more detailed, illicit finance action plan.   
   
The action plan lays out seven priority actions.  These actions will
guide our longstanding efforts to prevent digital assets from being used
for financial crimes, such as money laundering and terrorism financing. 
The actions include strengthening U.S. AML/CFT supervision of virtual
asset activities, disrupting illicit actors, expanding public-private
dialogue, and improving global regulation and enforcement of
international standards.  The action plan also recommends continued
monitoring of emerging risks in the digital asset sector to identify
potential gaps in our regulatory regime.   
   
Overall, I believe that these reports, as well as others that we have
consulted on with our interagency partners, provide a strong foundation
for policymakers as we work to realize the potential benefits of digital
assets and to mitigate and minimize the risks.   
   
These reports are in addition to the Framework for International
Engagement on Digital Assets, which Treasury released in early July.   
   
And we will supplement this work soon; the Financial Stability Oversight
Council will release a report on digital asset financial stability risks
and regulations as required by the executive order.  And I will have
more to share on the substance of that report once it’s released.   
   
So thank you for joining us on that call and let me now turn it over to
Director Alondra Nelson, from OSTP.  
   
DR. NELSON:  Thank you very much, Secretary Yellen.  Thank you, also,
Director Deese.  Thank you both for your leadership and your partnership
in this whole-of-government approach to digital assets.  And thank you
to our colleagues in journalism for being with us.   
   
Before I start, I want to just recognize the teams at the Office of
Science and Technology Policy, OSTP, for their incredibly hard work on,
in particular, two of the really rigorous digital asset reports
(inaudible) briefly for you while we’re on the call this afternoon.   
   
As our moderator noted at the top, I lead the Office of Science and
Technology Policy.  And our job really and our mandate from Congress
since 1976 and from the President is to maximize the benefits of science
and technology to advance health, prosperity, security, environmental
quality, and justice for all of the American public.   
   
In addition to this, by our founding mandate, OSTP is the office in the
Executive Office of the President that’s really kind of focused on the
future.  So a lot of our work is engaged with tackling tough challenges
of today, endeavoring to anticipate the unknown opportunities and
obstacles that lie ahead, and really trying to drive boldly the country
and the nation towards solutions.   
   
So this work means often taking a hard look at today’s innovations and
technologies and things that are just cresting on the edge of new
technologies, and evaluating their potential to either shape or hinder a
safe, equitable, and flourishing future for all of us.   
   
So the two reports I mentioned.  One, last week, we released a report on
the Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto Assets.  In our climate
report, we found that crypto assets consumed between 1 percent and 2
percent of all U.S. electricity each year.  We also found that crypto
asset activity produces between 0.4 to 0.8 percent of U.S. greenhouse
gas emissions.  That’s similar to the emissions from iron and steel
production in the United States by way of comparison.  
   
The crypto asset industry is expanding rapidly using more electricity
and producing more emissions.  And crypto mining affects local
communities with noise pollution, as well as air and water pollution
from direct fossil-fired electricity.  These local community impacts can
exacerbate environmental justice issues for communities that are already
burdened by other pollutants.  We need to make sure that crypto asset
operations do not impede our goals to protect communities, reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, and achieve a carbon pollution-free
electricity grid.   
   
The recommendations in our report align with these goals while also
recognizing that innovations in this technology could help with climate
monitoring and mitigation.   
   
Earlier this week, we saw a major crypto player begin transitioning to a
less energy-intensive model, a good first step that we should encourage
others to consider.  
   
Innovation in the financial sector has the potential to transform money
and payments.  This transformation may reach the core of our financial
system through the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency — or
CBDC.   
   
Our second report provides a technical evaluation for a potential U.S.
CBDC system.  In theory, a U.S. CBDC system could facilitate efficient
and low-cost transactions, might provide greater access to the financial
system, and could help preserve U.S. global financial leadership.   
   
At the Office of Science and Technology Policy, we believe that the best
technology policy is specific about the policy objectives we hope to
achieve, as well as the technology we’re using to achieve these
objectives.   
   
That’s why we’ve worked across the federal government, gathering input
from dozens of offices and an interagency process to develop a list of
specific U.S. policy objectives for CBDCs, including safeguarding
privacy and advancing equity.   
   
Our colleagues at the Federal Reserve have also been doing
experimentation and research on whether to pursue a CBDC as outlined in
their January 2022 discussion paper.   
   
While no decisions have been made to issue a CBDC, our report will help
policymakers understand the technical design choices of a CBDC system,
and how those choices can best align with the values of the Biden-Harris
administration.   
   
These two reports and the larger suite of reports that Secretary Yellen
just mentioned are only the beginning.  We need to continue working
across the federal government to implement the recommendations.   
   
As we take action, we look forward to supporting innovation while
prioritizing equity, inclusion, and national security.  We will work to
expand the benefits of technological innovations for all the American
public while reducing harmful financial practices like predatory
inclusion of underserved communities.   
   
It’s going to take a broad coalition of stakeholders to do this, working
together, but we can achieve these goals.  And we really appreciate your
interest today and this policy work.   
   
With that I turn things back over to you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Thanks to our speakers for their remarks.  This
concludes the on-the-record portion of the call.   
   
We’re going to now switch to on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials” for the question-and-answer session of the
call.  
   
For your awareness and not for reporting, the speakers on the call are
\[senior administration officials\].   
   
So, Operator, could you please queue up the directions to ask a
question?  We’re going to take as many questions as we can in the time
that we have.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) what you might say to somebody who is hungry for action
— who sees what you’re doing and the methodical process, yet feels like
it’s not commensurate with where we are in the evolution of these assets
and has seen the implosion of a stable coin — so-called stable coin,
recently; the precipitous drop in Bitcoin; and how leveraged this
industry is becoming (inaudible) it’s becoming; and sees you plodding
through this but not getting to anything actionable.   
   
I wonder what you would say in response to that, and also, when we might
see steps that would be that — would be, say, the recommendation whether
or not to do a CBDC.  More concrete steps than just more reports and
more research.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, this is (senior administration
official).  I’ll take the question because your question is
fundamentally around the risks and it sounds like particularly the risks
around consumer protection.   
   
There are some key recommendations on actions regarding consumer
protection.  There are actions regarding asking agencies to particularly
— I’ll just pull that up quickly here.   
   
First, on the congressional side.  As you know, Congress is debating
legislative steps in that way.  But with regard to actually pursuing
further work, it calls on agencies to follow up and do the work, to
assess the use by consumers.   
   
And frankly, in addressing criminal activity, we’ve put a lot of work
into existing law enforcement tools.  And for example, DOJ shut down
Hydra, a Russian language dark net marketplace.  Hydra that uses trade
cryptocurrency for illicit goods and services.  
   
And we’re doing additional work as well for agencies to invest in
training their personnel and acquiring the most advanced analytic tools
for the digital ecosystem.   
   
So I think, to your point, we have significant concerns.  We’re asking
agencies to double down on their work on enforcement of existing
regulations, treating these as digital assets, and also looking
carefully to say what additional work is needed in the space and
watching for the work happening on the Hill to add additional regulation
that may be needed as well.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Do any of our other speakers have any comments
before we move to the next question?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  This is (senior administration
official).  So I reinforce what (senior administration official) just
said.  One of the reports on the consumer use cases and protections
looks exactly at what the current use cases are, identifies areas of
misconduct, risks to market integrity, and reinforces with
recommendations for the agencies that have already taken enforcement
actions to continue to aggressively pursue those actions to address the
instances of frauds and scams and other misconduct.   
   
At the same time, it highlights that there are some potential use cases
for this technology, especially like distributed ledger technology that
could allow more automated transactions, peer to peer, faster settlement
and clearing.   
   
And so, you’re trying to just make recommendations to address
misconduct, risk to market integrity while at the same time reserving
some space for innovation to be able to continue.   
   
On your point about Central Bank Digital Currency, the report makes a
recommendation to advance further work on policy and technical issues,
you know, so that the U.S. is in a position to issue one should it be
determined in the national interest.   
   
But I would start with thinking about Central Bank digital currency.  It
is just the country’s sovereign currency in digital form.  It is not —
it’s a special type of financial asset; it is not just the consumer
financial asset.   
   
There are many considerations to con- — to consider, many factors to
consider.  On the one hand, it’s for competition and innovation and
payments, financial inclusion.  But there are some risks as well,
including the effects on the private intermediation sector, especially
in times of stress.  
   
So, I think it is a question that needs to be seriously considered by —
by many across the government.  And I think — so the recommendation is
to advance that and have a sequence of regular meetings to discuss the
merits of the policies and the technological features of a CBDC — of a
potential CBDC.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Anyone else?  All right.  Let’s go to our second
question, please.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you.  Thank you for taking questions.  I really
appreciate it.  I have — I have a couple questions.  The first being:
After doing all of this information collecting and all of this research,
is there any rulemaking through the agencies that the speakers would
deem appropriate in the foreseeable future that seem, you know, common
sense and obvious given how the industry is evolving?  
   
And then I have another question.  We’ve seen a couple — a few
legislative proposals on what would be regulation for digital assets. 
And is there — given what we’re talking about today through the
executive branch, is there a concern that lawmakers pursuing their own
sort of legislation, along with the executive branch pursuing research
and eventually giving its own recommendation, there could potentially be
any kind of inconsistency in the regulation of the market?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can start with that. This current set
of reports does not ask for specific legislative recommendations.   
   
You may be familiar with a report that had been issued by the
President’s Working Group on Financial Markets with the OCC and the FDIC
to recommend legislation for stable coin, where the work had identified
some regulatory gap.  So they’re — that had been a legislative
recommendation.   
   
There is — as \[senior administration official\] had mentioned, there is
another report that Treasury lead — as leading the Financial Stability
Oversight Council, will issue in several weeks.  And in that report,
they were tasked to look at the current regulations and identify any
regulatory gaps.  So that that work is still ongoing; the council
members are discussing that.  
   
So — but in this case, these reports — that had not been the task.  But
there is still plenty to do, just to be clear. The — you know, one of
the recommendations in the consumer and investor protection report was
to ask the agencies to carefully review their sets of authorities, what
they’re using for enforcement, what kinds of authorities they have for
guidance, and whether in a coordinated manner the regulatory agencies
have — can address the risks of these activities.  
   
Now, these activities are often financial; they provide financial
services.  Financial services have been provided in this country for a
long time, it’s — but the underlying technology has changed.  But it
seems the regula- — the regulations often address the function and the
service and are indifferent to the technology.  So much of what the
existing laws and authorities can address much of the problem.  And one
the question — and we — we recommend enforcing compliance and applying
the authorities, and especially in a coordinated way if that expands the
reach.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Anyone else have any other thoughts before we go
to our next question?  All right, let’s go to our third question
please.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for — thanks for doing this.  My question is: I
understand in the executive order, one of the reports relating to a
Central Bank digital currency was going to be focused on the question of
whether legislation would be necessary or — for the creation of a
digital dollar.  And so, I guess my question is basically a practical
one of, is that report — I guess, what is the finding of that report
from DOJ?  Will — is it necessary for Con- — to act on a (inaudible) to
create a digital dollar or what the status of that is?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, Andrew.  I’ll take that one.  We’re
not going to get ahead of ourselves now while the Fed studies the
issue.  We believe it’s important to work with Congress on this like we
have been and are continuing to do.  
   
MODERATOR:  I think we can go to our next question please.  
   
Q    Hi.  Yes, thanks for taking these questions.  Talking about in the
executive — in the summary here about balancing financial innovation
with consumer protection and other factors, are there examples of
innovation in the private sector that you can identify that are
furthering the goals of financial inclusion, reducing costs, and that
sort of thing?  And are there ways in which you recommend maybe easing
off on regulations that you might have recommended because you want to
foster that innovation?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think the — I think there are
definitely examples of private-sector innovations exploring the use of
distributed ledger technology for applications.   
   
So you — there are financial institutions that have internal clearing
and settlement systems, and this can speed it up, make it faster,
instantaneous, so that — for example, balances you have to hold for
end-of-day settlement, it reduces sort of the holding costs of various
securities.  There are numbers of examples where private firms are
testing this internally.  
   
I think the potential for distributed ledger technology to — for more
broader consumer uses is still being tested.  And what we’ve seen over
the last couple of years is that most of the consumer use has been kind
of more trading and lending and borrowing.  And, you know, as I said, we
— you know, are many cases of misconduct and fraud.   
   
And so, we would — we definitely recommend we want to, you know,
aggressively pursue those and enforce current authorities.  
   
But I don’t — I think we’re starting from a place where a new technology
is finding new places to test.  And we can anticipate where some
products look like they could present risks, such as stable coin, and
try to regulate in anticipation of them becoming large and more
potentially pose larger risks to financial stability.  But I can’t cite
an example that you cited of pulling back on something at this point.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you. I think we can go to our next question please.  
   
Q    Hey, there.  Thanks for the time.  So, you know, I’ve heard — it
seems like more and more lawmakers these days are criticizing the SEC
specifically in its — with regard to its mission to facilitate capital
formation by updating its rules in light of this technology.  And the
industry, similarly, has been asking for some kind of path so they can
know if we take these steps — you know, we’re — we’re within
guidelines.   
   
So I’m just curious: Is the administration’s position that some kind of
regulatory update is needed for blockchains?  Or do you — does it agree
with SEC Chair Gensler that the existing guidance for coin and token
issuers is adequate already?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So I’ll jump in.  This is \[senior
administration official\].  One of the recommendations — that regulators
will issue new rules and guidance to resolve confusion and close gaps
related to existing financial regulations applications to
cryptocurrency.   
   
So that’s a recognition that we see work needed in this space.  And
that’s work that we intend — obviously, regulators operate
independently, but that’s a clear recommendation coming out of the
studies that were done.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Let’s go to our next question, please.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you so much for holding this.  I wanted to follow up on
Brady’s question just now.  We’re hearing increasingly from a lot of
crypto companies that the lack of clarity on how to register and provide
disclosure is becoming a major issue for them in terms of, you know,
figuring out how to legally operate within the U.S.   
   
With the — with the acknowledgement that the SEC and the CFTC are
independent regulators, would the administration consider or does it
plan to try and create a perhaps more clear definition of, you know,
just where the line is between what could be deemed security and what
could be deemed a commodity, and just — you know, how that would apply
in, you know, 2022 given how many cryptocurrency projects there are out
there at this point?  
   
MODERATOR:  \[Senior administration official\], do you want to take that
one?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So I think —  
   
MODERATOR: Go ahead.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Just going back to your original point
being the SEC and the CFTC being independent agencies, we need to start
with from there.  The point of these reports was to assess, you know,
the broader digital assets space in terms of risks and how they — risks
and potential benefits, and how they achieved inclusion, equity,
privacy, national security, global leadership.   
   
Some of those issues, the recommendation is for the agencies to clarify,
review their rules, clarify, coordinate.  And I think that their view
is, as they have expressed — and I’m just saying what they have said —
they have the necessary authorities.  It is that many of the firms are
not complying with their existing rules.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you for doing the call.  I’m actually a bit confused by
the last two responses.  Because on the one hand, it sounds like the
administration is making some recommendations to agencies to provide
more clarity to the industry, and especially since so much of what is in
the kind of factsheet is focused on maintaining U.S. leadership and
innovation.  At the same time, you just said that the agencies have said
that they have, you know, all the authorities they need and that these
firms are just not in compliance.  And those two things seem a little —
those two messages that we’re hearing from you seem a bit at odds.  So
could you, I guess, give us a little more clarity on what exactly it is
that the report says or recommends to agencies like the SEC and the
CFTC?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The exact recommendation is that the
agencies should continue to do — so, for example, to issue guidance and
rules to address current and emerging risks in products and services for
consumers, investors, and businesses.  And agencies should work
collaboratively to promote consistent and comprehensive oversight.   
   
I think you’re pointing to a tension which is that this is a new and
very rapidly developing product space, and we — it needs to —
regulations need to be able to adjust to these new products and
activities that are being offered.  So I don’t really think there is a
tension.  It’s just the nature of the development of this technology —
the rapid development of the technology.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, this is \[senior administration
official\].  So I’ll jump in, you know, to the question you asked.  So
there were two sets of recommendations.   
   
The first one, building on \[senior administration official\]’s
comments, were that financial regulators — like the SEC and CFTC, as
well as law enforcement agencies — should redouble their investigations
and enforcement actions against illicit, fraudulent, or deceptive
digital asset practices under their jurisdictions, as they already have
the mandate to do.  This includes scaling-up people, training, and
technological capacity like blockchain analysis capabilities.  And the
CFPB and FTC will do the same with their response to and investigations
of consumer complaints.   
   
And in addition — building on that, we ask that agencies — the
recommendation was that agencies pursue initiatives to promote consumer
educational literacy about digital assets.  And the Financial Literacy
and Education Commission will coordinate those efforts.   
   
A second set of recommendations were that regulators will issue new
rules and guidance to resolve confusion and close gaps related to
existing financial regulations applications to cryptocurrency.   
   
But what’s an overriding piece and the sum takeaway is that until now
the approach to digital assets has been very much an agency-by-agency
approach.   
   
Now the White House is saying, the President’s direction is that we
bring the various goals we have here — around climate and environment,
international engagement, illicit finance, financial stability, consumer
protection, and domestic innovation — and integrate the recommendations,
which in some cases are competing, so that we have a holistic approach
to digital assets, along with working with the Hill closely — as we are
— to ensure that we’re working that arm in arm for the Hill’s
independent opportunity to legislate with what can be done under
executive authority, or by agencies pursuing digital assets under
existing authorities for financial tools but with updates to the way
they approach it because they often require, frankly, training and
capabilities within government to do that, that may not already be in
place or may need to be augmented.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you both.  We have time for just one more question. 
So could we do our last question, please?  
   
Q    Yeah, this last question is going to be a bit anticlimactic
compared to the other ones.  The readout that we got mentions FedNow and
the potential utility of FedNow as an instantaneous, 24/7 interbank
clearing system.  I’m wondering to what extent the administration views
this as something that could address many of the needs that a CBDC might
meet or might address?  I know that there are some folks at the Fed who
have made that point in the past.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So for the FedNow or instant payment
system is clearly a technological development that can make the payment
system faster and cheaper, more efficient, and could — by lowering costs
— address some of the financial inclusion considerations that are
important for — under this EO and for this administration.   
   
A CBDC is somewhat — is different in the sense of yes, it is also a
payment mechanism; it is money.  But it’s also, you know, the — it’s a
liability — a direct liability of the central bank.  So it has — it is —
you would choose a CBDC not only for the purposes of making payments
more efficient, but for a number of other reasons.   
   
And one could imagine a system where you would have instant payments and
a CBDC.  They don’t have to be substitutes, but they both can improve a
payment system.  But the CBDC has other attributes and potentially
different sets of risks that need to be considered, which is why this
sort of recommendation to continue to advance the research on a CBDC.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, I’ll make a few comments to build
on that.  You know, to the question Chris asked earlier regarding what
is the value-add of cryptocurrencies and, in this case specifically, of
the CBDC, and potentially could be faster settlements, particularly
faster cross-border settlements.   
   
And FedNow — and you saw the commitments that the Vice Chairman of the
Fed recently rolled out for spring of 2023 — makes real progress on
moving to a more rapid settlement bank to bank within the U.S., which is
critical.  Right?  That’s a foundational step.   
   
So even as we continue to pursue the research and technology — the R&D
around a CBDC, we make progress in parallel with the FedNow rollout. 
And one of the key attributes of that, which is more rapid settlement:
We participate in pilots with some of our international partners and
what that might look like from a global perspective as well.   
   
Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  All right.  Thank you so much.   Any other last thoughts
from our speakers on the call?   
   
Okay, great.  Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today.   
   
As a reminder, this entire call — both the on-the-record and
on-background portion — is under embargo.  The embargo will lift
