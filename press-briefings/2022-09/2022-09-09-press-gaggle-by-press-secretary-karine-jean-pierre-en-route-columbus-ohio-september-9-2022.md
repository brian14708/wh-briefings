Aboard Air Force One

En Route Columbus, Ohio

10:17 A.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Okay.  Just one thing at the top.  
   
Q    The Queen?   
   
(Laughter.)  Sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  As you all know, we are on our way to Licking County,
Ohio, for the groundbreaking of Intel’s new semiconductor manufacturing
facility.  
   
Thanks to the passage of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, companies
across the country, including right here in Ohio — where we’re headed —
are investing in American manufacturing and creating tens of thousands
of new jobs.   
   
As the President has said many times, he is committed to being a
President for all Americans — for Americans in red states, blue states,
and every state in between.   
   
As this week — as the first in a series of Communities in Action events,
we hosted nearly 50 local elected officials and community leaders from
Ohio at the White House to explain how the American Rescue Plan,
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS Act
are delivering for the people in — of Ohio.  The White House will
continue hosting state and local leaders from across the country to
demonstrate how our administration is delivering results for the
American people.  
   
And with that, Aamer, you want to kick us off?  
   
Q    Yeah.  That would be great.  So, yesterday, Congressman Ryan had
made a comment, I believe in a Youngstown television interview, when
asked if the President should seek a second term, and that his hunch is
that we needed new leadership and that it was a time for a generational
move.  And he also described himself as an “independent,” not as a
Democrat.  I — just generally, do you have any response to that?  And is
there any concern that he’s almost running as if he’s not on the same
team as President Biden?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, when it comes to that — the last part of your
question, I’ll just let Congressman Tim Ryan speak to that and explain
that further.  
   
What I can say is we’re — as you know, we’re headed to Ohio to celebrate
this groundbreaking of Intel’s new $20 billion semiconductor
manufacturing facility.   
   
As you know, Congressman Tim Ryan is going to be attending, along with
several other elected officials from across the aisle will be joining us
as well, because this is something that a critical, important — that is
critically important to our economy and to our national security.  And
that’s really going to be our focus.  
   
Anything else, I would just point you back to the congressman.  
   
Q    Any plans for — any updates on the Queen’s funeral and if the
President will be attending?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, one of the things that we want to be mindful of —
as you all know, there’s a process, there’s a protocol here — official
protocol through which leaders are invited.  So we’re not going to get
ahead of that protocol.  And when we have an update, we’ll certainly
share that.  
   
Q    But the President did say that he would probably go.  So that’s his
intention, is it not?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I’ll — I’ll just say: We just want to be mindful
of the protocol.  I’ll let the President’s statement stand for itself.  
   
I do want to say one thing.  You know, her — just more broadly, her loss
will be felt by people around the world, as we have seen already.  Like
the President said yesterday, the Queen was a stead — “steadying
presence” and admired around the world.  As Queen, she met 13 Presidents
— or 14 Presidents.  Most around the world have not known a United
Kingdom without her.  Our nations and people have a strong bond.  And —
and I think I speak for the country when we say our thoughts are with
the people of the United Kingdom.  
   
Q    Karine, two questions.  One, on Ukraine: The Ukrainians appear to
be making rapid advances east of Kharkiv.  What is the U.S. government’s
assessment of what’s going on there?  Is — are the Russians retreating? 
Are their forces collapsing there?  What is — what are people
thinking?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we have always — we have always said, you know, we
leave, you know, the military assessment — the military movement of what
Ukraine is doing to Ukraine.  That is — that is, they know the best way
to be fighting for their independence, to be fighting for their
freedom.  
   
What we are going to continue to do — and the President has been clear,
our allies and partners have been clear — is we’re going to provide the
assistance that’s needed to give them, you know, a strong — a strong
hand on the battlefield and also at the negotiating table when that
presents itself.  
   
But we’re not going to get into specifics of, kind of, their military
movements or how they’re — how they’re fighting for — fighting for their
own — for their sovereign country.  
   
Q    Secretary Blinken was on the ground in Ukraine yesterday.  Did he
give the President his assessment or any assessment of what he saw
there, what his sense of it on the ground is?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to read out to you as any calls
or conversation that the President had with Secretary Blinken.   
   
Q    Karine —  
   
Q    Karine —  
   
Q    I’m sorry.  So, related to Ukraine, has that changed the assessment
on what the administration is going to ask Congress for as it relates to
continued military assistance, how large that package needs to be, and
how quickly a package like that would need to be approved by Congress?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just give you a little bit about what we’re
asking for:  
   
So, four-point — $4.5 billion to provide critical defense capabilities
and equipment for Ukraine, including replenishments of DOD stocks. 
Nearly two thirds of previous emergency appropriations from Congress for
this purpose have already been committed.  And we expect another $3.5
billion to be committed before the end of the fiscal year.   
   
We are relatedly asking for an additional $3.6 billion in President —
Presidential Drawdown Authority, $2.7 billion in funding to continue
military intelligence and other defense support.   
   
Most of the funding for these purposes from previous appropriations will
be used by the end of the year, of this fiscal year: $4.5 billion to
continue to provide direct budget support to the Government of Ukraine
through the next quarter, $2 billion to help address the impacts Putin’s
war has had on domestic energy supply and reduce energy costs in the
future.  
   
So that’s kind of what the breakdown is — is there.  
   
And so, we’ve been very clear that what we’re going to be doing is we’re
going to be working the phones and holding briefings to express urgency
of our requests as it relates to the CR.  Senior administration
officials, including OMB Director Shalonda Young, have held numerous
calls with lawmakers to explain the need and highlight the emergency
nature of this request.   
   
We’re also holding multiple bipartisan and bicameral briefings with the
Hill to walk through our requests and answer questions.  
   
So, expect us to continue to press lawmakers, as we have been, to make
sure that we deliver on these bipartisan issues.  
   
Q    Karine, North Korea has codified its stances on nuclear power. 
They say they’re — that position is irreversible and that they’re
considering first-strike capability.  Is that a reflection of your
administration’s failure to get them to the table to start talking about
their nuclear program?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean, we were aware of these reports.  And we’ve
been very clear, since the beginning of this President’s administration,
that our policy — and our policy remains unchanged.  The United States
remains focused on continuing to coordinate closely with our allies and
partners to address the threats posed by DPRK and to advance our shared
objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
That has not changed.  
   
And we have made clear: We have no hostile intent toward the DPRK.  And
as we have said — and North Korean officials, including Kim Jong Un,
have publicly noted — we continue to seek diplomacy and are prepared to
meet without preconditions.  The DPRK continues to not respond.  And
we’ve been very clear and upfront about that.  
   
But again, we remain fully committed to the defense of the Republic of
Korea, using the full range of defense capabilities.  
   
Q    You released a 60-page economic framework this morning talking
about your comprehensive strategies.  The word “trade” does not appear
in there and neither does tariffs.  Two years into this administration
nearly, and there’s no real strategy or direction from this President on
trade or tariffs — not just China, but more broadly.  Why is that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not going to get into any decisions or
thinking process of the administration.  You know, I would refer you to
Ambass- — Administrator — Ambassador Kai \[sic\] — Tai, who is clearly
focusing on these issues.  But I don’t have anything specific more to
share on that.  
   
Q    Karine, could the President talk about marijuana legalization
before the midterms?  Is that a thing that’s on his agenda?  Because
it’s — it’s coming up from a lot of his allies.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — yeah, and I know this question has come up a
couple of times.  
   
Q    Yes.  It’s come up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I realize.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ve talked about it —   
   
Q    Yeah.  Yeah.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — in the briefing room —  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — a couple — I think a couple of weeks back.   
   
Q    Yeah, but just like, you know —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — generally speaking, what’s — what is his position?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —  
   
Q    And could it be something he talks about before midterms?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean, look, the President has — believes that
there are too many people serving unduly long sentences for nonviolent
drug crimes, a disproportionate number who — of whom are Black and
brown.   
   
That’s why in April, during the second month — Second Chance Month,
President Biden announced 75 sentence commutations and three pardons,
which are more grants of clemency at this point in a presidency than any
of his five recent — most recent predecessors.   
   
As I’ve said before, as you know — because we just said that — the
President supports leaving decisions regarding legalization for
recreational use up to the states, rescheduling cannabis as a Schedule
II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.  And
at the federal level, he supports decriminalizing marijuana use and
automatically expunging any prior criminal records.   
   
I don’t have anything else to share in up — in the upcoming weeks.  
   
Q    Karine, you mentioned working the phones just a little bit ago. 
What is the President going to do on the same-sex marriage legislation? 
Is he working the bill?  Is he calling Republicans to get some of those
that are kind of on the fence off the fence?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Alex, as you know, when it comes to the — you
know, the same-sex marriage bill or same-sex marriage just more broadly
and where the President stands, he’s been very clear — he was very clear
as a vice president, certainly throughout his career.  That is something
that he supports and has — and has been a proud advocate of that
issue.   
   
Look, as it — as it relates to this particular legislation that’s in
Congress, we put forward a SAP — a statement that supports this
legislation that is before — that’s coming before the Senate, as you
just laid out.  
   
Look, our office — you know, our White House officials are going to
continue to do what they do on every legislation that’s important to the
President, and that’s talk to staff — staff on the Hill and
congressional members.   
   
And the President has been — it is — I know you’re asking me what he’s
going to do, but it’s very clear where the President stands on this
issue.  And he has been, again, a leading advocate, a leading voice, and
I don’t think anyone is confused by that.  
   
Q    Okay.  But precisely, is he going to pick up the phone and start
calling?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, as you know, we do not share out conversations
that the President has or specific conversations on specific issues.  We
have been very clear about that these past — especially these past
several months.  
   
So what we are going to do is we’re going to continue to have the
conversations that we always do when it’s — when it is an issue or a
piece of legislation that is important to the administration — but not
just the administration, to the American people.  
   
Q    The President the other day sort of indicated — he was asked, I
think, by Sebastian, maybe, about meeting with President Xi in — at the
G20.  Tell us about the conversations — any planning conversations to
make that conversation happen.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m not going to get — get ahead of the
President.  I’m not going to get ahead of any potential announcement
that may be coming forth around the G20.  
   
Q    Is that something — is that something the administration wants to
see happen, though?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m not — as you know, the President has talked
to President Xi multiple times.  And they’ve had frank, you know,
leader-to-leader conversation.  We have read out all of those
conversation that they have had.  I just don’t have anything further to
share.  
   
Q    How about if he runs into Putin at the G20?  Would — would — you
know, would —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   All these hypotheticals, Sebastian. (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Well, it’s not that hypothetical, right?  I mean, really.  You know
—  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, we have a long way to go before we get —
get to — get to that.  So —  
   
Go ahead.  Last question.  
   
Q    Okay.  So European leaders are obviously —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible.)  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    European leaders are obviously focused on trying to address a
potential energy crisis there.  What’s the level of concern inside the
White House?  And are you worried about a potential spillover impact in
the U.S.?  
   
And then, separately, does the President plan to visit Jackson,
Mississippi?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, on your — on your last question, I don’t have
anything to read out or — we don’t have anything to share on any visit
to Jackson, Mississippi.  We’ve been very clear on the assistance and —
that we have provided — the surge of assistance that the President
called for after we got the declaration from the governor last week for
need for federal assistance.   
   
As you all know, the FEMA Administrator was there recently. She’s been
working very closely with local officials.  Our EPA Administrator was
there very recently.  So we have EPA on the ground.  We have FEMA on the
ground.  We have the Army Corps on the ground.  They are doing
everything to make sure that bottled water is being handed out. 
Millions of bottled water — more than 5 million — has been already given
out.  And we are expediting the equipment that is needed to really get
that facility moving in a way that they can — they can actually provide
clean water to the community.  
   
So that is something that — we are making that a priority.  Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, American Rescue Plan — there’s funding there for the
state — for the state of Mississippi, including Jackson more
specifically.   
   
And so we’re going to continue to work with officials, making sure that
the people of Mississippi get that relief that they so- — they sorely
need.  
   
Look, as it comes to, you know, the — the threat — the exports and the —
and the energy that we — that is happening in Europe, look, we’ve been
very clear here: Putin’s weaponizing of energy is only strengthening our
unity and resolve in the face of Putin’s aggression.  That’s how we see
it.  
   
The President and our partners in Europe predicted this playbook.  The
President and EU President von der Leyen set up a joint task force back
in March.  And we have been working for months to increase alternative
sources of natural gas to Europe and help reduce Europe’s demand for
Russian energy through increased efficiency and clean energy
deployment.  
   
But we know that we — there’s more work that needs to be done.  And so,
we’re going to continue to work closely with our — with our allies in
looking for ways to increase gas stockpiles in Europe and to help
bolster other sources of energy where possible.  
   
Q    On Tuesday —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Last question.  
   
Q    Yeah, last one to me.  Last one to the ladies — the ladies. 
Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The ladies’ question.  Okay.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    On Tuesday, the President is hosting a bunch of lawmakers and, you
know, allies at the White House to celebrate the passage of the
Inflation Reduction Act.  We’re expecting the latest inflation numbers
to come out the same day.  
   
I’m wondering if you could give us a sense of what your economic aides
are expecting from that number.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything to predict.  What I can say
— as you know, Nancy; as many of you know — this has been an economic
priority for this President as it relates to lowering inflation,
lowering costs, more specifically for the American people.  
   
That’s why the Inflation Reduction Act is so important as you look at
what it’s going to do on the healthcare side — bringing down Medicare
costs for our seniors; really dealing with climate change in a real way,
the most robust investment ever in our history.  
   
And we always know there’s more work to do.  But as we’ve seen from
other reports — CPI report last month, showing that — in July, the
easing of inflation, which is a good sign.  
   
But look, we’re going to continue to do the work.  Regardless of what
those numbers are or what — what we’re going to see on that day, we are
going to continue to do the work that we have been doing — for example,
lowering gas prices, as we have seen for the last 86, 87 days, getting
that to — lowering that by more than a dollar — more than a dollar at —
per gallon at gas pumps across the country.  
   
And so, that is going to be the President’s priority. That’s — we’re
going to Ohio to talk about the CHIPS Act, which is going to create jobs
— manufacturing jobs; protect our — protect our national security;
strengthen — will strengthen our national security, strengthen our
supply chain.  
   
All of these things are part of the President’s economic plan to really
not leave anybody behind, to build the economy from the bottom up and
the middle out.  And that’s going to be the focus for us continuing.  
   
All right.  Thanks, everybody.  I’ll see you on the ground.
