James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:55 P.M. EDT   
      
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Okay.  
   
The Queen has been — the — I’m so sorry.  Good afternoon, everybody. 
It’s been a long morning.  
   
All right, let’s do this again.  The President has been briefed and will
be updated throughout the day on the concerning news out of the United
Kingdom about Queen Elizabeth’s health.  His and the First Lady’s
thoughts are with the Queen and her family today.   
   
The President also conveyed to Prime Minister Truss during a previously
scheduled video conference this morning that he and Dr. Biden are
thinking of the Queen, her family, and the people of the United
Kingdom.   
   
This morning, the President hosted the video conference with allies and
partners to underscore international support for Ukraine, including
through continued security and economic assistance, and the sustained
imposition of costs on Russia to hold the Kremlin accountable for its
aggression.   
   
They discussed Russia’s weaponization of energy and additional steps to
secure sustainable, affordable energy supplies for Europe.  They
committed to continued close consultation on this issue.  
   
In a few — in a few — in about an hour or so, the President will give
remarks on the new, updated COVID-19 vaccines with a simple, clear
message: “Don’t wait.  Get a COVID shot this fall.”   
   
He’ll note that with these new, updated vaccines, we’re entering a new
moment in our fight against COVID.  For most Americans who are fully
vaccinated, our nation’s health experts are recommending that you get
the updated COVID vaccine once a year.   
   
The President will also discuss our plan to ensure Americans get these
new vaccines and are preparing for the fall and winter.   
   
First, by making these vaccines available for free and easy to get at
tens of thousands of convenient locations.   
   
Second, we’re also doing our part by taking action.  While we’re
constrained in what we can do with our limited remaining COVID re- —
response funding, we’re acting to further increase access to tests and
treatments, including by purchasing some more tests and launching a new
pilot program to further expand testing.   
   
Third, the President will call on everyone to do their part, with
specific calls to action for schools and businesses.   
   
Last, the President will continue to call on Congress to take — to take
action on the administration’s request for additional COVID-19 funding
so we can make important investments to support testing, long-COVID
research, and the development of next-generation vaccines and
research.   
   
So, here’s the bottom line: The President will underscore that we’ve
come a long way in the last 19 months.  People are back to work, kids
are back in school, and we can now prevent the most serious outcomes
from COVID.  And if we all stay vigilant and keep doing our part, we can
build on this progress and keep people safe, manage COVID, and minimize
disruptions this fall and winter.   
   
Lastly, tomorrow, President Biden will travel to Licking County, Ohio,
to deliver remarks at the groundbreaking of Intel’s new $20 billion
semiconductor manufacturing facility.   
   
Intel committed this funding in anticipation of the passage of the
bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.  The facility will be built by union
labor, creating over 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time,
producing, leading-edge CHIPS jobs as well. 

Thanks to the President’s economic plan, U.S. manufacturing is back. 
Our economy has already added more than 680,000 manufacturing jobs since
President Biden took office, which is more manufacturing jobs on average
per month than any other President in the last 50 years.   
   
Just in the last few weeks, Micron announced it will invest fifty — $15
billion in a new memory chip manufacturing facility in Boise, Idaho,
creating 17,000 jobs.   
   
GlobalFoundries and Qualcomm are partnering to invest $4.2 billion to
manufacture chips in an upstate New York facility.   
   
Major global companies like Toyota and Honda are choosing America as the
place to invest and build.   
   
When we make more in America, we strengthen our supply chains, bolster
our economic and national security, and lower costs for Americans.   
   
The CHIPS and Science Act is a once-in-a-generation law that invests in
America itself, and it’s a law that American people should be proud
of.   
   
With that, go ahead, Aamer.  Good to see you.   
   
Q    Good to see you, too.  Does the White House support putting Senator
Manchin’s permitting reform measure in the continuing resolution needed
to fund the government?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say — say that one more time.  
   
Q    Sure.  Does the White House support putting Senator Manchin’s
permitting reform measure into the CR?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we support the permitting reform bill, which will
help us realize the benefits of the historic investments in the
Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastruc- — Infrastructure
Law as well.  We want to see it enacted.  We are working with Senator
Schumer and Senator Manchin to find the best path forward.   
   
We think it’s important to meet the country’s clean energy goals and to
reduce cost and to promote energy security.  Permitting always delays a
new solar and new wind projects are among the longest in our — in our
country.  
   
So, right now, as you all know, we’ve seen gas prices moving downward at
a record pace in — fastest pace in history — in our history.  The point
of this legislation is to help ensure a long-term clean energy supply
for this country.  And — and so, we’re going to continue to work with
Senator Schumer on this.  
   
Q    With the permitting reform, the White House believes it could have
an effect on a downward trend with gas prices?  
   
    MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, again, you know, we’ve done the work to see
the prices of gas at the pump go down every day this summer —
consecutive days, 86 days.  It’s at three hu- — $3.75 per gallon
nationally.  And so, we’ve done the work to do that.  
   
What we see this will help us do is ensure long-term clean energy supply
for this country.  And so, this is — this is a reason why we think this
is important.   
   
Q    And just lastly on that: Is there any concern –there’s obviously
differences amongst Democrats on this — that this could sink a CR and
lead to a government shutdown?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Meaning this particular —  
   
Q    Yeah, this issue.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, the way that we see this is this is not the
first time that we’re going through a process — a CR process.  We did it
last year.  And we believe that it can happen again, that Congress can
move forward and get the CR done.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You’ve been referring to this new shot as the “updated
COVID-19 vaccine.”  Can you explain a little bit more the decision to no
longer be calling it just a booster?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we — we have to remember we haven’t seen a
vaccine — a new vaccine since December 2020.  Our health and medical
experts made an independent determination that we now have new, updated
vaccine, as you just said, to fight COVID.  It is the first time that we
have seen this type of updated vaccine, like I said, since December of
2020.  
   
And if you — and the message to folks that we are — we’re — we are
providing is: If you’re 12 or older and it’s been at least two months
since you last got a shot, you should get these new updated vaccines
right away.  That’s the doctor’s advice.  And they made this decision
independently.  
   
Q    But you do still need to get the first original dose before you can
get this shot.  The FDA, the CDC — they’re still referring to this as a
booster.  So, I guess, why the discrepancy?  Are you concerned that may
cause some confusion?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I’m not going to get into, like, regulatory
language on what to call this.  I’ll leave that to a booster or a
vaccine.  We’ll just lay — I’m just laying out what the doctors and the
experts have recommended.  
   
This is, again, a new vaccine.  We haven’t seen a new vaccine since
December of 2020.  What this vaccine does — it targets the Omicron
variant, which is the dominant variant not just here, but globally.  And
this is — this is good news.  This is a step forward.  And we’re going
hear more from the President about this.  
   
But we think this is, again, a good step forward.  We are in a place
where COVID is now manageable.  We know what works.  We know what keeps
us safe, what keeps us from not getting sick — is by getting
vaccinated.  
   
And right now, if you think about it, there’s more than 200 million
Americans who are currently fully vaccinated.  That’s 77 percent of the
population who are 12 and older.  And so, that’s — that’s an important
way forward that the President has worked very hard since stepping into
the administration to make sure that we had a comprehensive vaccine, you
know, getting shots into arms operation.  And this is part of that.  
   
Q    And just a logistical question.  You mentioned the President being
briefed on the Queen’s health.  If she were to pass, should we expect
the President would travel to any service?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we think it’s inappropriate to actually be
talking about that at this time, so I don’t have anything to share on
travel.  
   
Again, you know, as I stated, the people of UK and the family — the
Queen’s family are in the hearts of the President and Dr. Biden.  So,
I’ll leave it there.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Has the White House specifically inquired about
the Queen’s health this morning?  And when was the last time President
Biden actually spoke to the Queen?  Was it at the G7 in Cornwall, or
have they had conversations after that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So they — they last met during the President’s visit
to the United Kingdom in June 2021 in Cornwall, as you just stated, when
she welcomed the President and the First Lady to Windsor Castle.   
   
A few days before that, she also hosted the President and another G7
leaders at a reception in Cornwall, which is what — which is what you
just stated.   
   
Yeah.  That was the last time that they saw each other.  
   
Q    And has the White House specifically inquired about her health, or
has —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I can tell you that the President has been briefed.  I
don’t have any calls to preview at this time.  But he has been briefed
on the situation.  
   
Q    And a quick one on the tech meeting.  We saw the readout that
landed a few minutes ago.  The White House held a listening session with
senior administration officials on the harms caused by big tech.  And we
are sort of just trying to understand, you know, why tech companies were
not invited to participate in such a session and, you know, why did you
decide to have such a meeting now.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, this is, as you know, the largest tech
meeting — convening that we have had at the White House since the be- —
since we have started in the last 19 months.  
   
These — just a couple of things I want to say about this, because it’s
really important.  These principles are the culmination of months of
work by the administration and engagement with numerous stakeholders. 
They also consist with work that the administration has been doing and
will continue to do.   
   
So this is an important roundtable, as you’ve heard from the readout and
as we’ve laid out.  Look, we are — you know, we’re looking forward to
hearing any feedback from the tech companies.  And I’ll just leave it at
that.  
   
Q    Any plans to specifically act on the recommendations that came
out?  I mean, there were —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything — I don’t have anything specific
to add.  Look, again, the roundtable is the largest discussion about the
harms of tech companies, as you just started in your question, held at
the White House.  The President has long called for fundamental
legislative reforms to address these issues, and we look forward to
continuing that work with Congress to make bipartisan progress on these
issues.  
   
Again, the President also encourages federal agencies to use the tools
they have to continue advancing these principles throughout their work,
as well.  And we welcome any — any feedback from the tech companies.  
   
Q    When the President conveyed his thoughts to Prime Minister Truss,
did she offer any update on the Queen’s condition or the Queen’s health,
based on what she knows?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything more to share from — from what I
just stated about him having a conversation or speaking to her briefly
during this call this morning.  
   
Q    Did the President express any concerns over the Queen’s health
after meeting with her, as he did last summer?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Concerns meaning —  
   
Q    Concerns about her health and how she was doing.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That is not information that I have.   
   
Look, you know, I’ll just reiterate this because I think this is
important, which is our countries and people have always had a — or
shared a special relationship.  And our thoughts are – again, are with
the people of the United Kingdom, with the Queen and her family.  And
she, again, as the President has stated — you know, they are in the
hearts of both the President and Dr. Biden.   
   
I don’t have more to share on that.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Do you have any update on when the last time the President has
spoken to the Queen?  Was that when they met, as Kaitlan just
referenced?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yep.  
   
Q    Or have they —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It was when they met in June of 2021, is the last time
they spoke and saw each other.  
   
Q    And then, just on COVID, there’s a projection that the
administration could run out of tests in another — if there’s another
major COVID wave.  I’m wondering if there’s any updates on whether or
not the White House or the administration plans to buy more tests.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, we’ve been very clear we need Congress to pass
the CR.  We have made some cuts here and there to the — to our fall plan
and — and in order to move forward with this COVID vaccine that we’re
talking about, that the President is going to announce today.  We — we
have enough for the fall but not for the winter.

And we have been very clear that in order to — to not — to not be left
behind, to continue moving in our progress, we need Congress to fund the
COVID — you know, the COVID response funds that we have asked for — the
$22 billion.

So we’re going to continue to work with Congress.  We’re going to
continue to have those conversations — those bipartisan conversations to
move that — that conversation forward on getting that CR done.

And so that is a priority for this administration.  We’ve been talking
about that for months now.  There’s nothing new there.  And in order to
continue with the testing, in order to continue with these new vaccines
that are very important, that is a gamechanger in how we’re approaching
managing COVID, we need those funds.

Q    Logistically, would the President be given any sort of heads up if
the Queen does pass?  Or would he find out, kind of, when Buckingham
Palace releases a statement?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I mean, we just feel — we just feel having
those conversations at that time is inappropriate.  Clearly, if anything
is to share, we will share that.  But again, we’re thinking about their
family.  They’re in our hearts.  And just not going to get ahead of that
at this time.

Q    And then, on the President’s call with allies, in the readout they
mentioned that they talked about Russia’s weaponization of energy and
the need to, you know, coordinate on sustainable and affordable energy. 
Is the President concerned that gas prices — you mentioned that they’re
coming down.  Is he concerned about them increasing again?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  In — here in the U.S.?  I mean, the President is doing
everything that he can to make sure that we lower the costs for the
American people.  This has been a priority for him.  And he took really
bold actions to see the trend that we have seen — been seeing with gas
prices, right?  Eighty-six days they’ve been trending down.  And so
we’re encouraged by that.

It’s been — it’s been — it’s been, you know, work that, again, his
leadership from the Strategic Petroleum and making sure that we tap
those — that historic tapping of the Strategic Petroleum of 1 million a
day for — for the last several months, that has helped.  It’s the
ethanol 15 that he made a decision on to make that available during the
summer, which is not a regular time to make that available.

He took bold actions, and now we’re seeing — we’re seeing that effect.

So, look, we’re going to continue to take — to look at all options. 
We’re going to continue to make sure we keep costs down for — for the
American people, including at the pump.

Q    And then you mentioned the President is going to Ohio tomorrow for
this groundbreaking.  Is this going to be something that we’re going to
see throughout the midterms — going to these kinds of ribbon-cutting
ceremonies, groundbreakings?  I mean, is that kind of the focus?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I can’t talk about the midterms from here. 
I can’t talk anything political from — from where I stand and in this
position.

We put out a memo in August laying out what — what the next several
weeks would look like.  We had a string of successes, as you know: the
Inflation Reduction Act, which is going to lower cost for Americans as
it — as it relates to healthcare, as it relates to making sure
prescription drugs are lowered for our seniors, as it relates to
investment in dealing with our climate crisis, which is all incredibly
important.   CHIPS Act — as you know, that’s what he’s going to be
focusing on tomorrow.

And so we’re going to go out there.  We’re going to have those
conversations with the American people.  Not just us — Cabinet
Secretaries; you’re going to see congressional members out there,
Democrats who — who are going to make sure that the American people know
the work that this President and Democrats have done in Congress on
behalf of the American people.

And so we’re going to do that these next several weeks.  The President
is going to go to Ohio.  He’s going to go to other states in the next
couple of weeks.  And this is important.  This is important because as
we talk about the gas prices, the President has been very clear with his
— one of his priorities as it comes to the economy, as it relates to the
economy is to lower costs for the American people.  And so we’re going
to have those conversations across the country.

Go ahead.

Q    Does the President have any intention to go to the British Embassy
to sign any book today, though she’s — since we know that she’s ill, to
express his best wishes to the people of that country?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t — I don’t have any changes to his — his
schedule to announce.

Q    Is that under consideration?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nothing — nothing to — to — on his schedule today
that’s changed at this time that I have to report from here.

Q    Understood.  
   
Let me ask you about an announcement that was made by another news
outlet this week.  It relates to what the Republicans are calling the
“Commitment to America.”  Axios reporting that Kevin McCarthy is going
to unveil this economic agenda later this month in Pittsburgh.  Among
the items it dictates is a desire to put an end to Build Back Better. 
Presumably, that refers to the Inflation Reduction Act.

What’s the President’s view on that, given it’s being celebrated by
Democrats as his — one of his signature achievements?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, it says everything that one of the first acts
that Kevin McCarthy does — his first act when it deals with the economy
and dealing with how do we make — give a little breathing room to the
American people is wanting to get rid of the Inflation Reduction Act,
which we know — which we know the Inflation Reduction Act is going to
help lower costs for our seniors.

It is a — it is a big win for the American people when you think about
beating Big Pharma, something that Democrats and congressional members
have been trying to do for decades, beating a special interest group
that has spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to make sure that
we do not do that — lower cost for our seniors — and also make a real
effort in energy costs and climate change — lowering those costs as
well.

So the fact that that’s the thing, that’s what Kevin McCarthy wants to
do, that tells you everything that you know — that we need to know: that
they are all for tax giveaways.  And — and it’s a clear, clear message
that they are sending to the American people.

Let’s not forget: Medicare is popular with the American people.  What
we’re trying to do is popular with the American people.  Protecting
Social Security, which is something they have put on the chopping —
chopping blocks as well, that is very popular with the American people.

So I think it says — it says all that we need to know about Kevin
McCarthy’s agenda and how it does not stand for the American people.

Q    Last question, very quickly: President Obama, in his last visit to
the White House, turned to reporters and delivered his message to
Democrats on what he thought they needed to do ahead of the midterms. 
There were no comments from him publicly to the reporters that were in
the room.   
   
What did he tell the President yesterday about what he thinks needs to
be done for Democrats, given this uphill climb they still face even
though the polls show it’s an increasingly close midterm ahead?  What
did he say to the President that needs to be done to help sort of turn
that tide?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, again, I can’t talk about the midterms or any
political election from this podium —

Q    About achievements.  We don’t have to talk about the midterms. 
What did he say he needs to do better?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And what I can say is what I reiterated earlier to one
of your colleagues, which is: We are going to talk about the successes
that we have been able to do in the last 19 months for the American
people.  And that is building an economy that works for all, doesn’t
leave anybody behind; make sure that we build an economy from the bottom
up and the middle out.   
   
That’s what you’ve seen with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  That’s
what you’ve seen with the American Rescue Plan.  That’s what you’ve seen
with the CHIPS Act — CHIPS Act — CHIPS and Science Act.

That’s what you see with — again, with the work that this
administration, along with Congress — Democrats in Congress have been
able to do.

We have a lot of things that we can talk about directly with the
American people.  And that’s what we’re going to do. 

The President is going to go to Ohio.  They’re going to — we’re going to
go to Intel.  Intel made this investment in manufacturing jobs
investment because of the CHIPS and Science Act, because of the
commitment that we’re making to manufacturing jobs.

Q    Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And so that’s going to continue to be our focus.

Go ahead.

Q    Yes, on the Queen’s condition, who is briefing the White House
about how she’s doing?  Are you hearing from the Prime Minister?  Are
you hearing from Buckingham Palace?  How are you getting your
information?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not going to go into details or even private
conversation that the President has had on — on the updates that he’s
getting on the Queen.  All I can say is that he’s been briefed.  And he
has sent — he has been very clear on the message through all of you —
sharing with all of you the message that he has to the Queen, her
family, and also the people of the United Kingdom.  
   
Q    On COVID, there’s a report today that the White House might be
looking to wind down the COVID Response Team sometime next year.  Is
that in consideration?  What are — what’s the current thinking about
—   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share on that.  Right now,
we’re still trying to make sure that we — we continue the success that
we have seen with the work that the President has done on COVID.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I have a question about the President meeting with the
— President Xi of China at G20.  The President this week mentioned that
he will see him if President Xi is attending G20.  Is this based on some
communication between two governments?  Or he said —   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Can you sa- — I’m sorry, can you say that again?  
   
Q    The meeting between President Biden and President Xi of China.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have an — I don’t have anything to share on
that.   
   
Q    He mentioned this week that he will see President Xi at the G20 if
— if he attends.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I am not going to get ahead of our plans, of our trip
at this time — or a trip at this time.  We just — I’m not going to
confirm anything from — from here, from you.  
   
Go ahead.  Way in the back.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Yeah, you’ve talked about trying to get costs
down.  A new Gallup poll shows that 24 percent of Americans are spending
less; they’ve changed their spending habits.  Seventeen percent are
driving less because of inflation.  Seventeen percent traveled less or
canceled vacations.   
   
The President has been to his beach house six times.  He went on
vacation in North and South Carolina.  Is he considering any spending
cuts for the administration or for himself personally because of
inflation?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait, can you say that part again?  
   
Q    Yeah.  So, the President is — 17 percent of Americans have —
according to this Gallup poll, have canceled vacations or traveled
less.  The President has been to his beach house six times this year. 
He has been in North and South Carolina on vacation.   
   
Has the President himself considered personally reducing his spending
because of inflation, or had the administration reduced spending because
of inflation?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So can I — I’ll say this: The times that the President
has gone to Delaware, not including — and we were very clear that when
he went to South Carolina in August and Rehoboth, he was going to go
spend time with his family, which every President does.  That is not
unusual.  That is not uncommon to do.  And the President has a right to
spend time with his family, just like every other American across the
country.  And so, that was that piece of — of what ha- — what occurred
in August.   
   
As it relates to trips that he’s made to Delaware: Look, the way we see
that is the President could be President anywhere.  He can — he can work
from the Residence.  He can work from the Oval Office.  He can work from
Delaware.   
   
And that is — that is the work — that is what he’s able to do as
President of the United States.   
   
Look, when it comes to inflation, the President has been very clear on
this.  When it comes to his economic plan and dealing with inflation,
he’s doing everything that he can to make sure that we lower costs. 
That’s why the gas prices going down the last 86 days is a step
forward.  Bringing it down under $4, an average of $3.75, is a step
forward, because the decline that we have seen is indeed historic.  We
haven’t seen that decline in over a decade.   
   
That is why it’s so important that we — we pass the Inflation Reduction
Act.  That is going to change people’s lives.  It is a gamechanger if
you think about senior citizens who are paying thousand doll- —
thousands of dollars a month — $2- to $3,000 a month on prescription
drugs.  Now it’s going to be capped at $2,000 a year.  Those are the
things that’s actually very popular with — with the American people.  
   
And guess what?  Republicans didn’t vote for that.  And Republicans
didn’t support that.  Matter of fact, Republicans — what they have put
forward is putting Medicare and Social Security on the chopping
blocks.   
   
And so, the President is going to continue to be zero-focused on
lowering costs for the American people, and that’s what you’ve seen.   
   
I’m going to move on.   
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
We actually have about 10 minutes left.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Can I actually piggy back, though —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — Karine, on that?  
   
Just to confirm, though, are there any spending plan cuts, either
personally that the President is going to make or the White House? 
Because, you know, as my colleague mentioned, Americans are making some
of those cuts. And I just wanted to get clarity on whether or not that’s
happened?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We understand.  And we have been very clear — and the
President has said this — that we understand what the American people
are going through.  And I want to be —  
   
Q    But no plans for cuts, you’re saying?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What — what I — I want to be very clear that we
understand that there are American people who are still dealing with
high costs.  And we understand that they have those difficult
conversations around the kitchen table about how they’re going to spend
— spend their paycheck.  
   
But we also have to understand is: What the President has been able to
do with the economy — and we — we get it.  There’s still more work to
do.  With the American Rescue Plan, with the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Legislation, with the Inflation Reduction Act, with CHIPS — are all part
of a plan to make sure we don’t leave anybody behind, we bring down
costs. He’s created more than 10 million jo- — 10 million jobs since —
since he — he’s walked into office.  We’re going to talk about COVID.   
   
If it wasn’t for the comprehensive plan that the President had put
forward about — with COVID, we wouldn’t be in the position that we are
right now, with more than 200 million people who are fully
vaccinated.   
   
I don’t have anything else to share on that.  What I can say is the
President has the ability to work from anywhere.  That is the
President’s — one of the President’s obligations that he has.  Wherever
he goes, he’s able to work.  He has a team to do that.   
   
And again, when it comes to high costs, when it comes to tough decisions
that the American people make, he gets that and he’s going to continue
to do the work that we have been doing to bring costs down.  
   
Q    Can I ask you a quick question on an unrelated topic?  The Unity
Summit next week.  Can you provide any details on what exactly it is or
just any additional context on that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’ll have more information for you early —
earlier in the week.  I don’t have any details at this time.   
   
I’m going to keep going.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I will say, I did fill up the tank at the Biden
service area the other day, and the gas prices were a bit lower.   
   
But regarding next week, the President is going to Detroit, to the auto
show.  Secretary Yellen has got a speech at a Ford plant in, I think,
about a half an hour from now.   
   
Is there anything you can preview about the President’s trip to Detroit
yet, or anything further on what Secretary Yellen is doing?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as to what Secretary Yellen is doing, I would
refer you to the Department of Treasury.   
   
I’ll give you a little bit on next week — the Detroit visit.  President
Biden’s economic plan has fueled an electric vehicle manufacturing boom
in America, and you can expect him to talk about that and more in
Detroit.   
   
Under President Biden, the private sector has invested over $100 billion
to make more electric cars and their parts in America, create jobs for
our autoworkers, and strengthen our domestic supply chains.   
   
And just weeks after President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act
into law, major companies have already announced billions of additional
dollars in new investments to boost American clean energy manufacturing
and create good-paying jobs.  
   
And that’s what he’s going to look — that’s what Detroit is going to
look like.   
   
Q    And are you concerned about the possibility that the $7,500 tax
credits may not be available for a lot of these EVs?  There’s been some
reporting that the parts just won’t be from the United States, that the
— the or- — the country-of-origin situation won’t be sufficient for
those.  
   
Is the White House concerned and trying to figure out a way to make sure
that people can actually get those tax credits to buy those EVs?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’re going to do everything that we can to make
sure that — that that part of the Inflation Reduction Act, as it comes
to the climate change, is implemented in a way that the — the American
people sees that direct effect.  It is a priority for us.   
   
We just announced — we announced John Podesta, who’s going to be leading
that effort.   
   
As we have done with the American Rescue Plan, as we have done with the
bipartisan infrastructure legislation, we’re going to make sure that
what we pass — these laws that we pass to improve the Americans lives
are — are implemented in a way that has a real effect and that the
American people truly feel the cost.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I have two questions.  The first is on Queen
Elizabeth.  She has served for nearly a third of American history.  So
how does President Biden view this special relationship between the U.S.
and the UK if there were to be a transition in the British monarchy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, don’t want to — you know, we feel like it’s
inappropriate to talk about hypotheticals here.  We — what we — what I
will say about the relationship with the — with the United Kingdom, as
the President said in celebration of Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, which was
not too long ago, under — and this is quote: Under her “reign, the
relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States has grown
stronger and closer than ever.”  
   
The President, as you all know, has known the Queen for over three
decades.  He’s met — he’s met her personally three times — once was in
June of 2021 — over the years, including, as I said, twice last year.   
   
Again, we see this relationship is stronger — grows stronger every —
grows stronger and closer.  And again, our hearts, the President’s — as
he said, our thoughts and our hearts are with the Queen, her family, and
also the people of the United Kingdom.  
   
Q    They met three times, as you just indicated.  And I’m wondering if
you have any — anything to add about what the President has shared on
the Queen’s views of the U.S. and the world as it stands right now.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into private conversations that
they have had.  I can tell you, again, they’ve met at least three —
they’ve met three times in the past few decades.  And, again, I, you
know, don’t want to get ahead of anything here.  We think it’s
inappropriate to talk about any travel or any thoughts on that.  But
again, you know, we’ve made it very clear that they are in our hearts,
they are in our thoughts.  And that’s where we are today with this. 
We’ll have more.  
   
Q    And a quick clarification on the technology meeting that took place
today.  How did the White House select Mozilla and Sonos to represent
the views, more broadly, of the entire industry?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, you know, I think the way that we see what is —
the roundtable today — it is, again, the largest roundtable that we have
seen from this administration to deal with tech, and we think it’s an
important conversation to be had.  
   
Again, we are — we look forward to hear the feedback from tech companies
on what they think about what we’re working through and moving forward. 
But again, I’m not going to get ahead of that process.  But we think
it’s important.   
   
This is a — you know, this is — the actions that the President has taken
on tech and the conversations that we’ve had has been a priority for
this President.  And — and we’re just — I think what you should take out
from today, or take away from today, is that, you know, the President is
going to and has long called for fundamental legislative reforms to
address real issues.  And so we’re going to continue to do that.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Why do you guys keep saying the Inflation
Reduction Act is reducing prices?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Because in the Inflation Reduction Act, when you look
at Medicare, when you look at what it’s going to be able to provide —
allow Medicare to negotiate lowering costs for seniors — that is
reducing costs.  When you think about seniors who are paying — again, I
just stated this — $2,000, $3,000 a month, and it’s going to now cap
that at $2,000 a year — that is lowering costs.  
   
Q    But a majority of Americans now say that price increases are
causing them financial hardship that is more than at the start of the
year.  So where’s the inflation reduction for everything else?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So here’s the thing: The Inflation Reduction Act —  
   
Q    Karine —  
   
Q    Karine, the Queen has died.  
   
Q    The Queen died.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, all right.  Okay.  So that’s been confirmed?  
   
Q    The Royal Family has tweeted.  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as I said earlier, you know, our hearts and our
thoughts go to the family members of the Queen, goes to the people of
United Kingdom.  
   
I don’t want to get ahead of what the President is going to say.  I want
him to — from you all to hear from him first, and so I don’t want to get
ahead of that.  
   
But — and I said this earlier: Our relationship with the people of the
United Kingdom — and this is something that the President has said
himself — has grown stronger and stronger.  And it is one of our — the
United Kingdom is one of our closest allies.   
   
And, again, our hearts go to the people of the United Kingdom, to the
Queen, and to her family.   
   
I’m just not going to go get ahead of the President.  
   
And with that, I’ll see you guys on Monday.  Thank you.
