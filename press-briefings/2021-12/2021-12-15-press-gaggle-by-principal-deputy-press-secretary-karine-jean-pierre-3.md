Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Fort Campbell, Kentucky

10:35 A.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining
us for President Biden’s visit to Kentucky, where he will survey the
catastrophic storm damage firsthand and offer his support for the people
of Kentucky who were impacted by this devastating storm.  
   
The President is accompanied by his Homeland Security and Emergency
Response Team, including DHS Secretary Mayorkas, FEMA Administrator
Criswell, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and by
Congressman James Comer.  
   
He will meet with Governor Beshear and other elected officials to
receive a briefing of the devastation and walk through impacted
neighborhoods in Mayfield and Dawson Springs.  
   
The President’s message today is that he and the federal government
intend to do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, by providing
any support that is needed to aid recovery efforts and support the
people of Kentucky and of other impacted states as they rebuild.  
   
As you all know, the President quickly approved a major disaster
declaration for Kentucky and emergency disaster declarations for
Illinois and Tennessee.  
   
To support recovery efforts, FEMA has teams of Urban Search and Rescue
and emergency response personnel in Kentucky supporting search and
rescue efforts along with disaster — Disaster Survivor Assistance teams
to help survivors register for assistance, which they can do through
DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA.  
   
FEMA has sent 61 generators to help provide power where it is still out,
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel are providing debris
removal, infrastructure assessment, and power restoration support. FEMA
is providing critical supplies to the state, including 144,000 liters of
water, 74,000 meals, 18,500 blankets, 5,100 cots, and 1,500 tarps.  
   
A wireless emergency communications center has been activated at the
candle factory site for charging and Internet service. And the mobile —
Mobile Emergency Response Support personnel are on the ground in
Kentucky to provide emergency communications capabilities as needed.  
   
As Governor Beshear said this weekend, “The federal government has been
there every step of the way.” Leader McConnell also thanked the
President for his rapid approval of Kentucky’s major disaster
declaration. He appreciated the administration’s quick work to speed
resources to help deal with this crisis. That’s something the President
is committed to making sure continues.  
   
And with that, Zeke, you want to take this?  
   
Q  Yeah, thanks, Karine. Just, first on the trip today: Does the
President intend to meet with any of the family members of those who
lost their lives or any sort of real people?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: As you know, in the past — in the past trips that he’s
done, sadly, on this type of disaster — weather disaster — when he went
to Louisiana, when he went to the Northeast, he does end up meeting with
families and folks who have been affected by the storm damages in those
respective areas. So, I suspect that will happen here as well today.  
   
Q  It’s the 15th; it’s the last day authorized for child tax care
credits to American families. Can the President commit to those — to
Americans that, on January 15, that they will get a Child Tax Credit
payment?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I appreciate the question. Look, it is — you know,
the Child Tax Credit clearly was a historical middle- — is a historical
middle-class tax cut that is getting more money in people’s pockets. It
has — as we’ve heard, it’s cut poverty — childhood poverty by half.
That’s what the data has shown. He thinks it is, you know, reprehensible
that Republicans are standing against it. And not voting for Build Back
Better is essentially voting — or not supporting it is essentially not
supporting such a middle-class tax cut for families that has been
critical over these past several months.  
   
So the President is going to continue to fight for — he’s going to fight
for Build Back Better. We are optimistic that we will get this done
before Christmas, and that is our focus, that is our hope, and that’s
what we’re working towards.  
   
Q  Is it also reprehensible that Senator Joe Manchin doesn’t support
that right now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, Senator Joe Manchin is a friend of the President,
and we’ve had very good conversations. The President has had two great
conversations with him this week that have been productive, that have
been — they’ve talked — even Manchin had said this — they talked about
iterations of the bill.  
   
I’m not going to say more, because even Manchin said this
person-to-person conversation should be kept that way. So, I’m not going
to read out more on that.  
   
But we’re — the — we believe the senator wants what we want, which is to
deliver for the American people in a way that it has a real affect,
especially during this time of COVID and getting the economy back.  
   
Q  Does the White House have any reaction to Elon Musk’s comments? He’s
made some comments, criticisms of the Build Back Better bill,
particularly the union parts of the electric vehicle. And in the last 24
hours, there’s been a — kind of a spat between him and Senator Warren,
where he called Senator Warren “Senator Karen” for some criticism.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, as you know, Senator Warren is a friend and has
been a partner with us on many of the — you know, many of the
President’s agenda, and we appreciate her support. Clearly, I have not
heard Elon Musk’s direct comments, but she — we see her as a partner in
this and a friend.  
   
As far as the Build Back Better Agenda, look, this is — when you put —
we’re about to get knocked out here by this door.  
   
Are you okay, Jenny?  
   
Q  Yeah, I’m fine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. When we put the Build Back Better Agenda and the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, this — those two components will have a
historical investment on fighting climate change. This is something that
we — the data shows. This is something that we know. And the President
is very proud of his economic policy. It’s going to create jobs. It’s
going to, you know, make sure we, like I said, fight climate change.
It’s going to give the middle-class family, working families a break,
breathing room.  
   
And so, we’re just going to continue to implement the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Deal. Electric vehicles, clearly, is a big component of
that. And that’s going to be our focus.  
   
Q  Any concerns about the White — does the White House have any concerns
about the warning signals here and the tornadoes, how companies
responded? Is that going to be part of the questions the President will
ask today?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, I mean, I won’t get into specifics of — you know,
of what’s going to be asked. I’m sure the President will be happy to
share that at some point during the day.  
   
But I’ll say this: We are glad that OSHA, as well as state and local
regulators, are looking into this to help us all understand whether
there is anything that could have been done better to avoid these tragic
losses of life and terrible destruction.  
   
While it’s too early to know exactly what happened, we will work with
the federal government’s experts, as well as state, local, and private
sector partners to learn the right lessons and improve how we
collectively address such threats in the future.  
   
Q  Given all the details that are coming out from Mark Meadows’s texts
and other information, is there a role for the Biden administration to
investigate what happened at the planning level — not just the people
who entered the Capitol, but in the — the people who kind of made this
thing happen on January 6th — rather than just leave it to Congress?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, the President — and we’ve said this before
— you know, January 6th is one of the darkest moments in our country’s
history, and it’s vital that we have a full accounting of what happened
to ensure it never happens again.  
   
And so, you know, the way that we — the way the President sees it, he
has full confidence in the January 6th Select Committee’s ability to
carry out that work, so we’re going to let that work continue.  
   
Q  So, the Attorney General, then, is not doing an independent review of
the top-level stuff that was happening?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, I can’t speak for what the Attorney General is
doing. You would have to — I would send you to DOJ. I’m just telling
you, with the select committee, the President has full confidence in the
select committee members and the Speaker, and he’s going to let that
process run its course.  
   
Q  Karine, before the President left the White House, he was saying that
he made some progress on Build Back Better. Is there anything more you
can say on what that progress entails?  
   
And then, of course, is there another meeting or conversation with
Senator Manchin planned for this week that you could preview for us?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I don’t have a meeting to preview with Senator
Manchin in the next coming days. I can say that — and as we have been
saying — they’ve been productive. And the President appreciates the
conversation.  
   
You know, as this is all kind of going and the components are being
discussed, I don’t have anything further to share on the specifics on
where we are right now.  
   
Q  And then, given the Omicron variant and sort of the latest data on
that, does the President think that schools are going to shut down
again? And will the CDC revive its school guidance for Omicron?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we’ve been very clear: We have the resources
and we know what works to keep everything open, to not shut down
schools, to not shut down the government, to not shut down businesses.
And so, we’ve been doing this long enough.  
   
And the President made sure to that, which is why we passed the historic
American Rescue Plan which gives us the resources not just to make sure
that people are getting vaccinated and now getting the booster, but also
it has components in there to make sure that school stays open.  
   
And so, we’re very confident that that’s going to be the case. We’re not
going to shut down. We are comforted by the resources and what we have
learned and the tools that we have in our — in our toolbelts to do
that.  
   
Q  One more, Karine, if I may.  
   
Q  Karine, can you —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Whoever wants to go.  
   
Q  Can I just come back to Mark Meadows? I mean, he was chief of staff
at the time this all happened. Does that complicate things, in terms of
his claim of executive privilege, given that he’s not a — not in the
same position as Steve Bannon? And does that change the way Merrick
Garland’s calculus might work?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I cannot speak to what mayor — mayor — Attorney
General Garland is going to do. That is — they are an independent
agency, so I leave it to the Department of Justice, and I’ll send you
there. And so I don’t have any — much more to say about that. I refer
you to them.  
   
Q  Can you give us an update on the Secretary of State’s trip and why
they decided to cut it short, instead of just isolating the people who
had tested positive?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken spoke today with
the Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The Secretary
expressed his deep regret to the Foreign Minister that he would not be
able to visit Bangkok this week. He explained that in order to mitigate
the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and to prioritize the health and
safety of the U.S. traveling party, those that — and those they would
otherwise come into contact with, the Secretary would be returning to
Washington, D.C., out of abundance of caution.  
   
The Secretary extended an invitation for the Foreign Minister to visit
Washington, D.C., at the earliest opportunity and noted that he looked
forward to traveling to Thailand as soon as possible. They affirm that
they would use the upcoming engagements to further deepen the U.S.-Thai
alliance.  
   
Q  There have been so many multi-fatality weather events this year. The
President hasn’t even been able to go to half of them. Is the message
about climate change getting into people that have been resistant to
receiving it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, you know, every — he has gone — he has been able
to go to Northeast when those affected — those folks who were affected,
the states that were affected. He went to Louisiana and had that
conversation as well with those in — and was there in person, clearly,
to provide — you know, to provide comfort and also make sure the federal
government did everything that they could in that regard.  
   
Look, the President talks about the severity — right? — how extreme
weather, where we are today, and there’s been connection to climate
change.  
   
I would say for today — our focus today is to make sure that the people
of Kentucky are receiving all of — all of the resources that they need
to move forward. It is going to be a very long — long road ahead. And so
that’s the President’s focus right now is to talk specifically, to hear
from the elected officials on the ground.  
   
Clearly, I mentioned he’s going to be with Governor Beshear and others,
and the Congressman is on the plane. And he’s going to hear directly
from the American — well, the Kentucky people — the public, and hear
what their needs are and what is it that they’re experiencing and what
they’ve been through.  
   
So, that’s the focus for today.

Q  The UK is lifting its extra travel restrictions on African nations
because of Omicron today. Is the U.S. going to follow suit anytime soon?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have anything new to share about the travel —
the travel — our travel restrictions. But I’ll say this: The
country-based restrictions were intended to be temporary, to buy time,
not a longer-term strategy.  
   
As discussed, they’re learning more every day. And throughout each day,
we are watching three areas closely: One is vaccine effectiveness; two,
transmissibility; three, severity. And the data so far shows vaccines
continue to help prevent the worst outcomes and that a booster shot can
significantly increase your protection against Omicron.

We also know this is a more transmissible variant, meaning more people
get it more quickly. But what’s encouraging is early data suggests fewer
people who get it are getting severe — are getting severe diseases.
We’re seeing lower numbers of hospitalization and deaths as a proportion
of those who have been infected so far.

We’ll continue to adapt our approach to travel restrictions as more data
comes in. And like I said, I have no specific updates on timing.

All right.

Q  One last one on ambassadors. The President is going to end the year
with a historic low in the number of confirmed ambassadors. Is that
damaging U.S. national security? And is there sort of a concrete example
you can point to where —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.

Q  — something the President has tried to do with a foreign partner
hasn’t been able to get done because there isn’t an ambassador in place?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I appreciate the question, Zeke, because it’s
really important.

So, President Biden is quickly working to restore America’s position on
the world stage. And he has moved swiftly to nominate well-qualified
ambassadors who have earned Republican and Democrat — Democratic
support.  
   
But instead of putting politics aside, Senate Republicans have led an
unprecedented effort of obstruction by blocking dozens of President
Biden’s nominees and preventing them from advancing America’s national
security interests.

It’s long past time for GOP senators to get out of the way and let the
Senate quickly confirm these national security nominees so they can
advocate for the interests of the American people around the world.

Q  Thanks, Karine.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Thanks, everybody.
