James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:12 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  
   
Q    Hi.  Good afternoon.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Good afternoon.  Okay, today we have joining us our NEC
Director, Brian Deese, who is going to give some brief opening remarks. 
He’ll take some questions, and then we’ll do a briefing from there.  
   
Take it away.  
   
MR. DEESE:  All right.  Hello, everybody.  It’s good to be here today. 
All right.   
   
Q    Hello!  
   
MR. DEESE:  Enthusiasm.  I like that.  (Laughter.)  
   
So I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes on providing some context
on where we are in the economic recovery and also use some charts, which
should be really fun.   
   
The President — the President released a statement earlier today, saying
that our economy — our economic recovery has two components: getting
Americans back to work and getting prices and supply chains back to
normal.  And so, I want to provide a little bit of context on our
perspective on that issue.   
   
So first, today, we learned that the number of Americans filing for
unemployment insurance fell to its lowest level since 1969.  And I will,
as I think I have done every time I’ve come to this podium, reinforce
that every time we look at data like this, one week — even one month —
can be volatile, so we look at the averages and trends.  
   
But if you look at the first slide here, you’ll see that the trend
underscores that the four-week moving average for initial UI claims is
now down by about 75 percent since the beginning of the year.  And
another way to think about that is that at the beginning of this year,
there were 18 million Americans who are collecting unemployment
benefits.  And today, we learned that now that number has fallen to
fewer than 2 million.   
   
So, in addition to that consistent trend, we’re also seeing a reduction
in 16 million Americans who were previously relying on government
benefits that have now transitioned off of it.   
   
We also learned last week that the unemployment rate fell to 4.2
percent, which is, again, the fastest year-to-date decline in the
unemployment rate on record.   
   
And in this second chart, you see — there we are.  This — the second
chart, you see that that is not only the fastest decline, but it’s also
very significantly accelerated from what was projected at the beginning
of this year.   
   
So, the — I guess mauve.  What color is that?  That light brown line.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. DEESE:  Mauve — is that right?   
   
Q    Light brown.  
   
Q    It’s not mauve.  
   
MR. DEESE:  No?  No.  (Laughter.)  Okay.  I’m getting clear feedback
from the front row that it is not mauve.  (Laughter.)  
   
The brown line — the light brown line shows the projections from the
beginning of this year, prior to the passage of the American Rescue
Plan, which showed that it would — it projected to take our economy
until the end of 2024 to get to an unemployment rate of about 4.2
percent.   
   
And now we have reached that in the fourth quarter of 2021, which
underscores both the significance of the American Rescue Plan in helping
drive a strong labor market recovery but also just the benefit for the
American people of reaching that point.   
   
I would just note as well, in terms of labor market strength, that we
have also seen encouraging signs in labor force participation, because
when the unemployment comes — rate comes down, it can be because people
are joining the labor force or coming out.  And we saw that the prime
age employment population ratio, which is the metric of — that
economists generally look at, increased by five tenths of a percent last
month, and we’ve now recovered nearly 85 percent of our pandemic drop in
that metric.   
   
So, we’ve seen very strong labor market developments, and that — those
labor market developments are coupled by strong developments in overall
economic growth and in household income and demand.  And so, that puts
us in a position where, today, real household income is higher than
before the pandemic.  So, real household income for the typical American
family is $350 a month higher now than before the pandemic, in real
terms, accounting for price increases, accounting for inflation.   
   
And so that strength — that strength of the labor market, that strength
of household balance sheets, that strength of economic growth —
positions us uniquely well to deal with the challenges that we face of
prices and supply chain issues.  In fact, uniquely among industrialized
countries, we are the only country that has seen GDP now recover from
its pre-pandemic levels, has seen household income recover from its
pre-pandemic levels.  So that positions us uniquely well.  
   
And so, on that note, we are, as you all know, very focused on
addressing the issue of prices and supply chain bottlenecks head on,
from that position of strength.   
   
Tomorrow, we will get data on consumer prices for November.  And I’m not
going to attempt to predict what those data are.  Outside forecasters
expect those data to continue to show price increases at — to remain at
elevated levels.  But I want to provide a little bit of context on that
front as well.   
   
The first is that that data is, by definition, backward-looking, and so
it won’t capture some recent price movements, particularly in the area
of energy.   
   
And so, for example, prices of gas at the gas pump are now down
nationally.  They’re down about nine cents.  But to put some context on
that, this next chart over here, this shows the inflation-adjusted real
price of gas at the pump over the last 10 years.  And what it shows is
that, on average, over the last 10 years — and, in fact, this is true
over the last 20 years — the average price at the pump for a gallon of
gas has been about $3.13 in real terms, inflation adjusted.   
   
And so, today, 20 states now have pump prices that are below that
20-year average.  And as the — as prices come down nationally over the
next couple of weeks, as we expect and hope that they will, we hope to
see more states falling into that category.  Those price reductions will
not be reflected in the data for November.   
   
In addition, this week we’ve seen natural gas prices fall.  They’re now
down 25 percent from their average in November.  And that is — that is
good news, particularly looking into the winter home heating season.  I
know several of you reported on and were focused on natural gas price
increases earlier this fall portending potentially big increases in
heating costs over the winter.  The very dramatic decline in natural gas
prices over the course of the last couple of weeks have changed that
outlook quite meaningfully.   
   
So these declines are delivering, most importantly, some benefit to
consumers and some benefits to consumers on a go- forward basis that
won’t be reflected in that data.   
   
Secondly, we’ve seen some near movements on other commodity prices over
the course of the last couple of weeks.  We’ve seen shipping costs to
move a container from Asia to the United States come down by about 25
percent.   
   
Over the course of the last couple of weeks, the price of wheat, the
price of pork has come down and, importantly, used cars as well.   
   
I know many of you have seen and tracked, in some of the recent price
data, that used cars have played an outsized influence.  There’s been
challenges in the used car market, including relating to — reflecting
the fact that rental car companies sold off their fleets and were buying
back.  We anticipate that some of the recent decline in used car prices
at the wholesale level indicates that we may see prices decline there as
well.  Again, that won’t be reflected in backward-looking data from
tomorrow.   
   
And lastly, the consensus estimates of outside experts continue to
forecast and project that price increases will moderate going into
2022.  The Blue-Chip consensus for core PCE inflation, for example, in —
by the fourth quarter of next year is down to 2.2 percent, for
example.  
   
So, that’s, I think, important context for all of you in thinking about
the data releases.  But most importantly from our perspective, it is a
reason to redouble our efforts to focus on both the immediate-term and
the medium-term steps that we can take to try to address prices and
bring down costs for families.   
   
That’s what we’re focused on with respect to our supply chain work, our
energy price work, and, of course, in moving the Build Back Better Act,
which will do more than any piece of legislation in modern American
history to reduce costs for families.   
   
So, with that, I will open the floor.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Kristen, kick us off.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  And, Brian, thank you for being here.   
   
Jumping off right there, on Build Back Better: As you anticipate and
wait for this new data tomorrow — and I think there’s also going to be a
new cost estimate of Build Back Better requested by Republicans — how
concerned is the White House that it will complicate your efforts to win
over those moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin?  
   
MS. DEESE:  Well, we are quite confident that if the question is, “What
can we do to address the costs that are most pressing to American
families?” — that that — if that is the debate and that is the
discussion, then the case for the Build Back Better Act is — only gets
stronger and that we are building momentum around that set of
arguments.   
   
If you step back and you think about a typical family’s budget and what
they have to spend on expenses in a typical month, about 60 percent of
those costs fall into housing, healthcare, prescription drugs,
childcare, and transportation.  That’s what, you know, the bulk of a
family’s budget is made up of.  
   
And on each of those areas, the legislation that the President has
prioritized and is moving through Congress would address and reduce
those costs.  And so, I think that if that’s the debate and that’s the
question — how can we address those costs that families are facing —
again, the Build Back Better Act will do more to lower costs than any
piece of legislation in modern American history.  And so we feel quite
enthusiastic about being able to make that case.  
   
Q    One quick follow-up on inflation: Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that
“transitory” is no longer the right way to describe inflation.  He said,
“It now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well
into next year.”  Given that, do you believe that this inflation is now
more entrenched and not transitory?   
   
MR. DEESE:  What we — what we believe is that price increases elevated
to the level that we’re seeing hit American families and their
pocketbooks, and we need to do everything that we can to address those
directly.   
   
We also believe that the strength of our economic recovery and the
strength of our labor market and the strength of wage increases and the
steps that we’ve taken to try to provide some relief to American
families position our economy and American households uniquely well to
address what is a global issue around price increases, in the context of
supply chains and otherwise.  
   
Q   But is Powell right?  Will these increased prices last through next
year?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I — I am not going to get into the prediction
business, other than to say — and I’ll echo what I noted at the
beginning — is that most outside, independent forecasters continue to
see price increases moderating, and moderating meaningfully, over the
course of next year.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mary.  
   
Q    Along the same line, the President did try to set expectations in
his statement today, saying, you know, you expect inflation numbers to
stay high, but that doesn’t reflect the reality.  So, when do you expect
the reports will actually reflect this?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I would just point to some of the real-world — you
know, real-world data that we’re seeing, which is that we’ve seen gas
prices come down.  We’ve seen natural gas prices come down.  We’ve seen
real progress in unsticking some of the supply chain bottlenecks that
have been — that have persisted in our economy.  
   
I was noting on supply chains that there’s actually now some reporting
that the principal concern is on the back end of the holiday season —
too much excess inventory, and people have over-ordered.   
   
And so — so, certainly these are not, you know — these are things that
don’t work themselves out overnight.  And we — I will go back to what I
said at the beginning of this: We never over-index on any one piece of
data or any one data release.  But we — you know, we’re going to stay
focused on what we can do to try to address these prices in the
immediate term.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Nandita.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Just talking about sort of gas prices coming down,
Brian, a group of bipartisan lawmakers, six of them from Texas, as
you’re probably aware, sent a letter to President Biden about not
reinstituting a ban on U.S. oil exports.  What is the position of the
White House on that, considering the letter was sent, explicitly saying
that the White House is considering a move to that effect?  
   
MR. DEESE:  It’s not an issue that we’re currently focused on.  The
President, in our focus on energy markets, has made clear to the team
that all options should be on the table to try to address challenges in
the market and bring relief to American consumers.  That’s certainly the
approach that we have taken to date in our international engagements,
our diplomatic engagements, and actions we’ve taken, including the
exchange and sale from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that the
President announced about 10 days ago.  
   
So, we’ll continue to work on those issues.  We’ll continue to work with
states and localities to make sure that they have the support that they
need, but that specific issue is not one that we’re currently focused
on.  
   
Q    Sorry, and just a quick — a quick follow-up.  In terms of sort of
your overall, you know, economic growth sort of forecasts from the White
House — you know, given the fact that the Omicron variant is spreading
rapidly, some economists have started factoring in sort of a slowdown in
demand and — you know, for services and hiring in general.  What are
sort of your expectations just over the next few quarters, in terms of
sort of overall economic growth in the U.S.?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, we, like others, are obviously tracking very closely
the questions raised by the Omicron variant and are waiting and watching
the information as we receive it, with the understanding that we need to
know more.  But we are learning some.  We’ve seen some encouraging data
coming out recently.  But it’s something that we will continue to
monitor closely and study closely.  
   
In terms of, you know, the current — growth currently: All indications
are that the economy in the fourth quarter continues to grow robustly,
and we certainly expect that to continue.  And our focus is on how we
can maintain the strength of the overall economic recovery, the strength
of the labor market recovery, while also addressing head on these price
challenges and these supply chain bottlenecks, and to be very clear that
the risk exists that price increases become entrenched in the long term;
that’s something that would be a real problem for the economy.   
   
We are working in looking forward and don’t see that in the current
environment, but are focused on the steps that we can take to drive that
kind of robust recovery going forward.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Weijia.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  And thank you, Brian.  Just a quick follow-up on
Build Back Better, and then one on unemployment.   
   
Given how involved you are with negotiations, what is the most viable
timeline right now for passing it, and is before Christmas still
realistic?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, we want to move as quickly as possible.  And we are
working very closely with Senator Schumer and the entire caucus on
facilitating that outcome.  And Senator Schumer has indicated his
intention, his timeline, and we’re both supportive of that and believe
that that’s — that’s right and viable.  
   
We want to move as quickly as possible here.  We think that the
outstanding issues are getting worked through in the process.  We’re
making a lot of progress.  So, we’re — we want to move as quick as
possible, and we believe there is every reason why we can.  
   
Q    Okay.  And in terms of unemployment, the system now — and I think
you referenced this earlier — doesn’t account for gig workers and
self-employed who were on uninsur- — unemployment insurance, but then
they ran out, if they were pandemic related.  So, is there any way
you’re tracking the number of those people who might not be included in
the numbers but might still be struggling?  And is there anything that
you can do to help them?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, the — there’s sort of two — two elements of that
question.   
   
The first is that there were — people who were previously receiving
unemployment insurance and are no longer receiving unemployment
insurance are obviously not reflected in the UI claims.  And these
reflect the people who are receiving government assistance.  And that
has come down dramatically, as I said, from 18 million to less than 2
million.  
   
Within that category, people who were on unemployment insurance and then
come off of unemployment insurance, the way to track that data is really
to look at the labor force data, because those people could either be in
the labor force actively looking for a job, or they could be employed,
or they could end up out of the labor force.   
   
And so one of the things from an economic point of view — one of the
concerns that you have is to track the labor force participation,
because if people come off of unemployment but they leave the labor
force entirely, then that’s a — that’s an outcome that you want — you
hope to avoid.  
   
So that one of the positive indications in our current labor market is
that what we’re seeing is: Even as the number of people receiving
unemployment insurance has come down dramatically, labor force
participation has stayed steady and started to tick up, which suggests
that people are coming back into the labor market, finding jobs, in many
cases, or are actively looking for jobs.  But that’s the sort of best
proxy to get at what I think you’re trying to refer to.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Brian, some of the critics — administration’s critics
have said over the last few months, as these reports come out and show
inflation is rising, that the administration highlighting the bright
spots like unemployment is glossing over the reality that people are
paying more for food and things — basic necessities.  And a lot of the
people who are impacted the most are the poorest or they’re on fixed
incomes.  They might not be moved by an unemployment statistic.  So,
what’s your message to those people, especially getting closer to
midterms?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, absolutely.  And just to be very clear that the — the
issue of, you know, increased prices hits people in very practical ways
in their lives, and no one likes to pay more at the gas pump.  Nobody
likes to pay more at the grocery store.  And for people who are, you
know, a lower income, it can be — it can be tough.  
   
I think the message is that employment and our labor market are really
important ways in which people can seek and find economic opportunity
and prosperity.  And the fact that wages are increasing the most for
people in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution is something
that hasn’t happened in our economy in some time and is really positive,
because what it means is that there are more job opportunities and job
opportunities at higher wages for people to move into.  That’s point
one.  
   
Point two is that, in terms of household income and their balance
sheets, if you look at the bottom 25 percent or the bottom 40 percent of
households and you look at both the increase in wages that people have
received and the benefits that people have received — because, in the
American Rescue Plan, for example, we passed a Child Tax Credit that is
now going to families on a monthly basis.  We provided checks to people
in there.  
   
And you look in the aggregate: Household income for those people in the
lower ends of the income spectrum is actually higher today, on a monthly
basis, even when you take into account increased inflation.   
   
So that’s not true for every person, and every individual has
challenges, and we want to speak to all of those.  But in terms of
overall, economically speaking, because of the strength of the economic
recovery, the strength of the labor market, and the support that we’ve
provided over the course of the year, people are better positioned today
to deal with these challenges, which are real and which are tough and
which is why we’re focused every day on what we can do to try to
alleviate them.  
   
Q    Does the administration see inflation as a driving need to extend
the Child Tax Credit?  
   
MR. DEESE:  The — our view is that the Child Tax Credit is a — you know,
a really important, basic support for families and that we should extend
it.  And we should extend it because it’s doing what we hoped it would
do, which is dramatically reduce child poverty in America, dramatically
reduce poverty in America, and give families some breathing room in a
very strong but uncertain recovery.   
   
So, certainly, it’s the President’s position that we should do that —
and we can do that, I would just underscore.  We can do that as part of
Build Back Better in a way that is fiscally responsible, fully paid for,
won’t add to any inflationary pressures in the economy.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Heather.  
   
Q    Yes, thanks.  Brian, can you give us any timing on when the
President may name additional Fed nominees?  Is that process drawing to
a close?  Could we see something next week?  
   
MR. DEESE:  I cannot.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Josh.  
   
Q    You alluded to the forecast for tomorrow’s number.  You know, I
know you didn’t want to name any, so allow me.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Great.  
   
Q    6.8 percent is our median estimate year over year; that’s higher
than last month, with 6.2.  The month-over- month figure is 0.7, or
0.9.  So, in other words, they’re sort of showing different things. 
(Inaudible) is getting worse, month over month getting better.   
   
My question for you is: Where are we, do you think, in the arc of
inflation right now?  You referenced the forecast bringing it down by
Q4.  Do you think the wave is cresting?  When you talk of
backward-looking data, do you think that inflation is leveling off; the
data aren’t just capturing it?  Or do you think it’s going to get worse
before it gets better?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, a couple of points.  First, I’m not going to try to
predict or project.  Your projection is an aggregated estimate of a lot
of people who have thought about this, and I’m not going to get into the
projection game.  We obviously do our own estimates.   
   
The second is, you raise an important point, and I think this is good
context for — in the — you know, in anticipation of it, which is:
Because of what we have seen over the course of the last 12 months or 11
months, the year-over-year headline number will be elevated compared to,
you know, historic levels under any circumstances.  That’s baked in, and
that’s largely a function — well, that is 100 percent a function of
everything that happened starting before November of this year.   
   
So, in a sense, the year-over-year is — should be taken with that
context.   
   
In terms of your question about, you know, the timing, I think that we
are in a place where we are seeing some of the — when you look at what
are the underlying issues that are driving this price pressures, we are
seeing some movement that is notable — you know, as I’ve spoken about,
on energy, with respect to the supply chains.  And our focus is on look-
— tracking that across time because we think that that will be what will
end up flowing through to affect those numbers across time.   
   
This is not — you know, I would not try to project on a, you know, week
or month-by-month basis because these numbers move around.  You know, I
mentioned used car prices, and a lot of people focus on what’s happening
at the wholesale markets when dealers are buying used cars because that
is really an indication of where the prices are going.  But that could
take, you know, a month or two to filter through into data.   
   
So, in each of these cases, there are specific elements, and we’ll
continue to look closely at them.  But I think you have seen — you are
seeing, in some important areas, some movement that is notable.  
   
Q    So do you think the wave is cresting, or is it too soon to say?  
   
MR. DEESE:  You know, we will — we’ll just — we’re going to continue to
focus on what we can do to advance this recovery and advance this
recovery in a way where, you know, typical households continue to have
some of that breathing room and more Americans are able to take
advantage of a job market where there are, you know, historic
opportunities out there.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Phil.  
   
Q    Thanks, Brian.  Just two quick ones, if you don’t mind.  One of the
concerns last month on the topline numbers was that perhaps it was
broadening out a little bit.  I’m thinking particularly not just
pandemic-driven price increases, but maybe rent being one specifically. 
Have you guys seen anything in that side of things, not driven by the
pandemic, that has raised concerns as you look at the data?  
   
Well, I’m glad you raised this issue around housing and shelter prices —
“shelter” being, you know, either rent or homes — because I think it
connects to a point that, Kristen, you raised, which is: We have, for
years, in this country had a problem of inadequate housing supply, of
single-family homes to buy and of houses to rent.  It is decades in the
making of underinvestment in affordable supply, particularly in areas of
the country where there is the most economic opportunity.   
   
And so it’s a persistent challenge of people wanting to move to, you
know, a different part of the country where they might have a job
opportunity and are costed out of that because of housing.   
   
The answer to that problem is to make a historic investment in
increasing the supply of affordable housing in America.  That is the
real answer to that question.  And the sooner that we do that, the
sooner that we initiate that process, the sooner that we are going to
actually address that underlying challenge.   
   
And so, some of the price increases that are already baked in and will
flow through to this — to these numbers, we know that everyone should
anticipate that, but the real policy question it goes to why Build Back
Better is so important is: Are we going to actually take some steps to
finally address that issue so that we can say to the American people
that, looking forward, they can actually expect some real relief?   
   
The housing investments in the Build Back Better plan are directed
exactly to that issue: How do we build the kind of housing supply that
typical people need across the country in urban, suburban, and in rural
areas?  
   
And so that is — that is a real present issue, one that will continue to
be with us.  But hopefully, if we can get this bill done, we’ll actually
have the tools in place to start to show people some real progress.  
   
Q    And then, just from a broader perspective, do you guys view it
inside your team as an acceptable trade-off if prices are high for a
shorter duration, a shorter period of time, perhaps because of some of
the demand-driven elements of ARP so long as you’ve been able to achieve
some of the data — positive data you’ve been laying out over the course
of this day and I think the White House has been talking about for the
last several months?  Like, this is a trade-off that’s acceptable so
long as those price increases don’t last or become entrenched?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I would start — we’re humble enough to not suggest
that we control all the levers of the macroeconomy and we’re in a
complicated, uncertain global environment, and — number one.  
   
Number two, I think that our view, and I think borne out by what you’re
seeing internationally, is that the challenges of supply chains, of
price increases, of the issues of labor supply are persistent across
industrialized countries.  But what’s unique about the United States
right now is the strength of our economic growth, the strength of our
labor market, and that is in no small part due to the American Rescue
Plan.   
   
So we’re absolutely, you know, not satisfied or want to accept a
situation where Americans are paying high prices when they can’t afford
it.  I think where we are in this economy is one where we have real
strength and that positions us to address real challenges that we need
to.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We can do a few more.  April.  
   
Q    I want to go back to the Child Tax Credit.  December 15th could be
that last check if BBB is not passed for the Child Tax Credit.  If it’s
not passed, what does that do to this child poverty rate that you have
been touting so much — how you slashed it?  Does it stay the same, or do
you anticipate a rise for that?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, we are confident that we’re going to get Build Back
Better passed.  Extending the Child Tax Credit is one of many reasons
why we need to do that and we need to do that as soon as possible.   
   
And so, that’s why you see this administration as focused as we are on
working with our congressional counterparts to move — to move that
agenda.   
   
There are multiple elements of this bill where if you look at costs and
you look at, you know, typical household situations, the urgency is very
clear.  This is one.  The lack of affordable housing is another.  The
lack of affordable childcare is another that is not a “tomorrow” issue
for so many families that are trying to figure out how to get somebody
back into the labor market.   
   
And so, we’re — you know, that’s the case we’re making, and that’s — and
we’re confident we’re going to get this done.  
   
Q    And then, on housing, can you talk about the price of new housing,
as well as existing housing?  Part of the problem, they’re saying, with
housing prices — new housing prices — it deals with inflation and
lumber.  The cost of lumber has pushed up the price of housing and the
supply chain issue.   
   
How, in the short-term, do you plan to combat as you — combat that as
you’re dealing with the housing issue?  And talking about affordable
housing, houses to buy right now are up because of inflation, supply
chain issues.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah.  So, it’s connected to Phil’s question. You know, the
prices in the residential market are elevated, but a lot of that is a
supply issue.  The supply issue is in part connected to near-term supply
chain issues, but it is much deeper and longer-term — about years and
years in which we’ve underinvested in supply, compared to the demand
that — in the economy for housing, particularly in certain regions and
geographies.  
   
The supply chain challenges that are affecting the inputs that go into
homebuilding are similar to the supply chain issues we’re facing
overall, but we’ve tried to take a dedicated focus in a number of
areas.  So, for example, we have an hours-of-service waiver for trucks
that move across the country to be able to operate additional hours.  We
extended that to cover building materials as well.   
   
The issue of helping to move a product through our ports is very
important, particularly for building materials that are being
imported.   
   
So, you know, we were — we’re focused on the supply chain issues in
general, but, as they relate to building materials wherever they can,
we’re trying to highlight them.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Let’s do Kaitlan and Courtney, and then we’re
going to wrap it up.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Thank you, Jen.  Thank you, Brian.  My first question
is on Russia.  The U.S. and European allies have pledged “severe” harm
on Russia if it escalates the situation in Ukraine.   
   
As you and the White House know, the economy is global, it is
intertwined, especially the energy market.  And European consumers are
already paying record costs to heat their homes this winter.   
   
So I’m wondering how the administration is thinking about mitigating the
impact on the U.S. economy with whatever decisions you decide to take
with regard to sanctions.  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, I will leave the question of sanctions and the impact on
our European counterparts to Jake and to Jen.  I think they’ve spoken to
them and the, sort of, dynamic involved there, including as it relates
to Nord Stream.  
   
With respect to U.S. consumers, the — natural gas, in particular, is an
issue that — is a commodity that doesn’t trade globally.  And so, the
decline that I referenced earlier — 25 percent decline in natural gas
prices since November — that’s the price of U.S. natural gas, which is
about — I haven’t looked in the last day — but, you know, four to five
times lower than in Europe.  And that’s for a set of reasons — the
export constraint — export constraints.  
   
But in terms of the American consumer, looking forward to this winter,
there’s some positive news in terms of domestic natural gas and not a
lot of flow-through to the issues you’re raising.  
   
Q    And on wages, just to follow up domestically: I think the average
American would find inflation more manageable if wages were also going
up.  And in the last year, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings are down
1.3 percent.  So when can Americans expect to earn more money for the
work that they’re already doing?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, it’s a good question and good context to — connects to
the earlier question as well.  
   
So, if you look at wage growth, it’s important to look at it through a
couple of lenses.  The first is: Where is that wage growth happening in
the income spectrum?  And what you’re seeing is wage growth today that
is fastest and strongest in the bottom half of the income distribution. 
So, for working families that are making less, they’re seeing their
wages increase more and, in many cases, significantly faster than price
increases.  So that’s point one, distributionally.   
   
The second is in terms of overall household balance sheets — the income
that families have.  And when you think about a family and they’re —
them trying to balance their checkbook or the — this year, the question
is, “What was my wage increase, and what was the support that I received
through checks from the government, through the Child Tax Credit?  
   
And when you take those into account and look at household income,
consistent with the data that you just said, the typical family — the
family, you know, at the 50th percentile — has actually seen their
household income increase, even accounting for price increases.  
   
Obviously, as we move forward in this recovery, what we want to see is —
we want to see a strong labor market recovery; want to see wage
increases, particularly for those at the bottom; and we want to see, you
know, a balancing out here of prices.  
   
That’s the scenario that we’re all trying to work toward.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Courtney, last one.  
   
Q    Can you give an update on the Competition Council that you’re
chairing?  It’s something I didn’t hear you mention in the context of
all this and  —  
   
   
MR. DEESE:  You said it’s something that’s what?   
   
Q    The Competition Council.  You never mentioned it in all of this. 
Can you talk about some of the accomplishments of that council and what
you all are working on right now?   
   
MR. DEESE:  Sure.  Sure.  I’m excited for the interest.  And we will
have — (laughter) — and I mean that.  I mean that sincerely.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Settle in, everyone.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. DEESE:   No, I mean that sincerely.  So — and we will be — we’ll be
convening the full council around the end of the year.  And so, look out
for that.  
   
It’s — I can talk about some of the specifics, but I will say that,
actually, you know, it’s consistent with the general philosophy that
does interact with a lot of the things that we’re discussing here, which
is that the President’s — the core directive in the — in the executive
order was to pursue pro-competition policies across the federal
government, across agencies and use antitrust statutes — enforce them
robustly — across agencies as well.  
   
And so, this intersects with a number of the issues that we’ve
discussed.  I would note positively that the House this week passed a
bill on increasing competition in ocean shipping, which is something
that we encouraged as part of that executive order.   
   
But more — you know, more directly, you take an issue like the railroads
and the, you know, lack of competition in that sector.  Well, that
affects this question of: How do we unstick bottlenecks if there’s not
sufficient competition among rail lines?   
   
We talk about food prices.  And I think the last time I was here, I was
with Secretary Vilsack.  When you look at most of the increase in food
costs, you can isolate a significant portion of that to meat, beef,
pork, and chicken in particular.  Those are very concentrated industries
where a small number of meat processors control the industry.  
   
And so, what you’ve seen is prices for the farmers go up, prices for
consumers go up, and profits for the meat-processing companies in the
middle go up.  And that’s an issue of concern and one that we have
focused on both from an antitrust perspective, but also investing in
helping competitors get into that market.   
   
In fact, today we’re making $500 million available to small meat
processors to try to increase competition in that space.   
   
So, we’ll be happy to follow up and give you a full slate of where we
are on the — there were — for those of you who were paying attention,
there were 72 specific actions in that executive order.  We’re tracking
against all of them.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go through them all.  
   
MR. DEESE:  But I will spare the rest of you that, and we’re happy to
follow up.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Thank you, everyone, so much.  Thank you,
Brian.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I definitely kept him much longer than I promised, so we
want him to come back.  
   
All right, so I only have one item for all of you at the top.  As I
think all of you saw this morning — or many of you saw — this morning,
the President opened the Summit for Democracy and announced the
Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal — a landmark set of
policy and foreign assistance initiatives to defend and bolster
democracy, human rights, and the fight against corruption.   
   
The initiative represents a significant targeted expansion of U.S.
government efforts to defend, sustain, and grow democratic resilience
with likeminded governmental and non-governmental partners.   
   
In the coming year, the United States is planning to provide up to
$424.4 million toward the initiative.  And these efforts will center on
five areas of work crucial to the functioning of transparent,
accountable governance, including supporting free and independent media,
fighting corruption, bolstering democratic reformers, advancing
technology for democracy, defending free and fair elections and
political processes.  
   
I know we’ll also have a call this afternoon — I’m not sure exactly the
timing — to give you more information on the deliverables from this as
well.  
   
Colleen, why don’t you kick us off, or continue our journey here
together?  
   
Q    Thank you.  Do you have an update for us on the President’s call
with Zelenskyy?  And another one, just sort of related — sort of: There
were a couple of reports last night about a potential financial threat
or a potential military action to Iran in regards to the faltering
nuclear talks.  I wondered if you had a comment or update on that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me start with the first.  When I came out here,
the President was still on the call.  So, our plan was to provide a
written readout to all of you, which you should be getting as soon as
it’s complete or following the briefing — whenever it’s ready.   
   
But I will highlight for you that the President’s intention going into
this call was to provide an update for President Zelenskyy on his call
with President Putin and underscore our support for Ukraine’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity, as Secretary Blinken did when he
spoke with President Zelenskyy earlier this week.  So this is a
follow-on to that call.  
   
President Biden is also intending to — was intending to discuss his deep
concerns with Russia’s buildup on Ukraine’s borders and his commitment
to respond to strong measures in the event of a Russian military
escalation.   
   
We’ve engaged closely with the Ukrainians throughout this process at a
range of levels and have been in daily contact with senior officials in
the Ukrainian government.  So, clearly, that is a component of it.  
   
I’d also note — I think as many of you saw — that the President also
provided an update to the B9 eastern flank countries, with a personal
readout of his call with President Putin, to hear their perspective on
the current security situation and underscore our commitment to
transatlantic security and to our NATO Allies that are — with our NATO
Allies — that’s sacred, and also to continue to stay in close
coordination.  
   
On the — but we will get you a readout as soon as that is complete.  
   
On the Iran question that you also posed second, I do have an update for
you.  As we’ve said many times from this podium and elsewhere in the
government, President Biden is committed to ensuring Iran never acquires
a nuclear weapon and believes diplomacy, in coordination with allies and
regional partners, is the best path to achieve that goal.   
   
We believe a diplomatic resolution offers the best path to avoiding a
nuclear crisis.  However, given the ongoing advances in Iran’s nuclear
program, the President has asked his team to be prepared in the event
that diplomacy fails and we must turn to other options, and that
requires preparations.   
   
We have made clear to Iran that the only path out of sanctions is
through nuclear compliance.  We have kept all the sanctions that we
inherited in place, and we’ve consistently enforced sanctions, all while
also presenting the clear path of their removal.   
   
If diplomacy cannot get on track soon, and if Iran’s nuclear program
continues to accelerate, then we will have no choice but to take
additional measures to further restrict Iran’s revenue-producing
sectors.   
   
While I’m not going to get into additional specifics on that front, I
can provide you a little update on some of the coordination that we’re
doing on the international — on the international front.   
   
A senior Treasury official will lead a Treasury-State delegation to the
UAE next week to talk about sanctions compliance.  The delegation, which
will be led by OFAC Director Andrea Gacki, will focus on engagements
with the private sector and key UAE government officials to discuss our
understanding of the companies and financial institutions that
facilitate non-compliant Iranian commerce that runs through its — or
touches the UAE.   
   
This trip follows a range of conversations that our National Security
Advisor, Jake Sullivan, and Brett McGurk had in October; that,
obviously, Rob Malley and Brett McGurk had in November; and Deputy
Treasury Secretary Adeyemo also had in November.   
   
And this is part of our extended outreach to our partners around the
world to ensure that we were preparing for a range of contingencies.  
   
Q    Jen, the timeline — you know, how long diplo- — the diplomacy is
going to continue before (inaudible) to other actions?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to present a deadline today.  But what I can
tell you is that we have presented a diplomatic path forward; that path
is still open.  But based on the outcome of the last round of talks and
the ongoing advancements in Iran’s nuclear facilities, we are laying the
path for — the groundwork for another path entirely.  So, it’s just
meant to be preparations.  
   
Q    Jen, the President said he hoped to announce by tomorrow meetings
between Russia and NATO Allies about Russia’s concerns.  Do you have any
update on that meeting and who may be attending?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think what the President was referring to is a range of
discussions and engagements that we’re continuing to have today: the B9,
as an example of that; obviously, there are a number of NATO partners
involved there.  And, of course, we will — while I have nothing to
preview at this point, the President — two presidents tasked their teams
to follow up, and we expect that to continue as well.   
   
So, it was not meant to be an indication of a deal cut, concessions
made, any formal format or anything along those lines — more about the
commitment to ongoing engagement.   
   
Q    And you said, you know, you don’t know what Vladimir Putin’s next
move is here; it’s not clear yet whether he’s made up his mind whether
or not to invade Ukraine.  But just now, the Russian President said the
situation in southeast Ukraine resembles “genocide.”  That was how he
described it.  Is that something that you would view as a rhetorical
escalation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the Russians are known for their rhetorical
escalations, as they are also known for their ways of providing
misinformation around the world and within eastern flank countries.  So,
I think we have to take their own efforts to communicate to their public
with a grain of salt.   
   
What we know is that the aggression here is on the Russian side.  The
military buildup is on the Russian side.  There’s a path — a diplomatic
path forward.  The part of the President’s objective — our President’s
objective — in having the call was to convey that clearly — that
certainly is our preference — but also to convey clearly that there
would be consequences, they would be significant and severe.  And we’re
going to coordinate with our European partners on that.   
   
So, I would, unfortunately — as I’ve said before, I’m not a spokesperson
for the Kremlin, and I would take their — their words with a little bit
of a grain of salt.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Just a quick question on — Ukraine has asked to
become a member of the NATO Alliance and they’ve put that out for
several years.  It’s been out there, but really has — there hasn’t been
any decision on that.  What is the United States’ position on that
issue?  I mean, does the President generally support the enlargement of
NATO, or does he want the Alliance to add new members?  What is his
position?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Nandita, the President has spoken to this in the
past.  And obviously, there are requirements that any country — which
the President certainly supports — any country aspiring to join security
alliances — NATO and others as well.  And he certainly supports the
aspiration of Ukraine.  There are certain requirements that they would
need to meet on a range of issues, including corruption and other
topics.  And it’s obviously up to NATO partner countries and NATO, the
Alliance, to determine what the path forward looks like.  
   
Q    As sort of biggest member of the Alliance — largest member of the
Alliance, what is the U.S. telling NATO on this issue, specifically? 
And is the President, perhaps, offering any assurances to President
Zelenskyy today as he speaks to him on this issue?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, the President’s message has been clear. There are — he
certainly supports the aspiration of Ukraine, as he supports the
aspiration of a range of countries, again, to join security alliances
around the world.  There are certain requirements that need to be met. 
Those are well known, and the United States, as a member of NATO,
supports that path.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.   
   
Q    And, Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.   
   
Q    Sorry, a quick question on the Senate passage of the Republican
bill yesterday to overturn President Biden’s vaccine mandate for private
employers.  Are you concerned that given, sort of, the Democratic
support that that — a bill actually was able to get — are you concerned
that it perhaps will actually be able to, you know, interest some
centrist House Democrats to maybe join in and, you know, and secure a
vote on that?  I understand the White House has said that, you know, you
will veto the resolution if it lands on the President’s desk.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what’s most important for people to know out
there and to understand is the reason why the President proposed these
requirements, which include not just a vaccine requirement, but also a
testing option — testing once a week, which we feel and I think the
American people feel is quite reasonable — in order to keep workplaces
safe, keep schools safe, keep stores safe for people out there Christmas
shopping and holiday shopping safe.   
   
We also know that it’s something — it’s steps that economists support. 
It’s steps that 60 percent of businesses have already put in place.   
   
So, again, we’re hopeful that this doesn’t come to the President’s
desk.  I can’t make a prediction of that.  I leave that to the vote
counters or the whip counters in the House.  But if it comes to his
desk, he will veto it.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Apart from whatever President Zelenskyy might have
asked the President for today, can you clarify what Ukraine has formally
requested of the U.S. as they prepare for any potential invasion?  Have
they requested support for air and naval defense or electronic warfare,
as an example?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re not going to get into specifics of private
requests made through diplomatic and defense channels from the Ukrainian
government.  If they want to speak to that, they certainly can speak to
that.   
   
I would note that there were requests — there have been requests made
over the course of time, and the United States has provided over the
course of some time now, I guess, $400 billion, I believe this is
correct — $400 million, sorry — “billion” would be a lot — $400 million
in security assistance that we’ve committed to Ukraine this year, as a
part of our efforts to support their sovereignty and territorial
integrity.  And that includes $60 million of security assistance that we
announced during the President’s visit in September, which we’re still
providing, we’re still delivering to the Ukrainians.   
   
So, in terms of their specific requests, what they want to convey
privately — if they want to convey that publicly, that is certainly
their prerogative, but we would not do that on their behalf.  
   
Q    And the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service is quoted
in the New York Times saying, “There are not sufficient military
resources for repelling a full-scale attack by Russia if it begins
without the support of Western forces.”  Has Ukraine expressed a similar
sentiment to the administration, and do you have a response?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I’m not going to get into private diplomatic
conversations, but I will convey to you — and what — what the President
would convey, has conveyed, I’m sure is conveying directly to President
Zelenskyy: Our objective is to make clear the significant and severe
economic consequences if Russia were to invade Ukraine, not just from
us, but from the global community.   
   
Obviously, it’s up to President Putin to decide how he’s going to
respond to that, what steps he may or may not take as it relates to
that.   
   
But I think what the public should see clearly — whether it’s the
Ukrainian public or the global public — is that the United States is
standing up for what we believe are democratic values, for the
territorial sovereignty of Ukraine.   
   
And our objective is to prevent that from happening.  
   
Q    And one quick one on vaccines: Based on conversations Pfizer has
had with the administration, should Americans be mentally preparing for
a fourth shot?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would point you really to what the CDC and our health and
medical experts have conveyed, and they will continue to evaluate and
assess what is needed for the American people and to keep people safe. 
But I don’t want to get ahead of their reviews of data.  
   
Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On vaccines, Amtrak, which we know is near and dear
to the President’s heart, announced that they will potentially have to
cut some long-distance routes because they don’t have enough employees
to operate when the federal mandate takes effect.  And that’s despite
the reporting on the Hill today that 94 percent of their employees are
vaccinated overall.   
   
Amtrak got $66 billion from the infrastructure deal; now they’re talking
about having to make cuts.  Is this policy undermining the President’s
own legislation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say — and you touched on this, Jacqui,
but it’s great news that 94 percent of Amtrak’s workforce is
vaccinated.  That is an enormous percentage of their workforce, to state
the obvious.  They also still have about a month before the deadline for
federal contractors on January 4th, or at least a couple of weeks — four
weeks, approximately.  
   
Our — what we — what we have conveyed to employers is that post
deadline, we expect employers will follow their standard HR process. 
That means for employees not in compliance, they’ll go through
education, counseling, accommodations, and enforcement.  That would be
what the process would be to play out.  
   
But, of course, these requirements — we don’t expect these requirements
will cause disruptions to services that people depend on.  There’s some
time to implement it.  We’re, of course, working with all federal
contractors and federal employees and ind- — and parts of the federal
government to implement this moving forward.  
   
Q    And then, on Ukraine, there are some reports that the U.S. is
pressuring Ukraine to cede land to Russia as a way to deter them from
invading.  Is that true?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, that’s absolutely false.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, thank you.  Staying on Ukraine, Russian troops are still
amassed along the border.  Do you have any indication at this point that
the President’s strategy is working?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Kristen, I think it’s going to be up to President
Putin to make a decision about whether he is going to invade Ukraine and
— and send a message to the global community that he does not respect
the territorial integrity of a country when the United States, our
European partners are sending a clear message that there will be
significant economic consequences — severe economic consequences —
beyond, as Jake Sullivan said the other day, what we have seen in
2014.   
   
So, at this point, obviously, you would know if they have made the
decision to invade.  They have not.  But again, it’s — the ball is in
his court.  
   
Q    And we know that Ukraine — some lawmakers on Capitol Hill said that
they want more military equipment now.  I know we don’t have a readout
yet of the call.  But are there any discussions about potentially
sending that equipment now and not waiting until there’s further
invasion?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there is equipment that we’re continuing to provide. 
That is a follow-up from the President Zelenskyy’s meeting with
President Biden back in September.  So, that is something they’re
continuing to receive.  
   
And, of course, there are a range of options under consideration, but
nothing I can preview at this point in time.  
   
Q    Because they want more.  They’re basically saying, yes, that is the
case; but given this current situation, they actually want more.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  I understand that.  And they’ve conveyed that
publicly.  I don’t have anything to preview at this point.  But
certainly, we have been a strong supporter of not only the sovereignty
of Ukraine, but also through security assistance.  And the President has
a long record of that.  
   
Q    If I could do one just domestically on the Child Tax Credit and
really just following up on the questions that April was asking —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Are there any discussions about potentially pulling that piece out
of Build Back Better and passing it unilaterally as a standalone bill if
Build Back Better doesn’t pass by Christmas so that there isn’t a
lapse?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think April — I don’t know where she went.  Okay,
there she is.  I was pointing to her in the ether there.  (Laughter.)   
   
April raised an important point here, which is that December 15th would
be the last child — check from the Child Tax Credit because it would
expire January 1st.   
   
One of the reasons that we have been pressing for the passing of the
Build Back Better is because there are key components of this package
that would lower costs for American families early next year.  So, when
we talk about inflation and we talk about costs and how they’re
impacting families’ budgets, that’s why we, Leader Schumer, and others
have been pressing so hard to move this forward.  
   
In terms of the mechanics of legislative vehicles, I’d really point you
to the Senate on that.  But again, you know, that is a timeline and that
is something that we are well aware of.  
   
And to go back to — I can’t remember who asked the question before —
maybe April, maybe Jacqui, I’m not sure — it is true that, in part,
because of the Child Tax Credit, we cut child poverty in half.   
   
I’m not an economist.  I can check and see if there’s more predictions
of what the impact of the lack of existence of that would be, but that
sends a clear message about the impact that has had on low-income
families, on families who are struggling to put food on the table.  And
it’s been a pivotal contributor to our success in doing that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, thanks.  I just want to circle back the President’s comments
yesterday about NATO Allies.  He said that he hoped, by Friday, he
would, quote, be able to announce “meetings at a higher level, not just
with us but with at least four of our major NATO Allies and Russia to
discuss the future of Russia’s concerns relative to NATO writ large.”   
   
Are these meetings, conversations not happening?  And if not, what was
he talking about exactly?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he has a call with the B9 this afternoon.  That’s
something that includes a number of NATO Allies.  And, of course, we are
in touch every single day with a number of NATO Allies and partners.  
   
And as I noted a little bit earlier, when he — when he had the
conversation with President Putin, they discussed and agreed to have
their teams follow up in ongoing discussions and engagements.   
   
In terms of any other format or forum, there is no current mechanism for
that.  But right now, our focus is on engaging with the Europeans, many
of our NATO Allies; doing that at a very high level, as the President
referenced; and also following up, as was discussed in his call with
President Putin.  
   
Q    So we should not expect some kind of announcement tomorrow about
some sort of conversation with these — the entities he’s talking about,
about accommodation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not one that I have to predict at this point in time.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    One more —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    The President, today, spoke about global press freedom during the
Summit.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    I’m just wondering if he’s going to commit to holding a year-end
press conference.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, one, I would say that global press freedom is
something that he feels is important to stand up for not just here, but
when he is traveling around the world and ensuring that your colleagues
around the world who are dealing with circumstances where they don’t —
they are put in jail, they don’t have access to any officials, they are
restricted from covering global events, human rights abuses around the
world — not that what you don’t all do isn’t very challenging; I’m not
suggesting that — but there are a lot of circumstances around the world
that I think even go beyond — go beyond.  
   
I would say the President answers questions multiple times a week.  I
think he’s done it already several times this week.  I don’t have a
formal press conference with embroidered cushions to predict for you at
this point in time.  But I can assure you that he will take your
questions many, many times before the end of the year, and he looks
forward, absolutely, to doing that.  
   
Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    Can I just ask quickly on Iran?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    You spoke to measures you’re preparing.  Are there particular
sectors that these sanctions would be aimed at?  Or can you give us any
more detail about what options are on the table?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Certainly understand your question, Josh.  I think
part of the effort of our OFAC Director in going overse- — going to the
UAE to have these discussions is to have these discussions at that level
about the range — a range of sectors and options, but I don’t have
anything else to preview at this point in time.  
   
Q    Is there a concern that existing restrictions are being violated
with regards to this trip?  Like people are finding a way around
existing —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re talking about — we have kept the sanctions in place. 
We’re talking about additional steps, should they be needed.  Obviously,
a diplomatic path forward and having a constructive dialogue through the
P5+1 format is our objective, but we’re preparing a range of options in
addition to what we have in place.  
   
Q    Have you consulted any of the P5+1 on these measures?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s part of our discussions, and this is part of the —
our OFAC Director’s trip is building on conversations that Brett McGurk,
that Jake Sullivan and others have been having in Europe as well.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just a quick question on — just a real quick question on the
Democracy Summit.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    You mentioned the $424 million.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Do you have a sense how much of that is already appropriated versus
how much would need to be approved from Congress?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me check, Scott.  It’s a really good question.  I don’t
have that in front of me, but I will check for you, and I’ll get that
around to all of you after the briefing.  
   
Go ahead, Ashley.  
   
Q    Two quick questions on Ukraine.  One, why did President Biden
immediately call top U.S. allies right after speaking with President
Putin and waited two days to call Presidents Zelenskyy?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He was traveling yesterday — I think as you all know — and
he was looking forward to having a good, lengthy call with President
Zelenskyy today, which I expect he will do.  I would note that we also
followed up with Ukrainian counterparts at a lower level than the
President.  So it was just a matter of scheduling and getting it all on
the books.  
   
Q    And yesterday the President also said that combat troops on the
ground in Ukraine are currently off the table.  Can you give us a sense
of what would change that calculation — when they would be back on the
table?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s not currently part of our discussion or part of our
policy calculations, so I don’t have anything to predict on that
front.  
   
Go ahead, Zolan.  
   
Q    Thank you.  On Afghanistan, there’s — in recent days, some parolees
or people seeking parole have started to be denied who are looking to
flee from Afghanistan.   
   
I understand the system has been flooded with, I think, roughly 30,000
applications, but some of the lawyers for those parolees or applicants
have said that the documentation requirement, including specifying an
address or a specific threat, given that it might have been 10 years ago
or their home might have been destroyed, is a pretty high standard.  Is
the President currently satisfied with this system of humanitarian
parole?  Or is there any thought of lobbying Congress for another
special parole program?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, here’s what we’re doing — I know you didn’t exactly
ask me this, and you follow this closely, but for others: Through
Operation Allies Welcome, we’re proud to welcome more than 74,000
Afghans to the United States and have received funding from Congress to
accept up to 95,000 through Operation Allies Welcome through the current
fiscal year.   
   
So, obviously, what we’re doing now is continuing to process, through a
vetting process and through — and there are requirements of that, of
course, as there should be.  That’s an addition to Afghans who are
admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admission Program and other
pathways.   
   
You touched on this, Zolan, a little bit, but the infrastructure to
support refugee resettlement was decimated by the prior administration. 
We’ve been working hard to rebuild that capacity.  I would say the
success we’ve had to date of welcoming that number of people is a
reflection of the fact that we’ve made some progress in that regard.   
   
And right now, DHS is processing applications for Afghan nationals
located outside of the United States who are seeking humanitarian
referral based on urgent humanitarian need or significant public benefit
reason.   
   
There are going to be requirements, of course, through any of these
systems, as there should.  As we consider welcoming people back in,
we’re continuing to put in more resources so that we can process more
people and continuing to try to take — do everything we do — can — do
everything we can, I should say — sorry — to handle the surge in
interest and in cases.   
   
But there will be people who don’t meet the requirements who aren’t
going to be able to come to the United States, and we just want to be
very clear and transparent about that as well.  
   
Q    Jen, on — with the Democracy Summit, again.  At a CNN town hall,
the President was asked about voting rights, police reform.  He said
that he had been so focused on Build Back Better and infrastructure but
that he was going to move on to that — indicated he would move on to
that.   
   
Now that we are moving — you know, you’ve had some progress with that
legislation — is there any update towards whether he would be more open
to a filibuster carveout?  Or just what exactly is he doing when it
comes to those two legislative measures, given the summit going on and
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, one, I would say: As the President — as you
heard the President say, you know, having a summit like this is an
opportunity to discuss how we can all improve our democracies, protect
democracy around the world, and do that in coordination with not just
leaders, but civil society actors, private sector, et cetera.  That’s
the purpose of this summit.  
   
There are dozens of White House staff working every single day on voting
rights and this priority.  It’s fundamental to upholding the rule of
law.   
   
You’ve heard the President talk about this many times since he took
office.  He signed a historic executive order in March.  We’ve worked to
double the voting rights staff in the Civil Rights Division.  He’s
appointed the Vice President, at her request, to lead this effort.   
   
There are discussions, as you know, in Congress among a range of leaders
about how to continue to move this forward, and we are eager, active
participants of those discussions.   
   
I don’t have anything more in terms of views or his steps on the
legislative process at this point.  
   
Q    No change to his approach on the filibuster?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Don’t have any updates today.  Okay, I got to — I got to
wrap in a second.   
   
Let me go to AFP.  Go ahead. Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you very much.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you.  One on Russia, one on Ukraine —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — and one on China, if I may.  Could you tell us a bit more about
President Biden’s — how President Biden views Putin’s central argument
that seems to boil down to: They — they don’t want Ukraine, A, to enter
NATO and, B, also (inaudible) also not have any U.S.-offensive weapons
or NATO-offensive weapons in Ukraine.?  
   
So, when President Biden referred to looking for accommodations, was he
talking about cutting some sort of deal with Putin about, “We won’t do
this if you don’t do that?”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me be very clear: President Biden told President Putin
in their call that one nation can’t force another nation to change its
border, one nation cannot tell another to change its politics, and
nations can’t tell others who they can work with.  
   
We’ve consistently expressed support for the principle that every
country has the sovereign right to make its own decisions with respect
to its security.  That is written into the underlying principle of the
Alliance and that remains U.S. policy today and will remain U.S. policy
in the future.  
   
As you know, NATO is a defensive alliance and they don’t have aggressive
intent toward Russia.  They’ve conveyed that, leaders of NATO have
conveyed that.  Every sta- — step we have taken to put in place the
protective measures needed to defend our Allies.   
   
So, that — just to be clear about where the President stands — that is
what he conveyed directly to President Putin.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then a quick one on China —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — because the Olympics are almost — would President Biden like
European allies to join this diplomatic boycott initiative?  Is he
disappointed in the French very publicly not doing so?   
   
And just more generally, you know, if you’re going to talk about
genocide in a country — which is, you know, right there in the statement
— is playing sports at all a kind of a reasonable thing to be doing? 
Why stop at a diplomatic boycott?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well — well, first, I would say this is the decision we made
— the United States made.  The United States has been a leader in
holding China accountable, as it relates to human rights abuses, the —
what we’ve seen in Xinjiang, which, again, the President and we have
referred to as a “genocide.”  And we have taken steps at the global
level to lead this effort to put accountability measures in place.  
   
Q    But, Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  As it relates to the Olympics, we made a decision — the
President made a decision that we cannot continue with business as
usual, that not sending a diplomatic delegation was making that clear
not just to China, but to the global community.  There are others who
have followed that same pattern and have taken that step as well.  We
leave it to other countries to make their own decision.   
   
I’m not going to express support, disappointment, or anything like that
from here.  They will make their own decision.   
   
And I will also just paraphrase — and I wish I had the quote in front of
me — Senator Romney, where he said — and he — his quote was better than
this, so I’m paraphrasing it here.  But that we cannot leave global
diplomacy on the shoulders of athletes who have been training their
whole lives to compete in the Olympics.   
   
If you look back at 1980 — and there was a boycott — all of those people
who trained for the Olympics, it was left on their shoulders — young
athletes who had been training their whole lives.  We are sending a very
clear message about our view on human rights, but we made the decision
not to leave that on the shoulders of athletes.   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me just go to Raquel, and then we got to wrap up.   
   
Raquel, go ahead.  Raquel.   
   
Q    Thank you so much —  
   
Q    (Inaudible) is there any reason why you keep a travel ban on other
African nations —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Can — can we let — can we let Raquel —  
   
Simon, Simon, Simon —  
   
Q    I have been trying to ask a question for one —  
   
Q    A lot of us have, so —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Simon, I’m trying to answer your question.  And then I’m
going to go to Raquel, okay?  
   
Let me —  
   
Q    Thank you so much, Jen, for —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Can I say one thing, Raquel, and then I’ll go to you?  
   
Q    Sure.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Simon, we’re evaluating every single day.  We don’t want
these to be permanent measures —   
   
Q    Jen, can I ask my question?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — and it is something that the President is getting updates
from his COVID team every single day on.  
   
Q    So — so, my question is: The Omicron variant is now in 57
countries.  The WHO issued a statement today and said that Africa has 46
percent of the nearly 1,000 cases globally.  But 70 — almost 70
countries in the world have imposed travel ban on only Black African
nation.   
   
And the U.S. is among the countries that have imposed sanctions on only
eight African nations, when the virus — when the variant is in 57
countries.  Why don’t you just lift it or impose sanctions on all the
countries that have it?  What would you say to those who believe that
this is a racist ban that targets only African and Black African
nations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Simon, I would convey to you that is absolutely not the
intention.  That is not our policy.  This was a recommendation of the
health and medical experts because there were a large number of cases in
South Africa.  And they made a decision early on, out of an abundance of
caution and to protect the American people, to slow the spread of the
variant.   
   
This is not meant to be permanent.  It’s not meant to be a punishment. 
And we are evaluating every single day decisions on whether to — when to
lift these restrictions.   
   
Go ahead, Raquel.  
   
Q    Thank you so much, Jen.  Since it’s —  
   
Q    Jen, on the —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Raquel.  
   
Q    — democracy day here today in White House, what is the White House
assessment so far from what you guys are hearing or from world leaders
and the commitment they are making?   
   
And also, what commitments would President Biden like to see from Brazil
and other countries experiencing, right now, forms of democratic
backsliding?  What is President Biden expecting to hear from President
Bolsonaro tomorrow?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that the President convened the
summit in order to have a forum at a global level to discuss publicly
but also privately — and he convened a private discussion with leaders
this morning — to engage, listen, and speak honestly about the
challenges and opportunities facing democratic governments and how
democracies can deliver for their citizens.   
   
And part of this is an opportunity, as I noted in my opening, to stand
up for the freedom of speech, the freedom of press; for ensuring that,
as a global community, we are lifting up democratic societies, we are
fighting corruption, we are bolstering democratic reforms.   
   
And the United States wants to be a country that leads by example and
builds and repairs from the damage done for four years.   
   
Thank you so much, everyone.  I appreciate you.  Have a good day.
