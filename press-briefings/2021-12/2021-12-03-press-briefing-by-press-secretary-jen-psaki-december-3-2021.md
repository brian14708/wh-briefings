title: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, December 3, 2021

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:54 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. Happy Friday.  
   
Okay. A lot happening in the world; I don’t have to tell all of you.
Just a couple of notes for you all at the top.  
   
This morning, we learned the unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, down by a
historic 2 full percentage points since President Biden took office.  
   
Prior to the American Rescue Plan, CBO estimated that the U.S. would not
have a 4.2 percent unemployment rate until the end of 2024. So, this
gives you that chart, just to give you a sense of exactly what the CBO
projections were and how much more quickly we move to that unemployment
rate.  
   
After the Great Recession, it took nine years for the United States to
reach a 4.2 percent unemployment rate — just to give you a sense.  
   
The unemployment rate is dropping even more — even as more people are
reentering the workforce and looking for jobs. That’s good news.  
   
There is no doubt that the Biden economic agenda is getting people back
to work. In November, we added an additional 210,000 jobs for a total of
6 million jobs in the first 10 full months of the President’s
administration. That is a record for a new President.  
   
Wages are also up. And thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the President
and Congressional Democrats delivered significant tax cuts for families
raising kids.  
   
On average, Americans have about $100 more in their pockets each month
than they did last year, even accounting for higher prices. The United
States is the only leading economy in the world where household income
and the economy are stronger than they were before the pandemic.  
   
And our COVID strategy is allowing millions of workers to find jobs and
ensuring our country can weather any challenges without shutting down
our businesses or our schools.  
   
We know there is more work to do, and the historic Build Back Better Act
will cut costs that American families have struggled with for years,
create more jobs, and continue growing our economy.  
   
Just some notes on the week ahead for all of you. On Sunday, the
President and First Lady will return from Camp David to host the Kennedy
Center Honors — Honorees Reception, where they will be joined by the
Vice President and Second Gentleman. They will then attend the 44th
Kennedy Center Honors.  
   
On Monday, the President will deliver remarks on how his Build Back
Better and Act will lower the costs of prescription drugs for millions
of Americans by finally letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, imposing
a tax penalty if drug companies increase their prices faster than
inflation, putting a cap on how much seniors and people with
disabilities have to pay for drugs, and lower insulin prices so that
Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their
insulin.  
   
The President thinks it’s absolutely unacceptable that the American
people are forced to pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in
the entire world — two to three times as much as other developed
countries, and this is an example of how Build Back Better will reduce
many of the biggest costs families face.  
   
On Thursday and Friday, the President will host the virtual Summit for
Democracy, bringing together over 100 participants, representing
governments, civil society, and private sector leaders. The President
will deliver the Summit’s opening and closing remarks, and will
participate in plenary sessions.  
   
I know we’ve previewed (inaudible) components of that, and we’ll have
more in the coming days.  
   
Go ahead, Alex.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. I have a few questions on Russia and then one on Iran.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  So, today Putin’s foreign affairs advisor told reporters that
arrangements have been made for a Putin-Biden call in the coming days.
Can you tell us anything about that? Will there be a call with Zelenskyy
as well?  
   
And then can you clarify what the President meant when he said earlier
he was putting together a, quote, “comprehensive and meaningful set of
initiatives” to deter Putin?  
   
And then, one more on that. Does the administration think that Ukraine
has to do anything more than it’s doing to deter Russia? Should there be
concessions from Ukraine?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, let me start with a second one first, and then I’ll try
to make sure I cover all of them.  
   
First, while I can’t, of course, speak to Russian intentions, I think
you’ve heard us and Secretary of State Blinken express growing concerns
about what we’re seeing on the border of Russia and Ukraine.  
   
He has been in Europe this week consulting with our partners, European
partners. And we have also been consulting, at the same time, closely
with Congress.  
   
And we want to make sure that we are prepared. We know what President
Putin has done in the past. We see that he is putting in place the
capacity to take action in short order. And should he decide to invade,
that is why we want to be prepared and — in an area we have expressed
serious concern about.  
   
So, what he means by a group of — a package — is there’s a range of
tools at our disposal. Of course, economic sanctions are an option. But
we are going to do that in coordination with our European partners, with
Congress.  
   
Those consultations have been ongoing. And we just want to be
prepared.  
   
As it relates to the potential for a call, we have been engaged in the
possibility of that. When we have — if and when we have that finalized,
we will make that make that — we will make you all aware of that.  
   
As you know, the President is somebody who believes in leader-to-leader
diplomacy. It certainly would be an opportunity to discuss our serious
concerns about the bellicose rhetoric about the military buildup that
we’re seeing on the border of Ukraine.  
   
Go ahead. You had another question.  
   
Q  On Ukraine. Follow-up.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yes.  
   
Q  Does the administration think that Ukraine should be offering
anything more to Russia to try to deter some of that bellicose rhetoric,
the actions that we’ve seen?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think we are not the only country who feels that the
onus is really on Russia to reduce their bellicose rhetoric, to make
some changes as it relates to the buildup of military troops that we see
at the border and will really — the onus is really on them.  
   
Q  And then on Iran: The Iran talks have not been going well. There are
reports that the Western negotiators told Iran negotiators they’re
opening proposals were, quote, “unserious.”  
   
So, will those talks continue as planned? Is the administration still
hopeful for a diplomatic approach?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We are always hopeful for a diplomatic approach. That’s
always the best option.  
   
The seventh round of talks did end today in Vienna. Special Envoy Malley
and his interagency team are returning to Washington now.  
   
The new Iranian administration did not come to Vienna with constructive
proposals.  
   
The first six rounds of negotiations made progress finding creative
compromise solutions to many of the hardest issues that were difficult
for all sides.  
   
Iran’s approach this week was not, unfortunately, to try to resolve the
remaining issues. So — and even more importantly, Iran started this new
round of negotiations with a new round of nuclear provocations, as
reported by the IAEA on Wednesday. And they’ve still failed to reach an
understanding with the IAEA to restore the cooperation and transparency
they have degraded in recent months.  
   
We know why we’re here. The previous administrations decided to withdraw
from the JCPOA. That’s led to a dramatic and unprecedented expansion of
Iran’s nuclear program.  
   
This cannot continue, and the President continues to believe that there
is a better alternative. He’s committed to returning the United States
to compliance with the JCPOA and staying in compliance so long as Iran
does the same. He means it.  
   
If Iran is equally committed, a solution is at hand. But we did not see
that from them this week.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen.  
   
Just, first — just clarifying what you said on Ukraine there. So, it’s
fair to say that the White House is preparing for the possibility that
Russia might invade?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we can’t predict from here what President Putin’s
calculus is or what the Russians’ calculus is. We saw what they did in
2014. We’ve seen what they’re doing on the border. And we’re going to
consult with our allies and partners and Congress here to be prepared
for a range of options.  
   
Q  I want to switch gears totally to a comment from — a statement from
Senator Manchin last night. He voted with Repub- — he voted against a
Republican amendment to zero out funding for the vaccine mandate, but
then he put a statement saying that he would actually support that idea
in the coming weeks.  
   
What’s your reaction to Manchin saying that he’s against the President’s
mandate that much?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, one, it’s “vax or test.” And obviously, that is
something we feel we have every authority to do based on a 50-year-old
law that Congress put into place 50 years ago.  
   
We simply disagree. We disagree based on what we feel is a preponderance
of evidence of the effectiveness of requirements, vaccinating, or
testing.  
   
You look at the private sector. There are a range of companies,
airlines, hospital associations who have implemented these types of
requirements effectively.  
   
We are the largest employer — the United States government — in this
country. We have implemented requirements, and we have seen 96.5 percent
compliance — something we’re going to continue to build on.  
   
And these companies and the federal government are doing it for a range
of reasons. It creates certainty, it allows people to feel safe in the
workplace, and it’s good for the economy.  
   
So, we disagree on that front. And we’re going to continue to press
forward with these requirements.  
   
Q  But, to that point, if the companies are doing that — I mean, that’s
Manchin’s statement was that we should just continue to incentivize
companies.  
   
Why — you know, what are you going to do if he votes with the
Republicans and tries to really gut funding for these mandates?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m sure we’ll be having discussions with him and anyone who
is an opponent of these steps, but I don’t have all the details of what
this would actually propose.  
   
We’re talking about implementing requirements through a 50-year-old law.
It’s obviously in the courts now.  
   
It is a good sign — no question — that companies are doing this in the
private sector. But we still feel, at this point in fighting the virus,
it’s important to move forward with these requirements.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Just a quick follow-up on Ukraine. Russia has been pretty clear for
the past several months about what they’re looking for out of the U.S.,
out of NATO in terms of this crisis. They want firm, legally binding
security guarantees. They don’t want NATO and Ukraine — they don’t want
to see a military buildup on the other side. And they don’t want to see
Ukraine become a member of NATO. Where is the flexibility for the White
House on this? Are you willing to budge on any of those issues?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, NATO member countries decide who is a member of NATO,
not Russia. And that is how the process has always been and how it will
proceed.  
   
I think it’s important to remember where the provocative action is
coming from at this point in time. It’s not the United States; it’s not
Ukraine.  
   
Q  Okay. So, let me ask you about abortion rights. You mentioned
yesterday about the President’s support for the Women’s Health
Protection Act —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  — which was passed by the House and the Senate — the House, in
September — and is awaiting action in the Senate.  
   
President Biden has talked a number of times about there being areas
where he is open to reforming the filibuster — to preventing a default
is one of those examples that he’s given. Is passing this bill one of
those things? And does he want to see quicker, faster, stronger action
on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, again, we don’t have a ruling from the Supreme Court.
We don’t expect that for several months. The President continues to
believe that codifying Roe is something that should be done, and he
supports this piece of legislation. But I think we’re getting a few
steps ahead in the process at this point.  
   
Q  Okay. So — but again, that bill was passed in September. Schumer said
it will come up very soon in the Senate, back in September. Where is
that? And is the White House doing anything to push that along?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I would point you to Leader Schumer’s office on any status of
when that would come forward. Again, it’s something the President
strongly supports, and he is a strong advocate for codifying Roe.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  In the President’s remarks earlier today, when he was asked about his
cold, he said that he was te- — he is being tested daily for COVID-19.
My understanding was that it was done with less frequency of that. I
know Dr. O’Connor said that he was tested three times this week, but is
there a change in protocol where he is going to be tested daily? And
what kind of test is he getting: antigen or PCR test?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah, I think we just put out some details from Doc O’Connor
that outlines how many times he’s been tested and, I believe, the kind
of tests that he received. He received those tests because he had a
cold, which would be considered a symptom and — but it’s not a change in
protocol.  
   
Q  And so he is not going to be tested daily?  
   
MS. PSAKI: No.  
   
Q  Okay. And then, yesterday, President Biden said that he spoke with
Senators McConnell and Schumer on government funding. But has he spoken
with Leader McConnell when it comes to the debt limit? And would the
President be opened to tying the debt limit to the NDAA?  
   
MS. PSAKI: The — I don’t have any calls to read out for you, but we are
encouraged by the conversations that are happening between Leader
Schumer and Senator McConnell about how to address a range of issues
that are in front of Congress, including the debt limit. And beyond
that, we — I don’t have any update from here.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. Just to clarify: The President did say he was tested
every day for COVID, so did he just misspeak there?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, Weijia — I would point you to the transparent
note we put out from the doctor to all of you that outlines how many
times he was tested and exactly what he was tested for.  
   
Q  Okay. And then shifting to the new travel policy that goes into
effect on Monday. The burden is on airline workers to verify test
results to make sure they’re negative. Is the administration doing
anything to help train them so they know how to do that and so that they
can spot fraudulent results, for example?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I would really point you to TSA, a division, of course, of
the government. I’m sure that they are taking steps to make sure people
are prepared to look for how to verify, but I’d really point you to them
for more details.  
   
Q  Okay. And the President just announced it yesterday. It goes into
effect Monday. Can you share what you’re doing to get the word out to
international travelers, especially to Americans who might be coming
home? Are airlines sending out the message to all those travelers?  
   
MS. PSAKI: This is not — I would just remind everyone that this is from
three days, to the day in advance. So, it is a change in that regard. It
is not an entirely new component.  
   
We have communicated that effectively. I think travelers has been able
to abide by the three-day requirement. We will communicate through a
range of channels we’ve done in the past, but we don’t expect there to
be an issue.  
   
Q  And then just one more quick one. A lot of these at-home tests come
with a stick. So your test result is the stick that either has one line
or two lines on it. But the FAQ section says that you need — you will
need to show a paper or a digital copy of your test result. So is the
stick the test result?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Again, Weijia, we’ve been implementing these requirements for
the three-day requirements since we returned to international travel
effectively. I would point you to TSA and others for specifics. But this
is not an area where we’ve had issue, and we don’t anticipate them in
advance of Monday.  
   
Q  Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. The Build Back Better plan’s price tag is being
described as “incomprehensible” by Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a
Democrat. And Lindsey Graham says that he has heard from the CBO that
they’re going to do an alternative cost estimate and that it’s going to
cost more and add more to the debt. So, is there any thought around here
to maybe waiting for Build Back Better until a month that you don’t have
this big miss in the jobs report?  
   
MS. PSAKI: There’s a lot of things gathered into that question so let me
—  
   
Q  There is not. There is like three.  
   
MS. PSAKI: — let me do the best I can. Let me do the best I can for you
here.  
   
In terms of the report of a new CBO, that is not exactly how it works.
There has been — and let me just start with the irony here — that
there’s an irony that a number of Republicans — who forced an unpopular
tax giveaway to the rich that increased our debt by $2 trillion and
certainly didn’t ask for a score for a continuation of that legislation
that did add to the deficit — are now asking for a score — an additional
score, post this bill being concluded, for something that isn’t even
going to be law.  
   
They’re asking about a potential continuation of these components of the
package that, again, the President has said he would pay for. I can’t
get into the psyche of why. I would suggest that it might be — have
something to do with their opposition to raising taxes on corporations.
That seems to get under their skin a little bit. We disagree with them
on that front.  
   
I would say: The CBO has put out a score; a number of economists have
put out scores. We have outlined in the past that CBO does not have the
— have not have a great deal of experience scoring components like the
IRS tax savings — that’s something that the former head of the CBO has
also spoken to in the past — and that there are estimates about those
cost savings that lead to not only our assessments of the cost and
savings from the package, but the assessments by many economists.  
   
Q  Okay. On the pandemic. It’s been more than two weeks since President
Biden had a call with Xi. And on that call, we know he did not press him
to help with the COVID origins investigation — because you said that Xi
just understands he’s supposed to be transparent. So, in the two-plus
weeks since, has he helped and been transparent yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t believe that’s exactly what I said. I believe what I
said is that we have pressed for this repeatedly, we will continue to,
and we’ll continue to do that at a range of levels. I don’t,
unfortunately, have any updates on the participation or willingness of
the Chinese to add and provide additional data.  
   
Can I provide one other update to you, since you asked me about crime
yesterday and I have a little more information for you?  
   
Q  About crime? My question was about Xi and China.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, you asked me a question about crime yesterday.  
   
Q  Okay. Sure. Yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI: So I was going to give you a little extra information.  
   
Q  Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I followed up for you, Peter.  
   
Q  Great.  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI: So, I would note, what I — what I should have added yesterday
but I learned afterwards is that the Justice Department, the FBI, and
the federal law enforcement have been in touch — in contact with
jurisdictions where we have seen this high level of retail theft.  
   
So, for example, in Los Angeles, we’ve seen a rash of robberies. The FBI
is providing assistance to a multi-jurisdictional task force led by the
LA Police Department.  
   
I’d also note that, on top of that, the Department of Justice announced
last week that San Francisco, where a number of high-profile retail
thefts have happened, will get money to hire 50 more police officers
through the COPS Program that the President has championed — that came
as part of nearly $150 million in similar grants nationwide.  
   
So just a few updates for you.  
   
Q  Thank you for that. We will include that in our coverage.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I look forward to seeing it on Fox later today.  
   
Q  It’s on Fox right now, I think.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay. I bet it is.  
   
Q  One more topic, to follow up on some of the questions from earlier.
The President was hoarse and coughing today. A lot of people in the
workforce are encouraged not to go to work if they are exhibiting those
symptoms, even if they are fully vaccinated. So, are the rules different
for the President?  
   
MS. PSAKI: The President, again, was tested, as we put out in some — in
a transparent piece of information from his doctor, where he received a
response quickly from that test, enable him — enabling him to proceed.
People also had — he had a cold, which is what you know from the
information put out by the doctor.  
   
Q  But as you know from your own experience, it is possible to test
negative several times before there’s a positive test. So is there any
concern about having him at work while he’s got these symptoms, even if
he is showing negative tests?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I can assure you that the President follows every protocol.
He wants to keep everyone safe in the White House. And that’s why,
obviously, he — we consult with the doctor and we put out that
information to make it available to all of you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  If I can ask you about the announcement the President made yesterday.
Right now, some European countries are subsidizing the testing process
overseas. The decision was announced here that the government would be
having Americans submit to insurance for reimbursement. Why that
decision, to not follow what’s been a successful path for a lot of
European countries — which is the subsidizing of those tests?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would note first, Peter, that the announcement made
yesterday builds on the steps we have taken to date, which includes
ensuring there are eight FDA-approved tests available out in the market
— home tests. There were none available at the beginning. There were
half that number available just a few months ago. We’ve also quadrupled
the size of our testing program and capacity just since this summer.  
   
We’ve also invested billions of dollars here in the testing market. That
market here includes reliable tests that meet the FDA’s gold standard.
Some of those tests might not meet that standard. And that’s what we
think the American people expect and deserve.  
   
We also want to ensure the testing market continues scaling up and
remains competitive and innovative. We believe this will help drive down
costs. So, our view is we want to — and we share the objective with
others — we want to make them more accessible; we want to lower the
costs of tests.  
   
We also announced that we’re going to be donating 50 million tests to
rural and community health centers. That’s what we’re trying to achieve
here, and we feel this builds on the steps we’ve already taken to
date.  
   
But we have different tests, we have different market approaches here,
and we’re going to continue to build on what we’re doing here in the
United States.  
   
Q  The President, in his remarks earlier today, said talking about
progress is “not enough” if Americans aren’t seeing it — aren’t
effectively feeling it — in their everyday lives. Why do you think that
is that Americans aren’t feeling it yet? Is that a policy issue? Is it a
messaging issue? What’s the disconnect?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I’ve answered versions of those questions before, but I
— we feel, here, that COVID still has an overlaying effect — impact on
people and how they’re seeing things day to day, for good reason.  
   
People’s lives don’t look like they did a few years ago. You’re worried
about going to work. You’re worried about your kids getting sick. You —
you’re worried about whether you’re going to be safe in a restaurant or
going to a concert. That impacts how people feel about how they’re
experiencing the economy.  
   
And there’s no question, as much as we’re seeing encouraging economic
data, data doesn’t move people; I can tell you that as a communicator.
Their experiences in their daily lives move people.  
   
So, he’s going to be out there talking about how his plans will lower
their costs, make their lives better, and hopefully that will give
people a bridge to what he’s trying to achieve here.  
   
Q  Two last little thoughts just following up on the questions about his
health. Obviously, like everybody else, we wish that he will get well
soon. The question though is: Given the fact that he has a cold right
now, are there any things that are being done differently? Have meetings
been scaled back? Is he doing something separately or does everything
continue as planned, given the test?  
   
MS. PSAKI: It’s continuing as planned. He’s taking some over-the-counter
cold medication and probably some cough drops and some tea. But
otherwise, he’s proceeding with his schedule.  
   
And then, just to — finally, to punctuate that very quickly, just for
clarity: You said earlier that the reason he had these tests was because
he was showing symptoms. So, he gets tested though when he’s not showing
symptoms, correct?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Correct, yes. On a regular basis, not as frequently. And even
cold symptoms —  
   
Q  So, three times this week was because he was showing symptoms —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Correct.  
   
Q  — on other weeks, it would be less than the three times this week.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Thank you for the clarification.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Back on the new requirement for international travel to the United
States —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  — what gives you confidence that it won’t be an issue or a problem
for travelers coming into the United States having to get a test one day
before boarding their flights?  
   
Are you confident that there’s going to be enough supply, accessibility
for every traveler who wants to come here everywhere in the world?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, there have been some exemptions announced by the State
Department where tests are not as readily available. So, we look at all
of the factors here, Steve, and we’re not trying to make it more
difficult for people to return home. We’re trying to take every step to
protect the American public.  
   
There have already been these requirements in place for three days. So,
yes, it is a difference, but people who have traveled have adjusted to
that requirement, and this is just narrowing that requirement.  
   
Q  So, the requirement takes effect Monday. What is your advice, right
now, to Americans who are watching or listening to this — they have only
a few days left, what should they do?

MS. PSAKI: Americans who are here or Americans who are —

Q  Americans who are who are abroad and tuned into this briefing on —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure, no, I just wanted to make sure I understood.  
   
Q  Great.  
   
MS. PSAKI: A day in advance of their international flight, they should
get a test, as opposed to three days in advance.  That’s the
difference.  
   
Go ahead, Sabrina.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. A number of cities, including New York, LA, San
Francisco require proof of vaccination to access indoor dining, bars,
and other non-essential businesses. Given the new variant, does the
administration believe that more cities and localities should enact
similar proof of vaccination requirements?  
   
MS. PSAKI: They may decide to do that. Our — our approach and our view
has always been that’s up to cities and localities. It is not, as you
know, that CDC guidance has changed on this front. There’s a lot we
don’t know about the variant. We’re learning more every single day.  
   
But again, we continue to believe that’s up to states and localities on
what they need to do to protect people in their community.  
   
And just similarly, with respect to states, cities, and localities,
there are a number of cities that still have not reinstated mask
mandates, but they do fall within the substantial- or high-transmission
category that the CDC has outlined for areas where there should be
indoor mask mandates in place.  
   
So, do you think cities like D.C. and New York, which are still in
substantial- or high-transmission, should abide by the CDC guidelines?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Of course, they should; every city should. I would note, just
— and this wasn’t exactly your question, but I thought this was an
interesting piece of data as it relates to vaccination rates: Yesterday,
1 million people received booster shots; 2.2 million shots total. That’s
our highest day since May.  
   
So, just to give you a sense of how people are consuming information. We
obviously don’t want that to be a respo- — you know, our objective is
not for people to be scared. That is not what we’re trying to do here.
But certainly, you’re seeing that the impact of how this is being
communicated about is being felt in communities. People are taking steps
to protect themselves.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  In the State Dining Room earlier, the President said he was putting
together “the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to
make it very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead” with actions towards
Ukraine. Are any of those initiatives military in nature?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I’m not going to outline them in more detail from here,
but I would note that, obviously, economic sanctions in a range of
formats, economic steps are always a part of the option.  
   
We have, of course, provided a range of security assistance to Ukraine
in the past, and that’s something that remains under consideration. But
that’s what I can preview at this point in time.  
   
Q  And just on the next tranche of Fed nominees, has President Biden
finished the interviews for those three slots?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any update on the personnel process. He continu-
— you can all continue to plan for him to announce the additional
nominees in short due time, but I don’t have an update on the day.  
   
Q  Afghanistan, please?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you very much, Jen. Winter is very close, and Afghan people are
still in a bad situation — food crisis. Any plan of the United States
for humanitarian assistance to Afghan people?  
   
And also, the U.S. victims’ families — 9/11 — they expect to receive
some money from the frozen money in Afghanistan. Do you have any comment
about that? Although Afghan people lost so many people, like 165 people
is dead — have been dead in Afghanistan, and Osama bin Laden was found
in Pakistan. I think that the 9/11 victim families receive this — expect
this amount from Pakistani authority. And Afghan people just —  
MS. PSAKI: So, I would just note on the last question you asked — very
important question, good question. It’s under — the Department of
Justice is really the right entity to discuss that with. There’s some
discussion of litigation around that with some of the 9/11 families, so
I would point you to them on that, in that regard.  
   
On the earlier question you asked about humanitarian assistance:
Absolutely. The United States continues to be the largest — if not one
of the largest — providers of humanitarian assistance to the Afghan
people in the world. We will continue to discuss with our partners, with
the U.N., with others, the best means of getting that assistance to the
Afghan people. And that is an ongoing discussion and one we were — we
are committed to continuing to contribute to.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Jen, thank you. Germany has decided that unvaccinated people should
not be allowed to go into public places. That may be a great way to
incentivize people to be vaccinated. Let’s assume that would not fly in
this country.  
   
Let me ask you — the serious part of the question really is — there
seems to be, no matter what, this 27, 30 percent of the population — the
eligible population — that refuses to be vaccinated for a variety of
reasons.  
   
MS. PSAKI: It’s a little lower than that. I mean, more than 82 percent
of people have received their first dose.  
   
Q  Okay. But what makes the President think that this new winter
initiative of trying to get people to get vaccinated — what makes him
feel confident that that’s going to work on those people who absolutely
refuse to be vaccinated?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, first, we know what works. I would remind you that,
almost a year ago, only about 30 percent of eligible adults in this
country felt open to getting vaccinated. Now we’re — it’s more than 82
percent have received one — at least one dose.  
   
That is clearly not against — on partisan lines. Because you know — you
know how divided our country can be. That — those are people who took a
step to protect themselves, to protect their neighbors, to protect their
loved ones.  
   
I’d also note that we saw — I just gave you some data on the vaccination
rate from just yesterday — the highest we have seen since May. And we
know that vaccinations are what can save lives, but, also, it’s
important to continue to build our testing and masking capacity. That’s
what we also announced yesterday.  
   
So, I would just say: We know what works. We also know what’s standing
in the way. And you’re right, there are things that we can’t change.  
   
For reasons I will never begin to understand, some members of the
Republican Party have decided that their political platform is going to
be running in favor of protecting people from getting vaccinated or from
getting tested. That’s why people tried — some people tried to shut down
the government. As crazy as that sounds, people hear that. They hear
misinformation traveling on social media. Those are all entities we’re
fighting.  
   
But you’re right, there are some forces against us.  
   
Q  When does he — the President throw up his hands?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Never. You can’t do that as President.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Just a real quick clarification. The letter that you all sent out
from the President’s doctor —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  — does not indicate whether the COVID test was a PCR test or —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay, fair. I —  
   
Q  — an antigen test. If you — if you could you —  
   
MS. PSAKI: I will get the clarification from him. Absolutely.  
   
Q  Great. I mean, it’s —  
   
MS. PSAKI: I read it too quickly up here. Yes.  
   
Q  It’s important, given the difference in accuracy for the —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. Understood.  
   
Q  That’s all. Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay. Sounds great.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. My question is about the travel restrictions. And,
right now, the African people are still very concerned about these
restrictions. Because of that, there is a little chaos in the continent
because many countries are closing their borders and people are not
traveling as usual. And many people in Africa still have problem to
really understand the real reasons behind those travel restrictions, so
— and why it’s still in place.  
   
You have said in the past that there is no political reasons behind this
decision. And the President and you yourself have mentioned that this is
to protect the American people and it’s for the safety of the American
people. But if this was really about the safety of the American people,
why some countries in Europe and even Canada that has the variant are
not included on this travel restriction list? And even African countries
that doesn’t have the variant are on the list.  
   
So, how do you explain to the African people who are watching you right
now that there is no political reasons behind, even though it looks like
there is?  
   
MS. PSAKI: So, I would say directly to the people in Africa that these
restrictions were announced a week ago, on the recommendation of our
health and medical experts, because what we saw and what we have
continues to see is that, in South Africa, the variant and the spread of
the variant led to hundreds and thousands of cases. And I don’t have the
exact number in front of me, but now it’s definitely far into the
thousands of cases.  
   
We also put the — the restrictions were recommended by our health and
medical experts for neighboring countries. These steps were taken in
order to slow the spread of the variant and to give our medical experts
here more time to assess this variant and more time to assess what we
needed to do to protect people in the United States.  
   
At the same time, we have been donating not only vaccines, but know-how
and expertise to South Africa, to neighboring countries. And we’ve been
in touch with officials there on a daily basis as we help to — work to
address this variant and this virus.  
   
And we are assessing, on a daily basis, what is needed, whether it’s
adding additional restrictions or removing restrictions. So that’s what
I would say.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  And, Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think I have to keep going.  
   
Q  One last — one last question, please.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m sorry. I have to keep going because we’re going to —  
   
Q  One last question.  
   
MS. PSAKI: — we’ll run out of time.  
   
Q  One last one. Please.    
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay, last one.  
   
Q  Yes. We have seen President Biden in the past strongly defend the
South African people from the apartheid regime when he was in Congress.
And not only that, even normally, he used to advocate for the rights of
the African people. Does the mind of President Biden change over the
time towards the Africans?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Absolutely not. What we’re trying to do here is work in
partnership to address a variant and address a virus. And we are in
touch on a daily basis with leaders there, with health officials there
about everything we can do to be a partner in that effort.  
   
At the same time, the President needs to take steps to err on the side
of protecting the American people from the spread of a variant we knew
little about and we’re learning more about on a daily basis.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks. Apple alerted U.S. diplomats that their iPhones had been
hacked in recent months by spyware from the NSO Group. This is the first
confirmed cases of the Pegasus software being used to target American
officials. I’m wondering if the administration has any comment on
that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I have seen this particular report. And I’m not sure if the
State Department will have more to say about it — they may. We have been
acutely concerned that commercial spyware, like NSO Group’s software,
poses a serious counterintelligence and security risk to U.S. personnel,
which is one of the reasons why this administration has placed several
companies involved in the development and proliferation of these tools
on the Department of Commerce’s Entity List. We have also mobilized a
government-wide effort to counter and curb proliferation of these
commercial hacking tools.  
   
But in terms of this specific incident, I’d point you to State; they may
have more up-to-date information on it.  
   
Q  And just one more on the shooting in Michigan. I’m wondering if the —
if you have any update on whether or not the President has had any
contact with state or local leaders, or families impacted by it?  
   
And then, secondly, gun control is obviously something that he’s talked
quite a bit about. There is no — he nominated someone for the ATF.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  That nomination has been pulled. Do — should we expect someone else
to be nominated for that — the role, or any more of a focus from the
President on gun control, given what happened this week?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, absolutely. I mean, gun safety is something that has
been a core issue for the President for decades. As you know, and you’ve
heard me say from here before, you know, he led the effort to pass the
Assault Weapons Ban, to get the Brady bill passed and background
checks.  
   
And even since he’s come into office, in April, he announced a set of
actions to reduce gun violence, including reining in the proliferation
of ghost guns, an issue that — ghost guns are something that has really
been a rising contributor to violent crime — to crimes out there and to
gun violence; better stable — regulating stabilizing braces; and
encouraging states to adopt red flags through the Justice Department, an
issuance of model legislation; and in June he announced a comprehensive
plan to reduce gun crime.  
   
The fact is, there are three bills right now that have passed the House:
the Violence Against Women Act, which includes provisions to keep more
guns out of the hands of abusers; the bill to require background checks
for all gun sales; and also Build Back Better, which includes a historic
proposal to invest $5 billion in evidence-based community violence
interventions.  
   
So, this is central. He will continue fighting for this. And he will
continue to look at what steps can be taken through executive action as
well. But this will continue to be a cause for the President.  
   
On your other question, I will check. I have not — I don’t have any
calls at this point to read out. I will check and see if there’s any
update to that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Yeah, back to the travel restrictions. Once these restrictions are in
place, it seems like it can often be pretty hard for them to go away.
India had a travel ban for months and months and months. The UK had a
travel ban for like a year.  
   
So, are there specific metrics that the White House is looking for to
decide, “Okay, let’s let these people travel here again” — you know,
especially given that it’s here; there’s community spread in the United
States?  
   
MS. PSAKI: And there are tens of thousands of cases in South Africa. And
there are —  
   
Q  Oh, of course.  
   
MS. PSAKI: — a half a dozen, we’re aware of, here in the United States.
That will grow and increase.  
   
I would say — I would refute one notion. We can make the decision, based
on the health and medical experts — and their meeting on a daily basis —
to rollback any restrictions. There are some, as you have said, that had
been in place for weeks or months for a reason. Right?    
   
Q  And then —  
   
MS. PSAKI: And if there had been a recommendation to roll those back
sooner, we would have abided by those recommendations. So, this is being
evaluated on a daily basis with our health and medical experts and team.
We really rely on them for their assessment of when it is appropriate
and the right — and a science-based decision to do exactly that.  
   
Q  And do you know if there any particular metrics that they use for
those decisions?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I — there are, but I would really point you to the health and
medical experts to speak to that more effectively.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Just following up on the Afghanistan question. You mentioned ongoing
discussions. Given the level of crisis that’s happening there and how
it’s worsening, is there something more specific that you guys are
asking for? A deadline? Is the Pres- — will the President entertain
lifting some of the sanctions? Can you get a little more specific on
what — what you —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, what I was trying to get at is that one of the
challenges in Afghanistan — I think you can agree on this — is the
logistics of getting humanitarian assistance around to different
communities. And that’s one of the areas we’ve been discussing. So
that’s what I was getting at.  
   
We have provided an enormous amount of humanitarian assistance and we
will continue to. And that is something that other — others of our
partners are as well. But we also recognize the logistical challenges.
That’s something we’ve been discussing. So that’s what I was referring
to.  
   
Q  What about the sanctions? Would — is there any entertainment of
lifting some of the sanctions?  
   
MS. PSAKI: There hasn’t been a change to that. I would point you to the
State Department.  
   
Tom West obviously had some discussions with the Taliban, but our policy
on that has not changed that I’m aware of.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  The national debt is now over $29 trillion. That’s more than double a
decade ago when then-Vice President Biden went across the street and led
discussions with lawmakers at the Blair House.  
   
You said that he’s encouraged that Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell
are discussing this issue. But does he want any direct engagement
himself? Do you see any sort of scenario where the President tries to
strike some sort of grand bargain like President Obama and John Boehner
tried to attempt a decade ago?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think you’re combining a few things there. So, let me do my
best here. One, the debt limit is about paying the bills that are
already due. Right? And so, our pro- — our proposal — our preference is
always to do that through regular order and just raise the debt limit to
ensure that we are protecting the full faith and credit of the United
States government.  
   
As it relates to what the debt looks like, we agree. That’s why the
President was opposed to the $2 trillion in tax cuts for the highest
income that contributed to a portion of that. That’s why Build Back
Better is entirely paid for by asking corporations and the
highest-income Americans to pay more.  
   
So, the debt limit, I would say, is –- you know, the President is
encouraged by the conversations between Leader Schumer and Senator
McConnell. And what his hope is, is that we can –- through regular order
–- raise the debt limit, as has been done 81 times in the past, so we
don’t play around with the full faith and credit of the United States.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. There’s reporting on an alleged Chinese submarine in the
Taiwan Strait. Has the President been briefed on that? Is he concerned
about it potentially escalating into an unintended conflict?  
   
And just on a more broader level, is the administration preparing for
any kind of potential increased Chinese provocations, either in the
Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, anywhere, in case Beijing decides to
express their frustration ahead of the Democracy Summit?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, we always raise concerns we have
about any provocations or escalatory behavior that we see. I have not
seen this exact report, so let me check with our national security team
and see if there’s more that we can get back to all of you.  
   
Q  Just really quickly — just to double check some more reporting that
the President is pursuing or planning an in-person summit between the
U.S. and ASEAN leaders in January. Can you confirm that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not tracking that plan, but I will check and see. Where
was that supposed to be?  
   
Q  I think it was reported by some Asian media, including Japan
(inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI: Oh, got it. Okay, the ASEAN Summit. I will get you — and see
if there’s more details on that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. You’ve been clear, going back until at least
September, every time I ask, about the administration’s position on the
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. You’ve said numerous times that the
President doesn’t have a position.  
   
There’s new reporting in the Washington Post that in October the Deputy
Secretary of State was telling lawmakers to slow the bill down.  
   
So, is the administration on the same page? And why does it seem that
the Deputy Secretary of State was saying in private to lawmakers to slow
this down while in public the White House has been saying that the
President is neutral?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I wouldn’t say we’re neutral. I would say we share
Congress’s concern about forced labor in Xinjiang, and, in fact, have
taken a number of concrete measures, as you know, on our own, including
but not limited to visa restrictions, Global Magnitsky and other
financial sanctions, export controls, import restrictions, the release
of a business advisory, and rallying the G7 to commit action.  
   
So I would say, we are hardly neutral. We have strong concerns, serious
concerns. And we are absolutely not lobbying in any way against the
passage of this bill.  
   
There are negotiations and discussions between members of Congress. The
executive branch often offers Congress technical advice to make
legislation effective and implementable by the agencies responsible.  
   
Those are the conversations that are happening. But we absolutely
support and have been advocates for doing more to hold — to put in place
accountability here.  
   
Q  You laid out a number of executive steps the President has taken and
then also how he’s rallied the world, you know, at the G7, on this
issue. Does he want Congress to do anything additional?  
   
I mean, is he — he’s leading on the world stage; is he going to lead in
Congress, in terms of actually getting something in the law?  
   
MS. PSAKI: There’s negotiations he fully supports between members of
Congress, and he supports the objective of doing more here and — as is
evidenced by the fact that we have done a great deal. We’re offering
technical assistance.  
   
Again, we’re not lobbying against this bill in any way, shape, or form.
That’s a normal part of the process in order to make sure we —
legislation can be effective and implementable.  
   
That’s where the status of it is at this point in time.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: We got to — we got to wrap it up.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. I wanted to ask you about Mitch Landrieu’s team and the
infrastructure bill.  
   
  MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  Can you talk about what specific tasks that team is going to be
handling, what kind of staff he’s going to get, and who are they’re
already meeting with and working with?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, in terms of the staffing question, I think that’s still
being determined. But what his — what his role will be, I would say, is
akin to the role Gene Sperling has had in implementing the Bipartisan
Infrastructure piece of legislation.  
   
That includes engaging closely with local elected officials, mayors,
governors — fortunately, he’s got some experience doing exactly that.  
   
It includes working closely with agencies, and he has this group of
agency leaders he meets with on a regular basis to talk about what their
plans are for implementation.  
   
So, it includes overseeing all of those components to make sure this
piece of legislation is effectively implemented and is done so with
minimizing — eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.  
   
Q  Can you talk about -– you mentioned mayors and governors that he’s
worked with. A lot of this money, through grants, is going to end up
with those local officials who have to distribute it in whatever way
they’re going to.  
   
Are you at all — like how are you — you mentioned that he’s talking to
them, but are you doing anything to prepare those officials to be able
to get this money out the door and use it in the way that the President
wants it to be used and the law intends it to be?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Right. There was an executive order that laid out kind of the
six priorities of how this would be approached — investing the public
dollars efficiently, buying American, creating good-paying opportunities
for millions of Americans, investing public dollars equitably. That’s
the model that he is pursuing this through.  
   
There are a number of different agencies that are overseeing key
components of the implementation, as you know. Some of these programs
are grant making, some of them are programs that are already up and
running where we’re augmenting and adding more to it.  
   
You may have seen that there was an announcement from EPA yesterday —
right? — about a project that was going to get — be underway to knock
down and replace lead pipes. That’s a program that could happen on the
earlier end.  
   
We’ve talked a little bit about how taking steps to continue to address
congestion at ports is a top priority. That continues to be the case.  
   
There are some components of this — massive infrastructure projects —
that will require a longer-term approach because we want to do it
effectively and we want to do it right.  
   
He is overseeing all of that working in close coordination with agencies
and leaders, mayors, governors in these states to implement not just
short-term but also longer-term projects.  
   
Okay. We have a visitor today.  
   
Hello. Great meeting you, Rafael. From Univision. Thanks for joining us.
I like your backdrop.  
   
What can I answer for you today? Oh. Can we hear you? Uh oh. Are you
trying to talk?  
   
Q  Yes. I guess you can.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Oh, great. Okay. We had a — we had an audio issue last week.
Okay.  
   
Q  Hello, Secretary Psaki, and thank you for taking my question. I’ll
ask you something that is a cause of concern for our communities here in
Georgia.  
   
As you probably know, our state is only — we have only 51 percent of our
population fully vaccinated, and we even have counties where only 20
percent of our residents are vaccinated.  
   
Yesterday, Dr. Cameron Webb from the White House COVID-19 Response Team
told me that states like Georgia are potentially some of the most
vulnerable ones to the new variant.  
   
Nevertheless, our Governor, Brian Kemp, has been laser focused on
fighting federal vaccine requirements, calling them “unlawful” and
“unconstitutional.”  
   
And as cases of Omicron variant increase in the U.S. and with Georgia as
one of the most vulnerable states, I would like to know what is the
White House’s message to Governor Kemp?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say our message to Governor Kemp is: If you’re
not going to be a part of protecting the people of Georgia, ensuring
that they can take steps to save their own lives, save their neighbors’
lives and their children’s, then you should get out of the way, because
businesses are implementing steps across the country, including in
Georgia, to put in place vaccine or testing requirements, hospital
associations are, universities are, and people — and what we’ve seen as
one of the biggest barriers — and this is something we can do from the
federal government — is access.  
   
So, our hope is that we can continue to work in a nonpartisan way with
health officials in Georgia, as we do across the country, to incl- —
increase and expand access to not just testing but also vaccination.  
   
That’s something that we announced that we’re going to take additional
steps on yesterday, and we’re looking forward to building on.  
   
Thank you very much. Everybody, have a great weekend. I’m sorry. We’ve
got to wrap it up. More to come on Monday.  
   
Thanks, everyone.
