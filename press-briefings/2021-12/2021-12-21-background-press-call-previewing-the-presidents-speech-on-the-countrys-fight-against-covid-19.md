(December 20, 2021)

6:13 P.M. EST  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Hey, everybody.  Thanks for joining us on tonight’s call on
the President’s remarks tomorrow on the country’s fight against
COVID-19, including new steps the administration is taking to help
communities in need of assistance.  In just a few minutes, we will send
you guys an embargoed factsheet.  
   
Joining us on tonight’s briefing will be \[senior administration
official\].  As a reminder, this call will be embargoed until tomorrow
at 5:00 a.m. Eastern and attributable to “senior administration
officials.”   
   
Please raise your hand for the Q&A portion.  But with that, I will leave
it to you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right.  Hi, everyone. Thanks for
joining us tonight.  Tomorrow, the President will address the American
people about Omicron, as we head into the holidays.  
   
Early this month, he laid out a robust winter plan to get people to
maximum protection as we head into the winter months and (inaudible) a
new variant.  
   
Tomorrow’s address will build on that plan.  He’ll start by
acknowledging that this is an uncertain time and many Americans have
questions — questions about gathering with family, how to be safer, and
if we’re headed towards lockdown.  
   
Tomorrow, the President will answer all of those questions and lay out
new steps he’s taking to prepare for rising cases (inaudible) in the
weeks ahead.  
   
Before I go through those steps, I’ll start where the President will
start, which is: We know we have the tools to get through this wave.  As
you’ll hear the President say tomorrow, if you’re among the vast
majority of Americans who are fully vaccinated, and especially if you’ve
got your booster shot, you have a high degree of protection against
severe illness.  
   
Because Omicron spreads easily, we will see fully vaccinated people get
COVID-19, but vaccinated people who get COVID will likely have no
symptoms or mild symptoms.   
   
Because of that strong protection, the President will tell the American
people that if they are vaccinated and follow the process that we all
know well, especially masking while traveling, they should feel
comfortable celebrating Christmas and the holidays as they planned.  
   
We will also note that if you are unvaccinated, you are at high risk of
getting sick.  This variant is highly transmissible, and the
unvaccinated are 8 times more likely to be hospitalized and 14 times
more likely to die from COVID.  
   
Unfortunately, because we have about 40 million eligible yet still
unvaccinated adults, and because we know Omicron is more transmissible,
we are prepared for cases to rise.  
   
The steps the President will announce tomorrow will build on the Winter
Plan he laid out a few weeks ago.  These steps fall into three main
categories: First, increasing support for hospitals.  Second, increasing
access to free testing.  And third, expanding capacity to get shots in
arms.  
   
The first, on increasing support for hospitals: The President will
announce several steps to ensure states and hospitals around the country
have the personnel, the beds, and the supplies they need as they battle
rising Omicron cases among the unvaccinated.  
   
The President is directing Secretary Austin to mobilize 1,000 members of
our military — these are doctors, nurses, medics, and other military
medical personnel — to deploy overburdened hospitals in January and
February.   
   
These doctors and nurses and others will be ready to deploy to
neighboring hospitals that need them.  God willing, we will not need all
of these servicemen and women, but if we do, they are ready and they are
mobilized.  
   
Second, we’re also expanding hospital capacity.  We have already built
out two new medical surge facilities in Louisiana, added about 30 beds
for COVID patients in Baltimore, and expanded ICUs and emergency
departments in California.  
   
The President has asked the FEMA Administrator to activate the National
Response Coordination Center and to deploy FEMA planners to assess
hospital needs and start to expand that capacity now.  Additionally, we
will pre-position critical supplies and materials needed to shorten
timelines to get more hospital beds online and keep staff safe.  We have
hundreds of millions of high-quality masks, billions of gloves,
thousands of ventilators.  We’ve prepositioned these supplies in
strategic locations across the U.S. so that if a hospital runs out, we
can get those supplies to states that need them immediately.

Next, we’re expanding access to testing.  Since January, the President
has taken significant actions to increase testing.  This summer, we used
the Defense Production Act to increase testing capacity, and we will
continue to use the DPA.   
   
We’ve invested $3 billion to expand the number of at-home tests.  There
are now 20,000 free testing sites across the United States.  We made
sure the insurance — private insurance covers — all insurance covers PCR
testing and will also cover at-home testing in the new year.  We’re
sending out 50 million tests to help people without private
insurance.   
   
And tomorrow’s steps build on that progress.  The President will
announce that the federal government will set up new federal testing
sites around the country.  The first of these will be set up in New York
City before Christmas.  And the President will announce that the
administration will purchase half a billion at-home rapid tests this
winter to be distributed for free to Americans that want them.   
   
The initial delivery of these tests from the manufacturer will be in
January, and we will be setting up a website where Americans can go to
get at-home tests delivered to their home for free.   
   
Testing in the country is a lot better than it was, but there’s more to
do and we’re taking action now.   
   
Finally, we’re expanding capacity to get shots in arms.  FEMA is
standing up new pop-up vaccination clinics.  We’re deploying hundreds of
additional federal vaccinators who will help add thousands of
appointments each week.  And pharmacies nationwide are adding
appointments and capacity across their networks.   
   
So, before I close, I’ll just say the bottom line for the American
people is this: We should take Omicron seriously, but this is a cause
for concern not a cause for panic.  We have the tools, we have the
knowledge, we have the planning to get through this.   
   
If you’re fully vaccinated and especially if you got your booster shot,
you are highly protected.  So that’s what (inaudible) President will go
through tomorrow.   
   
And with that, we can take questions.  
   
 MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Thank you.  And I promise we’ll have that
factsheet to you all soon.

First question, let’s go to Joyce Frieden at Medpage Today.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  You talked a lot about what the
President is doing to increase testing.  What about the fact that tests
are now very hard to come by in commercial pharmacies in some areas?  Is
there anything being done to increase distribution?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Joyce.  First, I’d start with
just reminding us of where we’ve come from.  We now have 20,000 free
testing sites.  We’ve used the DPA, including steps in the past two
weeks, to help increase the number of tests — both PCR and at-home tests
— that are available.  We’ve spent $3 billion, which helps us quadruple
the number of at-home tests that are available to Americans as we close
out this year.  And obviously, we’ve done the insurance coverage.   
   
But we are doing more.  And I’d say the biggest thing we’re doing, to
get to your point, is buying half a billion tests — at-home tests — to
be able to give to the American people for free.   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, next question.  Let’s go to Shannon Pettypiece.  
   
Q    Hi.  I was wondering: Could you talk a little bit more about how
this at-home testing purchase is going to work?  So, for example, like
how many tests will be available starting in January?  Where can people
go to get those free tests?   
   
And how are you recommending people use the test?  Should they only be
used if they’ve had exposure to someone who they think is infected? 
Should they just be using it if they’re going to be going out to dinner
with friends?  What’s — so a little bit more of how this will work and,
sort of, what the guidance is for people right now on testing.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Shannon.  So, on your first
part, the first delivery of these tests will — from manufacturers — will
arrive in January.  We’re setting up a free and easy system to get those
tests out to Americans, including the website I mentioned.  We’re
actively working to finalize those distribution mechanisms, and we’ll
share more details in the weeks ahead on that.   
   
And then on your second question, I’d say — how they’re used — we,
obviously, continue to follow CDC guidance for the use of all tests,
including the rapid at-home test.  So, I think that’s what we would
encourage Americans to do.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Next questions.  Let’s go to David Lim at
Politico.  You’re unmuted.  
   
All right, we’ll try to come back to you.  Let’s go to Spencer Kimball
at CNBC.  
   
Q    Hi, can you hear me?  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Yep.   
   
Q    Okay.  Yeah, my question is also about the at-home testing.  What
is the administration’s guidance for people who are traveling right
now?  It’s December 20th, so if somebody wants to get tested to be safe
before flying home to visit family, or if somebody is showing symptoms
and they can’t find an at-home test at a pharmacy, or if the lines are
too long at clinics or clinics are at capacity, what are they supposed
to do?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Thanks, Spencer.  Obviously,
if they have symptoms, they should make sure they’re testing and not,
you know, traveling around with a lot of — a lot of (inaudible) and
exposing people if they have symptoms.  I think what — what we’ve done —
and I mentioned all of the testing actions we have already taken.  That
includes quadrupling the at-home test and making sure insurance can
cover PCR testing.   
   
We do have 20,000 free testing sites around the country.  And we’ve
worked with Google to make sure that people can actually go into a
Google search engine, search “free COVID test near me” — “free COVID
test near me” — to find all the sites near them.  So if their
neighborhood one doesn’t have an appointment for them, this will allow
them to find some that might be still close by that they’re not aware
of.   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  We’re going to try to go back to David.  
   
Q    Can you hear me now?  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Yep.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  
   
Q    Hi.  Okay.  I realize that the supply of at-home tests is limited
for the time being, but I wanted to ask about other testing
modalities.   
   
In terms of PCR testing and laboratory turnaround times, is the
President going to address what appears to be an extension of the time
between when people take tests and when laboratories are going to be
able to return those test results in the coming days to weeks?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, David.  Look, we continually
work with labs across the country.  We’ve built out the PCR capacity
tremendously since the beginning of the administration.  We continue to
work with them to make sure they have all the supplies they need and can
expand their network of testing, and we’ll continue to do that.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Next question.  Let’s go to Cheyenne Haslett at ABC.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you.  I wonder: Is there a plan for the government to
track the results from these 500 million rapid test kits that are sent
out to Americans, given that right now it’s a little bit of a blind spot
with how many people are using the at-home tests and that that doesn’t
get reported to public health officials for contact tracing and
whatnot?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Cheyenne.  Look, we do not plan
to track the results of Americans on these tests.  What we would ask
Americans, as we have for a while, is: If you test positive, you should
consult with your doctor and local public health departments. 

MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Hopefully some other questions. 

Sheryl Stolberg, New York Times. 

Q    Hi, thanks for doing this call.  I have a couple of questions about
testing also, and one about FEMA. 

The President recently announced that people would be able to file for
reimbursement for at-home tests — those who have insurance would be able
to do that.  So, what happens to that plan?

Separately, you said that there would be — you are going to set up new
federal testing sites and there will be one in New York before
Christmas.  Can you talk a little bit more about how many testing sites
you envision and where they’re going to be?

And finally, with respect to FEMA, do you have an eye on where you might
expand hospital capacity next?  You said that you’ve expanded in
Baltimore and also in New Orleans, and I’m wondering, you know, where
else is there need and what’s the next step there.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, Sheryl.  Okay, I’m going to
try to get — make sure I get these right.

So, I think your first one was on reimbursement at home for folks’
private insurance: That stands.  That action will be effective by
mid-January, and that will still allow Americans to buy and get
reimbursed through private insurance for their tests.  That is not in
lieu of the $500 million; that’s in addition to.

So, all of these are additive steps just to make it easier and more
affordable for Americans to get these at-home tests that we know are
very popular. 

Your second question, I think, was on New York City and the testing
sites.  We will actually have several of those up in –the first several
open in New York City before the Christmas holidays. 

And we’re going to continue to add sites based on where states and
communities have capacity constraints and where the state and local
public health officials request our assistance. 

So, we’ll continue to do that, you know, over the coming weeks into
January and February as needed. 

And then you asked about expanding hospital capacity.  You know, I think
the thing that we’re doing here and that FEMA is doing is deploying
planners.  And we’ve been working with people over the course of the
Delta surge, obviously, deploying planners to talk to every state to
make sure that they have plans in sight and then start to activate those
plans now and actually start to build out the hospital beds. 

I still have to mention one other thing related to hospital beds, which
is we’re also deploying hundreds of ambulances and EMS crews to help
transport patients from overburdened hospitals where you might not be
able to get a bed — get a bed to hospitals nearby that might have open
beds. 

So, we’re really trying to think creatively about how we relieve some of
the burden on our hospitals. 

MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  We have time for a few more questions.  Let’s go
to Chris Megerian at the Los Angeles Times. 

Q    Hi, everybody.  I just wanted to clarify one thing about the new
website.  Did you say this new website was not going to be available for
people to order additional free tests until January?  And why not until
then? 

And lastly, just to clarify, this $500 million is in addition to the $50
million that’s already being distributed to clinics as announced in the
Winter Plan? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Chris.  So, correct, the
website will be in January.  It will be in January because that’s when
we will have the tests available to be sent to Americans, and those will
be paired.  And this is in addition to your mentioning of the $50
million that was already announced.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Andrew Restuccia at Wall Street Journal.  
   
Q    Thanks.  You mentioned the DPA and how you might continue to use
it.  Can you clarify, you know, in what capacity you’d continue to use
the DPA and for what purpose?   
   
And then, also, on the distribution of the 500 million at-home tests,
can people go on the website and request more than one test?  Or is it
one per customer?  And would they be delivered by mail or will they need
to be picked up somewhere?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Andrew.  So, first, to your
first question on the DPA, we’ve used the DPA over the course of the
summer and, most recently, last week to increase testing capacity.  One
example: Just in the past two weeks, we used the DPA to ensure that we
had two testing manufacturers who needed raw materials and specialized
equipment to produce more tests.  And so, we used the DPA to ensure they
got the raw materials and they got that equipment and could rapidly
expand.  Those are both at-home tests — or sorry, over-the-counter tests
and point-of-care tests.   
   
And then the $3 billion award that we talked — that I talked about
earlier that we did in September, we’re also leveraging the DPA and
helped us mobilize industry and brought additional — that additional
testing capacity that I mentioned earlier.  
   
On, I think, your second question on the at-home test, we’re working
through the specifics of how many tests would be available to each
American household.  We’ll have those details in the coming weeks.  And
they will be delivered by the mail.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, last question.  Let’s go to Josh Wingrove at
Bloomberg.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks so much for doing this.  Can you just say, in the
deliberation process that led to this, did you consider whether or not
to ask Americans to stay home or to do more to limit what — their
interactions, given the rise of this?  And if so, why didn’t you decide
to do that?  Is it that, you know, we want to put incentives in place
for the vaccinated?   
   
You know, this seems like the strategy is, more or less, cope with the
cases that we’re going to see rather than necessarily head off or try to
head off any new ones.  And I’m just hoping you can walk us through
philosophically where you’re at, at that.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Josh.  You know,  
we have the tools, more than ever in this pandemic, that there’s no need
to lock down our schools and our economy.  And you’ll hear that from the
President tomorrow.  You know, our vaccines work against Omicron,
especially if you’re boosted.  
   
As I said, we have 90,000 sites.  It’s free, it’s easy, it’s convenient
to get vaccinated.  We are increasing.  We have significantly increased
testing capacity.  And today, we’re announcing really big — or tomorrow,
we’re announcing really big actions, including 500 million tests to be
bought by the U.S. government and handed to Americans for free, and the
creation of new federal testing sites.   
   
We already have strong masking guidance in place.  We’re asking
Americans to follow that masking guidance.  And we’ve extended, as you
know, the masking requirement on plans through early in the new year.   
   
And, you know, we’re doing surge — these surge teams, which we’ve been
doing throughout.  And the President is now directing 1,000 additional
troops, hundreds of ambulances, and expanding hospital beds.  
   
So, we’re not complacent here.  We are acting strongly to ensure that we
get Americans the most protection we have.  And we’re prepared for what
we think will be an increase in unvaccinated hospitalizations in the
coming months.  And we’re going to be prepared for that, even as I think
Americans who are fully vaccinated and who are following the precautions
that we all know well can enjoy their holiday — can and should enjoy
their holiday.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, well, thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  And thank you, everybody, for joining.   
   
As a reminder, I’ll send a factsheet.  And this is embargoed until
tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern and attributable to “senior
administration officials.”  Thanks again.
