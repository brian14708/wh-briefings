12:55 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just have one thing at the top, and then I’ll turn
it over to the Admiral.  
   
Starting today, the President will kick off his three-day swing through
Pennsylvania.  As you know, we’re on our way to his hometown of
Scranton, where he will deliver remarks at a campaign event.  I’ll refer
you to the campaign for more details on the event.  
   
Tomorrow, the President will travel to Pittsburgh, where he will
participate in two campaign events.  I’ll refer you to the campaign for
more details.  
   
President Biden is investing in Pennsylvania, and it’s working.  The
unemployment rate in the state is near a record low of 3.4 percent, down
from 7.4 percent when he took office.   
   
Four hundred and eighty thousand applications have been filed to start
new businesses.  That’s up 36 percent.   
   
He invested $16 billion in roads, bridges, public transit, replacing
lead pipes, and other infrastructure.  
   
Thanks to the President — to the President’s Inflation Reduction Act,
2.9 million seniors are saving money on Medicare from the 35 bucks cap
of insulin to free vaccines to lower drug prices.  And 420,000
Pennsylvanians have health insurance — health — health insurance through
the Affordable Care Act.  
   
On Thursday, the President will travel to Philadelphia for campaign
events, as I mentioned.  The President will remain focused on the
historic economic progress from the last three years.  And this week,
you’ll hear directly from him in stops across the state on how his
administration is doing exactly that.  
   
With that, as you can see, the Admiral is here to take any questions you
may have on the Middle East and anything else.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Karine.  I can just go right into questions.  
   
Q    As Israel — as Israel considers whether to attack Iran, what advice
has the U.S. given the Israelis?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, again, these are going to be Israeli decisions to make
and for them to speak to one way or the other.   
   
In the President’s call with the Prime Minister on Saturday night, he
lauded the commendable effort to successfully knock down the vast, vast
majority of missiles and drones that Iran threw at them.  And — and,
again, our view was it was an incredible success, and that success alone
sends a lot of strong messages to Iran and to our partners in the
region, as well as to Israel, about how strong they are and how — how
utterly Iran failed.  
   
The President does not want to see — and he said this before: He does
not want to see a war with Iran.  Don’t want to see the conflict widen
or deepen.  
   
Q    John, yesterday, I believe you said that you would — that the
President would not support a standalone bill.  We see that Speaker
Johnson is suggesting four standalone bills, I believe.  Would you all
be opposed to a series of standalone bills?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We — we do not — we don’t support a standalone bill that
only funds Israel, because Ukraine needs munitions too.  
   
Now, look, I think we still have to see the Speaker’s proposal in more
detail.  The important thing is that the House moves this week to help
us get security assistance for Israel, Ukraine, and also for the
Indo-Pacific.  They need to move this week.   
   
And as for the details, we’ll wait and see what the Speaker comes up
with.  
   
Q    So, you’re okay with four bills?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, we’re going to wait and pass judgment after we’ve had
a chance to take a look closer at the Speaker’s proposal.  
   
The important thing is that our allies, like Ukraine and Israel, who are
under the gun — literally, under the gun — get the security assistance
they need as quickly as possible.  So, we want them to move this week.  
   
Q    And, right now, you’re not sure of the details of the bills — if
they’re something the White House can support at this point?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think we just need to see more right now than we do — I
think we need to see more than we have right now to be able to — it does
appear, at first blush, that the Speaker’s proposals will, in fact, help
us get aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, and needed resources to the
Indo-Pacific for a wide range of contingency — contingencies there.  At
first blush, it looks like that.  We just want to get more detail.  
   
Q    So, whether it’s all together or separate is not a deal-breaker per
se?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, at first blush, it looks like the Speaker’s proposal
does cover those immediate needs, and they are immediate needs, but
we’re waiting to get a little bit more detail before we — we say one way
or the other.  
   
Q    John, the Speaker said that it would include loans to Ukraine and
other, I think, accountability measures that the White House before has
said that, you know, would complicate the — the distribution of aid.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, yeah.  
   
Q    Have you had a chance to evaluate those at all?  And — and can you
talk about what the President said to the Speaker in their phone
conversation yesterday?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Same answer as I gave before.  I think, again, it appears at
first blush that these proposals do get the necessary security
assistance to Ukraine and Israel at a critical time right now.  We want
to learn a little bit more.   
   
I won’t go into more detail about the conversation with the Speaker.  I
think Karine has already talked to you guys about that.  And I’ll leave
it at that.   
   
Except that — the only thing I would say is that the President stressed
very strongly that we’ve got to move this national security supplemental
funding as quickly as possible.  We need to see the House move this
week.  
   
Q    And I know —  
   
Q    Is — is the President watching or being briefed on former President
Trump’s trial in Manhattan?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President is going to Pennsylvania today, and he’s
going to do a three-stop tour.  He’s going to focus on how he’s
continuing to help the American people.  And you’ll hear directly from
him today.  That’s his focus.  His focus is on the American people.  
   
I don’t have anything else.  
   
Q    It’s been 11 days since the World Central Kitchen’s — the
investigation into the World Central Kitchen strike was released.  Why
is the U.S. review of that report taking so long?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re — we’re still taking a look at that.  I don’t think
we’ve — haven’t come to any conclusions one way or another about it.  I
think you can expect we want to — want to do this in a thoughtful way.  
   
Q    I heard what you said earlier that, you know, Israel’s response
will be its own.  But has Israel told the U.S. what it’s planning to do
at this point?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I will refer you to the Israelis to speak to their
decision-making process.  That’s really for them to speak to, not us.  
   
Q    Going back to Ukraine for a second, John.  What’s the situation on
the ground?  How under stress is the Ukrainian military?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s incredible the — the stress that they’re under,
particularly in the Donbas area where the Russians continue to push west
out of Avdiivka.  They keep making — it’s not a lot of progress every
day, but it’s a little bit of progress every day.  They’re pushing back
against the deeper defensive lines of the Ukrainians.   
   
And it’s not just in the east.  There is some movement down in the south
as well.  But just as critically, the se- — you know, Saturday night
when we were watching 300 missiles and drones getting launched from Iran
into Israeli, Mr. Putin was still firing those same Iranian drones and
missiles into Ukraine at various sites, knocking out their energy
infrastructure, going after the defense industrial base.   
   
So, it’s a very active scene in Ukraine and the need is acute there as
well, which is why we said earlier we wouldn’t support a standalone
Israel bill that — because it wouldn’t account for what Ukraine needs.  
   
Now, again, the Speaker has put forward a proposal that would factor in
Ukraine, so we’ll have to see what that looks like.  
   
Q    Yesterday, Ukraine’s president gave an interview to PBS News in
which he wondered why, essentially, allies could not shoot down missiles
over Ukraine — similar he gave the example to Iran — and he raised that
in the interview.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  And I mentioned this yesterday, I think.  I mean, it’s a
different fight altogether.  The President has been very clear that
there won’t be U.S. boots on the ground.  The United States will not get
involved in a combat role in the war in Ukraine.  It’s a different
fight.  It’s a different —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s a different — we — we have long said we’re not going to
be involved in a combat role in Ukraine.  The President has been very —
very, very consistent on that.  
   
Q    Is it different just because Russia has nukes?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s — we’ve been very consistent on that.  It’s a different
fight altogether, a different set of circumstances.  
   
Q    Because of the nuclear issue or because of like, different —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Different set of circumstances.  
   
Q    Any update on the Rafah meeting?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No update on the meeting to speak to today, Steve.  We’re
still hoping to have another round.   
   
I will add that after the virtual meeting, there were — I’m sorry —
there were technical talks at a lower level on the staff.  Those talks
continued between the Israelis and the United States.  And we’re hoping
to get another meeting on — for Rafah here in coming days.  But I don’t
have anything on the schedule.  
   
Q    Has there been any communications with Iran since the attack that
happened over the weekend —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Not that I’m aware of.  
   
Q    — through the — through those indirect channels?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Not that I’m aware of.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay?  
   
Q    What was the — oh, sorry.  Last thing.  What was the President’s
reaction to the protests about Gaza yesterday that shut down major
thoroughfares in big cities?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I haven’t had a chance to speak to the President about his
personal reaction to — to that.  You know, and I think Karine has
already talked very much about the protest activity.  And I’ll — I’ll
leave it to her.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    Karine, will the President talk about the U.S. Steel-Nippon merger
at all when he’s in Pennsylvania?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I don’t have anything to share about that. 
But obviously, the President’s commitment to steel workers continues and
stand.  He’s a union guy.  But I don’t have anything to share about
tomorrow’s event.  
   
We’ll certainly have more later today.  We’ll have a press call.  So, I
would urge you and your colleagues to certainly join the press call
later today.  
   
Q    Do you know when the last time was the President spent the night in
his hometown?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The last time he’s been to Scranton?  
   
Q    For the night.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The night?  Oh, that’s a good question.  I do not
know.  I can find out for you.  
   
Q    To what extent is this sort of a homecoming for him going back to
his hometown?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think you’ll hear directly from the President.  This
is going to be — this is a homecoming for sure.  I had an opportunity to
talk to him about it this morning.  
   
Going back to Scranton is always — it always feels good to go see where
he spent a lot of his childhood.  And so, you all will be able to see
that directly.  
   
I got to be careful because it is a — that portion is a campaign
portion.  So, I would — we’ll certainly refer you to the campaign.  But
it al- — always feels good to be back in S- — Pennsylvania.  Always
feels good to be back to Scranton for this President.  
   
Q    Inflation has been a stubborn concern for a lot of Americans.  You
know, do — does the President think that his tax plans will, you know,
help alleviate some of those concerns by, you know, pulling more taxes
from the — from the wealthy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the President’s tax cuts for working families and
the middle class are fully paid for by making billionaires and big
corporation pay for their share — fair share.  His tax plan would lower
costs for families with lower taxes, lower healthcare costs, and lower
utility bills.  That’s the President’s focus.   
   
And unfortunately, what we’re seeing from congressional Republicans,
they want to give big tax breaks for mil- — billionaires and — and
corporations.  They see a total opposite way of giving Americans
breathing room.  They are not doing that, and we’re trying to do that.  
   
Q    So, I guess what I’m trying to say is: Americans are concerned
about inflation.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    The President wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and
corporations.  How is that addressing their concerns about the
economy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think our focus when it comes to the economy — we
say this all the time — is building an economy from the bottom up,
middle out and making sure that we’re continuing to lower costs.  That’s
the thing — right? — that is the thing that Americans care about when we
talk about the economy: How do we lower costs?   
   
And this is something that the President has continued to do over the
last three years — right? — whether it’s healthcare from — you know,
beating Big Pharma; whether it’s doing everything that we can to lower
the cost at the pump — at the gas pumps because of Ukraine, because of
COVID.  And so, he’s going to stay really focused on that.  You hear us
talk about junk fees.  And so, look, that’s going to be his focus, is
continuing to do that.   
   
I do want to say, I think we had confirmed that the President spoke to
Speaker Johnson, and Speaker Johnson shared the plan with him. 
Obviously, we’re going to look at the details of — of that plan.  But
you heard from the Admiral, you heard from National Security Council,
you heard from the President over the weekend how important it is to
move forward with that — that — for getting aid to Ukraine and,
obviously —  
   
Q    Was it accurate that — was it accurate that Speaker Johnson
initiated the call?  I believe he told Fox News he called the
President.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, I can confirm that.  I just don’t want to go into
details of the — of the call.  And the Speaker did share the plan with
the President.  
   
Q    Splitting it in four pieces seems kind of risky, right?  I mean —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, want to be super mindful.  We’re going to see
the details of — of what he is planning.  But we’ve been really clear:
We want to see all of the parts that the President has talked about,
getting that really important funding for Ukraine, Israel, Indo-Pacific,
obviously that humanitarian aid that’s needed right now — dire situation
in Gaza, as we talked about.  We do not want to see a standalone.  We
want to see all of these components move forward.   
   
But we want to be super mindful here.  We’re going to see the details —
what’s — what’s in writing — the details of the — of the plan.  But,
obviously, we want to see what — what the Speaker has to share.  
   
Q    Karine, a — a second Republican — House Republican endorsed the
motion to vacate against Speaker Johnson over the Ukraine funding.  If
the Speaker does push forward with this, you know, effort to get the
Ukraine aid, would the President recommend Democrats come to his aid if
there’s a challenge to his leadership?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, again, as you know, Justin, I get this question
often, and — and we’ve been very consistent.  We don’t get involved when
it comes to congressional leadership, how they choose their leadership. 
That is something for Congress to decide on.   
   
And, obviously, you know, Leader — Leader Jeffries, who is the
Democratic Leader in the House, that’s something for he and his caucus
to — to decide.  I just don’t want to get involved — we’ve been very —
or speak to it.  We’ve been very, very clear about that.  
   
I think we’re going to have to sit.  All right?   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks guys.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you so much.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re very welcome.
