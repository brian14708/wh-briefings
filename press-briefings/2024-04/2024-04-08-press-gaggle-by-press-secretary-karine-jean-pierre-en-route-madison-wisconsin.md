Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Madison, Wisconsin

12:25 P.M. EDT

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Here we go.  So, from day one, President Biden
vowed to fix the broken student loan system and make sure education was
a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.   
   
Today, we are heading to Madison, Wisconsin, where the President will
announce his new plans to cancel student debt.  If these plans are
finalized, more than 30 million people would stand to benefit from
student debt relief when combined with the steps we have already
taken.   
   
The Vice President, Second Gentleman, and Secretary Cardona are also
fanning out across the country to talk to Americans who have received
debt relief thanks to the Biden-Harris administration.  The President
will continue to use every tool to deliver as much relief as possible to
as many people as possible, no matter how many times Republican elected
officials try to stand in his way.   
   
Second, last night, the President, as you all know, called Coach Dawn
Staley from the University of South Carolina to congratulate her and the
team on their undefeated season and national championship.  Yesterday’s
game was fantastic and capped off a woman’s tournament that generated
record ratings.  
   
On behalf of the White House, we congratulate the University of South
Carolina and all the athletes who have accomplished so much for their
teams and their — and their sport.  It was really a March Madness to
remember.   
   
And finally to mark the eclipse, the White House released a video —
hopefully, you all got to see it before we took off this morning — on
social media with the President reminding people to wear protective
eyewear.  The President hopes that everyone enjoys the eclipse but hopes
they also play it safe and protect their eyes.   
   
With that, I am happy to take some of your question.  
   
Darlene.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Congress is back this week.  Apart from the national
security supplemental, money for Ukraine and Israel, is there any
legislation the President would want to see Congress send him before
they break again for recess in a couple of weeks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, thank you for the question.  I think it’s really
important.  You mentioned the national security supplemental, which we
all know passed in a bipartisan fashion, overwhelmingly, in the Senate,
79-29.  And now we want to see Speaker Johnson put that national
security supplemental on the floor.  We know it would get overwhelming
support.  We want to see that moving forward.   
   
We also want to see Congress move forward with the border security
negotiation that came out of the Senate.  It was done in a bipartisan
way.  The President, obviously, was involved in that.  And so, we know
that the last president, President Trump, told Republicans to reject
that proposal and not put the — not put majority of Americans first.

A majority of Americans want to see that proposal move forward or — not
even the proposal — want us to take action on the im- — immigration
system, which has been broken for decades.  And we want to see that
proposal move forward because we believe that proposal, if it were to
move forward, it got to the President’s desk, and he were to sign it, it
would be not just the toughest but also the fairest — getting support
from U.S. Chamber of Commerce and also the Border control — Patrol
folks.   
   
In addition, there is — the Senate should pass the bipartisan tax deal
passed by the House, which would expand the Child Tax Credit for
millions of families and support construction of hundreds of thousands
of affordable homes.   
   
Congress should extend funding for the Affordability \[Affordable\]
Connectivity Program — you heard us talk about that recently — which has
helped over 23 million households save 30 to 75 bucks each month on
their monthly Internet bills.  
   
And then, finally, Congress should pass the bipartisan bill to
reauthorize and reform Section 702, which provides irreplaceable
information on almost every threat that the American people expect their
government to find and stop: terrorist plots, illicit fentanyl,
ransomware and other cyberattacks, Russian — Russian war crimes, and
many, many more.   
   
So, there’s a lot for Congress to do, and we hope that they take — they
take action.   
   
Q    Sec- — second, will the President be able to see any of the solar
eclipse —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —  
   
Q    — today?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — I — I don’t have any information on that to share
with you.  Obviously, as I stated at the top, the President wants to
make sure — it’s exciting time.  We know millions of Americans are
excited about the — the solar eclipse that’s going to happen today.  We
want to make sure that they protect their eyes, they have the protective
eyewear.  I just don’t have anything to share on — on — right now, at
this moment, on — on the President.  
   
Q    On Section 702, does the White House have a contingency plan if
Congress allows this to lapse?  And then what would be — you mentioned a
few of the risks, but what are some of the ramifications if this
provision expires?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I — I don’t want to get ahead of the most
important point — right? — the provision underpinning the government’s
most critical foreign intelligence tool, Section 702, is set to expire
on April 19th and — along with other provisions.  And we’re — and we’re
laser-focused on working with the Hill to prevent that from happening. 
And so, that’s our focus.  That’s what we’re going to do.  
   
And — and I — I think I’ve mentioned this already about what it — what —
what Section \[7\]02 provides: irreplaceable information on almost every
threat that the American people ex- — expect their government to find
and stop.  And so, we urge Congress to — to reauthorize it now.   
   
The bipartisan bill that the House will take up this week includes some
of the most extensive reform we’ve ever seen to protect the privacy of
Americans and to strengthen guardrails to ensure accountability and
transparency in how this critical authority is used.  
   
The administration strongly, strongly supports the reauthoration —
reauthorization and the of — and reform bill.  And so, don’t want to get
into hypotheticals from here.  We are going to do everything that we can
to get this done.   
   
Obviously, the deadline for this is April 19th.  
   
Q    Do you have an update on the Gaza hostage talks in Cairo?  And I
think Jake is meeting with some hostage families today.    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything on the Jake meeting with
hostage families.  I would certainly refer you to the National Security
Council.   
   
As you know, there were reportings on the Di- — Director Burns being in
Cairo over the weekend.  Certainly can confirm that for all of you.  
   
I’m not going to get into details of those talks.  As you know, they’re
incredibly sensitive.  And — and we’re doing everything — this
administration is doing everything possible to broker a deal that
secures the release of all hostages and leads to an immediate
ceasefire.  And there is no — no higher priority for us at this time.  
   
Q    And — and Israel’s withdrawal from parts of Gaza, what do you make
of that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m just not going to get into the — Israel’s —
Israel government op- — operations — military operations.  I’m just not
going to get into.  I let them speak to it for themselves.  
   
Go ahead, Mario.  
   
Q    Yes, Jamie Dimon today, Morgan Chase’s CEO, said that — suggested
that the LNG exports were political, the ban was — were — was
political.  Does the administration have any response to that assertion
at all?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, we want to be really clear about the facts here.
 And the facts are: We announced a temporary pause on pending additional
approvals of LNG report \[export\] licenses to evaluate the economic and
climate impacts on consumers and communities.  I’ve mentioned this
before — very recently, last week at the podium.  
   
Meanwhile, record domestic oil and gas production is helping meet our
immediate needs while we make the historic investment needed to
transition to a clean energy economy.   
   
The President has been very clear that climate crisis — that the climate
is indeed — climate change is a crisis.  He’s going to do everything
that he can to deal with this.  He’s — he’s been the most — yeah, he’s
taken the most progressive, ambitious actions on dealing with climate
change.  And we have to deal with the facts.  That’s what we have to
deal with: the facts.  
   
Q    On the student debt plan — the second student debt plan.  The — the
earnings-to-borrow ratio that’s being applied to for-profit universities
— if you took that ratio, it would also apply to almost 80 percent of
undergraduate degrees, some HBCUs.  Why isn’t that being applied
evenly?  It looks like you’re targeting the for-profit universities.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Just a couple of things.  Obviously, the Department of
Education is going to be really squarely focused on this, but I’ll say a
couple of things.   
   
We’re committed to holding colleges accountable when they leave students
with mountains of debt and without good job prospects.  That’s our
commitment.  
   
And so, we’ll be issuing proposed rules on the policies announced today
in the coming months.  So, we’ll be able to address those specific
questions in the coming months.  But obviously, the Department of
Education is — is monitoring all of this as well.  
   
Q    And does the White House have any response to what Senator
Fetterman said this weekend about squatting?  He took a pretty firm
stance against that.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, I — you know, I’m always very careful on
what — what congressional — congressional members say.  You know, I’m
going to obviously let — let the senator speak for himself.   
   
As I said before — I also spoke to this last week at the podium — it is
critical that communities take action to address this issue in a way
that works best for them.  While this is a local issue, it is important
that we protect the rights of both property owners and also renters.  
   
But I also want to be clear here: Anyone found guilty of a crime should
be held accountable.  And that is something that we’ve been consistent
about from here.   
   
The bottom line is this: Everyone in every community in this country
wants the same thing.  They want their families to be safe, and we want
to see that.  
   
Q    Just one follow-up on that.  Democrats are talking about a bill
that would eliminate — would ban back- — criminal background checks for
renters.  That would include convictions for squatting.  Does the
administration support that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I haven’t seen that particular legislation — what
Democrats are working on — so, I want to be super mindful and not
comment on that.  Obviously, I need to check in with our Office of Leg
Affairs. 

But we’ve been very clear: Understanding this is a local issue, local
government needs to address this, I don’t want to get ahead of — get
ahead of where we might be on that. 

Q    Karine, Steve asked about the withdrawal of troops in southern
Gaza.  I just want to ask, is that something that the President and
Netanyahu talked about last week?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything beyond the readout that we
all shared with you.   
   
Obviously, the purpose of that call last week was about protecting
humanitarian aids who are in Gaza.  That was the purpose of that call. 
And we have also said that Rafah operations was not part of that.  So,
it was really focusing on that, what — what is — you know, what is
Israel doing to protect humanitarian aid — aid workers, but also, six
innocent civilians in Gaza, and that was the focus of the call.   
   
It was a 30-minute call.  It was very direct.  And so, don’t have
anything beyond what we’ve read out to all of you.

Q    On Ukraine.  I know you’ve been asked similar things.  But if — if
the Democrats were to support Speaker Johnson, if you were to bring that
to the floor, is that something — would you be opposed to Democrats kind
of helping out Johnson there?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, that is — and you’re talking about as it relates
to the — the national security —

Q    Yes.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — supplemental?  Look, we’ve been always very clear,
Democrat — you know, Leader — Leader Jeffries — he’s the Leader.  He —
he will — he will determine what’s right for his demo- — for his caucus
— obviously, the Democratic Caucus.  We’re not going to step into that. 
We’ll let them figure out how they want to move forward. 

Look, we’ve been very clear, and I said this at the top, I think even in
my — in the first question that I got from Darlene: The national
security supplemental — if we want to help Ukraine, if we want to keep
our commitment to Ukraine as they are fighting for their freedom — the
brave people of Ukraine fighting for their freedom, we got to get that
national security supplemental done.  That is what is going to — we got
to do our part.  We have to do our part.  And what we have seen in the
past several weeks, several months is Ukraine is losing ground in the
battlefield.  And that’s because of congressional inaction. 

And so, we have to continue our support, as we’ve been supporting them
for almost — more than two years now.  And they are fighting for their
freedom, their democracy against Mr.  Putin’s aggression. 

And so, look, we know what happens if we do not deal with tyranny, if we
not — if we do not stop at a dictator.  We know how history has played
out in the past.  And so, this is critical.  This is important. 

If that — if Speaker Johnson were to put that supp- — national security
supplemental on the — on the floor, we know that it would get
overwhelming support.  But as it rel- — as it relates to Democrats and
how they’re going to move forward, I would have to leave it to Leaders
Sc- — Leader Jeffries.

Q    Just — just one more quick one on Trump and abortion.  I know the
campaign put something out, but just on the policy position that he’s
taking, any response?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I do.  So, obviously, don’t want to comment on
2024 election.  Going to be really mindful. 

But I have a couple of things that I want to say here.  So, the only
reason that — that extreme abortion bans are now in effect all over the
country is because of the judges the previous President and Senate
Republicans put in the courts.  The only reason that women are being
denied lifesaving and even unrelated procedures and turned away from
emergency rooms as a result of those bans is because of the judges the
previous President and Senate Republicans have put in the courts.

The only reason that Republicans’ officials are able to take radical
actions like banning IVF and criminalizing doctors for providing care is
because of the judges the previous President and Senate Republicans put
in the court.

When it comes to the fundamental freedoms at stake and the devastating
healthcare effects that Republican officials’ extreme agenda mean for
more and more American women every day, we need to be clear-eyed here. 

Just look at the extreme law about to go into effect in Florida, as one
in three women live in states with bans — with bans. 

Just look at the budget.  Look at the budget 80 percent of House
Republicans put out that bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or
incest. 

The President is absolutely clear, his administration — the Biden-Harris
administration — has been very clear: We need to restore the protections
of Roe, and that’s what we’re going to continue to fight for.

Q    Karine, the Vatican, today, put out a new document that states
gender-affirming operations risk, quote, “threatening the unique dignity
the person has received from the moment of conception,” and also
denounces attempts to obscure, quote, “the sexual difference between man
and woman.” 

Obviously, the President is a devout Catholic.  I’m wondering if he has
seen that document and if he has any comments on it. 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I — I’ll say this: So, we are pleased to see that
the document you just mentioned, Tyler, further the Vatican’s call to
ensure that LGBTQ+ are protected from violence and imprisonment around
the world.   
   
However, the President will continue to be an advocate for the rights,
safety, and dignity of the LGBTQ+ community, including transgender
people, here in the U.S. — and not just here in the U.S. but also around
the world.   
   
And I just don’t have anything else to add.  
   
Q    What about the — what about the more specific comments about gender
theory and — and transgender individuals?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m going to be really careful and — and the
President’s role to — to litigate internal church policy.  It’s not —
that’s not his role.  So, I’m going to be super careful there.   
   
But I can speak to the President’s stance, and he’s always been very
clear on the importance of protecting — or having protections for the
transgender community and the broader LGBTQ+ community.  And that’s been
very clear since day one of his administration.  
   
Q    And just one more on student debt.  Does — the President’s previous
attempts to cancel student debt have been struck down by the courts. 
What is the level of confidence within the administration about the
ability to — to go forward with the plan that he’s going to lay out in
more detail today?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we know that Republicans’ officials,
obviously, in the past, have done everything that they can to oppose the
President’s — the President’s effort to give Americans — millions of
Americans a little breathing room.   
   
So, while we can’t prevent them from — from filing lawsuits against this
plan, the President will never stop fighting on behalf of borrowers, no
matter how many times Republicans try to stop them.   
   
You know, we — as I just stated at the top in answering your question,
we know what Republicans are going to do.  We can’t stop them from
that.  But it’s also not going to stop the President on acting and
taking action like he’s doing today.  
   
Q    And just one more quick one.  Did the President — you said the
President called the coach of South Carolina.  Did he watch any of the
game last night?  And did he invite them to the White House?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll have more to share.  We’ll have more to share
on — on a potential visit to the White House.  As you know, that is a
common — that is a common — common event for the champions to come to
the White House.  So, we’ll certainly have more to share.   
   
I have not had a second to ask him if he was able to watch the game last
night, so I don’t have anything to share on that.  
   
Q    One quick follow-up.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Why is the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Which — which follow-up?  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    I’m going back to the eclipse.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, okay, okay.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Why is the President traveling today?  Did he not want to be at the
White House for this, you know, big moment?  I mean, during the last
eclipse, President Trump was at the White House and watched from the
balcony.  So, just —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We all saw that moment, yes.  
   
Q    Just wondering if this current president —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We all know that moment.  And, hopefully, you saw the
President’s video on the eclipse.  
   
Look, we know — we know how exciting this is.  We get it.  We know that
people are going to want to watch it, obviously.  And I said this
multiple times already: We want them to do it safely, put some — the —
your protective eyewear on to do this.   
   
Look, but student loans matter — right? — giving — giving Americans
student loan relief also matters, right?  
   
Q    True, but you could talk about student loans any day of the
week.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    The eclipse only comes around, you know, once every 40 years.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I know.  I know.   
   
But, you know, the President has a different schedule.  And the schedule
certainly is — is focused on — on what he’s doing on behalf of the
American people.   
   
And, look, you know, what he announced today con- — and as — as it’s
obviously also connected to other announcement that he’s — he’s made on
— on student — on student debt relief — is going to help at least 30
million Americans across the country.  That matters.  
   
And I think when we go to Madison, Wisconsin, which the President is —
is really looking forward to do and having — and him laying out what
he’s — what he’s announcing, I think folks there are going to be excited
to hear about that too.  
   
And so, look, it’s an exciting day.  Yes, there’s an eclipse.  But, you
know, the President — it’s not going to stop the President from
traveling and being — going directly to the American people and talking
about a plan that he pro- — he promised that he would deliver on —
deliver on, even though Republican officials have tried to stop it.  
   
Q    Can I ask you about the articles of impeachment against Secretary
Mayorkas and the trial this week?  House Republicans clearly believe
that he violated the law there.  Do you all take this as a sign that
some law has been violated or just that it’s a — a representation of a
frustration with border policies?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  And I’ve talk- — I’ve spoken
to this many times before.  Obviously, this is not their first
attempt.   
   
And as the President has said, “History will not look kindly on House
Republicans for this blatant act of unconstitutional partnership.”  This
impeachment stunt already failed once on the — on a bipartisan vote. 
And it drew bipartisan opposition again in February, as I know you’re
tracking.  
   
Instead of wasting time on these kinds of political games, Republicans
should — should want Congress to deliver more resources and stronger
border security.  We talked about that.  There is a bipartisan border
security proposal that we were able to ha- — make happen in the Senate,
as you all know.  That took a couple of months.  And the former
President told Republicans to reject it. 

Hopefully, they will do the right thing and be where majority of
Americans are when it comes to the immigration system and fi- — fixing —
fixing that — a system that’s been broken for decades.  
   
So, if — this is not what the American people want or expect from their
leaders.  They want us to deliver on real, real solutions — solving
problems that they have — including, as I just mentioned, the border
security.  
   
Q    Is the administration still considering executive actions at this
point?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, I’ve also been very clear about this, and I
think the President has been as well: This administration has been — the
only real solution, we believe, in dealing with the border challenges
that we’re seeing and — and fixing the immigration system, again, that’s
been broken for decades is moving forward with this border security
proposal.   
   
Again, I stated this at the top; I’ll state it again.  You’ve got the
Border Patrol union supporting this; you have the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.  It was done in a bipartisan way — the negotiation — coming
out of the Senate.  You know, we believe this is the way to move
forward.   
   
And it would be, yes, tough but also fair.  And it would be the first —
I think the first — the first legislation, if it were to get through and
the President were to sign it, that we have seen in some time.   
   
And so, a majority of Americans care about this.  Let’s get to work. 
Congress should get to work and get this done.   
   
Q    If it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen, though, before the
end of — before the end of President Biden’s first term, is it something
that the administration thinks is important enough to move on
unilaterally?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, the President has taken so many actions over the
last three years.  And he started off putting forth his own — his own
proposal — a comprehensive immigration proposal the first day — first
day that he walked in — the first piece of legislation that he wanted to
move.  And three and a half — three — three years — more than three
years, Republicans got in the way at every turn.  Every turn, they got
in the way of getting things done.   
   
And so, we finally came to the end of the — end of last year, had a
conversation — Republicans in the Senate, Democrats in the Senate — to
get this done.  I mean, that’s pretty impressive to be able to come out
with a bipartisan proposal.   
   
The former President got in the way and told — and told Republicans to
reject it because it’s going to help Biden — I mean, you all reported
that — and hurt him.  And that’s unfortunate.   
   
So, look, there’s been many times where we’ve been told that we’re not
going to get things done in a bipartisan way, and we’ve been able to do
that in the past three years.  So, that’s not going to stop us.  
   
We’re going to continue to call on Republicans to — to — for them to
reject what the former President told them on not doing — on not moving
on this — and to move on this on behalf of no politics, not
partisanship, but on behalf of the American people.   
   
All right?  Thanks, everybody.   
   
Q    Thank you.
