James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:26 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Good afternoon, everyone.

Q    Good afternoon.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Happy Thursday?  (Laughs.)

Q    Question mark.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Question mark.  (Laughs.)

So, today I am honored to speak to you from our brand new press toast
lectern.  Yay.

Q    Yay.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yay.  And I’m proud to name the lectern in honor of
Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne, the first two Black women in White House
press corps.  In addition to the annual White House Correspondents
Association Award in their name, we are excited to help remember their
service to the American public in this way.

The Dunnigan-Payne lectern and its accompanying seal were designed over
the last year, and they replace the previous lectern, which had been
used in our briefing room since 2007.

The previous lectern will be preserved.  I’m sure many of you were
wondering what was going to happen to the previous lectern.  So, it’s
going to be preserved.

Now this lectern, a blend of modernity and tradition, is meant to embody
the essence of our country’s stature, built using a harmonious
combination of metal and black walnut, as you can see.

The metal speaks to the resilience and strength of our nation, while the
black walnut represents the rich history and the deep-rooted foundations
upon which this country stands.  The blue paint signifies vigilance,
perseverance, and justice.

Every member of this team consist- — consisting of Army, Navy, and the
civilians brought unique expertise and skills to the project.  And we
are deeply grateful for their work and this new addition to our shared
space.

So, welcome, to the — to the lectern here.

All right.  Today, here in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, I
want to take a moment and recognize the 30th anniversary of the Brady
Handgun Prevention Act.

In — in 1981, one of my predecessors, Press Secretary James Brady, was
left paralyzed after an assassination attempt on President Reagan. 

In 1993, the Brady Bill, which James Brady advocated for and which
President Biden worked to pass as then-Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, created the background check system that we have today.

According to the Department of Justice, this system has denied over 4.4
million applications and prevented guns from getting into the hands of
domestic abusers and people with felony records.

Building on these efforts, President Biden continues to take historic
action on gun safety, including strengthening background checks through
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which is the most sweeping gun
safety legislation in the last three decades.

Specifically, the law enhanch- — enhances background checks for people
under 21, and a proposed rule implementing the law would close the gun
show and Internet loophole.

President Biden has also taken more meaningful executive action than any
other president to make our schools, our churches, grocery stores, and
our communities safer.

We’re also encouraged to see 20 states step up to pass laws to expand
background checks to cover private sales, including most recently in
Minnesota and also in Michigan.

But we can’t do it alone.  Congress must fully fund the FBI and ATF, who
— who administers the system, and act to establish universal background
checks, pass a national red flag law, ban assault weapons, invest in
proven solutions, and more.

Now turning to the economy.  Today and yesterday, we got more good news
on the economy as inflation continues to fall and the economy continues
to grow.

Today, annual inflation fell to its lowest level in more than two and a
half years, and monthly inflation was zero — again, zero.

Gas prices are down by $1.77 from their peak after Putin’s war.  Prices
for eggs, milks are down over the last year. 

The economy grew more than 5 percent last quarter, stronger than any
quarter under Trump — Tru- — under Trump outside of the pandemic.

We still have more work to do.  And we understand that, and we know
that; the President understands that.  The prices are — are still too
high. 

That’s why President Biden is fighting to lower costs for American
families by strengthening our supply chains, taking on Big Pharma to
lower prescription drugs, cracking down on price gouging by banning
hidden junk fees, and calling on corporations to pass savings on to
consumers.

Unfortunately, congressional Republicans are pushing MAGA-nomics that
fails the middle class — that fails the middle class with the following:
by tax giveaways for the wealthy and big corporations, blowing up the
debt; cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; raising costs for
hardworking families.

The good news is the President won’t let them.  He will not let this
happen.

We also have significant news from EPA today, building on the
Biden-Harris administration’s historic commitment to protect children
and families from the — from the lead poisoning. 

The EPA announced a proposal to require water systems to replace lead
service lines within 10 years, helping secure safe drinking water for
communities across the country.

There is no safe level of exposure to lead, particularly for children. 
And eliminating lead exposure for — from the air, water, and homes is
crucial component of our commitment to advancing environmental justice.

Already, the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is investing more
than $50 billion in the largest upgrade to the nation’s water
infrastructure in history.  And the President is going to keep fighting
to deliver safe, clean water to every community across the country.

And lastly — thank you for your patience.  I know it’s been a lot.  And
lastly, tomorrow is World AIDS Day, which was established 35 years ago
to commemorate those who have died due to AIDS-related illnesses and
honor the more than 40 million individuals with HIV around the world.  
   
This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the U.S. President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, otherwise known as PEPFAR. 

When the program was announced by President George W. Bush in 2003, an
AIDS diagnosis was a death sentence, and only 50,000 of the more than 4
million people across sub-Saharan Africa in — in need of anti- —
anti-retroviral treatment for HIV were receiving it.  
   
For more than 20 years, PEPFAR has been one of our — our nation’s most
profound transformational investments and has enjoyed strong bipartisan
support. 

PEPFAR has become the largest commitment by any nation to address a
single disease in the world, and the program has had a remarkable
impact, having saved 25 million lives and enabled 5.5 million babies to
be born HIV-free to mothers living with HIV.   
   
That’s why the Biden-Harris administration continues to urge Congress to
reauthorize PEPFAR as part of our commitment to ending HIV/AIDS as a
public health threat by 2030.

Domestically, the updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which has re- —
which — which was released by President Biden on World AIDS Day back in
2021, continues to provide a roadmap for the nation to accelerate our
efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by 2030 and increased the
number of people in care and on PrEP.  
   
With this year’s theme of, and I quote, “remember and commit,” end
quote, we remember those we lost — we lost to AIDS-related illnesses,
emphasize the urgency of our collective commitment to end the HIV
epidemic, and recognize the courage and passion that has been essential
— essential to the progress we have made so far.   
   
Thank you all for your patience.  I know that was a lot.  We have my
colleague from NSC, Admiral John Kirby, here to give an update on all
that is happening in the Middle East.  
   
John.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Were you — were you dozing off?  Was I that long and
boring?  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, I was — it was fascinating.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I was like, you seemed — you seemed shocked — (laughs)
— when I called you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, it was gripping — gripping.  (Laughter.)  
   
Thanks, everybody.  Unfortunately, I’m going to submit you to some — a
few different toppers too.  I’ll try to get through it as quickly as I
can.   
   
Obviously, the first thing I want to talk about is what’s going on in
Middle East and this extension of a deal now for a seventh full day. 

The humanitarian pause now, over the first six days, has seen more than
100 hostages released and returned to their families and a significant
surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza — several hundred trucks over
the last week, which is important.  
   
Again, we all recognize more needs to be done, more needs to get in, but
we shouldn’t discount the incredible work that has been done on the
ground to get more food, water, medicine, and even fuel to the people of
Gaza over the last week. 

So, we’re going to continue our efforts with Israel, with Qatar,
obviously, with Egypt, to support and extend this pause as much as we
can and to help secure the release of all the hostages held by Hamas
terrorists.  
   
And I know one of the first questions I’m going to get is, “What are the
chances of an extension?”  And I just can’t tell you that right now,
except to tell you that we’re working at it literally by the hour to see
if we can get this seventh day turned into an eighth and ninth and tenth
and beyond.  
   
But — but all I can do is tell you where we are right now.  And we’re
glad that we got a seventh day out of this. 

The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, have noted that, at least at the
time that I came out here, two hostages had made their way back.  I
don’t know if there will be more.  We certainly hope there will be
more.  But, again, we’re working on this by — by the hour.  
   
And then I think we’ve all seen the terrible news coming out of
Jerusalem: a deadly shooting attack there where at least three people
were killed.  Hamas has claimed credit.  We obviously condemn this
terrorist attack, this heinous violence.  Just another example of the
kind of threat that the Israeli people and the Israeli nation are under
by — by Hamas.   
   
So, we certainly extend our condolences and thoughts and prayers to all
those affected and the family members that are now grieving — additional
family members that are now grieving.  
   
I want to switch, if I could, to Russia and Ukraine.  Last winter,
Russia sought to destroy Ukraine’s critical infrastructure — the energy
infrastructure and to deprive the Ukrainian people of access to heat and
electricity at the coldest time of the year.  Russia tried to break the
will of the Ukrainian people, but, of course, it failed.   
   
As we head into yet another winter, we expect that Russia will return to
this cruel tactic and again try to pursue a campaign to destroy
Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure. 

In just the last couple of days, we’ve seen some airstrikes taken by the
Russians that seem to be going after the kind of defensive systems that
the Ukrainians have in place to protect their energy infrastructure.   
   
And, again, over the weekend, they launched a major drone attack against
Kyiv and elsewhere.  We view this as a strike of what’s to — sorry, a
sign of what’s to come.   
   
For many months, we’ve been working aggressively with our Ukrainian
partners to prepare for this contingency.  And as you will all recall,
it was a major topic of discussion when President Zelenskyy visited the
White House last September. 

And ahead of this winter, President Biden and National Security Advisor
Sullivan directed the United States government to prioritize these
efforts, just as we did last year.   
   
So, we’ve been focused on driving forward three key lines of effort. 
First, we’ve been strengthening Ukraine’s air defensive capabilities so
that they can shoot down Russian –Russian missiles and their Iranian
drones targeting critical infrastructure.   
   
That’s why we provided Ukraine, even recently in recent packages now,
with Patriot batteries, HAWK and Avenger air-defense systems, counter
unmanned air systems equipment, and other critical air-defense
assets.   
   
Second, we’ve been helping Ukraine harden their critical energy
infrastructure.  We provided them with extensive amounts of defensive
protection equipment, including wire mesh, rebar, and HESCO barriers to
protect critical infrastructure.  And our experts at DOD and at the
Department of Energy and the U.S. Agency for International Development
have all been advising Ukrainian officials on how to use this equipment
most effectively.   
   
And, third, we’ve been providing Ukraine with backup equipment and
supplies, including high-voltage auto transformers, industrial-size gas
generators, and mobile off-grid equipment to add resiliency and prevent
people from losing heat and electricity if Russia’s strikes get through
and are successful.  
   
We’re pursuing these lines of effort in coordination with our allies and
our partners.   
   
The President has been leading a coalition of more than 50 countries to
provide Ukraine with the security assistance it needs, including
additional, as I said, Patriot batteries, SAM-T systems, and hundreds of
air-defense missiles.   
   
Last winter, we stood up the G7+ Energy Coordination Group, which we
continue to lead and convene on a regular basis.  Through this forum and
others, our allies and partners have provided Ukraine with energy
equipment and backup supplies, as I said, including power-generation
equipment, transmission infrastructure, and — and further passive
protection.   
   
This is no easy task — none of this.  We have more work to do in support
of Ukraine, and we need Congress to take action to pass additional
supplemental funding so that we can keep providing Ukraine with
air-defense assess — assets, the protection equipment, and the backup
supplies that they need.   
   
President Putin appears certainly intent on continuing this conflict and
on taking it directly to the Ukrainian people, again, at the coldest
months of the year.  We can and we must do more to assure Ukraine is in
the best possible position to defend itself and its critical energy
infrastructure throughout the winter.   
   
And I want to — just one more foot stomp on — the supplemental funding
is important.  We didn’t pull those figures out of thin air.  We need
that funding.  We continue to urge Congress to pass that supplemental as
soon as possible.   
   
Again, as I said before many times, the runway is getting shorter.  And
we think we got until, you know, about the end of the year before it
gets really, really hard to continue to support Ukraine.  And the end of
the year is coming soon.   
   
Now, just real quickly on Angola.  As you know, President Biden is
hosting President Lourenço of Angola later this afternoon.  He’s looking
forward to this meeting very, very much.   
   
The U.S-Angola relationship has flourished over the course of this year
through frequent and productive senior-level engagements between our two
countries, including in September when Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin
became the first-ever sitting Secretary of Defense to visit Angola and
to talk to them about mutual security opportunities, particularly in the
maritime environment.   
   
President Biden looks forward to capping off a historic year in this
bilateral relationship by discussing all of the things that we can do
with President Lourenço to strengthen our — our cooperation and our
relationship with Angola, not just in the security environment but — but
economically and diplomatically as well.  They’re a strategic partner
and a growing global voice on issues of peace and security.   
   
We’re particularly grateful to Angola for its very principled stand on
the conflict in Ukraine and the role that President Lourenço is playing
to advance solutions to conflicts elsewhere on the continent.   
   
Angola and the United States are expanding our economic cooperation at
record speed, including pursuing additional investments through the
President’s flagship Partnership for Global Infrastructure and
Investment to build quality, sustainable infrastructure that connects
Angola to — to global markets.   
   
And, of course, we’ll have a readout of that meeting when it’s over.   
   
Thank you.  Appreciate your forbearance.   
   
Q    Thank you, Admiral.  So, the U.S. administration has been clear
that they’ve asked Israel to be more targeted in its military operations
in Southern Gaza, but Israel has vowed to resume this fighting with full
force —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — when it starts again.  So, what has the President specifically
told Netanyahu?  And how much daylight is there between what the
President wants and what Israel wants?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, obviously, we continue to believe that Israel has the
right and responsibility to go after Hamas.  They have said — they have
spoken for their military campaign, and they have said very clearly that
— that when these pauses are over, they intend to go back at it.   
   
And as they make that decision, they will continue to find support from
the United States in terms of tools and capabilities, the weapons
systems that they need, as well as the advice and the perspectives that
we can offer in terms of urban warfare.  No nation should have to stand
for what Israel had to — had to experience on the 7th of October.   
   
So, I won’t speak for their operations.  And I’m certainly not going to
get into private conversations that the President has had with the Prime
Minister.   
   
But he has been clear publicly and certainly in his discussions with the
War Cabinet that they will continue to have the United States’ support
as they go after these terrorists.   
   
And, again, just look at what happened today in Jerusalem.  I mean, if
anybody’s guessing and wondering whether Hamas  
still has murderous intentions against the Israeli people, just look at
what happened in Jerusalem today.  
   
Q    And you had mentioned before that the U.S. believes there are two
American women held.  One has been released, so does that mean there is
one American woman left being held?  And what do we know about her
conditions?  Do we think she could be released soon?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I wish I had good answers for those questions. 
Unfortunately, we don’t know.  We do believe that there is — that there
w- — that, of the unaccounted-for Americans, that we believe there is
one other woman that’s unaccounted for and that we had believed was
taken hostage.   
   
So, we were hoping to see two women and, of course, little Abigail come
out over the last week.  We’re certainly grateful that we — we’ve now
gotten six Americans out, but I don’t have additional information on
this individual or where she might be or what her condition is.  I just
don’t know.  
   
Q    Does the U.S. believe that Hamas does not know where all the
hostages are, or is that just something they’re propagating the U.S.
believes in order to delay this?

MR. KIRBY:  I can’t say with certainty what Hamas knows or doesn’t
know.  They launched these attacks on the 7th of October with two
purposes: one, to kill; the other to take hostage.  And they did that to
a fare-thee-well.

We do think that there are some other groups other than Hamas that might
be holding hostages.  But that’s not to say that Hamas doesn’t have
visibility on that or doesn’t have a way to find out about it.

So, the onus is really on Hamas, as — as this deal progresses today, to
identify, locate, and secure these hostages and — and get them to the
Red Cross so that they can get to safety.

But I couldn’t speak with great certainty about exactly what Hamas knows
and doesn’t know.

Q    Thanks.  Is — administration officials said yesterday that there is
an effort to encourage the Israelis in the Southern Gaza operation to
kind of narrow the target, make sure that civilians have a clear idea of
where they can seek refuge.  Is there a concern that that might give a
heads-up to Hamas, as well, so that they can reposition as well and seek
refuge?

MR. KIRBY:  Well, there’s a couple of things there, Trevor.  First of
all, I certainly won’t speak for the Israeli military or what their
plans and strategies are.  I mean, they have a right to operational
security in terms of what they’re going to do, when they’re going to do
it, and how they’re going to do it.

So, obviously, we certainly don’t want to say anything from the podium
or publicly that would put their operational security at risk.

Secondly, we have been very consistent and clear with our Israeli
counterparts that we do not support a move to the south unless or until
they have adequately accounted for the protection of innocent human life
— civilian life in Southern Gaza, with the understanding that there’s a
whole heck of a lot more innocent civilians in Southern Gaza than there
were a week or two ago because the Israelis opened up corridors for them
to move south.

So, I won’t get too far ahead of operations.  But what — what we want to
see and what we’re urging our Israeli counterparts to do is to make sure
that there’s a proper accounting for that, that there are — that — that
there is appropriate safety measures put in place so that these
additional, now, hundreds of thousands of civilians are not put at
greater harm’s way than they already are right now.

Q    And then the — the father of an American hostage that was released
from Gaza said that he was invited to the White House to come speak with
Biden in person.  Do you have a date set as far as when that’s going to
take place?

MR. KIRBY:  No, sir.

Q    Okay.  And then, finally, I was wondering if you have any reaction
to the death of Henry Kissinger and any explanation of how he has shaped
this administration’s foreign policy.  I know he’s been consulted by
Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken and — and others.

MR. KIRBY:  Well, obviously, our — our condolences go to — to his entire
family over this — over this loss.  To his wife, Nancy, and to — to
everybody else in his family, of course, it’s a huge loss. 

This was a man who, whether — whether you agree with him or not, whether
you hold the same views or not, he served in World War Two, served his
country bravely in uniform, and for decades afterward, which I think we
can all be grateful for and appreciate, just the public service.

And, again, whether you saw eye to eye with him on every issue, there’s
no question that — that he shaped foreign policy decisions for decades. 
And he certainly had an impact on America’s role in the world.

So, again, our deepest condolences go to the family.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  John, thank you.  Just to follow up on that: Is
there a reason why the administration hasn’t issued any formal statement
from the President or this White House with regard —

MR. KIRBY:  I —

Q    — to his death?

MR. KIRBY:  I wouldn’t read anything into that just — just yet.

Q    Okay.  And then, on the President’s comments about conditional aid
to Israel, I wanted to follow up because he suggested that if conditions
had been in place, the progress that we have seen so far might not have
happened. 

So, of all the proposed conditions, can you explain how they would
hinder efforts, whether it’s, you know, reducing the level of civilian
casualties or making sure U.S. weapons are used within humanitarian
law?  How would any of the proposed conditions slow down or prevent the
progress that has been made?

MR. KIRBY:  Well, rather than speak to these proposed conditions, let me
just take a step back and, again, reorient the discussion here.

Israel was attacked on the 7th of October in a most heinous way.  The
President has been clear we’re going to continue to support their
ability to eliminate that threat — the continued threat that Hamas still
poses.

At the same time, as we have done that, since the early hours, we’ve
been urging our Israeli counterparts to act with as much precision and
care and deliberateness as they can in their targeting.

Now, again, I’m not discounting the fact that many thousands of innocent
people have been killed, many thousands more injured, and hundreds of
thousands displaced internally in the country — in the — in Gaza —
excuse me — in Gaza.

And we continue to, again, urge our Israeli counterparts to factor all
that in as they plan and execute military operations.

And as a result of — and this is what the President was talking about —
as a result of our engagement with our Israeli counterparts, we have
seen results.  I mean, now a week-long pause.

At the beginning of this, the idea of a pause was unthinkable to our
Israeli counterparts.  But now, a week-long pause, a hundred hostages
out, hundreds of trucks of aid getting in.  At the — at the outset, the
idea of humanitarian assistance getting in was not something that was —
was warmly received as an idea.

So, the President believes that the approach that we’ve been taking has
had results.  
   
Now, again, nobody is discounting or dismissing the loss of innocent
life.  And we continue to work with and share perspectives about urban
warfare with our Israeli counterparts so that they can continue to hone
their operations in such a way that there’s a reduction and a minim- — a
minimizing of civilian death.  But we’re going to continue that
approach.  
   
Q    And, John, I hear you.  And I know that that’s what the President
has said repeatedly.  In fact, he has supported all of these
conditions.  These are things that he says he believes in. 

So, I’m asking — you know, talk is one thing, but should there be
actions that draw a line to say, “Hey, if you don’t do what we’re
asking, there will be consequences”?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We believe that the approach that we’re taking thus far has
produced effective results — again, without discounting civilian deaths,
and I don’t mean to dismiss that at all.  We — each one is a tragedy,
and we mourn them all.   
   
But — but we are — the approach that we’re taking thus far is having
results, and it has — it has actually had a practical effect on the way
our Israeli counterparts have prosecuted these operations.  I mean, just
look at, for instance, the — the ground incursion into — into Gaza.  
   
I mean, without getting into too much detail, I’ll tell you, we — we
shared with them our own experience in that kind of urban warfare in
places like Fallujah and in places like Mosul, and we sent over military
advisors and experts to talk to them about some of those lessons
learned. 

And I can tell you, they were receptive to those lessons learned.  And
it did affect — again, I don’t think I’m giving anything away for the
Israeli military, but it did affect the way they ultimately chose to go
into Gaza.  
   
So, I would just say we’re going to — we’re going to keep at that.  
   
Q    Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’re running out of time.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’ve got to go really quickly.  (Laughs.)  Go
ahead, Chris.  And then I’ve got to go to the back too.   
   
Q    What impact has the shooting that Hamas has taken credit for in
Jerusalem had on the efforts to extend the humanitarian pauses?  And is
the U.S. goal to turn these — these pauses into a more permanent
ceasefire?  Is that the overall trendline that the U.S. is going for?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know, and no.  So, I don’t know.  I don’t think
there’s been —  
   
Q    Which one is which?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  (Laughs.)  I don’t think there’s been any effect that — not
that I — not that I’ve heard or seen — effect on the — on the deal —
extending the deal by the violence in Jerusalem.  I’ve seen nothing that
indicates an effect on that.  
   
And, again, we do not support a permanent ceasefire at this time.  We do
support the idea of humanitarian pauses.  And we would love to see — as
I said at the outset, we want to see this 7-day pause turn into 8, 9,
10, and beyond.  But ultimately, that’s going to take Israel and Hamas
to agree to the parameters of extending that deal.  
   
But in the United States, they’ll continue to find an advocate for
extension.  
   
Q    And how has the alleged plot by an Indian government official to
assassinate somebody on U.S. soil — how has that affected U.S.-Indian
relations?  You know, given that, you know, the President recently
hosted Modi for a state dinner, you know, relations have been trying to,
you know, improve — tighten those relations, what impact does that plot
have?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would remind you the state dinner happened before we knew
about this.  
   
Q    Sure.  Yeah.  But —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  And — and I want to be careful here that I don’t get ahead
of the Department of Justice and talk about an ongoing investigation.   
I would just say two things: Isra- — India remains a strategic partner,
and we’re going to continue to work to improve and strengthen that
strategic partnership with India. 

At the same time, we take this very seriously.  These allegations and
this investigation — take it very seriously.  
   
And we’re glad to see that the Indians are too, by announcing their own
efforts to investigate this.  And we’ve been clear that we want to see
anybody held — anybody that’s responsible for these alleged crimes to be
held properly accountable.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  On Venezuela, I wanted to ask about today.  Is the
deadline that the administration set for the Venezuelan government to
make progress on certain things — one of them lifting the public bans of
political opposition leaders who cannot run in elections, establish a
process to release wrongfully detained Americans.  So, my question is:
Have you seen any progress?  And is the U.S. prepared to reimpose
sanctions, which was the consequence of — of not seeing progress?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I haven’t seen any progress yet.  There’s eight hours left
in the day.  So, we’ll see what the Venezuelans decide to do.  And I
won’t get ahead of decisions about sanctions one way or the other going
forward.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Anita.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I have a few questions about Angola.  As you know, this
exciting Lobito Corridor runs through a part of the DRC that’s been
embroiled in secessionist violent conflict since 1960.  Can the Lobito
Corridor work without peace in that region?   
   
And then, to that point, how is the White House supporting President
Lourenço in his work as AU peace envoy to bring about peace?   
   
And then also how is the administration engaging bilaterally —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  You know I’m on a time clock here.  
   
Q    No, I hear you.  This is the last — second-to-last one. 
(Laughter.)  Sorry.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I guess I should write these down.  
   
Q    How is — how is the administration engaging bilaterally,
multilaterally with Great Lakes leaders to bring about peace?   
   
And then, finally, what is the President’s message to President Lourenço
about his country’s poor human rights track record?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, look, I’m going to try to boil this down; otherwise, I’m
going to be in big trouble.  So —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s okay.  It’s the — it’s the President’s time. 
(Laughs.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Exactly.  Me too.  
   
This is a relationship that has been improving now, as I said, over the
last year.  And the President is very much looking forward to this
meeting with the Angolan president.   
   
There is a lot of ground to cover.  So, we never shy away from talking
about human rights.  The President routinely brings that up.  I won’t
get ahead of the President, and we’ll have a readout.  But — but we — he
never shies away from talking about human rights when he’s talking to
foreign leaders.  
   
Number two, we welcome President Lourenço’s efforts to — to foster
peace.  I said that at my — at the opening statement.  His efforts on
the continent to improve peace and security and stability are welcome. 
And I am absolutely certain that the two leaders will talk about that
today and the prospects for that and where that’s going, including in
the DRC.   
   
And, number three, on the Lobito Corridor, the President is very excited
about this.  This is a — a real landmark effort as part of PGI and — in
helping lower- and middle-income countries find sustainable investments
in their infrastructure that can not only create jobs, but also open up
economic opportunities — in this case, all across that southern part of
Sub-Saharan Africa.   
   
So, it’s very exciting.  And we’re going to — we’re going to keep
pushing forward with it.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Follow-up on —  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  In the back.  In the back, go ahead.  Yes, sir.  
   
Q    Thank you very much, Karine.  And thank you, John.  Two very brief
questions related to foreign policy.   
   
One, has the President had discussions with Speaker Johnson akin to
those he had with Speaker McCarthy about the supplemental on Ukraine
standing alone?  And is the price tag on it $60 billion or $47 billion
at this point?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t — I don’t — I’d have to get back to you on whether
there was a specific conversation with the Speaker on the
supplemental.   
   
That said, we have had numerous discussions and briefings with members
of Congress and staff members about the importance of the supplemental
and moving on all four of those buckets: Israel, Ukraine, the
Indo-Pacific, and border security.  We want to see them act as quickly
as possible on that.  
   
Q    So, no —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  And the — and the total numbers are on the web  
to see, but —  
   
Q    Right.  So, no standalone, then, on Ukraine?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We want to see all four priorities taken up by Congress and
all four funded.  The reason why it’s a supplemental is because they’re
all urgent.  And as I said earlier, we’re running out of runway on
Ukraine, and I would tell you the same thing for Israel.  We have some
existing appropriations and authorities to continue to support Israel,
but that’s — that — that well is not, you know, endlessly deep,
either.  
   
Q    And will the President send or has he chosen a representative to go
to President-elect Milei’s inauguration on the following Sunday?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Not that I’m aware of.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    One of the key provisions of this deal was getting Red Cross
officials in to access the hostages and see their conditions.  With the
fragility of the truce being there right now, is there any realistic
hope that the Red Cross is actually going to get any access to these
people?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That — that’s — that’s part of the — that’s part of the
deal.  That’s what we — our expectation is that Hamas will allow that
access.  
   
Q    But have —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s — that was part of that — that was part of that
arrangement.  
   
Q    But have they just simply been saying “no” at this point?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I — I don’t know whether — how much access they’ve actually
had, but that’s part of the deal — what they signed up to.  So, we’ll —
we’ll see — we’ll see if we can get an extension on this.  I mean, you
know, it’s part of the deal for pauses.  So, during a — during the
pause, while you’re getting hostages out and aid in, Red Cross gets
access.   
   
So, again, the — we’ve got one more day today.  Hopefully, we can get
this thing extended, and we’ll see.  
   
Q    And does the U.S. have any —  
   
Q    Can — can I ask you a follow-up on Angola?  
   
Q    — other way that they feel they can determine the condition of
these hostages, especially the Americans who are there?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s why the — that’s why the Red Cross access is so
important, because it’s eyes-on.  It’s an independent view and a look to
see how these people are doing.  And that’s why it’s so important and
why we’ve been fighting for it.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Joey.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Kirby, can I ask you a follow-up on Angola?  
   
Q    Thank you, John.  Regarding the attack in Jerusalem in which Hamas
is taking credit, does the U.S. view that attack in any way to be a
violation of the ongoing truce between Israel and Hamas?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Tech- — and I don’t want to get into — I’m not — I’m not a —
a lawyer here.  This attack happened in Jerusalem.  
   
Q    Right.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The pauses in the fighting were specific to Gaza.  
   
Q    Okay.  So, that’s a — as simple as that?  I mean, it wasn’t —
therefore, it didn’t violate the —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It didn’t technically violate the — the deal that was in
place.  But, obviously, it’s a stark reminder of — of who they’re facing
and what kind of — what kind of enemy that they’re opposing.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nadia, Nadia.  Go ahead, Nadia.  
   
Q    Can — can I ask you a follow-up on Angola?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nadia.  
   
Q    One — one question.  
   
Q    I mean, it’s so surprising that you don’t take a —  
   
Q    Sorry.  
   
Q    — you are receiving an African leader —  
   
Q    I have —  
   
Q    — and you can’t take a question from an African journalist.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  We can — we can end this briefing right now —  
   
Q    I — sorry, I — I have one question.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — if — if you’re not going to be respectful.  
   
Q    So, basically — —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  John, we can end the briefing.   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    It’s not about ending the briefing.  I want to ask an African
question because you’re receiving an African leader.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    I’m trying to ask a question.  Can I just —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   All right.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  
   
Q    Oh, my God.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  If we — we can end this briefing if it’s
not going to be respectful here.   
   
Chris.  
   
Q    You’re not doing the right thing.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    That’s what I’m saying.  You are receiving an African leader, and
you don’t take questions —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Thanks, everybody.  
   
Q    Karine, I have a question about gas prices.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, everybody.  All right.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Can we do one about the falling gas prices?
