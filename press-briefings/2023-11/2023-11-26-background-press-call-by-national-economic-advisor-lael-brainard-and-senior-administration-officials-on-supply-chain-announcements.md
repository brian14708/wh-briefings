title: Background Press Call by National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard and Senior
  Administration Officials on Supply Chain Announcements
---
 
Via Teleconference

2:03 P.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our
call.  
   
A few minutes ago, I sent around a factsheet that this –that lays out
the announcements that the President will be announcing tomorrow.  If
you have not received them, I will be resending that in — in a second to
everyone who has registered for this call.   
   
The first person of our call is on the record and will include remarks
from National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard.  The second portion of our
call will have questions and answers from Joelle Gamble and Monica
Gorman from our National Economic Council.   
   
This call and the factsheet are embargoed until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow,
November 27th.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to Lael for on-the-record opening
remarks.  
   
DIRECTOR BRAINARD:  Well, thank you to everyone for joining us today.  I
hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving.  
   
The pandemic brought tremendous hardship to so many.  
   
In addition to the human hardship, the pandemic led to unprecedented
stress in our supply chains, creating shortages in everything from
semiconductors to cars, to washing machines, to everyday household
goods.   
   
In his first month in office, the President signed an executive order on
America’s supply chains and established a Supply Chain Disruptions
Taskforce.   
   
He secured important actions on shipping and trucking through the Ocean
Shipping Reform Act and the Trucking Action Plan.  
   
And to enable investments in America’s transportation systems and key
inputs, the President secured the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in his
first year and the CHIPS and Science and Inflation Reduction Acts in his
second year.  
   
When supply chain stress intensified, input prices rose and some
corporations increased consumer-goods prices by even more, contributing
to a surge in inflation.  
   
Today, as a result of the actions taken by President Biden, supply chain
stress has been reduced from record highs to record lows and inflation
has declined by 65 percent from its peak.  
   
You can see this visually by looking at the relationship between the
Global Supply Chain Pressure Index and CPI inflation.   
   
But this work is not done.  President Biden will continue working to
ensure American supply chains are resilient and corporations are
bringing prices down for American consumers.  
   
Tomorrow, President Biden will launch a White House Council on Supplier
Resilience and announce 30 new actions to strengthen American supply
chains and bring down costs for American families.   
   
He’ll announce a presidential determination to broaden the Department of
Health and Human Services’ authorities under the Defense Production Act
to mitigate drug shortages and invest in essential medicines in
America.  HHS has identified $35 million for investments in domestic
production of key starting materials for sterile injectable medicines
and will designate a new supply chain resilience and shortage
coordinator.   
   
The Department of Defense will also soon release a new report on
pharmaceutical supply chain resilience.   
   
The Department of Homeland Security will launch a new Supply Chain
Resilience Center and new tabletop exercises designed to test the
resilience of critical cross-border supply chains.   
   
Near-term priorities will include addressing supply chain risks
resulting from threats and vulnerabilities inside U.S. ports.   
   
The Department of Commerce will launch a new, first-of-its-kind supply
chain center to integrate industry expertise and data analytics to
develop innovative supply chain risk-assessment tools.   
   
And DHS and the Department of Commerce will collaborate to strengthen
the sem- — semiconductor supply chain and further the implementation of
the CHIPS and Science Act.  
   
So, we’re pleased with the progress on supply chains that was showing up
in lower prices — in everything from turkeys to gas prices this
Thanksgiving — but we’re determined to keep working to bring down prices
for American consumers and ensure the resilience of our supply chains
for the future.  
   
And with that, let me turn it back to \[Moderator\].  Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks so much, Lael.   
   
We’ll now turn it over to questions and answers.  If you have a
question, please use the “raise hand” function.  We’ll take a second and
then we’ll take some questions on background as “White House
officials.”  
   
All right, our first question goes to Paris Huang with VOA.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you for doing this.  So, I — I have
two questions.  One is on the pharmaceutical.  In — in the factsheet,
you talk about the DOD is going to find a more reliable source of the —
the pharmaceutical supply chain.  Is that talking about those precursors
or the drugs that importing from China?  Is that part of the — are we
switching from China to India to look for those sources?  So, that’s my
first question.  
   
And second is on the semiconductor.  Of course, we talked about the
CHIPS Act.  There was a concern over Taiwan’s semiconductor abilities
and the Chinese threats to Taiwan.  Is that factoring into these new
actions you want to pursue?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, this is \[senior
administration official\].  Happy to start.  
   
So — so, first off, thank you all for being on the call today.  As Lael
mentioned, this is a part of the President’s long-term strategy to
support resilience of critical supply chains following on, you know,
work that has been done over the last two years, including a day-one
executive order on America’s supply chains.  
   
To your — to your questions (inaudible) there’s actually a fairly
similar answer.  The goal of these actions, including the Department of
Defense’s report on pharmaceutical supply chains and the collaboration
between Commerce and DHS on semiconductor supply chains, is to make sure
that we are both — using both domestic tools and international
partnerships to diversify supply chains for critical goods.   
   
We know that hyperconcentration in just one region can bec- — can become
a problem because of the heightened risk of — of geopolitical, economic
and climate shock, as we experienced during the pandemic.  So, the goal
here is to work strategically across domestic partners and international
partners and allies to make sure that we’re securing the supply chain
for these goods.   
   
The different agencies mentioned have specific expertise in these areas
that they’re leveraging through the work of the council and the works
mentioned in the factsheet.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks — thanks, \[senior administration official\].  
   
I’ll turn it over now to Jeff Mason from Reuters.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks very much.  Can you give any more details about the two
centers that Lael mentioned at the two agencies?  What will they do with
regard to supply chains and semiconductors that hasn’t already — that
isn’t already being done by those two agencies?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sorry for the — the delay; I was trying
to unmute.  
   
So, the partnership between these two agencies, I think, is important
because, you know, they have complementary authorities.   
   
DHS has unprecedented access to cross-border information, data flows, et
cetera.  CBP, for instance, is one source of data and unique
partnerships with industry from the security standpoint.  
   
Commerce as an agency that is very, very focused on trade in an economic
sense has a different set of authorities.  And so, what the Secretaries
announcing is a partnership to continue to work as they announce
(inaudible) funding — you know, as we get a better sense of who the
major players will be in the United States, to make sure that we are
doing all that we can to sumor — support, you know, this kind of
resurgence of chips production in the United States.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  I’ll now turn it over to Lori Anne \[ph\].  
   
Q    Good afternoon and thank you for, you know, putting this on.  I’ve
got a couple of questions.  
   
As regards to flow, in terms of the interoperability and the sharing of
data — as we all know, you’re one firewall away from a potential, you
know, hacking incident.  What we’ve seen in Australia and the impact
that it has had, if you will, on the flow of trade for their ports —
what kind of systems do you have in place in terms of the sharing of
data and to ensure that — that all the links that are together are
indeed strengthened and not weakened?  Because as you all know, it could
just take one link for somebody to get into a system.  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks for your question.  
   
That — that is, in fact, the beauty of flow is that there are a number
of different players along the supply chain who are collaborating across
— across industry and with the federal government to be able to create a
kind of interoperable data set.   
   
Basically, you pay to play, right?  So, a lot of the industry players
benefit from flow because they get (inaudible) from their competitors,
and that incentivizes them to participate as well.  And so, you get a
fuller picture of what’s happening in the ports system.   
   
So, that is — that is the goal of it in t- — the goal is to strengthen
it.  And (inaudible) will be announcing a few new partnerships along
those lines.  
   
I don’t know if, \[senior administration official\], there’s anything
you wanted to add to that, since you’ve been working closely with
them.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  I did just want to note — I
mean, again, you — you stressed it, \[senior administration official\]:
the beauty of the cross-collaboration here.  
   
But this will also be a focus for the new Supply Chain Resilience Center
at the Department of Homeland Security, which is particularly looking at
risks from critical infrastructure as it relates to the flow of goods. 
So, just noting that that point will be crucial as they work together
with (inaudible).  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Our next question will go to Courtney Brown, who’s
on the phone.  
   
And if we can’t get Courtney — I know that the phone is difficult —
we’ll turn it over to Morgan.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks so much for doing this.  I just had two questions.   
   
First, on the coordinator at HHS, is this going to be a new — new person
from outside government?  Do you have someone within the agency that’s
going to be tapped for that?  Can you say who it’s going to be?  Is
that, like, an announcement that will come later on?  
   
And then on the DPA.  Can you just kind of give us a sense of how
quickly we’ll start to see some results from the President using that? 
And is that going to actually happen tomorrow, that he invokes the
DPA?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  So, HHS is announcing the
creation of this coordinator tomorrow.  They’ve managed — despite
congressional, you know, rescission of a lot of their funds from the
pandemic, they managed to secure multiyear funding to do so.   
   
They’ll announce the actual coordinator at a later date but have been
working really hard to secure the financing to make this a durable
position, which was important to the overall effort.  
   
On the DPA, the presidential determination will be released this week. 
And we will, you know, of course, hope to see results as soon as we
can.  But as you can imagine, this is a very, very hard problem.   
   
And so, this is one of many steps the administration will be taking to
help invest in both our domestic manufacturing capabilities and to
address overall issues with drug shortages.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Just to add to what \[senior
administration official\] said, HHS has identified $35 million for
investments in domestic production of (inaudible) materials for
(inaudible) as well.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  And we’ll now turn it over to Courtney again, who I
know was trying to unmute.  And we’ll take that as the last question.  
   
And if not, we can always take questions by email.   
   
So, thanks, everyone, for joining us today.  If you have any questions
or didn’t get the factsheet, please feel free to follow up over
email.   
   
The remarks by National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard were on the
record.  The Q&A was on background as “White House officials.”  And this
call and the factsheet are embargoed until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.  
   
I hope everyone enjoyed Thanksgiving.   
   
Thank you.
