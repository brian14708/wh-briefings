title: "Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials Previewing the Bilateral\
  \ Engagement of President\_Biden and President Joko Widodo of\_Indonesia"

Via Teleconference

2:22 P.M. EST

MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.  And thank you all for joining today’s
call this afternoon to preview the bilateral meeting between President
Biden and President Widodo of Indonesia. 

On today’s call, we have \[senior administration official\] and \[senior
administration official\].  As a reminder, today’s call is on background
and attributed to “senior administration officials,” under embargo until
5:00 a.m. Monday, November 13th.  By participating in the call today,
you are agreeing to these ground rules. 

I will now turn the call over to \[senior administration official\] and
to \[senior administration official\] to kick us off.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Moderator\], thank you.  Hi, friends,
and thank you so much for joining on Sunday.  It’s such a lovely day
here around Washington.  I’m sorry to drag folks from outside indoors,
but we’ve got a very consequential set of events next week. 

The President and most of the Cabinet will be out in San Francisco for
APEC.  The President will be hosting President Xi for a significant
bilateral.  And the week begins, really, with the visit of President
Jokowi — President Widodo tomorrow, late afternoon.

This is an event that we’ve been looking forward to for some time.  As
you all know, the Vice President extended an invitation to the President
to come to Washington in advance of APEC when she was visiting for the
East Asia Summit in Jakarta.  

I think the visit tomorrow will be consequential in many respects. 
There are a number of issues that we will seek to discuss in terms of
foreign policy and national security. 

The Indonesians always have important perspectives on critical issues
like the South China Sea, what they’re seeing in with — in respect to
China’s diplomacy and engagement, some of the areas of engagement as
part of ASEAN.  As you know, Indonesia has played a key role in trying
to develop a dialogue with Burma, with Myanmar. 

So, there are a number of issues, I think, that the two leaders will
want to discuss.  I think it will be critical to hear the perspectives
from Indonesia about the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. 
Indonesia, as you all know, is the largest Islamic country in the world
and major democracy.  And so, their views and their engagements are
critical.

I think the President will look to ask Indonesia to play a larger role
and to assist us as we go forward there. 

In addition, in the bilateral context, there are a number of things that
we’ve been working on.  I want to give full credit to our team, and
particularly \[senior administration official\]. 

I think you’ve seen some reports — we don’t really have anything more
for you at this juncture around critical minerals, but there have been
discussions here on technology with respect to Indonesia’s desire to
move up the ladder with respect to issues relating to technology and
manufacturing and fabing.

We will discuss climate change, some work that we’ve been able to do
together, educational initiatives.  There’s always so much to be done
with respect to advancing educational opportunities for Indonesians,
advancing more with respect to American campuses that are engaged in
country.  

I think you’ll also see a number of issues that basically seek to deepen
what we view as an absolutely central and critical role that Indonesia
plays. 

The President has had several interactions with Indonesia over the last
three years.  Really, today and tomorrow mark the beginning of the
presidential campaign in Indonesia, so this is likely one of the last
meetings that the two leaders will engage.  They enjoy a warm
relationship, and we’re very much looking forward to welcoming the
Indonesians to the White House for an afternoon tea, a private meeting
among a small group of aides, and then a larger bilateral in the Cabinet
Room. 

So this is something we’ve been preparing for for some time.  We all
recognize the central convening role that Indonesia plays in ASEAN, and
I think the President wants to thank President Widodo for all that he
has done to advance greater partnership between the United States and
ASEAN and Indonesia.  And we will look forward to build on that as we go
forward.

\[Senior administration official\].

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much, \[senior administration
official\], and thanks again to you all for joining today.  I’ll add
just a few quick comments to \[senior administration official\]’s great
opening remarks, and then look forward to questions that you might
have. 

As \[senior administration official\] indicated, you know, this visit is
going to be really consequential.  Not only are we on the cusp of our
75th year of diplomatic relations with Indonesia but, at this visit,
we’ll be taking our partnership to a truly new level, announcing a
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which is Indonesia’s highest
partnership tier. 

Of course, that follows, just a few months ago, our announcement of a
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Vietnam and in many ways just
builds upon our deep engagement in Southeast Asia and the fact that
we’re doing new and consequential things with many of that region’s
leaders. 

Of course, Indonesia is also a critical leader inside of ASEAN — the
most recent ASEAN chair — and always a strong voice within the
grouping. 

So, amongst many other topics, we’ll be talking about how we can
continue to bolster ASEAN centrality and work together on projects that
are of great interest and concern to ASEAN. 

Just to give you a sense of the lay of the land, in terms of our
deliverables, as \[senior administration official\] indicated, we are
looking at a future pathway towards cooperation on critical minerals. 
But we’re in the very early stages of that. 

We are looking closely on how we can cooperate with Indonesia to help
diversify its semiconductor ecosystem.  This is something that’s of
great I importance to President Jokowi, so we’re excited to be able to
partner on that.

We are going to be announcing a number of initiatives related to our
combined efforts to combat the climate crisis, building on our just
energy transition partnership.    
We’ll be layering on top of that some important new initiatives related
to carbon capture and storage, supporting Indonesia’s electricity grid,
improving air quality, and enhancing climate cooperation through ASEAN.

We’ll also have a number of security initiatives, which presage the
announcement of a strengthened defense cooperation arrangement and kicks
off new Coast Guard cooperation between our two countries, in addition
to closer cybersecurity partnerships.

Finally, I want to point to the fact that we’re going to have a couple
of consequential initiatives in the people-to-people space.  

We are very excited that Indonesia will be working with  
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service to announce the first
satellite program in Jakarta that will facilitate degree programs for
both American and Indonesian current and future policymakers.   
   
This is going to be the first American university that has a campus in
Indonesia and only the second international university, so we see this
as a critical not only bridge between our peoples but way to ensure that
our policymakers of the future are increasingly aligned in their views. 
And we’re really hopeful about this initiative.   
   
I also want to point to the fact that we will be partnering to help
restore Indonesia’s National Museum, which suffered a devastating fire
in September.  Now, together, U.S. experts will be working with experts
in Jakarta to train and help provide restoration services for this
national landmark.   
   
These initiatives really will run the gamut.  We think that’s really
important as President Widodo heads back to Indonesia to kick off their
electoral process in earnest and will really be capstones on a strong
history of cooperation between our two countries as we look towards the
next phase.   
   
Happy to pause there and take any questions.  

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  And, Michael, I think just to point out, you know,
obviously, we’re foc- — we’re focused on so much in the Middle East and
elsewhere, but you — I think you can sense from the depth of the
engagements, the broad-based nature of what we’ll be delivering with
respect to building a deeper, stronger relationship between the United
States and Indonesia going forward.  

MODERATOR:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\] and thank you,
\[senior administration official\] for those remarks.  
   
I think we will now enter the Q&A portion.   
   
Q    Thank you.  \[Senior administration officials\], I’m curious just
what the upgrade of the relationship will mean in terms of
military-to-military cooperation.  You know, for example, you had the
B-52 flying out of Indonesia over the summer.  That didn’t get a huge
amount of attention, but was quite a big deal.  Are we going to see more
things like that?  And can you give us a sense of what to expect?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  \[senior administration
official\], why don’t you lead?  I’ll provide some framing stuff, but,
\[senior administration official\], why don’t you just jump in quickly
if you would.    
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  Yeah, happy to.  We’re not
expecting to have a specific defense announcement of that particular
(inaudible) tomorrow.   What we are expecting is to be able to say that
we’re making substantial progress towards growing the defense
relationship in general.  By that, we mean expanded exercises, deeper
trainings in areas like cybersecurity cooperation and combating WMD.  Of
course, we continue to work on lots of very concrete projects.   
   
But what we’re looking towards in the immediate term is a broader
expansion and extension of the kind of everyday nuts and bolts that make
up this defense relationship.   
   
Secretary Austin will have the opportunity to move that forward with his
counterpart at ADMM-Plus this week.   
   
\[Senior administration official\], back to you.    
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, so I was going to mention that. 
So, we leave some of the deliverables on the security and military side,
Dmitri, to Secretary Austin.  I think, as you know, the Indonesians are
increasingly focused on their ability to project power or to be able to
understand and follow developments in their maritime periphery.  So much
more focused on capabilities that allow them to understand what’s going
on in their maritime domain, so that means radars, that means patrol
visits — patrol boats, probably more advanced aircraft at some point.  
   
I would just signal, Dmitri, that in almost every one of those domains
there are substantial procurement decisions that are looming.  And the
United States has several defense firms that are actively engaged in
that market and in each of those campaigns.  So, we won’t really talk
too much about them, but we will seek to support a variety of dialogues
that are essentially about a growing defense relationship between the
United States and Indonesia.    
   
I think, as you probably know, in the past there, perhaps, had been some
ambivalence in Jakarta.  I think some of that ambivalence has faded as
they’ve seen so many practical engagements of the United States with
allies and partners around the Indo-Pacific.   
   
It is probably also the case that they are somewhat more uncertain about
what to expect with respect to the South China Sea.  And a much more
robust set of Chinese activities and patrols near Natuna Islands and
elsewhere has certainly garnered attention in Jakarta.  And I think
that’s going to be one of the issues that not only Secretary Austin but
we will be discussing tomorrow as well.  

Q    Hi, yes, thank you.  Hi, \[senior administration official\].  Hi,
\[senior administration official\].  Thanks so much for doing this.  One
quick logistical question.  What time is a bilat tomorrow?   
   
And then on the critical minerals, you said that it’s very early stages,
but can we expect any kind of announcement that negotiations will start
and whether it will be — kind of looking ahead towards what Indonesia
wants, which is a limited free trade agreement of sorts or is it going
to be something (inaudible) a trade pillar?  
   
And if you could just indulge me on one more.  Obviously, the leaders
have very different positions on the war in Gaza.  I think President
Jokowi will be coming from Riyadh after the Islamic Summit, where he
will be bringing a message for — to push for a ceasefire.  And so, just
wanted to hear your thoughts on how the President would respond.  Thank
you.    
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Well, thank you, Patsy.  I
think we got most of your questions.  Why don’t I start, and then I’ll
ask \[senior administration official\] to jump in.  
   
Well, let me take your last question first.  Look, it is undeniable that
Indonesia’s views, its values, and its approach not just to Gaza but to
the Middle East is very important in how we think about our own next
steps.   
   
I know that the President is going to want to listen carefully to what
President Widodo heard and what his perspectives are with respect to
discussions he’s just undertaken in Saudi Arabia and with other Arab and
Middle East leaders.  So, I think that conversation will be
important.   
   
I don’t want to get ahead of the, you know — kind of where we, you know,
might end up.  But I will just underscore that part of what we’ve tried
to do over the course of the last several years is ensure that there is
an active Indo-Pacific role not just in the Indo-Pacific but when there
are developments elsewhere.  
   
And you’ve seen that, obviously, with Ukraine — unprecedented sets of
engagement.   
   
And I think what we’re likely to hear from the Indonesians is not just
about the ceasefire issue — which, of course, is extremely important in
the immediate — but we’ll also be talking about long-term goals — or
medium-term and long-term goals and objectives — a just peace, a
two-state solution, substantial resources that will be necessary to
rebuild and give hope to shattered lives.  And I think those are areas
that we look forward to working closely with Indonesia on given its
leading role.    
   
On your first question, let me just say that we are at the very early
stages, as \[senior administration official\] indicated.  We know it’s
important — and, frankly, Indonesia has a vast supply of critical
resources that are going to be essential in the 21st century economies
of — of automobiles, recycla- — recyclable capabilities, issues
associated with long-life batteries.  We could go on and on —
semiconductors.  
   
And so, we — we want very much to begin a process with Indonesia that
leads us towards a consequential partnership in this area.   
   
But I think it would be — I think it’s going to be important that the
two sides begin a process in which we hear from each other what our
expectations are.  I think we know clearly some of the things that
Indonesia is looking for, but they’re going to have to hear from us what
some of our hopes and expectations are as well.   
   
So, I think what you’ll likely hear is indications that both sides are
certainly prepared to take those steps and are ambitious about what
they’d like to accomplish as they move forward.   
   
\[Senior administration official\]?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\].   The only key term that I’ll add to your explanation is the
term “work plan.”  What we are expecting to be able to say tomorrow is
that we are moving forward together on an agreed pathway that will —
will certainly be a process to understand what will be possible by way
of a critical minerals agreement.   
   
That work plan is intended to prepare both of our systems to move
forward.  And the work plan is also intended to acknowledge that as we
move forward with any partner in the critical mineral space, we’ll need
to do so in accordance with the highest of labor and environmental
standards, as is true with everything that this administration does.    
   
So, the next steps we take will be to make sure that both of our systems
are prepared to move forward together.    
   
We’re excited about this initiative, but as \[senior administration
official\] indicated, we are at the — the very first phase.  And that’s
what the leaders will be discussing tomorrow.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Also — I should also say that I think
the meeting is — I — I don’t know the exact time, but it is basically
going to be like a high tea, in which the President and President Widodo
will meet privately in the Oval Office with a small group of aides.  I’m
sure we’ll talk about some sensitive issues there.   
   
They will then move across the hallway for a high tea in the Cabinet
Office with a larger group of key players from both of our
administration.   
   
I will say one of the things that was clear from the laydown that — that
\[senior administration official\] provided is that we have a very
strong push from across the government.  This is not a simply White
House-led initiative.  Every government agency — USAID, the climate
czar, State Department, every element — Commerce, Treasury — have deep
contacts and engagements with Indonesia.  And those will be on full
display tomorrow as well.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And I’ll just jump in and say, Patsy,
we’ll — we can get you an exact schedule for tomorrow.  
   
And, Moderator, back to you for Q&A.  
   
MODERATOR:  All right, we are moving to the next caller in queue.  Danny
Kemp, your line is unmuted.  You may go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi.  Can you hear me?  
   
MODERATOR:  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Great, yes.  Thanks for — thanks for doing this.  
   
You mentioned earlier about a — a larger role for Indonesia in respect
to the Middle East.   Could you elaborate on that a bit?  I mean, would
that particularly be a larger role in — in resolving the immediate
situation?  Because I know you were talking about things further down
the line, but — yeah. Can you just elaborate on that a bit, please?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I — look, I would say, at this
juncture, all of that’s still aspirational and uncertain.  
   
I — I think at — at very least, President Widodo has been outspoken
about issues associated with the Middle East.  But he’s also been very
attentive to the ongoing conflict — for instance, in Ukraine — seeking
to basically ensure that there is both an Indonesian and ASEAN voice for
global issues.   
   
So, I think what we would simply say is we welcome that.  And we do
believe, because of Indonesia’s role as the largest Islamic state in the
w- — in — in the world, that its views are deeply consequential.  
   
And I do think they want to go beyond just simply providing a voice. 
They are interested in practical engagements.  And we’re seeing,
increasingly, a global Indonesia, and we support that.   
   
And I think the President is looking forward to those conversations
tomorrow about how some of that can be actualized.  
   
MODERATOR:  All right, we are going to move to the next caller in
queue.  Chris, your line is unmuted.  You may go ahead.  
   
Q    Hello.  I have a question about how this meeting with the
Indonesian President might help President Biden prepare to meet with
President Xi at APEC.  You know, tell me a little bit more about the —
the connection between those two things and — and how one might help
prepare for the other.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Look, I’ll give you some perspectives,
but \[senior administration official is very good on this stuff.   
   
Look, I would — I would simply say that I wouldn’t look at this one
meeting in isolation.  I would look at it as part of a substantial set
of efforts over years to build stronger partnerships with allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific and  
elsewhere in Europe in which we reaffirm our common approaches to shared
challenges and opportunities, deeper commitment across the board on
issues of mutual interest.   
   
And so, what I would be looking at is this visit, of course, given
Indonesia’s leading role in ASEAN, but also, you know, the President’s
lifting of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in Vietnam, last month
his visit to India as part of the G20 and the steps that we’ve taken in
advance of that with respect to technology, the trilateral meeting that
was held in in — in Camp David, all the work that we’ve done to advance
Japan’s legitimate security interests.   
   
I think, you know, what we’re seeking to do — the state visit of
Australia — is to make clear that we are going to stand with our
partners and allies — that that is an essential — probably the essential
element of our combined strategy.  And we want both those countries to
be reassured that we stand with them, but also that — that we are
confident that — that through these engagements that we are better —
better able to sit down with President Xi and present a kind of common
front on matters of mutual interest across the board.   
   
And I would also say — look, I think you know this.  These — these —
these countries in ASEAN and elsewhere, they want closer communication
between the United States and China.  They want a situation that is —
that is not risking global conflict.  They want communication, they want
dialogue, and they want an appropriate level of engagement between
Washington and Beijing.  And I think that’s what President Biden is
seeking to do.   
   
But at the same time, none of these countries either want a G2, in which
the United States and China are taking decisions about the region or
about countries without them in the room.  And that’s something that I
think we’re deeply sensitive to as well.   
   
\[Senior administration official\]?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Senior administration official\],
just to put a fine point on what you just said: I just emphasize that
the President will be headed out to San Francisco and APEC (inaudible)
with the U.S. economy in an extraordinarily strong position,
historically strong position, and with the U.S. system of alliances and
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific also historically strong.   
   
But of course, as you indicated, that builds on all the work we’ve been
doing for three years, our recent diplomacy across the region, and
Indonesia is a critical piece of that puzzle, particularly in Southeast
Asia.   
   
The way that we’re thinking of the visit as preparatory is really about
that position of strength that we feel really good about and we think
represents a lot of hard work to invest in the region, (inaudible)
critical organizations and decisions and partnerships since President
Biden came into office.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Moderator\], I can take one last
question, if that’s all right with you.  Thank you.   
   
MODERATOR:  Yes, we do have a final question in queue.  We have Trevor
Hunnicutt from Reuters.   
   
Q    Thank you all for doing this call ahead of a very busy week.   
   
Just on the point of a global Indonesia, I was curious if the topic of
Myanmar is going to come up between the two leaders, the deteriorating
situation there, and what your current assessment is of that situation
and what role ASEAN can play there.  Thank you.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, thank you.  And you’re so right. 
There’s so many issues that are going to come up.  We’ve talked about
some of them, and I mentioned at the outset — I do believe an issue of
critical mutual interest is the very worrisome security environment in —
in Myanmar — in Burma.  
   
I think the United States has been very supportive of the ASEAN effort
to engage Burma/Myanmar, the leadership over the last couple of years. 
I think we’re all discouraged and disappointed that that effort has not
made more progress and, at the same time, that we see a continuing
negative spiral inside the country.  And I think it’s going to be time
soon for us to think about what our next steps are together to deal with
a situation that is untenable.   
   
\[Senior administration official\]?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’ll just add to that to say that
Indonesia plays an incredibly important role in ASEAN’s approach to
Myanmar.  You know, as you know, Trevor, Indonesia — Indonesia was in
the ASEAN Chair this past year.  As the ASEAN Chair hands over to Laos,
our friends in ASEAN have agreed to basically keep together a little bit
of a collective leadership on the Myanmar issue that is going to be
represented in an ASEAN troika.  
   
So, our friends in Jakarta will continue to play a leadership role on
the Myanmar issue inside of ASEAN for some time to come.  And that’s
part of why we’re so focused on the President and President Widodo
having a really substantive conversation on the situation.   
   
As you say, it is grinding, it is heartbreaking, it is very
discouraging.  And we have a strong, strong interest in working together
towards a better pathway.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, guys.  \[Moderator\], thank
you very much.  We really appreciate this opportunity.  We’ll be
debriefing folks next week as well.  Thank you.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you, \[senior administration official\].  Thank you,
\[senior administration official\], for joining today’s call.  And thank
you to everyone who joined.   
   
Just as a reminder, this call is on background, attributed to “senior
administration officials,” and is under embargo until 5:00 a.m. Monday
morning.  
   
Please feel free to reach out to our press team here and myself with any
additional questions, and hope everyone has a great afternoon.
