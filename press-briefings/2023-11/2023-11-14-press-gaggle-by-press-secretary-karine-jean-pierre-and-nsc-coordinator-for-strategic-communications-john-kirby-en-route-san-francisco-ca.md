En Route San Francisco, California

2:07 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I got a couple of things at the top before I turn it
over to the Admiral.  Thank you.  
   
So, this morning, President Biden shared big news in his work to tackle
climate change.  Over the past two and a half years, President Biden has
delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda in history, from signing
into law the largest investment in climate action ever, to including
more than $50 billion in climate resilience, to taking bold action to
reduce climate pollution across every sector of the economy, to
protecting more than 21 million acres of public lands and waters, to
restoring the vital role of science and guiding the Biden-Harris
administration’s decision-making.  
   
As a result of the President’s leadership and economic plan, energy jobs
are on ri- — on rise across the country and we’re on track to cut carbon
pollution in half by 2030.  
   
And as you heard from the President a short while ago, we’re not
stopping there.  The Fifth — the Fifth National Climate Assessment
released today shows that not only is every region of a country already
experiencing the impacts of climate change, we’re also making
progress.  
   
To keep building on that progress, the President announced more than $6
billion in investment to make communities across the country more
resilient to the impacts of climate change, including by strengthening
America’s aging electric grid infrastructure, reducing flood risks to
communities, supporting conservation efforts, and advancing
environmental justice.  
   
Now turning over to the economy.  Today’s CPI report that came out this
morning shows more progress bri- — bringing down inflation while
maintaining one of the strongest job markets in history.  
   
President Biden is delivering results for the American people.   
   
Inflation has fallen 65 percent since last summer.  Core inflation is at
the lowest level in more than two years.  Wages are higher than before
the pandemic.   
   
Gas prices are down by $1.65 from their peak after Putin’s invasion of
Ukraine, providing breathing room to families ahead of holiday travel.  
   
Grocery inflation is at its lowest level in over two years.  Egg, milk
prices are lower than they were a year ago.  
   
President Biden will keep fighting to lower costs, from taking on Big
Pharma to lower prescription drug costs, to investing in clean energy to
lower energy bills, to cracking down on junk fees.  
   
Unfortunately, that stands in stark contrast to what congressional
Republicans are doing, pushing trickle-down eco- — wow, hold on, guys —
economics by slashing taxes for the wealthy and standing with Big
Pharma, oi- — Big Oil, and other special interests that raise costs for
families.  
   
Finally, I wanted to highlight that last Friday, the Major Cities Chiefs
Association published data on violent crime for the first nine months of
2023 and compared it to the same period in 2022.  That data showed that
violent crime, which fell in 2022, is continuing to fall in 2023.  The
total number of homicides in — in the reporting jurisdictions dropped
more than 10 percent.  Rapes dropped 7.6 percent, aggravated assault
dropped 3.4 percent, and robberies dropped 2.5 percent.  
   
The Biden-Harris administration’s investment, including the $50 billion
from the American Rescue Plan, that cities have used to improve public
safety is working.   
   
But, of course, we have more work to do.  And that is why the President
has proposed more than 100,000 police officers that engage in community
policing.  The President urges Republicans to support his proposal.  
   
With that, I have the Admiral joining me today to — to speak to
tomorrow’s summit with Xi and anything else on APEC that you may want to
ask and, of course, the Middle East conflict.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Karine.  
   
I know you all heard from Jake yesterday about the — the meeting with
President Xi and, of course, APEC.  I won’t be able to improve much upon
what Jake said.  I’ll just tell you that going into APEC, I mean, the
President really feels we got the wind at our back here.   
   
And with 21 economies, 60 percent of global economic output represented
here in San Francisco, it’s — it’s an exciting time.  
   
And he’ll be focusing, really, on three things.  
   
One, not only improve and increase American investment in the region,
but the region’s investment in the United States.   
   
Number two, lifting up and looking towards a vision for better
international worker standards, cleaner environments, safer
environments, collective bargaining, a chance for international workers
to be able to compete on a level playing field.  
   
And number three, building a more inclusive economy across the region.  
   
Again, Jake covered all that yesterday.  
   
I do want to just give you some updates on the Middle East if you’ll
just bear with me here.  Since the very early hours after October 7th,
the President has been personally engaged throughout the region. 
There’s just been a lot of coordination, daily touchpoints with a number
of partners all run out of the NSC, led by Jake Sullivan.  
   
And he’s — the President has dispatched a number of senior officials to
the region.  Obviously, Secretary Blinken has made a couple of
significant trips there.  
   
But that’s why I think you saw us announce earlier that the NSC
Coordinator for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, is traveling to Europe
and the Middle East this week.  And he’s leaving today.  He’s going to
Belgium, Israel, the West Bank, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and
Jordan.  
   
Of course, the primary focus is going to be ensuring that we’re freeing
the hostages, that we’re doing everything we can to get them released,
including the Americans that are being held.  But he’s also going to be
focusing on how we can contain this conflict and that we can prevent any
further escalation as well as any effort by anybody to deepen the
conflict.  
   
We also are obviously going to keep working — and Brett will be doing
this — with our partners on the humanitarian assistance front to make
sure that the aid is getting in as well as people getting out.  
   
I think you may have also noticed all — I’ll just draw your attention to
it — Treasury Department issued another round of sanctions against Hamas
today.  This is the third one since the attacks.  
   
Together with our partners, we’re going to be decisively  
moving to degrade Hamas’s financial infrastructure, cut them off from
outside funding, and block the new funding channels that they seek to
finance their terrorism.   
   
Now, on the hospitals, I can confirm for you that we have information
that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the
Gaza Strip, including Al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them to conceal
and to support their military operations and to hold hostages.    
   
Hamas and the Palestinian — Palestinian Islamic Jihad — PIJ — members
operate a command-and-control node from Al-Shifa in Gaza City.  They
have stored weapons there, and they’re prepared to respond to an Israeli
military operation against that facility.    
   
Now, to be clear, we do not support striking a hospital from the air,
and we do not want to see a firefight in the hospital where innocent
people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the
medical care that they deserve — not to be caught in a crossfire. 
Hospitals and patients must be protected.    
   
And this just points out how challenging the military operation is,
because Hamas has deeply embedded itself within the civilian
population.  Israel has now an added burden that they have to — I’m
sorry, they have an added burden, given the way that Hamas operates.    
   
But as we have been clear on multiple occasions, Hamas actions did not
lessen Israel’s responsibilities to protect civilians in Gaza.  And this
is something that we obviously are going to continue to have an active
conversation with our counterparts about.  
   
And then, just — just to touch on some of the figures over the last 24
hours: Some 115 more trucks carrying humanitarian aid were able to enter
Gaza.  That brings the total now to around 1,100.  Again, we know it’s
not enough.  We know more must be done.  We got to accelerate it.  We
got to increase it.  But we’re up over a thousand trucks now that have
gotten in.    
   
And then since the 1st of November, we are now aware of more than 600
Americans and their family members who have been able to depart and —
and seek the support of our embassy team, our consular team on the
ground in Egypt.    
   
Q    Kirby, just on the — on the —  
   
Q    Hostages — on the hostages —  
   
Q    Could I just — on the hospitals, first of all, what evidence or
support or sourcing do you have to support the claim that you just made
about Hamas?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, it comes from a variety of intelligence sourcing.  I
think you can understand that we’re not going to be able to provide a
whole lot of granular detail on that.  We have to protect sources and
methods, but we were able to downgrade some information to be able to
provide it with — for you today.  But it comes from a variety of
intelligence methods of our own — of our own.   
   
Q    Does that change the idea of whether or not there should be a
ceasefire at the hospital in order to get the patients out?  I mean,
does this change the calculation?  Would you — would the U.S. support a
—  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I think —  
   
Q    — temporary ceasefire at this point?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I want to be clear, when we’re talking ceasefire versus
pause, there’s a difference.  So, we don’t support a ceasefire.  We
think that’s going to benefit Hamas.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) pause?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  But we do support these humanitarian pauses that the Israeli
military put in place.    
   
Now some of them have gone up to seven hours a day, which is a good
thing.  It’s allowing people to get out and to get to safety.    
   
As I said in my topper, and you heard Jake talk about this yesterday, we
don’t support attacks on hospitals.  We don’t want innocent patients who
are just trying to get needed medical care to be caught in the crossfire
here.  And this does point to the added burden that the Israeli Defense
Force has.   
   
As I said in my opening statement, now have information that confirms
that Hamas is using that particular hospital for a command-and-control
node and probably storage of equipment, weapons up underneath that. 
This is — this is — that is a war crime.   That — that does make it much
more difficult for the Israeli Defense Forces.  
   
Q    On the hostages, it seems we’re getting closer to a hostage deal. 
There seems to be indications and reports of that.  Can you give us any
information about how that’s moving?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  All I can tell you is that we are in active discussions as
we speak, right now, with our counterparts in the region.  And one of
the things that Brett will be doing when he goes over there is to
continue to have that work, to continue — to continue that work.  So,
it’s an hour-by-hour discussion.  
   
I think you can understand why I wouldn’t get into too much detail about
these active negotiations, lest I say something that — that puts them in
jeopardy.  
   
But as you heard the President talk about this earlier this morning, you
know, we’re — we’re confident that we’re putting the energy and the
effort into that, and we’re going to keep — we’re going to keep at
it.   
   
Q    Is there anything to that Washington Post report about the possible
exchange of around 70 civilian hostages in exchange for a five-day
ceasefire?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I’m just not going to get into the details.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) on ICBC — the ransomware attack on ICBC.  First, did
the U.S. give any sense of a warning to China about the vulnerability of
that — of that ransomware?  And second, is that something that you would
foresee coming up in the leaders’ meeting tomorrow?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I — I don’t — we’re wa- — aware of the attack and,
certainly, we’re monitoring that.  I don’t have a lot of information for
you.    
   
We — you know, the Treasurer is in touch with the financial regulators
and with the market itself, but I really don’t have much more
information on that.  It’s obviously something we’re going to watch very
closely.    
   
And as for whether it’ll come up tomorrow, I don’t want to get ahead of
the President and the discussion that he’s going to have.  
   
Believe me, the agenda will be a very full agenda with President Xi.  
   
Q    Does the President have plans to talk to Netanyahu before APEC gets
underway, before his focus shifts to the summit in San Francisco?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware of any calls on his schedule with Prime
Minister Netanyahu as we’re speaking right now.   
   
But he has maintained a constant communication with the Prime Minister,
and I have every expectation that they’ll be talking again, probably
multiple times.  I just don’t — I couldn’t tell you exactly when that’s
going to happen.  
   
Q    And on the sanctions — the Treasury sanctions on Hamas — are you
seeing any evidence that that’s having any impact right now?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I mean, sanctions sometimes take a little while before
you can actually see the practical impacts, and we’ve done three rounds
since the — the attacks.  And oftentimes, the effect just takes a little
while.  So, I couldn’t tell you one way or another how much impact it’s
had so far.  But eventually, these things — they will certainly put a —
will certainly put at a disadvantage their ability to fund themselves,
resource themselves, provide capabilities to their fighters.   
   
We’ll — and, you know, this is the third round.  We certainly aren’t
going to take off the table any additional sanctions.   
   
Q    In tomorrow’s meeting with President Xi, China’s Foreign Ministry
says they’d like to see, quote, “concrete actions” in terms of U.S.
support for Taiwanese —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Who said that?  
   
Q    The Chinese Foreign Ministry said they’d like to see “concrete
actions” in terms of U.S. support of the One China policy.  Whereas, as
we know, the U.S. would like to see Taiwanese citizens being able to
exercise their right to vote freely and fairly.  How do you square those
two positions?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  First of all, nothing has changed about our One China
policy, and we have been crystal clear about that.  We  
obviously don’t support independence for Taiwan.   
   
We certainly want to see Taiwan’s democracy continue to flourish.  
   
We don’t — don’t want to see any cross-trade tensions that are solved
unilaterally or upsetting the status quo in a unilateral way, certainly
not by force.   
   
So, there’s no change to our One China policy.  
   
Q    You said last week when asked about the President’s schedule that
the luggage isn’t on the plane yet.  You didn’t want to — you said last
week when asked about the President’s schedule for the conference that
the luggage wasn’t on the plane yet, so you didn’t want to talk about
it.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Well, we hope the luggage is on the plane.  But I wanted to ask how
fluid is the President’s schedule given the budget —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President is looking forward to a good week in San
Francisco and to a very robust agenda at APEC.  And  — and then I think
I’ll just leave it at that.  
   
Q    So, there’s no plans to possibly leave early, go back to
Washington, or —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re — we’re focused on having a good week in San
Francisco.  And — and I have no updates to his schedule to talk about.  
   
Q    Related to Xi, what interests does China have in what’s happening
in the Middle East right now?  And why has their approach been so
different to the United States on that issue?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’d have to point you to President Xi to speak to his views
of what’s going on in the Middle East.  I won’t speak for another
foreign leader.  And I certainly won’t speak for their comments and —
and how they’ve reacted to what’s going on in the Middle East.   
   
All I can do is tell you what we’re doing, and I just did that.  And the
President is going to stay focused on what’s going on.   
   
I have no doubt, Trevor, that — that the situation in the Middle East
will come up in the context of the bilateral discussion with President
Xi.  President Biden will be eager to hear President Xi’s perspectives
on this.   
   
They have — they have lines of communication in the region in some ways
that we don’t.  And, certainly, we would — we would welcome
opportunities for — if China was willing to be helpful in — in making
sure that Israel can get the support that it needs to defend itself and
that we can get humanitarian assistance to those in need.  
   
Q    And then also related to APEC —

MR. KIRBY:  And we don’t — and that we — there’s not an escalation or
deepening or widening of the conflict by any other actor in the
region.   
   
Q    And then related to — also related to APEC.  What discussions do
you expect the U.S. delegation to have with the Russian delegation
that’s on site?  And — and who is the senior-most member of that
delegation?  And how will you be engaging with them?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s their Deputy Prime Minister, and I’m not — I’m going to
blank on the name.  Their Deputy Prime Minister is representing them. 
And we look forward to having them as part of this larger economic
framework and discussion.  
   
Q    Admiral — Admiral, President Xi has met with President Putin.  So,
how is Russia and Ukraine going to come up in the talks between
President Biden and President Xi?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m sorry, say that again.  
   
Q    So, President Xi has met with President Putin and is keeping those
lines open.  So, how is the fight in the Ukraine going to come up
between President Biden and President Xi?  Like, what’s going to be
discussed there?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I don’t want to get ahead of the conversation that
hasn’t happened yet.  I do think that certainly they will want to talk
about what’s going on in Ukraine, and the President will make clear that
we’re going to continue to support Ukraine against Russia’s
aggression.   
   
And that — and, again, China could play a role here in helping us
support Ukraine but also to — helping advance President Zelenskyy’s
vision of a — of a just peace here for when — for when the conflict is
over.   
   
But I won’t speak for the Chinese and what — what they will or won’t say
about that.  But I have every expectation that the fighting in Ukraine
will come up.  
   
Q    Given so much attention given tomorrow to the President’s meeting
with President Xi, can you talk about the preparation and negotiations
for the lead-up to tomorrow?  Was it a smooth negotiation?  Were there
contentious points?  What were some of the things that were talked about
about the two leaders sitting down together?  Like, give us a little bit
of a sense of what we’re going to see in the choreography tomorrow and
how that came about.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, look, I mean, anytime you do a meeting at the leader
level, particularly between our two countries, you know, there’s weeks
and weeks of discussion about what’s going to be on the agenda, what’s
not going to be on the agenda, how we want the — the meeting to
progress.   
   
And then, of course, it gets down to execution.  Once these guys sit
down at the table — you saw in Bali, it went on for, like, three-plus
hours.  These are two leaders that know each other well, known each
other a long, long time.  They can be frank and forthright with one
another.  I fully expect that that will be the case.   
   
I’m not going to get into the back-and-forth between the two teams about
— about how the — all the modalities came into place.  But — but I think
— look, I think the table has been set — again, over the course of many
weeks — for what — what we hope will be a very productive, candid,
constructive conversation here.   
   
The President wants to make sure that we’re handling this most
consequential of bilateral relationships in the most responsible way
forward.   
   
He means to compete with China.  He’s coming into this discussion,
again, with the wind at his back, from an economic perspective.  He
thinks the United States is well-poised in that competition with China. 
He’s not going to be afraid to — to confront where confrontation is
needed on issues where we don’t see eye to eye with President Xi and the
PRC.  But we’re also not going to be afraid, nor should we be afraid, as
a confident nation, to engage in diplomacy on ways which we can
cooperate with China — on climate change, for instance, and clean energy
technology.   
   
So, there’s going to be an awful lot on the agenda.  All of that was —
was worked out between the two teams and baked in, and — and we’re
looking forward to seeing where it’s going to go.   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Will there be — are they going to wear matching outfits for the —
for the family — for the family photo at the end?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What?  
   
Q    I know.  It’s ridiculous.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    T-shirts.  
   
Q    Yeah, matching t-shirts.  
   
Q    So, there’s a tradition at the end of APEC that the leaders wear
some kind of matching outfits.  But the last time it was held in the
U.S., Obama — it was in Hawaii, and Obama did not want to have everybody
wear Hawaiian shirts because he thought it was kind of embarrassing. 
So, I guess there’s a question about whether or not there’s going to be
matching outfits this year.  I don’t know.  Are they all going to wear
aviators?  I don’t know.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, you got me there.  I wasn’t aware of that one.  I’ll —
I’ll take that back —   
   
Q    I swear it’s a thing.  I swear.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — and ask.  I — I take your word for it, but first I heard
of that.  
   
Q    Kirby, do you have any sense of whether President Biden will meet
with the Taiwanese delegation that’s attending APEC?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Other than President Xi, I don’t have additional bilateral
or even pull-aside discussions to speak to today.  I mean, there’ll be a
lot of leaders here, and we’ll see how things shake — shape out.  But
the only one that I — that I can speak to is the bilat with President
Xi.  
   
Q    On Indonesia, the President was seeking something like a free trade
agreement regarding critical minerals.  He didn’t get it yesterday. 
Why?  And is that going to be part of IPEF?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Is that going to be what?  
   
Q    Part of the IPEF (inaudible).  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of the agenda here for the
next few days.  I mean, we’ll — there’s a robust set of discussions,
including on progress on the pillars of IPEF.  And we’ll have more to
say about that in — in coming days.   
   
And as for critical minerals, there was a — there was a good discussion
with President Widodo about critical minerals and making — making sure
that — that we can work collaboratively in the region to provide more
resilient supply chains for raw materials like that.   
   
So, I think that’s about as far as I’ll go.   
   
Q    On the choreography of the meetings with President Xi, do we know
it’s going to work?  Are they’re going to have a handshake?  Are they
going to give statements?  How long?  And also can you tell us where it
will happen?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’m not going to get into much of the modalities.  I
mean, there’ll be a — obviously a — you know, a classic bilateral
discussion between the two leaders.  There’ll be an expanded bilateral
discussion with the two teams, but beyond that — and then, you know, I
think you’ll get a chance to hear from the President directly after
that.  But beyond that, I’m — I don’t have more detail.  
   
Q    On the aid trucks going into Gaza, you said 115 —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Right.  
   
Q    — and that that’s not enough.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s over the last 24 hours.  
   
Q    Over the last 24 hours, but not enough, you had said.  Have you —
do you feel that with these pauses that the pace has picked up a little
bit, though — that that’s made a difference in the past couple of
days?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  What the pause have done — I would — it would be hard to
draw a direct line between the pauses and the trucks going in.  The
pauses are largely in North Gaza, so away from the Rafah Crossing.   
   
What the pauses have done, though, predominantly, is allow people in
North Gaza to leave.  The Israelis now have two safe corridors — one to
the east and then one to the west along the coast road.  And that’s
opened up more avenues for people to move by foot.   
   
So, it’s really had an effect on — on getting people out of harm’s way,
which we hope, just mathematically speaking, would help alleviate the
risk — the greater risk of civilian casualties because now there’s now
just fewer people in the crossfire.   
   
But it hasn’t really been tied to the Rafah Crossing.  That work is
ongoing.  
   
Q    So, going back to the Xi meeting, a slightly funner topic, but will
—  
   
MR. KIRBY:  More fun than the —  
   
Q    Than the t-shirts?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — matching shirts?  
   
Q    I know.  More fun.   
   
Will President Biden ask President Xi about pandas and getting more
pandas for the U.S.?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re sorry to see the pandas go.  But, obviously, that was
a sovereign decision by the PRC, and, of course, we have to respect
that.  
   
Q    Kirby, should — will there be any U.S. action against Ukraine if
it’s found that they were at all involved in sabotaging the Nord Stream
pipeline?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’m not going to get ahead of what’s active
investigations here on the Nord Stream Two and the pipeline.  And I’m
certainly not going to speak hypothetically about what the results of
that investigation might be.   
   
What we’re focused on is making sure that Ukraine continues to get what
they need.  And right now, that’s a — it’s a critical need as they are
still fighting in this counteroffensive.  And without supplemental
funding, you know, we’re going to — we’re going to have a harder time
here.  The runway is getting shorter and shorter for our ability to
support them.  
   
Q    The President has a decision to make about a sanctions waiver on
Iran that would free up $10 billion that’s frozen, I believe, in an
Iraqi bank.  What’s he going to decide and what is the justification
for?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Won’t get ahead of the President’s decision making.   
   
But I will tell you this: We continue to hold Iran accountable.  We’ve
added force posture in the region.  We have sanctioned, in two and a
half years, some 400 entities — 300 in just the last year alone — for
all manner of Iranian destabilizing behavior: the way they’re treating
their protesters, the way they’re supporting Russia, and a — and the way
they’re threatening maritime shippin- — shipping in the Gulf Region. 
So, we’re not turning any — nobody is turning any blind eye to Iran’s
destabilizing activities.  We’re going to continue to keep that pressure
on them.  
   
Okay?  
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
Q    Thanks, Kirby.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Colleen?  
   
Hold on.  It’s a little bumpy.  
   
Q    I know.  I’m leaning against the side.  
   
So, on the — the CR, should the Hou- — should the White House have come
out so strongly against the two-tiered CR, especially now that it’s
looking like it might pass?  Where are — is the White House on it right
now?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, not at all.  Look, I’m — and I’m going to quote
something that — that was — that was in the statement from Saturday,
which is “House Republicans need to stop wasting time on their own
political divisions, \[to\] do their jobs, and work in a bipartisan way
to prevent a shutdown.”  So, that is still very true.  We are not going
to back away from that.   
   
But we’ve — we’ve been saying, and you heard from the President
yesterday, you heard from me yesterday as well: We are in touch with
that — with both leadership in the Senate and in the House to talk about
the best path forward for the American people.  That’s what we’re — we
care about: How do we move forward for the American people?  And so, we
believe that House Republicans need to continue to do their jobs,
right?  We should not be here.  We should not be just a couple of days
away — a place that we were before, as you all know, not too long ago —
and — and so — in September — so, we should — they should get this
done.  They should get this done.  
   
Q    Do you think the President will support the two-tier?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, they were having a conversation.  “They,” meaning
the Democrats’ leadership in the House and the Senate, and obviously
they’re going to be, from what I understand, voting on it today.  And
so, we’re going to let that process happen.  We’re not going to get
ahead of that process.   
   
The most important thing here is to make sure that we move forward and
they — in the best possible way for the American people.  And that’s
where we’re going to be on this.  
   
Q    But the White House hasn’t given an indication to Democrats that
they should or should not —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re letting —  
   
Q    — be voting on this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re letting the process happen.  We’re letting the
conversations and — the conversation happen in the House and the Senate
with Democrats.  And there’s going to be a vote, and we’re going to see
how this turns out.   
   
Q    So, if Democrats support this, the President would sign this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into hypotheticals from here. 
I’m going to let the process happen in — on the Capitol — right? — in
Capitol Hill.  Let them have a conversation.  There’s going to be a
vote.  We’re just not going to get ahead of what they’re going to decide
to do.   
   
Again, we want to move in the best path forward for the American
people.  That’s our — that’s our objective here.  That’s what we want to
know.    
   
Q    But has the President talked to congressional Democrats about
this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, our Legislative Affairs Office has
been in touch with — with the leadership in Congress — and also — and
also our OMB director.  We’ve been in touch with them for some time.   
   
Now, obviously, this is something that House Republicans have to fix. 
We’ve been very clear about that.  And I don’t have any calls — we don’t
have any calls to read out of any conversation that the President has
had.   
   
But obviously, on this trip, he’s going to stay in close contact with
the office of — his team — right? — Office of Leg Affairs.  He’s going
to stay in close contact with congressional leaders as well.  Just don’t
have anything to preview at this time.  
   
Q    Sorry, I didn’t — I’m just — I just let everybody jump in.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    But if this vote is happening in two hours — the White House hasn’t
given Democrats any indication that the President would veto or sign
this —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We —  
   
Q    — even if they’re about to take a vote in two hours?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ve been — that’s not the first time.  Right?   
   
Q    No, I know.  But —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Right?  There’s been —  
   
Q    — I’m saying, on something specific like this where there’s such a
—  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I hear you.  What —   
   
Q    — so much at stake on Friday —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And that’s exactly right.  And we shouldn’t be where
we are today — right? — because so much is at stake.  We’re talking
about vital programs for the American people.  You’re 1,000 percent
right.  We should not be here.  And we’ve been very clear about that —
very clear about that.   
   
But what we’re saying is: There’s conversations happening on the Hill. 
Yes, the vote is happening — I don’t know — in two hours, at four
o’clock, but there’s still conversations, right?  They’re still
negotiating.  They’re still having conversations.  We’re just not going
to get ahead of that.  
   
We’re going to get the leadership in the Dem- — in the — and the
Democrats’ leadership in the House and the Senate, make those — have
those conversations.  We’re just not going to get ahead of that.   
   
What we want to see is a — the best path forward for the American
people.  That’s who we’re putting first here.  That’s who is the most
important thing.  
   
We’re talking about critical, important programs that need to be funding
— funded to keep our law enforcement on the — getting paid; to make sure
our national security is — is in — is where it needs to be; to make sure
education, food security, all of these things that are so vital to — to
Americans.  That’s what’s our main priority, and that’s what we’re going
to let the Democrat leadership in both the House and the Senate have
those conversations.  And that’s what we want to see play out.  And so,
we’re —  
   
Q    So, would —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — not going to get ahead of that.   
   
Q    So, would the President be back in Washington, D.C., before a
shutdown takes place?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I know he just asked — someone — Emily just asked
that question.  Look, as you know, and you hear us say this all the
time, the President is the president wherever he is, and that is the
thing to remember.   
   
And he — he’s going to stay in touch, again, with his team back home at
the White House.  He’s going to, you know, stay in touch with
congressional leaders.  And he could do this anywhere, right?  He can
sign a bill anywhere.  He can, you know, talk to them anywhere he is. 
He can be president anywhere — anywhere in the country, certainly
anywhere in the world.  So, that is not going to — that’s not going to
change.   
   
Q    Karine, can I ask you — earlier today at his remarks, the President
sounded a little hoarse.  He was coughing a lot.  Is he feeling okay?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s feeling —  
   
Q    What —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s feeling — he’s looking forward to this trip. 
He’s feeling good.  You’ll see for yourself after the — after he has his
meeting with President Xi, you’re going to hear directly from the
President.  He’ll take a few questions in his solo press conference.   
   
The President — I just saw him.  The President is very much looking
forward to this trip — this really important trip and consequential
meeting with President Xi.  So, that’s what I can tell you.  
   
Q    When was his last COVID test?  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I didn’t hear that.  Sorry, Emily.   
   
Q    When was his last COVID test?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I can’t speak to that.  I — you know, if COVID —
we’re in a different place with COVID, as you know — a very, very
different place because of what this President has been able to do in
getting COVID and getting this pan- — getting us out of this pandemic,
getting COVID under control.  We are in a totally, totally different
place.  And I think that’s important to note as well.   
   
So, we’re not in the same place where — obviously, I don’t think you
test every day right?  So, we’re just not in that same place.  I just
don’t have any — we don’t have anything to share with you on that.  
   
Q    On Israel, Karine, you saw the protests today outside the White
House.  But also, I haven’t heard anything from the White House on the
death of a protester in California a few weeks back.  He sustained some
injuries during a protest in California.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Can — can you say that one more time?   
   
Q    Yeah.  A 69-year-old California man was — he succumbed to injuries
he sustained during a protest.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, this is the — the Jewish American?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Yes, I haven’t heard anything from the White House on him.  Has the
White House reached out to his family or his community?  
   
And then zooming out to the protests today that we saw, can the White
House assure American Jews that they are safe in America?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, so let me — let me touch on the first — the
first question about the gentleman — the protester, the — the Jewish
American.  It’s — it’s awful.  It’s devastating that happened. 
Obviously, our hearts go out to — to the people who loved him, his
family.   
   
And I don’t have a — we don’t have any calls to read out, but obviously,
we are sending our condolences to the family with that horrific,
horrific event.   
   
What I will say about the marches — that we welcome today’s march.  The
President has been very clear about his unwavering support for Israel to
defend itself against terrorism since Hamas — Hamas’s horrific terrorist
attack on October 7th.  And President Biden has taken historic actions
to fight hate, including antisemitism, announcing more steps to combat —
combat it on campuses today.   
   
Federal, state, and local officials have made the saf- — the safety of
this event a priority and have worked to ensure that necessary
precautions are enacted and resources are deployed to ensure the safety
of everyone attending — attending today’s march.   
   
We urge everyone to respect each other’s First Amendment rights and not
to engage in escalatory behavior.   
   
And obviously, we take — we take any hate crime on any group very
seriously.  And we’ve taken actions not just this year in the past
couple of weeks, but obviously a year ago, we made — we were very clear
about where this administration stands.  
   
Q    And you were at a roundtable about it with Neera Tanden last week. 
Can you just update us on how that —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say that one more time.  
   
Q    I believe you had an event with the Domestic Policy Advisor on this
last week.  Can you just update us on any —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share.  But obviously, the
team — the Domestic Policy team and other — other members of the
President’s leadership — White House leadership are going to continue to
have conversation with leaders in different communities, as they’re all
dealing with what we’re seeing: the increase in hate in the different
groups.   
   
And I’m — obviously, we’re going to continue to call out antisemitism. 
We’re going to continue to call out Islamophobia.  And we’re going to
continue to say, any — any violence, any hatred against any group is
unacceptable.  
   
Q    Along those lines, we had a poll today that showed that one in
three Asian and Pacific Island people in the United States faced some
kind of racial abuse.  I guess I wondered what’s your message to that
community and specific — particularly as APEC is happening.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, very sim- — very similar, right?  Any racism,
xenophobia, intolerance is unacceptable.  We’re going to be — continue
to be very clear on that.  This is something that the President has been
clear on since he was running to be president back in 2017.  So, this is
— we’re going to continue to be consistent there.   
   
So, President Biden and Vice President Harris have led a historic
whole-of-government effort to combat such discriminat- — discrimination
facing Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.  That
started their first week in office when the President issued a
presidential memorandum leveraging the power of the federal government
to stand against this hate.  The President also signed the COVID-19 Hate
Crimes Act into law and signed an executive order to reestablish the
White House Initiative on AA and NHPIs.  
   
And earlier this year, we released the first-ever National Strategy to
Advance Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for Asian American, Native
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander communities.  The strategy details
much-needer — needed investments from 32 federal agencies, including
improved data, language access, and combating anti-Asian hate.  
   
Q    And then, in San Francisco, homeless advocates have been advoc- —
been pushing for a meeting with the President, especially given some
criticism of a cleanup that’s been happening around the city ahead of
this meeting.  Is he going to talk with them?  Like, what are his
thoughts on this —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Like, speaking to the advocates?  
   
Q    Speaking with homeless people, addressing the situation there,
which is a big problem in San Francisco.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, here’s what I’ll say: The President has taken
homelessness incredibly seriously.  And so, this year, the Biden
administration — they announced an ALL INside initiative to aggressively
tackle homelessness and build a country where every person has a safe
and affordable home.   
   
The initiative is actually building on the American Rescue Plan, which —
which made the largest single-year investment in ending homelessness in
U.S. history and helped prevent a surge of homelessness as a consequence
of the pandemic, as well as work being coordinated across federal
agencies — including HUD and the VA, including HHS, including Treasury —
to reduce homelessness.   
   
And let’s not forget: Earlier this year, as it relates to California,
the administration provided an additional $96 million to communities
across the state of California specifically focused on addressing
unsheltered homelessness and homeless encampments.   
   
So, we believe Congress needs to act.  And — and they need to continue
to do that to cr- — so that we can create millions of affordable homes,
if you think about it; expand rental assistance; and provide communities
with the resources they need to prevent and end homelessness.  
   
Let’s not forget, the American Rescue Plan, which is — which is what his
initiative is built on — only Democrats voted for it.  We’re the ones
taking this very seriously.  Democrats in Congress are the ones taking
this very seriously.  Only Democrats voted on the American Rescue Plan
that actually have initiatives and provisions in there to deal with
crime; to deal with homelessness, as I just laid out; to make sure we’re
getting more police — more police officers in communities.  And that is
something that Democrats led, not Republicans.  
   
Q    How has the President prepared for this meeting tomorrow with
President Xi?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, you know, the President has — when it comes to
foreign policy and being a leader in this — in this space, this is the
President — something the President has done as a senator, as vice
president.  And you’ve seen him do this the last two years.   
   
And you’ve seen the — how — what his leadership — how this diplomatic —
how diplomacy — pardon me — how diplomacy plays such an important role. 
And he believes in that.  He believes in face-to-face conversation.  He
believes in having those direct — direct communication with leaders. 
And that’s what you’re going to see.  
   
This is not cert- — certainly — obviously not the first time he’s spent
with President Xi in his administra- — in his time as — as — in his
administration.  And so — so, he takes this very seriously, right?  
   
He’s going to meet with his team.  He’s going to — as he’s doing now on
the plane, as he’ll continue to do even when we hit the ground, and as
he’s been doing for the past couple of weeks and throughout his
administration.  And — and that’s — I think you could — what you could
expect is a — is a president that’s going to be prepared.   
   
And he’s going to be prepared not because he’s talking to his team and —
and, you know, reading his briefing book.  It’s because he has the
experience that — I would say, that many other presidents haven’t had. 
Right?  If you think about him being a senator for 30 — 36 years, if you
think about being a vice president for 8 years, that is experience that
is so needed as a t- — in a time like this.  
   
Let’s not forget: This is one of the most consequential relationships
that we have — you think about China.  And so, this is going to be
critical.  And you’re going to see a president that’s prepared and ready
to have a direct and honest conversation.  
   
Q    Karine, VOA reported this morning that the leaders will be meeting
at a place called Filoli Estate.  Why was that chosen?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have anything to share on location.  I — I
just don’t have — we don’t have anything to share about that.  
   
Q    Just on the budget again.  I mean, as you know, we were here a
month and a half ago.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Here in San Francisco, you mean?  
   
Q    No, I mean on the budget.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m so sorry.  Budget.  
   
Q    We’re not — we’re not in a position —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All I heard — all I heard —  
   
Q    But I’m trying to project.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — was “here.”  We were here a month ago.  
   
Q    We were at this point in time —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — leading up to three days away from a potential shutdown.  Do you
— can you give us a sense of sort of the m- — mood music?  Do you feel
any better?  Does the White House feel any better about the situation
now, as opposed to three days from the last one?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, there’s conversations still happening,
right?  They still have to vote on this at some point today.   
   
And so, we’re certainly — we — this is a president that’s always
optimistic, but we also believe that we should not be where we are
today.   
   
This is something that — when you think about — when you think about the
CR, when we think about where we are, we should — there was a deal, as
you know, earlier this — earlier in the spring — or late spring.  And we
believe that the President got involved — right? — and made sure that a
deal was done.  And we believe a deal is a deal.  And now we are in a
situation where we shouldn’t be — we really shouldn’t be.  
   
But I’m not going to get ahead of conversations.  I’m not going to get
ahead of the vote.  Let’s see what happens.   
   
But we have to be optimistic.  This is important to the American
people.  This is important to our national security.  This is important
to our veterans.  We’ve got to make sure that we deliver for the
American people and do the job that they sent us here to do.   
   
And that’s for Congress to do.  Congress needs to make sure that they
deliver.  So, we’re going to let — we’re going to let the Demo- — the
Democratic House and Senate, the leadership there, have those
conversation, have those negotiations.   
   
And hopefully we come to some sort of resolution here on behalf of the
American people.  That’s what we’re  
talking about.  
   
Q    What about — what about dealings with the new Speaker?  I mean, is
it better or worse than —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to — I’m not going to, like, publicly
judge the relationship that the President has or that the White House
has with the — with the new Speaker.  
   
What we want to make sure is that the work for the American people get
done.  That is the most important thing.  And that’s what we want to
get.  That’s what we want to see.  
   
Q    Karine, I want to ask you — DailyMail.com, through a FOIA request,
obtained photos of the cocaine that was found in the White House in
July.  Is there any update on that investigation?  Are the photos
helping anything?  Have there been any chan- —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would just — I would refer you to the Secret
Service.  That’s their — that’s their — that’s in their wheelhouse.  So,
I’ll — I’ll leave it to them.  
   
Q    Is it frustrating for the President that the polls show that a
majority of Americans think that, you know, the administration isn’t
doing that great on the economy when we have near — unemployment is,
like, a historic low and inflation is falling?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, as you saw — I — I just mentioned at the
top that CPI — right? — which is incredible, important data — came
out.   
   
And here’s what we think the President is getting for results for the
American people.  Right?  Inflation, in the pandemic, has fallen 65
percent since last summer, which is what I mentioned at the top.  Core
inflation is at the lowest level in more than two years.  Wages are
higher than before the pandemic, accounting for inflation.  Gas prices
are $3.35, down $1.65 from their peak after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,
providing breathing room for — to families ahead of the holiday travel. 
Grocery inflation is at a lowest level in over two years.  Egg and milk
prices are lower than a year ago.   
   
And, look, we understand.  We get it, right?  The pandemic had a lot of
strain and caused a lot of pressures for families and Americans.  We get
that.  That’s why the President did what he did, which — I — we were
talking about the American Rescue Plan — the first piece of legislation
that he signed into law to get us back on our feet, right?  
   
So, that is — so, we get that.  We get that Putin’s inva- — invasion,
war in Ukraine that caused the prices to go up.  That’s why the
President has taken these kind of historic steps when it comes to —
whether it’s the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, whether it’s the
Inflation Reduction Act — to make sure that we’re doing everything that
we can to make — to make Americans’ lives easier.  
   
Whether it’s healthcare; whether it’s bringing down gas — gas prices;
whether it’s making sure that, you know, unemployment — if you look at
unemployment, it’s under 4 per- — 4 percent, which is — it’s been doing
that for more than 20 months.  That’s important to note.  More than 14
million jobs created.   
   
That is Bidenomics.  That is what Bidenomics has been able to do.   
   
But, of course, we understand — right? — we see and understand that some
Americans are still feeling it out there.  But this is a president
that’s taking this very, very seriously and doing everything that he
can.  
   
One thing that he says all the time: He believes that every American
should feel like they have the dignity to be able to feed their family,
to be able to earn — to earn the wages to make sure that they can live
their life that they see fit for themselves and their family.  And
that’s important to the — to the President.  
   
Q    On the UK cabinet shuffle.  Does this change anything between rela
— with relations between the two countries?  And also, I think it’s the
King’s birthday today.  I think he’s turning 75.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait, it’s whose birthday?  
   
Q    Charles.  
   
Q    I think it’s the King’s birthday tomorrow.  Any birthday wishes?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait, to who?  I didn’t hear you.   
   
Q    The King.  
   
Q    King Charles.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, King Charles.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    He’s 75.  Maybe the President, a fellow November baby, has some
birthday wishes?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, happy birthday to the King.   
   
So, as far as the — the UK government obviously inf- — informed us to
the changes to the Pri — that — to Prime Minister Sunak’s cabinet.  We
look forward to continuing our cooperation with the Prime Minister and
the new cabinet, including new Foreign Secretary — new Foreign Secretary
David Cameron, on a range of important priorities.  
   
Certainly not going to speak to, you know, the — the internal workings
of another government’s political — political governance.  I’m just not
going to speak to that.   
   
All right.  Okay.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, guys.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
2:50 P.M. EST
