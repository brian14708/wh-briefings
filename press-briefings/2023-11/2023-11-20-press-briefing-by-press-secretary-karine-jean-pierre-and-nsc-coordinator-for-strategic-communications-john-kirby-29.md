James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:38 P.M. EST  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, where is everybody?  Oh, it’s holidays.   
  
Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Good afternoon, everybody.  
  
Q    Good afternoon!  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  Happy Monday.  All right.  This
Thanksgiving, we have a lot to be thankful for.  While inflation caused
by the pandemic and Russia’s war continues to be a challenge, we have
seen important progress.  
  
Just in a time — just in time for holiday travel, gas prices are down
$1.70 from their peak, airline tickets are down 13 percent over the last
year, and car rentals are down about 10 percent.   
  
And as we start preparing our Thanksgiving meals, grocery inflation is
at its lowest level in over two years, with prices for eggs, milk,
bacon, and fresh veggies lower than last year.   
  
In fact, according to the American Farm Bureau, the cost of a
Thanksgiving dinner fell this year.  Prices are down for turkey,
stuffing, peas, cranberries, pie crust, and whipping cream.   
  
We had a big discussion about whipping cream in the back.  (Laughter.) 
It was like — I don’t know what “whipping cream” is.  I know “whipped
cream” but not “whipping cream.”  Anyway.   
  
Because wages are rising, this Thanksgiving dinner is the
fourth-cheapest ever as a percentage of average earnings.   
  
Finally, as we look ahead to holi- — to holiday shopping, since last
year, prices for toys are down about 4 percent, used cars and trucks are
down 7 percent, and TVs are down 9 percent.  
  
Lowering costs for Americans continues to be the President’s top
economic priority.  From strengthening supply — supply chains, to
lowering energy and healthcare costs, to cracking down on price gouging
by ba- — banning hidden junk fees, President Biden’s policy will
continue bringing relief to American families.   
  
Meanwhile, instead of lowering costs for middle-class families,
congressional Republicans are trying to lower costs for the wealthy and
special interests — lower taxes, to be more exact — including big
corporations that are fighting tooth and nail to stop the President’s
efforts to ban junk fees.   
  
Now, today, on Transgender Day of Remembrance, we grieve the 26
transgender Americans who were killed this year.  Year after year, we
see that these victims are disproportionately Black women and women of
color.  No one should face violence, live in fear, or be discriminated
against simply for being themselves.   
  
As the President said, there’s still more to do to meet the promise. 
And it’s why this administration has taken urgent action to strengthen
rights and protect the safety of transgender Americans and all LGBTQ+
Americans.   
  
As we mourn the loss of lives that have been taken too soon, we must
also recommit ourselves to never stop fighting until all Americans can
live free from discrimination and also from hate.  
  
With that, Admiral John Kirby is here today to take any questions that
you may have, obviously, on the foreign policy front and to give any
updates that we have on the Middle East.   
  
Admiral.   
  
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Karine.  
  
MR. KIRBY:  You all right there?  
MR. KIRBY:  Yep.   
  
Q    What happened?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Let’s just move right to the topper.  (Laughter.)  
  
So, today, I think you know, Secretary Austin is in Kyiv to meet with
Ukraine’s leaders and reinforce our staunch support for Ukraine’s fight
for freedom against Russia’s brutal invasion.   
  
The Secretary underscored President Biden’s abiding commitment to
provide Ukraine with the weapons and equipment that it needs to retake
its sovereign territory and defend itself.   
  
Now, in Kyiv, Secretary Austin announced a new security assistance
package using previously authorized presi- — presidential drawdown
authorities.  It includes Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and additional
HIMARS systems, additional  
HIMARS ammunition, 155 millimeter and 105 millimeter artillery rounds,
Javelin and AT-4 anti-tank systems, and, of course, millions of rounds
of small-arms ammunition.  
  
This announcement will obviously help keep — meet Ukraine’s immediate
battlefield needs, but only just that.  
  
Again, we want to urge Congress to pass the supplemental request that we
put in front of them to allow us to keep supporting Ukraine in an
unimpeded, uninterrupted way.  The runway continues to get shorter with
each — every — each and every passing assistance package that — that we
provide them.  
  
As President Biden has said, when aggressors don’t pay a price for their
aggression, they’ll cause more chaos and death and destruction.  They
just keep on going, and the cost and the threats to America and to the
world will keep rising.   
  
So, the actions that we take and, just as critically, the potential
actions we don’t take will reverberate for many years to come.  
  
Speaking of that, I’m sure you saw the op-ed piece that the President
wrote for the Washington Post over the weekend, laying out how the world
faces an inflection point right now, again, about — where the choices we
make will determine our future for generations to come.  
  
As he noted, we continue to stand firmly with the Israeli people as they
defend themselves against Hamas — a terrorist group that has vowed to
wipe Israel off the map and has promised to conduct attacks similar to
ones on Sep- — the 7th of October again and again and again.  
  
So, President Biden and the team here is doing everything we can to help
get the hostages that Hamas took — get them released, including young
children and, of course, Americans that are in that po- — pool.  
  
I think — I know this is of great interest to all of you.  I just want
to let you know we’re still working this hour by hour.  I do not have an
update for you on the hostage deal that we’re trying to negotiate, but
as you heard the Deputy National Security Advisor say yesterday, we
believe we’re closer than we’ve ever been.  
  
So, we’re hopeful, but — but there’s still work to be done.  And nothing
is done until it’s all done, so we’re going to keep working on this.  
  
We’re also working to increase the flow of lifesaving humanitarian
assistance: food, water, medicine.  We’re calling for respecting the
inter- — international law in terms of minimizing the loss of innocent
lives.  And, of course, we’re continuing to advocate for humanitarian
pauses so that people can out of harm’s way and that aid and assistance
can get in.  
  
And, of course, you saw us le- — levy multiple rounds of sanctions to
degrade Hamas’s financial structure, cutting them off from outside
funding and trying to make it harder for them to be able to resource the
kinds of attacks that they conducted on the 7th of October.  
  
So, just a real quick update on the latest figures, and then I’ll be
done.  
  
Over the last couple of days, the 19th — the 18th and 19th of November,
almost 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid were able to enter Gaza. 
That brings the total to over 1,260.  
  
And then, following Israel’s announcement that it’s allowing fuel now
into Gaza to support nongovernmental organizations at our strong
request, we are now tracking that six trucks have cro- — crossed now
into Gaza with approximately 18,000 gallons of fuel.  That will help
support food distribution and it will help generators for — for the
hospitals so they can keep working.  
  
Again, we expect those deliveries to continue on a regular basis and
hopefully in larger quantities.  I’m talking about the fuel specifically
there.   
  
And then, just lastly, the total number of U.S. citizens that we’ve been
able to move out of Gaza through that Rafah Crossing is now up to 800. 
We’re continuing to work that every day as well.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Steve.  
  
Q    Thank you, John.  The United Nations says nowhere is safe in Gaza. 
Is the U.S. working with Israel to create a safe area in Gaza for
civilians?   
  
MR. KIRBY:  What we’ve talked to the Israelis about, particularly now as
they’re beginning to plan operations in the south where so many people
have moved, is to make it clear that they have obligations to not only
allow for that safe passage but — but to make sure they’re not putting
all those civilians — now more civilians in Southern Gaza than were
before — putting them in harm’s way.   
  
Q    And secondly, I know you don’t want to talk about hostages.  But in
general, is Israel on board with the idea of a pause of a few days?   
  
MR. KIRBY:  That gets into our negotiations here for the hostages.  They
have instituted — again, at our urging, they’ve instituted these daily
humanitarian pauses.  And in some cases — they were supposed to be four
hours a day — they’ve actually expanded them up to seven hours a day.   
  
So, they’re happening on a regular basis.  And they’re predominantly
designed to allow people fro- — in the north to move through a couple of
safe corridors to the south.  So, it’s a pause to let people get out. 
That’s the principal purpose of that.   
  
But I think you can imagine — and, again, I want to be careful here; I
don’t want to negotiate in public.  But if you’re going to secure the
release of hostages — and we certainly hope we’re going to be able to do
that soon — you got to make sure they can get from where they are to
safety and do that as safely as possible, which means you’re going to
have to have at least a temporary localized stop in the fighting to
allow them to move.   
  
I mean, we also can’t take for granted that all of these people are
easily mobile and don’t have some sort of health issues that require
perhaps a slower route out or assistance getting out.   
  
So, I don’t — again, don’t want to negotiate in public.  But — but we
believe we’re getting closer.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Michael.  
  
Q    John, you talked about the negotiations.  Everybody has been sort
of talking about the swirl of — you know, the contacts between the U.S.
and Israel and Qatar and Hamas.   
  
What — and when you talk to the family members, one of their deep,
abiding frustrations is that it’s, I think, day 45, and they don’t have
any information — proof of life, conditions — that — that normally the
Red Cross would — would go in, would at least, you know, determine
something about the fate of their — you know, some of these people are —
you know, believe that their — their loved ones either are sick or need
medicine or — or have been injured or whatever.   
  
You know, is there — is there nothing that the U.S. and Israeli
governments can tell the hostage families without compromising the — the
ongoing negotiations to actually get some release?  And if not, what —
to what do you explain — what do you think explains the fact that the
Red Cross hasn’t been able to get in there?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  I can’t speak specifically to the Red Cross access.  You
know, Hamas has control here over where they are and how they are.  So,
it could be an issue of Hamas holding — holding that kind of access
up.  
  
I can tell you we’re doing the best we can with the information that we
have to keep the families informed — American families informed.  And we
— there’s not that many of them.  We know who they are, and we’re doing
the best we can to keep them in- — informed, including keeping them
informed on the — the process of trying to secure release.   
  
But it’s a — I’m not going to — you know, I’m not going to lie here.  It
— you know, there’s, in some cases, a paucity of information.  I mean,
it’s just — it has been difficult to get any great detail on every
single hostage — where they are, how they are — you know, and — and move
that process forward in terms of informing the families.   
  
It doesn’t — we’ll do what we can.  We’re informing them to the maximum
degree we can.  They have a right to know everything that — that — that
we know.  And we’ll just — we’ll just keep doing it on our own as best
we can.   
  
Q    Thanks so much, John.  Has the President had any additional calls
with world leaders about the hostage deal today?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Not that I’m tracking today.  
  
Q    And was the last time he spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  The last chat —  
  
Q    — last Tuesday?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  — the last call that they had.  
  
Q    Can you just give us a sense of the level of trust right now?  And
I know you can’t speak to specifics, but in these negotiations, how much
trust is there in those conversations of all pa- — between all parties
over the hostage deal?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  It’s a negotiation.  And it’s over human lives.  You — you
do the best you can going back and forth with the arrangements, which
we’re doing right now.  And at some point, when you come down to
executing — you know, when you hit “go” — then you’re counting on
everybody to meet their commitments.  And that’s what — that’s what
we’re doing.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Gabe.  
  
Q    Admiral, over the weekend, President Biden, in his op-ed, said that
the U.S. was preparing to issue visa bans against Israeli extremists
attacking civilians on the West Bank.  What effect would that actually
have?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Well, that would — if you were to do — con- — impose a visa
ban, it would prevent that individual from — from traveling —  
  
Q    But —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  — to the United States.   
  
Q    — is there any timeline on when that might be instituted?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have a timeline for you.   
  
Q    But —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Nor do I have a final —  
  
Q    Is that — is that —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  — decision.  
  
Q    — meant to be the terms of —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Nor do I have a final decision.   
  
Q    Is — is the Biden administration upset by how this is playing out
in the West Bank — what those extremists are doing to Palestinians on
the West Bank?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Of course, we are.  Of course, we are.  The President has
spoken to this many, many times, including from the Rose Garden when he
was here with the Australian Prime Minister.  I mean, what’s happening
with the settler violence is unacceptable.  Absolutely reprehensible.   
  
And yes, we — and we wouldn’t have talked about the potential of
examining visa bans — and, again, no final decision here — if it — if it
wasn’t just another clear statement of — of our deep concern over
this.  
  
Q    What other sanctions are being considered besides the visa bans?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything else.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Annie.   
  
Q    Oh, thanks so much.  There’s been fighting over the last few days
and hours around the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza.   
  
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
  
Q    Can you speak to whether or not there is U.S. intelligence that
suggests that that, too, is some sort of hub for Hamas activity and what
the U.S. feeling is about those reports of shelling in and near that
hospital.  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Hospitals should not be the scenes of firefights.  We’ve
been very clear about that.  We got patients in there, you got medical
staff, you got people whose lives are literally at risk and are innocent
victims of this.  They shouldn’t be put at — at more risk than they
already are being held up in a — in a hospital — or holed up in a
hospital because of health issues, can’t — and can’t move.  So, we don’t
want to see firefights in hospitals.   
  
I don’t have any specific intelligence about the degree to which Hamas
is or is not using that particular hospital.  Nothing to share today.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Mark.  
  
Q    John, I was just curious.  You mentioned Hamas is still determined
to try and carry out any sort of terrorist attack abroad this
Thanksgiving week.  Is there any elevated risk of terror attacks here at
home, and are — is the White House or NSC doing anything specific? 
Because of the holiday week, most people, obviously, kind of check out
in D.C.  I’m just curious, are you staffing up in a difference — because
of the terror threat?  
MR. KIRBY:  We’re not tracking any specific, credible threat here at
home over the holiday.  That said, I think you can understand we — we’re
going to be as vigilant as we have been since this conflict began and
certainly make sure that — that we, to the best we can, can identify any
potential domestic threats and disrupt them before they can take
place.   
We’re watching this all very, very closely for spillover effects from
the fight between Israel and Hamas, both against the Jewish community
and, of course, the Muslim community here in the United States.  But,
again, I’m not tracking any specific, credible threat that — that’s
being acted on at this time.  
Q    Back at the Indonesian Hospital, my colleague spoke with the
hospital administrator who said that President Biden needs to do more to
protect hospitals in Gaza because, quote, “he’s the only one Netanyahu
will listen to.”  Could you comment on that?  And also, is the U.S. at
all concerned that Israel keeps it — is being seen, rather, as attacking
one Gaza hospital after another and also areas in the south now?  
MR. KIRBY:  The President in every conversation that he has with Prime
Minister Netanyahu — and it’s not just him — Secretary Blinken,
Secretary Austin, Jake Sullivan, the whole team here — at every instance
continues to urge the Israelis to be as cautious and deliberate and as
careful as they can in conducting these operations against Hamas, which
they have a right and a responsibility to do, to go after Hamas.   
They also have a right and responsibility — and added burden, if you
will, because of the way Hamas fights — to do everything they can to
look after civilian casualties.  It is a part of every discussion that
we’re having with our Israeli counterparts.  
And, I’m sorry, the second question was?  
Q    The second question was: Is the United States at all concerned that
Israel is seen attacking hospital after hospital?  
MR. KIRBY:  Oh.  Well, as I — as I said, I think, in my previous answer,
we don’t want to see hospitals as battlegrounds.  We don’t want to see
firefights in hospitals.  
Now, as we’ve also said — at least when it comes to al-Shifa; I don’t
have any intelligence on this Indonesia hospital.  But at Al-Shifa, we
did have intelligence that corroborated the Israeli claims that Hamas
was using it as a command-and-control node.   
So, it puts an added burden on Israel as they conduct operations in and
around hospitals to be even more discriminant and more careful. 
Because, again, you’ve got real live patients, real live doctors, real
live nurses that you got to look out — out for.  
On the other hand, you’ve got a real live threat.  You got a group that
seems to think it’s okay to bury themselves in the basement of a
hospital and use it to command and control their operations.  And that
presents a viable, legitimate threat to the security of the Israeli
people.  So, it’s about striking that balance.  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nancy.  
Q    Thank you.  John, the White House condemned Elon Musk in pretty
strong terms last week after he once again said something that was
considered antisemitic.  You called his comments “abhorrent.”  This
administration, this government is very reliant on Elon Musk,
particularly SpaceX technology, Starlink technology.  Have there been
any efforts made to wean the government off of his technology or find
some kind of replacement for it?  
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware of any efforts to do that, Nancy, but I think
we’ve been very clear about the rhetoric and how inappropriate it is. 
And we’ll call that out every time we see it.  
Q    But is the President concerned that the Pentagon and NASA are so
reliant on someone who holds these views and appears to even more
routinely embrace conspiracy theories?  
MR. KIRBY:  We’re — we’re — we rely on a lot of the defense industry, a
lot of the private sector to help us with our innovation, to help us
with research and development on new systems, and to help us in the
realm of space and cyberspace.     
There’s a — there’s a real benefit to private-public partnership when it
comes to those kinds of national security threats and national security
challenges.  There’s innovation out there in the private sector that
we’d be foolish to — to walk away from.  
I’m not aware of any specific efforts to address — to address our
concerns over his rhetoric through — through the way that — that his
companies provide support to our national security establishment.  But
that doesn’t mean that we accept or — or agree with or condone, in any
way, that antisemitic rhetoric that he pushed.  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, M.J.  
Q    Thank you, John.  Does the U.S. have any assessment of what the
Israeli military is describing as CCTV footage of Hamas bringing through
hostages through Al-Shifa hospital on October 7th?  
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t.  
Q    Okay.  On the hostages, if women and children end up being released
first, which is what it sounds like the situation is probably headed
towards, does the U.S. have any sense of how many in that mix might be
American citizens?  
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t want to get ahead of where we are, M.J.  And, I
mean, I know that everybody is interested in the numbers and who they’re
going to be.  We’re working that through literally in real time with —
with both sides.  So, I think it’s better if I just don’t speculate
about what that pool is going to look like.  
Obviously, we are laser-focused on the American citizens that we know
are being held hostage, and we want them out.  All of them — everybody
should be out now.  But here we are in a negotiation.  And we’re getting
closer to the end, we believe, of that negotiation.  So, again, I’m —
I’m going to be careful.  
Q    For any of the potential American hostages, is there confidence
that they are alive?  I know that you’ve addressed the lack of
proof-of-life videos and such in the past, but —  
MR. KIRBY:  I would say we have no indication otherwise.  
  
Q    Thanks, John.  There was media reports over the weekend that U.S.
pressure had resulted in the Palestinian Authority taking down a tweet
that accused the Israeli helicopters of most of the deaths at that music
festival.  Can you elaborate on that at all?  
MR. KIRBY:  No.  I mean, I don’t know.  What would you want me to say to
that?  
Q    Well, I mean, can you confirm any — can you give any information
about, you know, what kind of communications there were between the U.S.
and the Palestinian Authority about that messaging?  
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware of any specific messaging between us and the
P.A. on that.  I mean, obviously, it’s simply not true.  There was Hamas
paragliding into a music festival.  I mean, there was no Israeli
participation in that at all.  
Q    And then I just wonder if you can elaborate a bit on the
President’s remarks in the op-ed about a revitalized Palestinian
Authority.  Like, what would that look like?  Is it new leadership?  Is
it a different structure?  Like, could just talk about that a little
more?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  It’s — you know, what it looks like is going to depend on
the Palestinian people.  But what he’s referring to there is a
Palestinian Authority that has the — has the credibility, has the
legitimacy, has the authority, has the support of all Palestinians so
that they can effectively help with post-conflict governance,
particularly in Gaza.  But what it actually looks like is really and
should be up to Palestinians.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Go ahead.  And a couple more in the back.   
  
Go ahead.  Go ahead, sir.  
  
Q    Hi.  Me?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Yeah.  
  
Q    Okay.  Hi, John.  Thanks.  And Happy Thanksgiving to you.  
  
MR. KIRBY:   You too.  
  
Q    President Biden stood by calling President Xi a “dictator” at the
APEC press conference.  China’s Foreign Ministry condemned this is as,
quote, “extremely incorrect and irresponsible political manipulation.” 
What is the administration’s response or reaction to this?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  We came away from San Francisco with some concrete
deliverables on fentanyl, on military-to-military communications, on
getting our two teams together to start working on artificial
intelligence, particularly in the national security realm.   
  
There was an awful lot of very good outcomes out of this meeting between
President Biden and President Xi.  And the President is looking forward
— we’re looking forward to managing this relationship in a — in a more
responsible way and moving things forward, looking for ways where we can
cooperate, but also not being afraid to confront where — where we can’t,
including on the tensions in the South China Sea.   
  
So, the President and his whole national security team is focused
forward now coming out of San Francisco.  
  
Q    Still going to call him a “dictator” each time he sees him?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  The President — the President made it very clear.  He was
asked a direct question; he gave a direct answer.  He — and he stands by
that direct answer.  That doesn’t mean — as true as that statement was,
it doesn’t mean that — that there aren’t still prospects here to find
ways to cooperate and to compete with China in a more responsible way
going forward.  And that’s where the President’s head is.  
  
Q    When these two leaders met, did they agree to meet again or speak
again in the near term?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  They agreed that they would — they would meet again, but
there was no date put on the calendar.   
  
But what’s really important now is that the military-to-military comms
will begin to start and — even down to the theater commander level and
maybe even lower than that.  So, that’s a — that’s — that’s the
immediate channels of communication that we’re looking at getting back
open.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Steven, go ahead.  
  
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I’ve got a question about fentanyl, then a
question about the Gaza conflict.   
  
On fentanyl, the Chinese President committed to reducing the export of
fentanyl and fentanyl precursors.  But under President Biden there have
been 200,000 Americans who have stopped breathing and died as a result
of these chemicals.  As of earlier this year, we’re still at record
monthly numbers.  If there is not a drop in American deaths, will
President Biden hold the Chinese President personally responsible?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  It was really significant what President Xi was willing to
commit to.  To — for the first time now in several years — I mean, they
were really going forward here and willing to take law enforcement
action to shut down the export of these ingredients — the precursor
chemicals that the — that the labs, largely in our own hemisphere, are
creating to make fentanyl.  It’s a big step forward, and we’re grateful
for that.   
  
And we’ll see how they are in execution.  And I think we all need to
understand that it may be some time before you see the practical results
of this crackdown on the precursors.  But we’re grateful for that.   
  
But it’s not — you know, it’s not just the precursals –precursor —
precursor chemicals.  I’ll try it again in English.  The — but it’s the
labs in our own hemisphere that are taking those chemicals, those
ingredients, making fentanyl, and then — and then moving it north up to
our borders.  And it’s a serious problem.   
  
And, again, as the President said at the press conference: This
agreement will save lives — will save American lives.  And President Xi
said he was committed to helping with that.   
  
Q    But before turning to the second question, just to follow up on
that: The Chinese President is in charge of a single-party state.  He’s
— he said in the past that he’d crack down on fentanyl, and U.S. deaths
hit an all-time record last year.  I mean, is President Biden not going
to consider him personally responsible if American deaths do not go
down?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  He has said he was going to be personally responsible for
stemming the flow of these chemicals out of China, and we’re grateful
for that.  That’s been — that’s going to take a little bit of time as he
goes back to Beijing and puts those processes in place — those law
enforcement actions.  We’re grateful for that.  
  
Q    Thank you.  And the second question.  Protesters here in D.C., in
New York, across the country — they’ve settled on a nickname for the
President.  They’ve been calling him “Genocide Joe.”  They wrote it on
the gates.  Do you have a response from the White House for that
nickname that they’ve settled on?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  We’re not worried about nicknames and bumper stickers.  I
mean, it — it’s First Amendment, free speech.  
  
The President is focused on — as he wrote in his op-ed, on making sure
that we can continue to support Israel as they fight a terrible
terrorist group, Hamas, and as we all work together to get humanitarian
assistance in and get people out, including hostages.  
  
I said this the other day: Again, people can say what they want on — on
the sidewalk and that — and we respect that.  That’s what the First
Amendment is about.  
  
But this word “genocide” is getting thrown around in a pretty
inappropriate way by lots of different folks.  
  
What Hamas wants, make no mistake about it, is genocide.  They want to
wipe Israel off the map.  They’ve said so publicly on more than one
occasion — in fact, just recently.   
  
And they’ve said that they’re not going to stop, what happened on the
7th of October is going to happen again and again and again.  And what
happened on the 7th of October?  Murder.  Slaughter of innocent people
in their homes or at a music festival.  That’s genocidal intentions.   
  
Yes, there are too many civilian casualties in Gaza.  Yes, the numbers
are too high.  Yes, fam- — too many families are grieving.  And yes, we
continue to urge the Israelis to be as careful and cautious as
possible.  That’s not going to stop, from the President right on
down.   
  
But Israel is not trying to wipe the Palestinian people off the map. 
Israel is not trying to wipe Gaza off the map.   
  
Israel is trying to defend itself against a genocidal terrorist threat. 
So, when we’re going to start — if we’re going to start using that word,
fine, let’s use it appropriately.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, way in the back.  Go ahead.  
  
Q    I wanted to ask you about White House Advisor Amos Hochstein’s
visit to Israel.  Can you give us a sense of what the goal of these
talks are?  And does his visit signal that the White House is concerned
about military action — Israeli military action in Lebanon?   
  
And then I have a follow-up.   
  
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  Amos is in Israel today to follow up on his last
meeting to Lebanon, about a week or so ago, where he — where he talked
to Lebanese officials and to Israeli officials up in the north about —
about the risks of a second front — a northern front.   
  
And he’s in Israel today sort of back briefing his conversations with
the Israeli counterparts there in — in Tel Aviv.   
  
Q    But in terms of a follow-up, is the White House concerned that
Israel could be provoking Hezbollah?   
  
MR. KIRBY:  We don’t want to see this war escalate.  We don’t want to
see it widen.  We certainly don’t believe it’s in anybody’s interest —
certainly not the Israeli people’s interest — to have a second front
there in the north.  Though what Amos is doing, what our team is doing
is everything we can to help prevent that scenario from happening.   
  
Q    How fearful are you that — that if this is something that is being
provoked that it could draw the United States into it — that is the goal
of Israel right now?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Well, again, we don’t — we don’t want to see the conflict
widen or escalate.  That is why Amos is — is having the conversations
he’s having.  That’s why Secretary Blinken has now had two extensive
trips to the Middle East.  And it’s why the President has put forward
additional force posture — we were all talking about the carrier strike
groups, but also air and missile defense, as well as fixed-wing aviation
— into the region so that we can send a strong signal to any actor —
nation-state or otherwise — that if you’re going to think about widening
and deepening this conflict, don’t do it.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Kemi.  
  
Q    Yeah, thank you.  South Africa just submitted they re- — their
referral to the ICC to investigate Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Do you
have any comments regarding that for war crime?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  I’ll tell you, I’m going to take that question. I have not
seen that referral by South Africa.  So, before I go talking out of
school here for our U.N. ambassador, we’ll take that question and we’ll
get back to you.   
  
Q    Okay.  I ask a follow-up question.  It’s almost the first-year
anniversary of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.  President Biden said he
planned to travel to Africa within the year.  Do you have any updates
when the President will travel?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  I do not.  
  
Q    Thank you.   
  
Q    Is there an assessment of the U.S. on the level to which Hamas has
been degraded over the last several weeks?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  We don’t have an independent assessment that I’m aware of. 
That’s a question better put to the Israeli Defense Forces.   
  
Q    Is it something that you — I know that you have a lot of
communications with the Israelis inside of their operation.  Is that
part of what the —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  They — they —  
  
Q    — communications are between the U- — I mean, I’m trying to get a
sense of sort of what the next steps are and how long a campaign this
may need to be based on that level of — of degradation.  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Those are all great questions for the Israeli Defense
Forces.  This is their operation.  
  
Now, yes, we’re in touch with them daily.  And they — they provide us
their perspectives.  They provide us updates.   
  
I’m not going to, from this podium, characterize those conversations. 
I’m certainly not going to quantify the degree to which Hamas has been
degraded.  They are continuing to go after their leadership,
particularly in the north of — of Gaza.   
  
But really, that’s a better question for them.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We got to wrap this up.  Go ahead, Aurelia.  
  
Q    Thank you so much.  Has the President called the president-elect of
Argentina or does he plan to do so?   
  
And maybe a wider question: Does the administration think that this
president-elect is the right man to reform the economy and the
country?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  So, on your first question, I — I don’t have an update on
the President’s call sheet to talk about today.  But obviously, I’m sure
Karine and her team will keep you informed as — as things progress.  
  
You — I probably saw it — there was a tweet by Jake Sullivan
congratulating him on his win.  We look forward to working with him, his
admi- — and his administration.   
  
Argentina is a terrific partner in the region.  And — and there’s an
awful lot of things we share in terms of values — value of democracy,
human rights, and — and just — just hemispheric security and economic
concerns that we’ll — we’ll look forward to working with him and his
team on.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Joey, last question.   
  
Q    Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  I — I know you’ve been careful on what you can
say regarding the hostage negotiations.  But are you able to confirm
that — that we’re talking — that they’re centered on women and children
— getting women and children specifically out?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  I’d really rather not.   
  
But obviously, as I said in my opening statement, we — we want to see —
specifically, especially, we want to see the children and women get
released.  Obviously, that’s a high focus for everybody.  And, of
course, the Americans, too, because we know there’s at least one
American toddler in that pool.   
  
But I think the less said the better as we get into the — you know, into
the — what we hope is the endgame here on negotiations.  It’s probably
safer if I don’t go into much —  
  
Q    When you say hopeful —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  — speculating.  
  
Q    — that it’s the endgame, what are we — you know, what kind of
timeframe are you looking at?  I mean —  
  
MR. KIRBY:  I couldn’t tell you.  
  
Q    Yeah.  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Just — just that we’re closer now than we’ve been before. 
That’s a good thing.  But, you know, we don’t want to do or say anything
publicly that’s going to jeopardize what we hope will be a positive
result.   
  
Q    Thanks.   
  
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re too long —  
  
Q    Regarding your injury —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — on your foot there.  
  
Q    — is it a break — a sprain or a break?  
  
MR. KIRBY:  Both.   
  
Q    Aw.  
  
Q    Oh, man.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I didn’t want to keep them too long on his feet.   
  
Thank you so much, Admiral.  Appreciate that.  I know it’s not
comfortable.   
  
Will, go ahead.   
  
Q    Okay, I got a couple of things.  Changing gears, will there be an
order to lower flags to half-staff to mark Mrs. Carter’s par- —
passing?  And is the President planning on attending her funeral?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just say at the top — I know you heard from
the President and the First Lady yesterday on the passing of the former
First Lady.  I just want to say, certainly, that their thoughts are with
President Carter and the entire Carter family.   
  
As the President said yesterday, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have been
dear, longtime friends.  And Rosalynn Carter was an extraordinary,
extraordinary First Lady.  She was a champion for equal rights and
opportunities for women and girls; an advocate for mental health and
wellness for every person; and a supporter of the often unseen,
uncompensated caregivers of our children, age — aging loved ones, and
people with disabilities.   
  
The President and the First Lady are thinking of her and — and of — of
him and keeping the Carter family in their prayers today, as well.   
  
As it relates to any potential travel, the President and the First Lady
plan to pay respects to the former First Lady.  I don’t have anything to
share at this time on details or anything to confirm just yet.  But
certainly, as we have information or more details to share, we certainly
will share that with all of you.   
  
And as it relates to the lowered to half-staff — the flag be- — the flag
being lowered to half-staff, yes, we will certainly do that.  And we
certainly will follow — and we’ll do that in accordance to — with
protocols and details of — of when and how long that will happen.  We
certainly will share that at an appropriate time.   
  
Q    I have one more — another topic.  How is the President planning to
mark his birthday?  I ask because he mentioned it during the turkey
pardoning.  It looks like he’s got some family here.  Are they going to
have, like, a party or a dinner?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, he’s going — he’s going to do what they normally
do, how they celebrate the President’s birth- — birthday.  There’s a
trandition — a tradition, pardon me, which they’re going to keep to the
— to that tradition, which is they’ll be able to celebrate the
President’s birthday as a family together in Nantucket later this week
and certainly will do that with coconut cake, which is something that
they traditionally do.  
  
Go ahead.  
  
Q    Last year, we all remember the messy travel — holiday travel
season.  I know the administration has taken steps to try to improve
compensation for travelers who face delays and some other steps to hold
airlines accountable.  How confident is the White House that Americans
won’t face those same kind of issues this travel season?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, it’s hard to predict, obviously, but certainly
we take this very seriously.  The Department of Transportation takes
this very seriously.  And so, we’re going to be — we’re going to
certainly keep eye on — on what’s going on the next couple of days as —
as Americans travel crisscross the country to get to their loved ones
for Thanksgiving.   
  
And so, if any issues arise, obviously, we’ll — the Department of
Transportation, this administration will be on top of it.   
  
Hard to kind of surmise what that’s going to look like.  But as you
said, we’ve taken this seriously, and we’ve taken actions to work
closely with airlines, to work closely with other transportation means —
vehicles, if you will — to make sure that Americans get to where they
need to safely, certainly on time, as I know they want to get to — on
time.  And — and so, we’ll certainly be vigilant and on top of it.  
  
Q    And if I could just ask one follow-up on Nancy’s question.  Some
advertisers have pulled their ads from X, formerly known as Twitter.  Is
the White House at all considering suspending its official White House
or the President’s accounts on X given Elon Musk’s comments?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything to announce at this time or
any conversations — internal conversations on that particular question. 
But we’ve been very clear.  You heard from this White House after those
abhorrent, as you heard from us, comments were made by — by Elon Musk,
and we are going to continue — continue to certainly call that out,
condemn those types of hateful, hateful comments that can be incredibly
dangerous.  And so, we will — we won’t stop doing that.  
  
I just don’t have any internal conversations to — to read out or
announcement to read out on that particular platform.  
  
Q    Has anyone here spoken to Musk?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have any conversations to read out.  But
we will continue to certainly condemn any type of hateful comments that,
again, are dangerous.  
  
Go ahead, Steve.  
  
Q    How much more funding is available for Ukraine — the military
packages?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, that is something I would certainly refer you to
Department of Defense.  They’ll have more information on — on the
specifics on that — on your particular question.   
  
But, look, this is why we’ve been very clear about the supplemental,
about asking for additional Ukraine funding so that the people — the
brave people of Ukraine continue to fight against the aggression that
we’ve been seeing from Russia, against — it’s — they’re fighting against
tyranny, right?  They’re fighting against terrorism, right?  When you
think about Israel as well, what Israel then is doing in trying to fight
against Hamas.   
  
And so, that’s why that supplemental — that national security
supplemental for both are incredibly important.  And we’re going to
continue to have those conversations with folks on the Hill about the
importance of moving forward with the President’s national security
supplemental.   
  
I don’t have any specifics on how much money is left.  Certainly would
refer you to Department of Defense.  
  
Q    And secondly, the Commission on Presidential Debates just announced
dates and locations for the debates next year.  Will the President
participate in them?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the campaign on that particular
question.  Thanks, Steve  
  
Go ahead, M.J.  
  
Q    Karine, what does the White House make of Democrats and
particularly young people who say they do not approve of the President’s
handling of the Israel-Hamas war?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as — I’m going to be mindful, right, because
there’s going to be a number of polls that are going to come — be coming
out, which, you know — obviously, which we respect, and, obviously, that
is kind of the way that things go.  But what I’ll be very clear about is
we’re going to — not going to govern by polls here.  We’re going to — or
poll numbers.  
  
We’re going to focus on delivering for the American people.  That’s
going to be our focus.  We’re going to focus on — on how the President
is going to, we believe, continue to deliver for — deliver on what the
American people sent him to do, right?  Whether it’s the economy — let’s
not forget, when the President walked into this administration, the
economy was at a tailspin, and that was because of what the last
administration did.  
  
And so, we had — small businesses were shut down, we had — schools were
— majority of schools were shut down, large jobs were lost, and the
pandemic was not under con- — under control.   
  
Now, we understand so- — actions and the historic actions, legislations
that this President has done is going to take some time.  It’s going to
take some time.  It’s not like turning on a light switch for people to
certainly feel that.  
  
But, look, as it relates to recent polling, look, we’re going to focus
on what we can do.  We’re going to focus on governing.  We’re going to
focus on — on making sure we continue to deliver.  I’m not going to go
point by point on each poll.  But I just can speak to you about what our
focus is going to be moving forward.  
  
Q    Then maybe, polling aside —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
  
Q    — can you say whether this White House has a theory of the case on
how you win over young people, whether it’s on this conflict
specifically or generally?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as — when we say “when,” going to be very
careful, right?  I’m not — don’t — want to make sure I’m not speaking to
2024.  That is something certainly that the campaign can analyze and
speak to more broadly and how that looks for them and how it looks for
that campaign, the President’s reelection.   
  
What I can say is we’re going to continue focusing on delivering for the
American people.  That includes young people, right?  That includes
making sure that we meet them where they are.  Whether it’s student
loans, whether it’s an economy that works for all and does not leave
them behind, those are the things that you see the President do day in
and day out as we put forward policy, plans that include young people as
well.  
  
You know, I’m going to leave any of the analysis, any of the specifics
to any poll to dozens of people, certainly on TV, right?  It’s kind of a
cottage industry out there.  They’re going to analyze that.  They’re
going to speak to that, leave that to them — leave that to the campaign
to speak to winning young people or anything that’s related to 2024.  
  
Q    Do you know what the President makes of the fact that so many young
people are opposed to —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, I can tell you this: The President is focusing
on the job at hand.  He truly is.  He’s focusing on how we’re going to
deliver for the American people.  That is his focus, and that’s what
he’s been truly steadfast about in the almost three years of this
administration.  
  
Go ahead, Nancy.  
  
Q    Thanks, Karine.  How closely is the White House tracking what’s
going on at OpenAI, one of the most powerful companies in the AI sphere
— the revolt there, mass resignations.  And what does this mean for the
recent executive order having to do with AI?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, on the first question, look, we’re not going to
comment on any private company.  We never do, especially as it’s
changing any — any personal decisions that — personnel decisions that
they make and as they make those changes.   
  
As it relates to the executive order — a very comprehensive executive
order that the President announced not too long ago on AI — our message
to tech companies continues to be clear: They need to assure AI systems
are safe before releasing them to the public.  We’re going to continue
to make that clear, have those conversations.  But as it relates to a
personnel decision made by a private company, we’re just not going to
comment from here.  
  
Q    And then sticking with the tech theme, Twitter is back in the news
— I mean, not Twitter — TikTok back in the news because of
misinformation about the war, about Osama bin Laden.  It’s now been more
than two years that the CFIUS investigation has been underway.  Can you
give us any kind of update on where that stands?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  As you know, it’s an indep- — independent committee
investigation.  Just don’t have anything to comment on that — on CFIUS
and where they are on that investigation.  
  
Go ahead, Jordan.  
  
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The senators are having some talks this week about
an immigration deal that would unlock Ukraine aid.  Is the White House
planning to get involved with those, even sit on — sit in on them?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to negotiate from here.  
  
Go ahead.  
  
Q    You mentioned the President is excited to cele- — celebrating his
birthday.  But I’m curious — David Axelrod told the New York Times,
quote, “Biden thinks he can cheat nature here, and it’s really risky.” 
A, what’s the President’s response to David Axelrod?  Does he respect
his opinion?  Does he think he’s right?   
  
But also, I mean, is there a real alarm happening behind the scenes that
the President is simply too old to stick around for another four
years?   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, there’s no alarm happening behind the scenes.  Not
—  
  
Q    For Democrats?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  There — I — I can only speak —  
  
Q    Sure.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — behind the scenes here.  There is no alarm happening
behind the scenes.  And I’m certainly not going to comment on everybody
who has something to say.   
  
What I —  
  
Q    But he’s not nobody.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What —  
  
Q    I mean, David Axelrod is a —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I didn’t —  
  
Q    — is a — is —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I didn’t say that.  I didn’t —  
  
Q    Yeah.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nowhere in my response to you that I said that.  I
said I’m just not going to comment on everyone that has a — that has a
comment to say.  They’re going to speak for themselves.  I’m going to
speak for the President.  
  
And here will I — what I will say is: Look — and — and also, it’s just
not my job.  It’s not my job to think — to think through or to — to tell
people what to think.  Right?  Whether it’s an Am- — the American —
American people out there or — or a — a, you know, political analyst or
— or as your question is about David Axelrod.  It’s just not my — my
place to speak to that.  
  
What I can speak to is how we see this, how what our perspective is. 
Our perspective is that it’s not about age.  It’s about the President’s
experience.  That’s what we believe.   
  
And it’s — you know, as they say, the proof is in the pudding, right? 
The President has used his experience to pass more bipartisan
legislation in recent time than any other president.  That’s just a
fact.  That is something that we have seen this president do, and that’s
because of his experience.   
  
He’s been able to manage multiple — multiple foreign policy challenges. 
That’s — he’s been able to do that.  That’s because of his
experience.   
  
He’s been able to create jobs, raise wages, and lower inflation. 
Right?  And that is also — that is — the proof is in the pudding. 
Right?  We see that in the data.  We see that where we are today — than
where we are — than where we were when the President walked into the
administration.   
  
So, what we say is: We have to judge him by what he’s done, not by his
numbers.   
  
And — and one more thing I will add: This is the first president ever
that’s been able to go to an active warzone without our military, you
know, controlling what’s happening on the ground.   
  
And so, look, I would put the President’s stamina, the President’s
wisdom, ability to get this done on behalf of — of the American people
against anyone — anyone on any day of the week.  
  
All right, go ahead.   
  
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I just wanted to follow up.  I wondered if you had
any update on whether the President or anybody else in the
administration plans to attend the COP28 Summit in Dubai next week?   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any — we don’t have anything to read out
on his schedule.   
  
Go ahead, Karen.   
  
Q    Thanks.  You just told Jordan you wouldn’t negotiate on the
supplemental from here, but you and Kirby — before, you had talked today
just about how important it is to get this funding through.  So, now
that Congress doesn’t have an urgent deadline until next year because of
the CR getting passed, how concerned is the White House that this is not
going to get through in a timely matter — manner?  And what is the
President going to do in the next couple of weeks to try to push this
through?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, again, I’m not going to get into
negotiations from here, as you stated in your question.  But I will say
this: There’s a lot at stake.  There is.  There’s a lot at stake, as you
think about our national security and also our domestic needs.  So, it
is crucial and it is important that we get this done.   
  
And so, we’re going to continue to have conversations.  Our Legis- —
Legislative Affairs shop here, our OMB director is going to continue to
have legis- — have conversations with members of the Hill.  So, yeah, it
is important.   
  
We wouldn’t have put it forward if we didn’t think it was needed. 
Right?  These are emergency needs that we requested — when you think
about the supplemental, both the domestic one and the national
security.  So, obviously, we’re going to continue to have that
conversation.  We’re going to continue to do it in a bipartisan way — do
it both with Republicans and also Democrats on the Hill.  And so, we
take this very seriously.  We wouldn’t have put it forth if we didn’t
think it was needed.  
  
Q    Will we see the President get personally involved engaging with
lawmakers right after the hol- — Thanksgiving holiday?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have any — don’t have any — any layout or
readout about what — who the President is going to call.   
  
As you know, the President has personal relationships, long- — longtime
relationships with many members in Congress.  And so, you know,
certainly, he has done that before — reached out.  I just don’t have any
— I don’t have a strategy to lay out or a list of folks that the
President might or may not call.  
  
Go ahead.  Go ahead.  
  
Q    Oh, thank — thank you, Karine.  Just following up on what Steven
was asking about with regard to fentanyl of Admiral Kirby.  Can we
expect some type of trilateral agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and
China to tackle this issue?   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t — don’t have anything at this time — any
policy announcement to make at this time.  
  
Q    Thank you.   
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
  
Q    Thank you, as always.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  
  
Q    I want to ask you about —  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I might regret it, but go ahead.  (Laughter.)  
  
Q    I assure you, you will not.  (Laughter.)  
  
I want to ask you about polling.  In February, the President conducted
an interview with, I believe, it was Telemundo.  And he was asked about
the dismal state of his job approval ratings.  And he answered in words
to this effect: “Do you know anyone that believes the polling these
days?”  And he talked in some detail about the difficulty of getting
people on the phone and compiling accurate polling.   
  
Whenever you’re asked about the President’s dismal job approval ratings,
you say, “We’re not going to look at polls; we look at his
accomplishments.”  And yet, when you are asked about various domestic
policy initiatives, you will say, “These poll very well.  People support
what the President wants to do.  If you look at the individual subjects
on the polling, they support what the President’s agenda is.”   
  
So, once and for all, are only certain polls valid in your eyes — the
ones that support your agenda?  Or sh- — is the polling data that shows
that President Biden has been stuck for two years at the low 40s in his
approval ratings, are those valid?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, here’s the thing: I think it’s important to share
that American people do approve of some of the Pres- — President’s
initiatives.  I think it is important.  I think it’s an important to —
for the American people to hear that when it comes to Medicare and
fighting — and fighting and being able to — Medicare to be able to lower
costs for the American people.  I think it’s important to share that.  I
think it’s important to share that this — that when it comes to Social
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the American people care about that and
want us to fight about that — fight for it, which is what the President
—  
  
Q    So, those polls are valid?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   No, it’s not — it’s not that.  It’s not that.  We are
given — anytime I’m asked this question, given an opportunity to speak
on what the Pres- — what the American people want to hear and what we’re
doing, right?  And so, there are moments, just like when you ask me
about certain polls, that I can say, “Hey, you know what?  That is
something that the American people support.”   
  
But in more broad terms, in general, we’re not focused on every poll. 
We just are not.  It is not important for us that we believe to focus on
that.  
  
We’re going to continue to do the work and work on protecting Medicare,
Medicaid, and making sure that Social –that Americans have their Social
Security.  And I — and I think by saying that Americans support that,
that is important for — for us to say that from here, too, because we
are actually delivering for the American people.  We’re actually doing
what the American people want us to do.   
  
So, when I say that, that’s what I’m referring to: The work that we’re
doing, what we want to deliver on, what the American people care about. 
And it is the economy.  It is lowering costs.  Right?   
  
I always talk about that: The President’s number one priority is to
continue to lower costs.  And I talked about what he has done, whether
it’s junk fees, whether it’s making sure that people have good-paying
jobs by making sure that we’ve passed these historic legislation that’s
going to create <s>good union paying</s> \[good-paying union\] jobs. 
All of those things — all of those things are connected.  
  
Q    So, the polls that show that the electorate at large and also
significant majorities within the Democratic Party believe that the
President is too old, the polls that show the American people and also
significant majorities within the Democratic Party don’t want him to run
again, and the polls that show his handling of the economy, foreign
policy — all of these dismal polls — his job approval ratings: Does the
White House have any basis to challenge the accuracy of that polling?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I never — we never challenged.  I’m not challenging
the accuracy here.  That’s not what I’m doing.  
  
What I’m saying to you is that, you know, we’re not going to change the
minds of Americans.  I get that.  Americans are going to feel how they
feel, and we’re going to respect that.  And I’ve said that many times
from here — many times.  I said that moments ago.  
  
What I can tell you is what our perspective is.  What I can tell you is
how we see things.  And we believe experienced — this President having
experience to get things done is important.   
  
And we know that it’s going to take some time — right? — for Americans
to feel what we have been able to do in this administration: pushing
through bipartisan legislation that is historic.   
  
And as I mentioned earlier before, this is a president who has done more
bipartisan legislation than any other recent president.  And so, that’s
what I can speak to.  
  
I can speak to our perspective.  I can speak to how we see this.  I can
speak to what is important and how we’re going to try to deliver for the
American people.   
  
And I will say this: You know, just a couple of just data points here —
I’m going to be careful not to talk about the 20- — 2024 — any of the
elections.  But I could look back in history, right?  I can look back
and see where Obama was a year — President Obama was a year out of — of
his election, where President Clinton was a year out ahead of his
election, and it didn’t look like they were going to — they were going
to win.  Right?  It didn’t look like that.  
  
And so, it is not unusual.  You’re talking about dismal polling; it is
not unusual for a president to be where they are ahead of that.   
  
And so, look, the President is going to focus — this is something that I
can tell you for sure: He’s going to focus on the American people.  That
is always, always the number one priority for this president, and that’s
what you’re going to see him continue to do.  
  
Q    Thank you, Karine.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  I’m going to wrap it up.  Thanks,
everybody.  
  
Q    Thank you.   
  
Q    Happy Thanksgiving.  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.  
  
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
  
Q    Are you briefing tomorrow, Karine?  
  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Shakes head no.)  You’re welcome.  (Laughter.)
