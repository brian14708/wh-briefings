title: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, August 6, 2021

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:42 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Happy Friday.  Okay.  A couple of items for
you at the top.  
   
Are you — Zeke, are you married?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Welcome back.  Congratulations.  (Applause.)  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, he’s got some bling on his finger.  Okay.  Most
important decision you make in your life.  (Laughter.)  Okay.  
   
Today’s numbers — on the jobs numbers; obviously, it’s Jobs Day —
today’s numbers are further proof that President Biden’s economy is
booming.  Jobs are up, growth is up, and unemployment is down as
Americans get back to work.  
   
We see that clearly in today’s data.  This is the fastest monthly job
growth in almost a year.  Labor force participation also ticked up as
more Americans got back to work.  Since January, more than 1 million
Americans have re-entered the labor force.  Unemployment also fell
sharply, from 5.9 to 5.4 percent.  
   
See how we enjoy charts here?  I will note the comparison.  
   
In total, we’ve created over 4 million new jobs — 832,000 on average for
the last three months, with revisions upwards for the last two months.
 And over the first six months, we’ve created almost 700,000 per month
on average.  That’s more jobs created faster than any other President’s
first six months in history.   
   
In comparison, the previous administration only created 1.1 million jobs
in their first six months.  
   
And just last week, new GDP figures showed the U.S. economy has now made
up the las- — the losses of the last 18 months and surpassed the
pre-pandemic peak.  
   
I will note, as always, there may be ups and downs.  But thanks to the
strong foundation from the American Rescue Plan and the tools it gives
us, as well as our vaccination program, positions — positions us to
weather any challenges without going backwards or shutting down our
schools or our economy.   
   
I also wanted to note — (a cellphone ring) — that’s an exciting ringtone
— (laughter) — okay — that, yesterday, President Biden released a
statement on progress we’ve made expanding access to quality, affordable
healthcare — a huge priority for him — with the expansion of the Special
Enrollment Period, which goes through August 15th.  
   
In February, we announced — opened a Special Enrollment period to
provide all Americans the opportunity to sign up for health
insurance.   
   
In March, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law,
lowering premiums and saving families an average of $50 per person per
month. And later in March, we extended the enrollment deadline to August
15th.   
   
Five months later, the results are clear: more than 2 million Americans
have signed up for health coverage.  That’s exciting.  
   
And we also launched a “Summer Sprint to Coverage” campaign earlier this
summer, leveraging robust paid media, increased community outreach, and
more to get Americans signed up.   
   
So, for those who don’t have healthcare, go to HealthCare.gov and you
can sign up there and get more information.  
   
I also wanted to provide you all an update on COVID.  Today, we’ve
recorded — we recorded 821,000 total vaccinations. This is the second
day in a row we have got more than 800,000 total shots — the first time
we’ve done this since June — since June 30th and July 1st.   
   
Overall, more than 3.2 million Americans have gotten newly vaccinated
over the past seven days.  And importantly, as we’ve seen as a trend
over the last few weeks, states with the highest case rates are seeing
their vaccination rates grow the fastest.   
   
So, as we’ve said from the start, that’s exactly what it’s going to take
to get us out of this pandemic: more Americans stepping up and doing
their part to get vaccinated.   
   
In addition to encouraging trends on the vaccination front, we’re seeing
— with the pace of vaccinations, we’re seeing growing momentum on
requirements.  And we’ve seen a number of announcements out this
morning.  We expect that, certainly, to continue.  
   
So, as you know, last week, the President announced new requirements for
federal employees and contractors, and asked the private and public
sectors, universities, and healthcare systems, state and local
governments, and other institutions to take steps, and many of them are
answering his call to action.  
   
So, this week, one of the largest nursing home chains announced they’d
require vaccinations for employees.  Massachusetts will require
vaccination for nursing home staff.  And Maryland and Virginia announced
vaccination requirements for state employees.  And I’d note: Two of
those three states are led by Republican governors.  
   
Just today, United Airlines announced it will require all of its roughly
85,000 employees to be vaccinated by the end of September.   
   
So, the message — our message is simple: We support these vaccination
requirements to protect workers, communities, and our country.  And we
hope to see even more action from the public and private sector over the
coming weeks.  
   
Last piece for all of you — lots going on here, as you all know.  This
week, we — the administration — administration officials held virtual
listening sessions with groups representing landlords and tenant
advocates to discuss state and local disbursement of Emergency Rental
Assistance funds and ways to protect renters from evictions.  This is
part of our ongoing outreach and ongoing effort to get money out in
states and localities.  
   
Landlords offered ideas on how grantees might speed delivery and
increase access to rental assistance, and tenant advocates expressed
challenges renters are facing in accessing Emergency Rental Assistance
funds — both issues we want to work to address.  
   
In both meetings, administration officials reiterated the commitment
made by President Biden that our administration will not rest — nor
should state and local governments — until Emergency Rental Assistance
dollars reach Americans in need.   
   
And as we know, given the rising urgency of containing the spread of the
Delta variant, the President’s overriding goal is, of course, keeping
people — the American people safe and, ideally, in their homes.  
   
As part of this effort, the CDC has used the legal authority that
Congress provided, and developed the requisite record for a new,
targeted, and dynamic eviction moratorium focused on counties with high
or substantial case rates to protect renters and help to stop the spread
of this new and more transmissible COVID variant.  
   
The administration believes that this is a proper use of a lawful
authority to protect the public health, and the Supreme Court has not
ruled otherwise.   
   
Ultimately, we hope that these combined efforts will keep as many
Americans safe and housed as possible.  
   
I usually have a week ahead.  I will note for all of you that the
President — we expect the President to be here for a few days early next
week.  
   
As you know, the Senate also is expected to be, and we will keep you
updated as we know more specific details about his travel plans.  
   
Zeke.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  First, on COVID: some developments in the states
this morning.  In Arkansas, a judge there blocked the state from
enforcing its ban on schools enforcing mask mandates.  I was wondering
if the White House had any reaction to that.  
   
And then, similarly, in Florida, where the legislature there was passing
a — essentially a voucher program to allow parents to pull their kids
out of school if there were — if there were mask requirement they didn’t
like.   
   
What’s the level of White House engagement right now with all of these
different state governments?  And for folks who are sort of, you know,
puzzled by the — all these — you know, federal guidance, state guidance,
what’s the advice from the White House to parents worried about their
kids in school?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, since you reminded me, I also want to —   for anyone
who doesn’t know Kevin Munoz, he’s one of the amazing people on the
press team who does COVID — so just reminded me.  We call him “Dr.
Munoz,” because he’s such a specialist in this area.   So, I pulled him
out here with me today.     
   
So, I would say, Zeke, that we do have a concern, of course, about
restrictions that are being put in place in a handful of states — or
have been put in place around the country that make it more difficult
for localities, for schools, for businesses in some places to implement
public health guidelines.  
   
And our message continues to be that if you don’t want to abide by
public health guidelines — don’t want to use your role as leaders,
elected officials — then you should get out of the way and let public
health officials guide localities, schools, universities to do the — or
local schools as well — to do exactly the right thing.  
   
I think you heard yesterday — or those of you who were here heard
Secretary Cardona convey, as it relates to schools specifically, that we
do have information from our public health experts, from the CDC, on how
we can open up 100 percent of schools and keep them open in the fall.  
That’s our objective.     
   
The only prevention — the only thing preventing that would be if
officials in different states and localities put in place restrictions
that make that challenging or impossible.  And that is certainly
concerning to us.     
   
Q    And I got another COVID one for you.  The President, a few minutes
ago, said that additional vaccination penalties — for lack of a better
term — or burdens for those who are not vaccinated are likely to come in
the coming days.  I was hoping you might be able to address what some of
those are likely to stand as the new policy here at White House, in
addition to across the federal government, as well, in terms of forms
people have to fill out under potential criminal or civil penalty.     
   
But, you know, is the White House looking at requiring vaccinations for
all nursing home workers nationwide or for people flying on domestic
airlines (inaudible)?  Is domestic travel vaccination requirements
something that’s under consideration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know there was also, in addition to the President’s
comments, some reporting overnight as well that a number of you have
asked us about, understandably.  
   
And I would say that that and the President’s comments certainly reflect
what we always do in this administration, which is discuss policy
options about how we can continue to mount a wartime response against
the virus.  
   
So, what he was conveying and I think if — for those of you who have
asked us about reporting overnight: Yes, there are early conversations,
early discussions about a range of options.   Those are all early-stage,
they’re pre-decisional, and I would not — I don’t have any policy
decisions to preview for you because we’re not at that point in the
process.  
   
I know you didn’t ask me about this, but since others have, I would also
note that there has been some reporting around discussions about —
around cruises and universities, and that would not be accurate.     
   
Q    And just, from a broader, 30,000-foot standpoint, why is the
administration sort of taking — you know, acting sort of slowly here?
 You’re highlighting all the different efforts, you know, businesses and
some states are taking on this vaccination front.  Shouldn’t the White
House sort of lead at the front here to sort of try to really increase
the — sort of, maybe, hold that — wield that stick a little bit more for
people who are still waiting on the sidelines and not rolling up their
sleeves?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Zeke, I would say that the President led, eight days
ago, by delivering a speech where he conveyed that the federal
government would be taking actions, conveyed that there would be
requirements for federal government employees and contractors, and also
asked the public and private sector to take actions on their own.  And
we’re seeing that happening.  
   
So, we are going to consider a range of options.  There are factors, as
I think you all know, as you consider these policy options — pros and
cons.  We’re making all decisions through the prism of what is in the
interest of public health, but we’re going to let that policy process
see itself through.  And certainly, we want to make decisions as
expeditiously as possible.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Given the strength of today’s jobs numbers, has the
President decided that he’s not going to seek to renew the beefed-up
unemployment benefits when they expire next month?   
   
I know, earlier this summer, he said that it would make sense to let
them lapse, but that was before the Delta variant really took hold.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There has not been any decision about this at this point.  
   
Q    He’s still deciding whether to ask to renew them — whether to seek
to renew them or not?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Correct.  At this point, they’re expiring at the beginning
of September.  Nothing has changed on that front, but a final decision
has not been made.  
   
Q    And then, on Afghanistan, the Taliban has made big gains this week.
 They’re surrounding a number of cities.  They’ve taken control of a
provincial capital.  They assassinated government officials.  Has all of
that caused any reflection, second thoughts on the part of the White
House when it comes to the Afghanistan policy or any changes in the
strategy there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me strongly condemn — on behalf of the
government, of course — the assassination of Dawa Khan Menapal, the
Director of the Afghan Governmental Information Media Center.  His
murder follows the bombing attack in Kabul earlier this week that
targeted the Acting Afghan Defense Minister.  
   
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this later attack, and
there’s no reason to doubt reports they are responsible.  
   
Additionally, there are credible reports, as you’ve touched on, of
atrocities and retaliation against civilians in other Taliban-controlled
areas, which, of course, we are closely tracking and concerned about.
   
   
If the Taliban — our view is that the — if the Taliban claim to want
international legitimacy, these actions are not going to get them the
legitimacy they seek.  They do not have to stay on this trajectory.
 They could choose to devote the same energy to the peace process as
they are to their military campaign.  We strongly urge them to do so.
 This is what the Afghan people so urgently need, deserve after decades
of war.    
   
And it’s very much in Afghanistan’s neighbors’ interest to invest
renewed energy into a peace process that promotes a peaceful Afghanistan
and stable region.  
   
As it relates to the decision, the — we knew from the beginning — and
the President would be the first to say this — that there are difficult
choices a Commander-in-Chief needs to make on behalf of the American
people.    
   
He made clear — the President made clear: After 20 years at war, it’s
time for American troops to come home.  And as he said at the time, the
status quo was not an option.  The Taliban was prepared to attack U.S.
and NATO troops after May 1st, which was the deadline for our departure.
   
   
He also feels and has stated that the Afghan government and the Afghan
National Defense Forces have the training, equipment, and numbers to
prevail, and now is the moment for the leadership and the will in the
face of the Taliban’s aggression and violence.    
   
Q    And then a follow-up question about Afghanistan, please?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you very much, Jen.  As she asked about the senior journalist
that has been killed today, Afghan government — Afghan leaders like
President Ghani and the — all leaders in Afghanistan now, they said that
Pakistan is behind all of the Taliban activity — activity — very
systematically there, in general.  Now, Afghan people do not understand
that Pakistan is our enemy or our neighbor, our friend.  What do you
think?  Part of the — which route Pakistan should play to bring Taliban
— the peace process?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our view continues to be: It’s in the interest of all
countries in the region for there to be a political process, peace, and
stability in the region.    
   
Go ahead, Kelly.  
   
Q    Could you describe a little bit about what the overarching ask is
within the federal government to look at things like what levers do you
have to further spur vaccination?  
   
On the nursing home piece, is it using Medicare dollars and linking back
to nursing homes?  Is it regulatory action?  What sorts of things can
you help us to understand where that policy might go?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I certainly understand your question.  I’m not going
to be able to lay out too many details of internal conversations.  I
will note that, certainly, we have applauded the steps taken by a number
of states as it relates to requirements of nursing home employees and
health providers to get vaccinated.  We’ve seen states do that.  We’ve
seen some health providers do that.  That’s a positive step.  And as
noted in some of the reporting, that’s an area of early discussion — but
again, early pre-decisional discussion.    
   
We’re going to make decisions from the federal government that we
believe will save lives and we believe will protect the most vulnerable
populations, that will incentivize more people getting vaccinated and
bring an end to the virus.  There are pros and cons to many of these
policies; that’s part of the discussion as well.  
   
Q    Does it extend to other — we’ve talked nursing homes.  Is it
affecting travel?  Is it affecting other types of businesses?  Could you
just broaden it there for us to understand —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are obviously a number of private sector companies
that have taken their own steps.  We certainly applaud that.  And there
are a range of topics and industries under discussion internally.  
   
But again, the best step that that can happen out there is for Americans
going out and getting vaccinated.  And there are private sector
companies that are in the lead and continue to be in the lead on moving
this forward.  That’s a positive step.    
   
But there are ongoing internal discussions.  I’m not going to be able to
preview those too much — too extensively from here.    
   
Q    Thank you.  First, on the jobs report: If the economy is so great
and you guys are celebrating jobs being created at a historic —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Wouldn’t you say over 900,000 jobs created is pretty good?  
   
Q    So, this is my question: Why then is the President still pushing
for big relief packages — pandemic-era relief packages like the eviction
moratorium?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say: One of the biggest pieces of
legislation he’s pushing for, as we know, is the infrastructure package,
and also the Build Back Better agenda.  A lot of — most of the
components in those packages are long-term investments.  They’re out —
they’re overdue.  They’re meant to modernize our infrastructure, put
people back to work over the long term, and make us more competitive
over the long term.    
   
It is still a reality, even with a good jobs number this month and even
with 4 million jobs created over six months, that there are still people
out of work.  There are still people who don’t have enough money to make
ends meet.  That’s one of the reasons why we designed the American
Rescue Plan to have a long-term, spread-out impact — whether it’s the
Child Tax Credit or benefits that are going to schools that are spread
out over the course of a year — because we are still in a recovery.    
   
Q    Back-to-school question: Florida’s Governor DeSantis says that he
may start withholding funds from school districts that don’t let parents
opt out of policies that require masks in the classroom.  Does the
President think that parents should have that kind of power?    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think I’ve spoken to this a few times, but I will
say, as a parent myself of two young children, that I want public health
officials to make decisions about how to keep my kids safe, not
politicians.    
   
And not only is Governor DeSantis not abiding by public health
decisions, he’s fundraising off of this.    
   
So, my view is that — and our view, as an administration, is that
teacher — parents in Florida, parents across the country should have the
ability and the knowledge that their kids are going to school and
they’re in safe environments.  That shouldn’t be too much to ask.    
   
Q    He says that his concern is about harmful, emotional, academic, and
psychological effects of putting kindergarteners in masks for hours at a
time.  Is there any concern from officials that you guys talked to in
your early pre-decisional discussions about that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, there’s not.    
   
And I will tell you from personal experience, my rising kindergartener
told me, two days ago, she could wear a mask all day, and she’s just
happy to go to camp and go to school.    
   
And the objective from all of our public health officials have — has
been clearly — and our Secretary of Education — kids need to be in
school.  We know there’s a mental health impact of them not being in
school, and we should take the mitigation measures needed in order for
them to be in school and in the classroom, including masking and
including allowing that to be part of a reality in these schools to keep
the community safe.    
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    On the infrastructure bill, there’s a cryptocurrency tax provision
in the bill.  And some bipartisan lawmakers have suggested an
alternative to the White House-backed cryptocurrency.  Are you — is the
White House asking for those lawmakers — it’s Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis
— to withdraw their crypto amendment?    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first we are pleased with the progress that has
yielded a compromise sponsored by Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema
to advance the bipartisan infrastructure package and clarify the measure
to reduce tax evasion in the cryptocurrency market, which, of course, is
the objective — or was the initial objective.    
   
We believe this provision will strengthen tax compliance in this
emerging area of finance and ensure that high-income taxpayers are
contributing what they owe under the law, which is part of our
objective.    
   
We are also very grateful to Chairman Wyden and other leaders in the
Senate in pushing the Senate to address this issue.  But we believe that
the alternative amendment put forward by Senators Warner, Portman, and
Sinema strikes the right balance and makes an important step forward in
promoting tax compliance.    
   
Q    So, sticking with that one, would you — would the White House
prefer that Wyden withdraw his amendment then?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ll leave the mechanics up to Leader Schumer.  But
certainly, we see this amendment as an option that helps address the
concerns.    
   
Q    Thanks.  And you’ve seen that he has talked about how the White
House-backed proposal — that Sinema proposal — wouldn’t be good for
climate because it pushes — it undermines some parts of crypto that use
less energy.  So his argument is that there’s a climate, environment
argument there.  Do you have any reaction to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, we’re very grateful to his leadership.  He’s
been a key partner to us in this effort to move this initiative forward.
 I would just go back to the overarching objective here, which is
reducing tax evasion in the cryptocurrency market.  And we feel that the
compromise sponsored by Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema is a good
option moving forward.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    9/11 families are saying today that President Biden should not
participate in any memorial events unless there’s information
declassified that could show some link with Saudi Arabia to the attacks.
 Is he going to follow through with that and release that information?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our hearts are with the families who lost loved ones
on 9/11, especially in these days preceding the 20th anniversary of the
attacks coming up just next month.    
   
I know you didn’t ask this, but I just want to share that the White
House Office of Public Engagement and the National Security Council
staff have had several meetings with groups representing the families of
those who perished on 9/11 regarding their document requests and to hear
their thoughts on policy priorities.  That will continue to be a
priority.  
   
As a candidate — which you may be aware of, Alex — President Biden made
a commitment to 9/11 families to ask the Department of Justice to work
constructively on resolving issues relating to the previous
administration’s invocation of the state secrets privilege, including
adhering to guidance issued in the Obama-Biden administration, that the
invocation of such a privilege be narrowly tailored and not be
undertaken to prevent embarrassment to a person or organization.  He
remains committed to that pledge he made during the campaign.   
   
Of course, any steps would be taken by the Department of Justice.    
   
Q    And, secondly, I want to ask if the President supports a redo in
the Amazon union matter.  Does he — is he calling for another vote on
that?  Is he going to publicly advocate for workers on that front?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s certainly — the President is a strong supporter
of collective bargaining rights and the rights of workers, and has been
for decades throughout his career.  It would be up for the workers to
make that decision.  And certainly, we would leave that process to move
forward accordingly.   
   
Go ahead, Asma.  
   
Q    Yeah, there’s been some reporting in the Wall Street Journal about
a number of business groups calling on the administration to lift or cut
these tariffs with China (inaudible).  Can you give us any guidance on
the stage of your review and what is going on with the China tariffs?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, well, we are always going to use — the President is
always going to use every tool in his toolbox, including tarrists
\[sic\] — tariffs to fight against unfair trade practices that hurt
American workers, businesses, and farmers.    
   
And he’s been very clear that he thinks that a go-it-alone strategy is a
losing one.  We’re stronger when we work with our allies and unite the
world’s GDP.    
   
I know we’ve talked about an ongoing review, including tariffs; I don’t
have any preview for you or timeline for that conclusion.  
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    Jen, with respect to the government exercising its federal
authority around vaccines, you said that the conversations are
“pre-decisional.”  What is the timeline for getting to decisional?
 Like, are we talking days, weeks, months?  Do you guys have a sense on
when you’ll have a determination on some of these discussions?    
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have a timeline for you.  And when we say “early”
and “pre-decisional,” often that means it’s just at the staff level and
they’re discussing a broad range of options, many of which never may
even be presented up beyond that.  But there are a broad range of
discussions happening — early stages.    
   
And obviously, no decisions have been made, but clearly COVID is our
number-one priority, and they’ll continue to work towards what they
think the best options are.    
   
Q    And you said that the schedule is a little bit in flux for next
week.  Does President Biden intend to take a summer vacation?  And if
not, is that attributed to COVID numbers?  Is that attributed to the
Senate infrastructure talks?  Like — what are — what are — why are the
plans in flux?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, every President is always working, no matter where
they are.  Right?  That’s always how it works.    
   
But I was referring to the fact that we know the Senate is going to be
here early next week.  That wasn’t always the intention, as you all
know.  And so I just wanted to give you all a heads up about your own
plans that we expect him to be here early days next week.  
   
Even as he goes to Delaware or Camp David, he will of course still be
working.  But we will, of course, provide   
finalized details to you as soon as they’re made available.  
   
Go ahead, Katie.  
   
     Q    Thanks.  The number of migrant children arriving alone at the
border continues to remain high each day.  And they’re telling attorneys
and advocates that they can wait as long as a month at least to talk to
the sponsor or somebody in the United States or a family member.  So is
a month-long stay in detention acceptable to the President, given the
ongoing pandemic and the spread of the variants?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the — if the President were standing here today, he
would tell you he always wants to shorten the length of time that
unaccompanied children are waiting to go to sponsor homes or be
connected with family members.  And we have made a great deal of
progress on reducing the number of hours, as you know, that children are
in Border Patrol facilities, most importantly, and also reducing the
amount of time and days they are in HHS facilities, where they do have
access to educational resources, health resources, et cetera.    
   
But we’re always working to reduce that time.  There is also another
factor, which is vetting and ensuring that these children are going to
homes that are safe and have gone through a review process.  And
certainly, we don’t want to expedite that over the point of where they
would go — be going to harmful homes — not that you’re suggesting that,
but that’s the factor.    
   
So, he’s always going to say he wants it to be faster.  And he’s always
pushing the system to ensure that’s the case.  
   
Q    And some of these children are also saying that at that these
facilities they’ve gotten food poisoning and have had to wash their
clothes in sinks.  Is the President satisfied with the level of care
they’re receiving at these facilities?  Are there discussions to expand
capacity, open new shelters, improve conditions?    
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t know — are you referring to a specific facility?
 And I only ask that because there’s been an IG review over at Fort
Bliss.  
   
Q    Pecos, Texas.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, well, I would say that there has been — I’m not sure
if that’s exactly the location, but there has been a review of Fort
Bliss by the Inspector General, one that we’ve — our team at HHS has
been participating in.  And certainly, as conditions — as our HHS team
is made aware of conditions that are problematic or concerning, we’ve —
they have taken steps to address them, whether that is providing
additional personnel, additional resources.  That has been the ongoing
case throughout the last several months, but we can see if there’s more
details on that particular facility.  Go ahead.  

Q    Just to follow up on Nancy’s question: You said no final decision
has been made on the UI expiration, so that means that it’s a
possibility that perhaps the President would ask for an extension at
some point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s planning to end — it’s supposed to end, at this
point, at the beginning of September.  So, he hasn’t made a decision to
extend it; he also hasn’t made a decision not to.  So, I suppose that’s
— that’s correct.    
   
Q    Well, it gets to the question I actually wanted to ask, which — you
guys have been really aggressive on the public health front.    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    The President laid out today, I think, a series of six measures
that kind of foamed the runway on the economic front —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    — as Delta has resurged.  Is your economic team, right now, looking
at perhaps new short-term measures to implement if the Delta variant
drives the economy in the wrong direction?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, some of these factors we have been tracking and
watching for some time, which is the supply — one of them is the supply
chain impact.  That’s on a domestic issue.    
   
But we’ve seen, for example, in Malaysia and Vietnam, the rise of Delta
in countries like Malaysia and Vietnam has impacted the supply chain,
which of course impacts some industries here in the United States,
including the car industry.  That has been expedited by Delta but
predates Delta to some degree as well.    
   
We haven’t seen, to date, a direct impact on the economy from Delta, but
we anticipate supply chain impacts and certainly know those would be
factors.   
   
I will say that, as the President talked about earlier today, one of the
— the way that we designed the American Rescue Plan and our economic
recovery plans was to plan for the potential for ups and downs because
we knew an economic recovery would include them.    
   
So, I referenced earlier the Child Tax Credit benefits, which will go
monthly through the course of this calendar year, but then additional
benefits next year, which will help tens of millions of people.    
   
Also, the assistance that’s going to schools — that goes out through the
course of next year.  So there are a number of benefits that don’t
expire right now and weren’t meant to that will continue.  But, of
course, we will continue to monitor any impacts we see.   
   
Q    And then one more.  A couple days ago, there was a U.S. bombing
campaign in support in Afghanistan.  Is it the administration’s intent
that U.S. air support, as it pertains to helping the Afghan National
Security Forces, will end at the end of this month?  Or is there a
possibility that short-term micro-campaigns like that will continue
beyond?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question, Phil, and I would point you to the
Department of Defense.  
   
Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    I’m going to kick off with an international question as well.  How
closely, Jen, is the President and the White House following the war in
Ethiopia?  And are you concerned about the threats to a World Heritage
site, which has just been taken over by forces from Tigray, not to
mention the lives of the people there?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are, Jeff, following it quite closely.  And, of course,
the President is kept abreast of a range of global events happening
during his PDB and by updates through his national security team.    
   
Obviously, the State Department would be most closely engaged on the
ground through our embassy and other officials, as we watch closely.
 But we are concerned about threats to the Heritage site and, of course,
the threat to the people in Ethiopia.   
   
Q    All right.  And one domestic one as well.  The President said a few
months ago, a few weeks ago — time is —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s all running together.  
   
Q    — that he wanted to have both the reconciliation bill and the
infrastructure bill done at the same time.  Then he walked that back a
little bit.  Speaker Pelosi is saying that she wants both votes to
happen at the same time.  What is your view of the timetable on those
two votes?  And are you concerned that one may thwart the other?    
   
MS. PSAKI:  We certainly trust the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and
Leader Schumer.  And we’ve seen Leader Schumer deliver on exactly what
he promised to do, which was to move these forward during the summer
session here.  And the President intends to sign each of them into law.
   
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  The jobs report is getting a lot of praise today.
 But with the Delta variant surging, should Americans expect an economic
slowdown?  What’s the message from the White House to ordinary Americans
who might be a little nervous moving forward?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, first, the message is: This is not March 2020
or even January 2021.  We’re not going to lock down our economy or our
schools because our country is in a much stronger place than when we
took office, thanks to the President’s leadership in vaccinating the
American people and getting economic relief to those who need it.    
   
And I would say, yes, the topline number is very encouraging.  But there
are also very encouraging trends we saw in the numbers and encouraging
number — encouraging data, including wages going up.    
   
So there were a number of pieces of data in there that were positive.
 But we are not going back.  We are not turning back the clock.    
   
And as I noted earlier, the other message is: We’ve been preparing like
Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts for this moment and the potential that there
would be ups and downs in our recovery, there would be ups and downs as
we fight the virus.  And that’s why a number of the programs were
designed to extend for several months beyond this summer.    
   
Q    And one more on infrastructure: Do you expect the infrastructure
plan to pass this weekend?  And what role is the President playing in
the process in this final stretch in the Senate?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President is always happy to pick up the phone,
make calls, even when they’re not on his schedule.  He usually does it
on a, you know, moment’s notice, typically.  He was in the Senate for 36
years, so quite comfortable for him.  And he’s prepared to do that.    
   
He will receive updates from his team on the progress.  As you know, a
number of members of the Senate are currently attending former Senator
Enzi’s funeral today.  But we expect things to proceed and look forward
to getting updates of progress over the weekend.    
   
Go ahead, Fran- — go ahead.    
   
Q    Oh, me?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Sorry.  Sorry.  Thank you so much.  The White House recently
asserted in a memo that swing voters want bipartisan infrastructure
deal, and Democrats, as you know, have an extremely tight margin in the
House.  So why does the White House think that the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Bill will help lawmakers in the Democratic Party keep
their seats in battleground congressional districts in the midterm
elections?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, because the poll showed that 87 percent of
battleground voters surveyed said they would be more likely to vote for
a candidate who supports investing in our country’s infrastructure,
helping grow our economy, and securing our supply chain, investing in
American manufacturing.  That’s exactly what the President’s agenda is,
what the Build Back Better agenda is, what the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Bill is.    
   
It’s also reflective of the fact that, for most people, the economy,
making sure they have a good job, they’re getting through the pandemic
is front and center.  But that was reflected in the D-triple-C’s own
poll.    
   
Q    And while the President may not be taking a vacation, he is in
Delaware, and it’s a place that he goes often on the weekends.  Why is
it important for the President to visit his Delaware residence so
frequently?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Because it’s his home.  You like going home, right?  So,
does the President.  He’s human too.  
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    In April, Ron Klain said the Education Department was reviewing
whether the President could forgive student debt.  He told us that it
would be done in a few weeks.  When can we expect that?  We’re past
“weeks.”  We’re in August, and, just next month, the pause is going to
end, as you know.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update on that.  I will say that — and I —
somebody asked this — it may have been you, but I don’t think it was —
about also student loan forbearance, which is expected to expire at the
end of September — slightly different but also hugely impactful.  I
expect we’ll have more on that soon as well.  
   
Q    And there are some insurance companies experts signaling that we
may see vaccination status kind of be held against people when it comes
to their insurance.  Basically, if you chose not to get vaccinated, the
leniency provided over the pandemic so far on costs, co-pays might go
away.  I’m curious if the administration has been talking to insurance
companies about this and what your reaction is.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, it’s an interesting question.  I’d have to talk to our
health team about that specifically.  I haven’t had a chance to do that
yet.    
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You just mentioned wages are going up in this jobs
report.  At what point do you worry that there might be inflation that
is here for the longer term versus just in the short term right now?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, clearly, the inflation is the purview of the Federal
Reserve.  And we refer to their projections.  As you know, they
continued to project, and haven’t changed this, that while there will be
an increase in inflation this year, they expect it to be transitory, and
they expect it to come back to normal levels next year.  That has not
changed.    
   
And we knew that as the economy turned back on that could be a reality.
 But we rely on those projections, and we take it seriously and monitor
it closely.   
   
Q    And just to follow up on the federal unemployment benefits: Is the
White House willing to acknowledge that that might be a reason now that
more workers are returning to the workforce after they’ve been expired
now for a month and a half in some places?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We don’t see any evidence in the available data that some
states ending unemployment benefits early had any impact on today’s
incredibly strong numbers.    
   
We are seeing strength across the economy and across states and regions,
of course.  But that’s thanks to a number of investments that have
helped get people through this difficult time and get them back to work.
 We know there’s more that needs to happen, but we haven’t seen evidence
of that data to date.  
   
Q    What do you see as the main reason for this strengthened number
today then?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Vaccinations.   
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    With vaccine doses expiring in places like Alabama — tens of
thousands have recently expired — what are the administration’s plans
for continuing the push for vaccines while ensuring that places with low
vaccination rates don’t have vaccine doses that go to waste?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that the number of doses that have
gone to waste is only about 2.5 percent.  Now, we don’t want any doses
to go to waste, but that is a very low number.  And we made some changes
several weeks ago — even — maybe even more than that — where states and
governors can order the number of doses they think they need.  We also
work with states and localities to ensure they are following best
practices in order to get them out to communities to reduce the
potential for any wastage.   
   
But those efforts will continue, and certainly we want to do everything
we can to reduce the wasting of doses.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Patsy.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I have a question on Iran and then a question on
vaccinations.  So, a CENTCOM investigation has concluded that the drone
used in the Mercer Street tanker attack was produced in Iran.  There’s a
U.N. Security Council meeting on this today.  What is the U.S. position?
 And what steps are you willing to take to hold Iran accountable?    
   
And then, I have a different question on vaccines.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Well, this morning, U.S. Central Command issued a
statement on the investigation into the July 30th unmanned aerial
vehicle attack on the motor tanker Mercer Street.  We concluded that —
and it was noted in the statement, I should say — based on evidence,
that this UAV was produced in Iran.   
   
This comes as the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the high
representative of the European Union issued a statement standing united
in our commitment to maritime security and the protection of commercial
shipping.    
   
As outlined in the statement, we condemn the unlawful attack committed
on a merchant vessel off the coast of Oman on the 29th of July, which
killed a British and Romanian national.  This was a deliberate and
targeted attack, and a clear violation of international law.  We call on
Iran to stop all activities inconsistent with relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions.    
   
We know, as you noted, there is going to be some conversation up there.
 We call on all parties to play a constructive role in fostering
regional stability and peace.  
   
In terms of any action, I would — I’m not in a position to preview that.
 Obviously, there’s discussion with the G7, with the U.N. Security
Council, and others.  
   
Q    Okay.  And a question on the vaccine: You’ve addressed — a couple
of days ago — on the question on WHO urging wealthy countries to not
provide booster shots —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — until lower-income countries have had more vaccinations.  And you
said that the U.S. can do both.  We can provide booster shots as well as
help the world vaccinate its people.  
   
My follow-up to that is: In the determination of whether or not booster
shots are needed, would the FDA include research or modeling on what is
the more effective method to stop the emergence of new variants, whether
it’s providing booster shots or maybe it’s better to — if we ship those
vaccine doses to countries who need it, including like the 2.5 percent
of the wasted doses that you just mentioned?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’d certainly send you to the FDA, but I don’t think
they look at things through that prism.  But they’re evaluating whether
there are portions of the population who may need the — a booster shot
in order to be safely protected.  They’re scientists, right?    
   
So, I know that Dr. Fauci has obviously also referred recently — or
maybe yesterday, today; it’s all running together — to that potential
need as well.  We’ll see what they decide for immunocompromised
individuals, but that’s the recommendation that they will be making.    
Go ahead, behind you.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, no.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  So, the last time we talked about debt and deficits,
you noted that the President has proposed a way to pay for his proposals
and that he cares about the future of the next generation.  I’m
wondering what the White House reaction is to a recent analysis by the
Congressional Budget Office that predicts that the bipartisan
infrastructure bill would add a quarter trillion dollars to the deficit
over the next 10 years.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the CBO analysis I assume you’re — you’re referring
to?  
   
Q    Yes, ma’am.  Yes, ma’am.  Sorry.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, no, of course.  I thought — I thought I understood where
you were coming from.    
   
The CBO score, which projects a $30 billion deficit a year for eight
years, does not count real savings agreed to on a bipartisan basis.
 That includes over $200 billion in lower costs for emergency programs,
like paid leave, over the last year than CBO had originally estimated,
and over $60 billion in higher spectrum revenue from a February auction
than CBO had anticipated.  Also, it doesn’t include the positive effects
of the economic growth this package will drive on the budget.   
   
In fact, there’s strong evidence from a number of economists, including
Moody’s, that infrastructure investment like this can in fact help pay
for itself over the course of time and over the long run.  And that’s
something a number of leaders in the Senate are referring to.   
   
Q    And then, one more quick one.  Yesterday, Secretary Cardona noted
that the administration is working closely with teacher unions as they
prepare for school openings this fall.  I’m wondering: Are there any
specific parent organizations that the administration is also partnering
with?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  To help ensure schools opening?  You know, that would — that
is something certainly the Department of Education — they are working
with a range of organizations to make sure they are educated, they have
the information they need, they know what the mitigation measures are.
 I can certainly ask Secretary Cardona if there any specifics or get you
in touch with the Department of Education.    
   
Q    Jen, I’d like to —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — follow up on that —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — on the mask issue.  With Secretary Cardona yesterday, he —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   
   
Q    — mentioned that, with Governor DeSantis, they were — he was
concerned about the EO he did regarding public schools on masks.  And he
said, “We know what works.”  But the — one of the President’s top COVID
advisors, Michael Osterholm, just this — recently —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Who’s not a current advisor to the President, but —  
   
Q    Not a current, but — but was.  So, notable, right?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    He said, in a television interview this week, regarding mask
wearing — specifically the cloth masks, like so many of us are wearing
here and what the kids are wearing in school — right? — largely.  He
said it’s a — that the scientific community has been doing a disservice
to the public on face coverings.    
   
He said that cloth masks like these have very “limited” impact on the
amount of virus that you inhale or you exhale out.  And he also said
that he’s really disappointed in his colleagues for not making that more
clear to the public.    
   
And that’s sort of in line with the study that Governor DeSantis is
citing as the basis for his executive order.  So how do you respond to
that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think you’re confusing a few things there.  But let me
first say that Osterholm is not an advisor to the President, to the
administration, to the White House.  He doesn’t work here.  He’s a
private citizen and a medical ex- — a public health expert.  But a lot
of public health experts are out there speaking, and good for them.    
   
I will say that we are going to continue to rely on the advice of
medical experts in the federal government on what kind of masks we all
should wear, what kind of masks kids should wear.  And if they change
that advice, then the Department of Education will be working with
schools to make sure that’s implemented as a mitigation measure.  
   
The issue we have taken with the guidance of Governor DeSantis — which
he, of course, is fundraising off of, I think we should note — is that
he is preventing schools and teachers and others from protecting
themselves and the students in their classroom.    
   
And as a mother myself, that’s concerning.  And I’m sure it’s concerning
to mothers in Florida.    
   
Q    Now I want to —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we’re going to have to continue.  
   
Q    I have a —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.    
   
Q    I have a follow-up on vaccine —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we’ve got to continue.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Everybody else got one.  I have one more.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You had a very long question.  We’ve got to continue.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    No, I have one more —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — on vaccinations.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  Emerald, we’re going to continue.  
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    On the vaccine grants for India, what’s your understanding on why
the jabs haven’t gotten into the arms in India?  And is this failure
only because of the indemnity that’s involved?  Or is there a timeline
that you can sketch out for us?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  As why more people are not vaccinated in —  
   
Q    Why haven’t the vaccines reached India?  The U.S. — the grant that
was announced.    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that we have seen in some places
that there are legal — legal issues or regulatory issues that need to be
worked out country by country as we are delivering vaccines.    
   
The holdup is not on this end, but we are eager to get vaccines and
continued assistance to the people of India and want to continue to be a
part of the arsenal of solving the pandemic.   
   
Q    And is there a timeline that has come out in the discussions when
Secretary Blinken was in India?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, it’s a great question.  I would point you to the
government of India and see if they have more updates.  But we are eager
to continue to be partners with them, to continue to provide assistance,
including in the form of vaccines.   
   
Raquel, go ahead.    
   
Q    Thank you so much, Jen.  Yesterday, the National Security Advisor
met with the Brazilian President.  And I want to know how — if you have
more information about this meeting.  What was the message that
President Biden wants to convey with the Brazilian President with this
meeting?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, so National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and a
delegation are in travel right now to Argentina.  They concluded their
trip to Brazil just yesterday.    
   
And Mr. Sullivan did meet with President Bolsonaro.  He reiterated that
the U.S.-Brazil partnership is one of our most important relationships
in the hemisphere.  As the hemisphere’s two largest democracies, the
United States and Brazil have a stake in each other’s successes —
success, and we should be working together to advance ambitious climate
goals, successfully combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and build back better
in the region.  
   
And certainly, this, as the National Security Advisor’s first trip
there, shows how important our relationship with Brazil and Argentina
is.  
   
Q    Did he pressure President Bolsonaro on climate change, on
deforestation?    
   
And also, there are many investigations right now on the Brazilian
President, including about his claims that there will be — be a fraud in
the next Brazilian election next year.  Did the White House also discuss
this?  Is this something that concerns this administration that puts
democracy on the center of foreign policy as well?     
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly, in any meeting, the National Security
Advisor and any high-level representatives from the United States would
advocate for democracy, for free elections — for free and fair elections
around the world.    
   
I would note, on climate change, as one of the — another one of the
world’s — as are we — biggest emitters, certainly climate change,
deforestation are always a part of the topics of conversation.   
   
I can see, Raquel, if there’s any more specifics that we can provide to
you directly as well.    
   
Go ahead, Shelby.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to ask — a little bit ago, it was reported
that the emergency compound setup for COVID-positive migrants in McAllen
expanded overnight, and there’s only the City of McAllen resources and
manpower being used.  So has the administration been in contact with
officials in McAllen, Texas, on this — regarding the situation?  And is
the administration going to be helping provide relief?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think part of — one, certainly, I believe, we have
been in touch through the Department of Homeland Security.  And the
setup of this facility is meant to ensure we are taking steps to isolate
and mitigate any spread of COVID.    
   
And we have measures in place that we maintain: Any migrant who is
picked up by the Border Patrol is given PPE.  They’re required to wear a
mask.  If they show any signs of illness, they are referred to local
health systems for proper, appropriate testing.  
   
So that is part of what our — as a government — steps we are certainly
taking.  I can check and see, or I would point you to the Department of
Homeland Security on any —  
   
Q    Is there — but is there anything additional?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The Department of Homeland Security would be the best entity
to talk to about any additional assistance or any new assistance that
we’re providing.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I wanted to bring it back to cryptocurrency.  So, some in the
industry have said that the Portman-Warner-Sinema amendment includes
language that could favor Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies.  Could
you maybe address that?  
   
And if it came down to it, would the administration be willing to accept
the Wyden amendment to move the broader package?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we — our objective here is to support and pass
an infrastructure package into law.  We have — we feel these
negotiations and discussions about this issue and others have been done
in good faith.  And we are very grateful to Chairman Wyden for his
leadership in pushing the Senate to address this issue.   
   
As I noted a little earlier, we were pleased with the progress that has
yielded a compromise, sponsored by Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema,
to advance the bipartisan infrastructure package and clarify the measure
to reduce tax evasion.  We will, of course, be closely monitoring and
closely in touch as discussions continue.   
   
Josh, is that you?  
   
Q    It is.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  How are you?  
   
Q    Very well.  Very well.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You didn’t raise your hand, but I haven’t seen you in here
yet, so I’m just —   
   
Q    Well —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a Friday.  Do you have a question?  
   
Q    Sure, why not.  So, the administration is having the Justice
Department defend the new eviction moratorium.  Given that the President
pretty openly mused about the fact that he wasn’t even sure whether this
passed the constitutional muster and that a number of, you know, leading
experts he’s consulted with feel it does not, isn’t he putting them in a
pretty awkward position to be asking the Justice Department to defend
something the President himself doesn’t necessarily believe is legal?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President would not have supported moving forward
with this modified moratorium if he did not feel comfortable and
confident in the legal backing.  We believe that this is proper use of a
lawful authority to protect the public health, and the Supreme Court has
not ruled otherwise.  
   
We obviously don’t control the courts, but he asked — we asked our — our
legal team, I should say, asked the CDC, the Department of Justice, and
others to look into what options there would be.    
   
This is different from the national moratorium because it is more
limited, it is focused on the areas that are most highly hit by COVID,
and it is a short-term extension.  Understand there’s going to be work
happening in courts, but we certainly support and stand by the
extension.    
   
Go ahead, all the way in the back — Yahoo.   
   
Q    Jen —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just going to keep calling you “Yahoo.”  Go ahead.
 (Laughter.)  
   
Q    That would be fine.  
   
We’ve spoken a lot about Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott this week.  Who
are the two or three Republican governors who are getting things right,
in the view of the White House, right now,  
on COVID?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are a number.  We’ve ca- — talked about Asa
Hutchinson, who’s taken a number of steps.  We’ve also talked about
Governor Hogan in Maryland; I talked about him earlier today.  I’ve
talked about the governor of Massachusetts.    
   
And I’ve said several times: The vast majority of governors — Republican
governors are doing exactly the right thing.  They’re putting public
health, they’re putting policies first, and they’re saving lives in the
process.  And we’ve seen in a number of these states where they’ve taken
these steps, the rates actually come down because it’s having an impact.
   
   
So that’s a positive sign.  This is not political to us.  We are going
to continue to take steps to work with governors, leaders of all
political stripes in order to prevent — end the pandemic.    
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, everyone.    
   
Q    Jen.  Jen.  Jen.    
   
Q    Jen, there’s —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, I have one more person.  I’m sorry.  Go ahead, hello.   
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  It’s Vanessa Tyler from the Black Information Network.
   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, Vanessa.  
   
Q    I wanted to ask you about voting rights.  That’s a big concern for
the listeners of the Black Information Network.  Will the President make
voting rights one of those filibuster exceptions?    
   
And also, I wanted to know: What is his message to people who are really
tired of waiting?  Their patience is running out for many items on the
agenda, like voting rights, like the George Floyd Justice in Policing
Act.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say his message, first, is: He’s with you, and
that he is also tired of waiting.  He believes voting rights is a
fundamental right.  It will be a fight of his presidency.  And he would
love to sign legislation on voting rights and the George Floyd Justice
in Policing Act into law.    
   
He is also, I would say, not waiting for that to happen in order to take
action.  He signed a historic executive order into law, during his first
few weeks in office, to put in place additional protections.  
   
His Department of Justice has redoubled funding and efforts to ensure
they’re supporting litigation across the country, and we’ve already seen
them take action.    
   
And he has continued — and he has asked the Vice President to lead this
effort.    
   
So, the fight is continuing, it’s ongoing, and it is — certainly remains
a priority for him and of his presidency.  
   
Thank you so —   
   
Q    May I follow up and ask for —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  You have a follow-up.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Will he push to make it a — one of those filidu- —
filibuster-proofed exceptions — voting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the filibuster is, of course, a Senate legislative
tool, not a tool controlled by the President.  He has not changed his
position on that, but he is eager to sign a piece of legislation into
law.  
   
There’s ongoing discussions about that.  We’re hopeful there’ll be
progress.  And he’s going to continue to use the White House, the bully
pulpit.  And, of course, the Vice President will be leading this effort
moving forward.  
   
Q    And (inaudible) —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks so much.  Very nice to meet you.    
   
Q    All right.  Thank you.    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks.  Thanks, everyone.  I’m sorry.  We’ve got to wrap it
up.  Have a wonderful weekend.
