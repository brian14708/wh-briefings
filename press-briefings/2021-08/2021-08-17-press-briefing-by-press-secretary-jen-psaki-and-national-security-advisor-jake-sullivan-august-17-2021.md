  \ Jake Sullivan, August 17,\_2021"

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:33 P.M. EDT    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  So, joining me today is our National Security
Advisor, Jake Sullivan, who will provide an update on Afghanistan and
then take some of your questions.   
   
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Jake.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Jen.  And hello, everybody.  I’m going to
start with just an update, in terms of the President’s engagement today
in engaging with his national security team, and then make a few
comments, broadly, on the situation.  And then I’ll be happy to take
your questions.  
   
This morning, the President spoke with his military commanders for an
operational briefing on the security at the Hamid Karzai International
Airport, commonly known as HKIA.  He spoke with Secretary Austin,
Chairman Milley, General McKenzie, Admiral Vasely, and myself.  The
President was briefed that DOD personnel have now secured HKIA, HKIA is
open, and U.S. military evacuation flights are taking off.  
   
Following this operational briefing with his military commanders, the
President and the Vice President met by secure videoconference with
their national security team to hear intelligence, security, and
diplomatic updates on the evolving situation in Afghanistan.  They
discussed the status of ongoing evacuations of U.S. citizens, SIV
applicants, and other vulnerable Afghans at risk, and how we would do
this safely and efficiently and with the laser-focus of the team on
monitoring for and preventing any potential terrorist threats at or
around HKIA, including from ISIS-K.  
   
They were joined by Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, Chairman
Milley, Director Haines, Director Burns, myself, Ambassador Wilson,
Ambassador Khalilzad, General McKenzie, and other senior officials.  
   
Just to say a few words about where we come from and where we are: I
want to start by saluting our troops and our civilian personnel at the
Kabul Airport.  I want to salute the Defense Department, the
intelligence community, the State Department, the Department of Homeland
Security, and especially our country team in Kabul, who have been doing
incredible work under very trying circumstances.   
   
They have safely and effectively drawn down our embassy compound and
retrograded our diplomatic personnel.  
   
They have now secured the airfield and are conducting flights out of the
country.  
   
They are moving American citizens as well as Afghan nationals and
third-country nationals.  
   
They are facilitating flights for our allies and partners to get
citizens and others out of Afghanistan.  
   
These operations will continue in the coming days as we move to evacuate
American citizens and Afghan nationals who worked with us, along with
other vulnerable Afghans.  
   
We are engaging diplomatically, at the same time, with allies and
regional countries and with the United Nations to address the situation
in Afghanistan.   
   
We are in contact with the Taliban to ensure the safe passage of people
to the airport.  
   
We are monitoring for any potential terrorist threats, as I just
mentioned, including from ISIS-K.  
   
We intend to continue these operations over the coming days before
completing our drawdown.  
   
When you work on any policy issue — domestic policy, foreign policy, any
policy issue — the human costs and consequences loom large.  And we’re
all contending with the human costs of these developments.  The images
from the past couple of days at the airport have been heartbreaking.  
   
But President Biden had to think about the human costs of the
alternative path as well, which was to stay in the middle of a civil
conflict in Afghanistan.  
   
There are those who argue that with 2,500 forces — the number of forces
in country when President Biden took office — we could have sustained a
stable, peaceful Afghanistan.  That is simply wrong.   
   
The previous administration drew down from 15,000 troops to 2,500.  And
even at 15,000, the Afghan government forces were losing ground.  
   
What has unfolded over the past month has proven decisively that it
would have taken a significant American troop presence, multiple times
greater than what President Biden was handed, to stop a Taliban
onslaught.   
   
And we would have taken casualties.  American men and women would have
been fighting and dying once again in Afghanistan, and President Biden
was not prepared to send additional forces or ask any American personnel
to do that over the period ahead.  
   
There have been questions raised about whether we should have drawn down
our embassy and evacuated our Afghan allies earlier.  These are
reasonable questions.   
   
We did dramatically accelerate the SIV process and move out a
substantial number of SIV applicants and their families.  
   
But the Afghan government and its supporters, including many of the
people now seeking to leave, made a passionate case that we should not
conduct a mass evacuation lest we trigger a loss of confidence in the
government.  Now, our signaling support for the government obviously did
not save the government, but this was a considered judgment.  
   
When you conclude 20 years of military action in a civil war in another
country with the impacts of 20 years of decisions that have piled up,
you have to make a lot of hard calls, none with clean outcomes.  What
you can do is plan for all contingencies.  We did that.  
   
The American forces now on the ground at HKIA are there because of
contingency planning and drilling we did over the course of months,
preparing for a range of scenarios, including dire scenarios.   
   
President Biden ordered multiple battalions to be pre-positioned in
theater, and he activated them for deployment before the fall of Kabul. 
He also put additional battalions on a short string here in the United
States.  Those battalions have now flowed in as well.  
   
Yes, there were chaotic scenes yesterday.  But as Admiral Kirby said,
even well drawn plans don’t survive first contact with reality and they
require adjustments.  And we’ve made those adjustments.  
   
We will stay in close touch with our allies and partners in the days
ahead as we contend with the immediate need to complete the evacuation
mission and as we deal with the broader challenges posed by the new
reality in Afghanistan.  
   
And we will remain persistently vigilant against the terrorism threat in
Afghanistan and in multiple other theaters across multiple
continents.   
   
We have proven in other places that we can suppress terrorism without a
permanent military presence on the ground, and we intend to do exactly
that in Afghanistan.  
   
And with that, I would be happy to take to take your questions.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    So, I wanted to ask — the President yesterday said that the buck
stops with him.  I want to get an understanding of what did he mean by —
what is he taking ownership of?  Not just the decision to leave
Afghanistan, but is he taking responsibility for the chaos that happened
during the evacuations, for the decisions not to do evacuations sooner? 
For all — is he taking responsibility for that and for any bloodshed
that may be happening right now?  Is he taking responsibility for
that?  
   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  He’s taking responsibility for every decision the United
States government took with respect to Afghanistan, because, as he said,
the buck stops with him.  
   
I am also taking responsibility and so are my colleagues: the Secretary
of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, the directors of our intelligence agencies.  We, as a national
security team, collectively take responsibility for every decision —
good decision, every decision that doesn’t produce perfect outcomes. 
That is what responsibility is.  
   
Now, at the same time, that doesn’t change the fact that there are other
parties here responsible as well who have taken actions and decisions
that helped lead us to where we are.  So, from our perspective, what we
have to do now is focus on the task at hand, the mission at hand.   
   
You mentioned chaos at the airport yesterday.  At the end of the day,
the question is: Can we effectively evacuate those people who we intend
to evacuate?  And that is what we are planning for and executing
against, beginning today — where the airport is secure, the flights are
going, the people are coming.  And we will continue to do that in the
days ahead.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Yeah.  What is President Biden’s response to the people of
Afghanistan who are now in the hands of the Taliban terrorists and feel
abandoned by the United States, or to those in Taiwan and elsewhere that
are fearful that the U.S. will abandon them to the aggression of
China?  
   
And a follow-up to that is: What is President Biden’s response to people
in Israel and other countries who might also believe the U.S. will
abandon them to terrorists?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, to the first question, President Biden and all of us,
as I said in my opening comments, are heartbroken by the human
consequences that have unfolded and could continue to unfold in
Afghanistan.  
   
We believe passionately in human rights and human dignity, and we want
to work with the international community to advance that wherever we
can.  
   
But President Biden was not prepared to have American men and women
continue to fight and die in the civil war of another country in order
to achieve that.  We will use every other tool at our disposal to
achieve that, and we will do so day after day, month after month in the
period ahead on behalf of the people of Afghanistan.  
   
To your question about allies: We gave 20 years of American blood,
treasure, sweat, and tears in Afghanistan.  We gave them every capacity,
in terms of training and equipment, to stand up and fight for
themselves.  And at some point, it was the time for the United States to
say that the Afghan people had to stand up for themselves.  
   
We believe that our commitments to our allies and partners are
sacrosanct and always have been.  We believe our commitment to Taiwan
and to Israel remains as strong as it’s ever been.  
   
Keep in mind that, with respect to Afghanistan, we said back in 2011
that we would be out in 2014.  We stayed another seven years — far and
above and beyond the commitment that we made more than a decade ago.  
   
And the last thing that I would say is that President Biden is
laser-focused on accomplishing the core national security objectives of
the United States.  And when it comes to Afghanistan, that was getting
bin Laden and degrading al Qaeda.  We accomplished that, and he believes
it was time for our troops to come home.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    So, just now, Jake, you described a kind of choice that the
President — that was in front of the President: either save the — you
know, save the folks, the allies in Afghanistan, the folks that helped
the United States through the last two decades, or sacrifice more
American young men.  
   
I think the question out there on Capitol Hill and around Washington and
elsewhere is: Wasn’t there another choice?  Wasn’t there a way you could
have ended — President Biden could have ended the war in the way that he
wanted to end the war so that Americans don’t sacrifice further lives
for this war, but, at the same time, do a better job of either ignoring
Ghani’s, you know, request to — to not start evacuations or, you know,
figuring some way that we wouldn’t end up in a situation where there’s
masses of people crushing through the airport and the execution of the
last four, five, six days that has seemed, to just about everybody, as
not — I mean, as not the way a competent administration — you know, not
the result that a competent administration, you know, has in the end?  
   
So, was it — isn’t that a false choice?  And why couldn’t you do both?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, what I would say is that we were clear-eyed
going in when we made this decision that it was possible that the
Taliban would end up in control of Afghanistan.  We were clear-eyed
about that.  
   
Now, as the President said in his remarks yesterday, we did not
anticipate that it would happen at this speed, though we were planning
for these potential contingencies.  
   
The reason I say that at the outset — that we knew it was possible they
could take over and that had to be built into our calculus in making the
determination, as the President did, to draw down our forces — is
because once the Taliban came into Kabul, we were going to be faced with
a situation — no matter if there were still U.S. troops on the ground or
no U.S. troops on the ground — of dealing with a significant number of
people wanting to come to an airport to try to get evacuated.  
   
I’ll give you an example: We communicated with American citizens for
weeks, telling them to get out of the country.  We offered financial
assistance for those who wouldn’t be able to afford to get on flights
themselves.  Many chose to stay right until the end, and that was their
choice.  We now are faced with a circumstance where we have to help
evacuate those.  That’s our responsibility as the U.S. government.   
   
But the point I’m making is that when a civil war comes to an end with
an opposing force marching on the capital, there are going to be scenes
of chaos, there are going to be lots of people leaving the country. 
That is not something that can be fundamentally avoided.   
   
And so, while it is a point for reasonable debate, in my view, as to how
to think about the right moment to signal a complete loss of confidence
in a government or not and which is going to lead to more suffering and
death or not, the fact is that we made the judgments we made based on
the information we had at the time, while preparing for the alternative
contingency, which was having to flow in these troops to be able to get
out folks in a mass evacuation.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  Do you believe that the mission could be
completed by August 31st?  As the National Security Advisor, what do you
see the scenario on September 1st?  Do you think the Taliban of 2021 is
different than 2001?  Do you see analogous situation to Iraq, where a
new terrorist organization would be born — like ISIS out of the
(inaudible) in Iraq, for example?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, just on the last point: It’s fairly well documented
that the Taliban and ISIS-K fight one another, struggle against one
another.  So, I do not foresee a symbiotic relationship there — though
these are dynamics scenarios, so we will have to see how it plays.   
   
We are working day by day to get as many people out, so I’m not going to
speculate on the timetable question that you just laid out.   
   
And then finally, on what we expect from the Taliban going forward, that
is something that will have to be watched and observed over time. 
Whether in fact they are prepared to meet their obligations to the basic
human rights and human dignity of people, to the safe passage of people
to the airport, to the fair and — fair and just treatment of civilians,
that is something they’re going to have to show.   
   
I come at this with no expectations, but only a sense that they will
have to prove to the international community who they ultimately are
going to end up being.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  Can you tell us what is it exactly — the
commitment that you have secured from the Taliban, regarding the safe
passage of Americans as well as the tens of thousands of vulnerable
Afghans?

MR. SULLIVAN:  The Taliban have informed us that they are prepared to
provide the safe passage of civilians to the airport, and we intend to
hold them to that commitment.  
   
Q    Do you believe them?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  (Calling on another reporter.)  
   
Q    Just for clarity on that, is there some deadline that’s been set? 
Has the Taliban given assurances that this will go until August 31st? 
Is the deadline before that or after that?  For clarity on what you just
said.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Until — we believe that this can go until the 31st.  We
are talking to them about what the exact timetable is for how this will
all play out.  And I don’t want to negotiate in public on working out
the best modality to get the most people out in the most efficient way
possible.  
   
Q    So let me — let me —  
   
Q    Jake, can I follow on that?

MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  I have a question about that.  Yesterday,
President Biden said that the United States military cannot sacrifice —
sacrifice where there is no national interest.  If the same (inaudible),
would the U.S. withdraw troops from its allies, including South Korea? 
What (inaudible)?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, the President, as he has said repeatedly, has no
intention of drawing down our forces from South Korea or from Europe,
where we have sustained troop presences for a very long time — not in
the middle of a civil war, but to deal with the potential of an external
enemy and to protect our ally against that external enemy.  So, it is a
fundamentally different kind of situation from the one we were presented
with in Afghanistan.   
   
Q    (Cross-talk.)  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you.  The President, yesterday, said the situation in
Afghanistan unfolded more quickly than anticipated.  You said it
yourself just a few moments ago.  But numerous officials have told ABC
that there were key intelligence assessments warning the Taliban could
overwhelm the country and take the capital within weeks.  Did the White
House disregard that intelligence and push ahead?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m not actually familiar with the intelligence
assessments you’re describing.  But I also don’t want to get into
specific intelligence products.  And one thing I will not do from this
podium or anywhere else is talk about what a different component of the
interagency did or didn’t do because, from my perspective, we are one
team with one mission, trying to execute and do so in the best interests
of our interests and values.   
   
So I will leave it at that.  
   
Q  Jake, in the last few days —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  
   
Q    If that mission is not complete by August 31st and there are
Americans and Afghan allies who remain there, will U.S. troops stay
until everyone is out, or will they leave?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I’m not going to comment on hypotheticals.  What I’m
going to do is stay focused on the task at hand, which is getting as
many people out as rapidly as possible.  And we will take that day by
day.  
   
Q    So you can’t commit to —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  (Calling on a reporter.)  
   
Q    — bringing back every American home?  
   
Q    There’s a large — there’s a large number of —  
   
Q    Jake, you — you said that —  
   
Q    There’s a large number of Christian missionaries and aid workers
that are particularly vulnerable because they’re known to be
Christians.  Is there any plan to get them to the airport and get them
out?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We are working with a variety of different types of
groups — journalists, aid workers, NGO workers, and so forth — to help
facilitate their departure from the country.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Jake, you talk about these contingencies plans, but the President
of the United States left White House on Friday.  When did your
administration know that another 6,000 troops were going to be needed
for this withdrawal?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, on Wednesday evening, the President convened the
principals — this is last Wednesday evening — to discuss the
deteriorating situation on the ground in Afghanistan.  He posed the
question as to whether we had to flow more forces in, from the point of
view of a contingency, to draw down our embassy and to secure
evacuation.  
   
Thursday morning, he gave the order to begin flowing those forces in.   
   
And then, as we watched the situation unfold over the course of the
coming days, we determined that we would go from step one of that
contingency plan — which was about 3,000 troops — to step two of that
contingency plan, which was about 6,000 troops.  
   
Q    If he had flown them in, why did he leave the White House?  If on
Thursday he knew, why did he leave the White House on Friday?    
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The President worked throughout the entire weekend.  I
was intimately familiar with his working habits over the course of the
weekend because I was on the phone with him constantly; Secretary Austin
was on the phone with him; Chairman Milley, Secretary Blinken, the team
in country.   
   
So, he was monitoring developments hour by hour throughout that entire
time and has been making a series of decisions about troop deployments;
giving us direction and guidance about how to take the shape of this
mission and make sure that we’re executing it; and, at every turn,
asking our military — who is leading this mission and executing this
mission with bravery and valor — “What do you need?  I will get you
anything you need.”  He asked that question multiple times every single
day.  So President Biden has been deeply engaged in this.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Jake, last week —  
   
Q    Jake — sorry.  There’s a lot of anger in Australia this morning
about the way this has played out.  We’ve got citizens and then, of
course, so many Afghans who have helped the Australian Forces and
helping the U.S. mission over the past 20 years.   
   
Does the administration accept some responsibility?  Or perhaps, what
would be your response to those people who are trapped and some are
fearing execution because of the exit strategy or perhaps lack of
competent exit strategy?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We do take some responsibility for our allies and
partners in Afghanistan.  In fact, as I said in my opening comments, we
are working to facilitate flights — and have already done so — for
countries that have lined them up and gotten their citizens to the
airport.   
   
And we will be eager to work with Australia to help get out Australian
citizens and other individuals who the Australians would like to see get
out.  
   
Yes.   
   
Q    Jake, what do you say to the next generation of Afghan women and
children — young girls who face fundamentally different human rights
moving forward?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I say that truly, deeply my heart goes out to Afghan
women and girls in the country today under the Taliban.  We’ve seen what
they’ve done before.  And that’s a very hard thing for any of us to
face.   
   
But this wasn’t a choice just between saving those women and girls, and
not saving those women and girls.  The alternative choice had its own
set of human costs and consequences, as I said.  And those human costs
and consequences would have involved a substantial ramp-up of American
participation in a civil war, with more loss of life, more bloodshed,
families here in the United States who would be asking a different form
of the question you just asked.  
   
These are the choices a President has to make.  And it doesn’t mean,
because we don’t have forces in that country, that we’re not going to
fight on behalf of women and girls and human rights and human dignity. 
We are.  We do in many other countries where we don’t have active
military participation, and we’ll do it in Afghanistan too.  And we will
attempt to use every measure of tool and influence we have, along with
our international allies and partners, to alleviate the burden that
those women and girls will face in the days ahead.  We are absolutely
resolutely committed to that.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Do you recognize the Taliban as the legitimate governing power in
Afghanistan now?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Right now, there is a chaotic situation in Kabul where we
don’t even have the establishment of a governing authority, so it would
be really premature to address that question.   
   
Ultimately, it’s going to be up to the Taliban to show the rest of the
world who they are and how they intend to proceed.  The track record has
not been good, but it’s premature to address that question at this
point.  
Yes.  
   
Q    Jake, you said that the Taliban is committed to safe passage to the
airport, but our reporting is that they’ve set up checkpoints outside
the airport, people are being beaten and whipped when they try and cross
these checkpoints, and that some of the evacuation flights are leaving
nearly empty as a result.  What assurances do you have specifically
about these checkpoints, and when do you expect them to stop doing
those?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, two things about that.  First, the earliest
evacuation flights in any evacuation tend not to have every seat filled
because the process of getting any evacuation underway has a throughput
issue.  So, we believe that that is being resolved with each successive
flight, and we will be putting 300 passengers on your average military
cargo plane heading out of the country, one after another — hot
onloading and hot offloading.   
   
Second, in terms of people being turned away: By and large, what we have
found is that people have been able to get to the airport.  In fact,
very large numbers of people have been able to get to the airport and
present themselves.   
   
There have been instances where we have received reports of people being
turned away or pushed back or even beaten.  We are taking that up in a
channel with the Taliban to try to resolve those issues.  And we are
concerned about whether that will continue to unfold in the coming
days.   
   
As things stand right now, what we are finding is that we are getting
people through the gate, we are getting them lined up, and we are
getting them on planes, but this is an hour-by-hour issue.  And it’s
something we are clear-eyed about and very focused on holding the
Taliban accountable to follow through on its commitment.  
   
Q    Jake?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.   
   
Q    Thanks so much.  You’ve talked about your confidence in the
contingency planning.  And I’m wondering if, in hindsight, looking at
the planning and execution, what this administration would have done
differently knowing what it knows now?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  It’s a good question, and it’s one that we will conduct
an extensive “hotwash,” as we say.  We will take a look at every aspect
of this from top to bottom.   
   
But sitting here today, I’m spending every hour I have focused on how we
execute the mission we have before us, which is getting all of these
people out.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Jake, two questions for you.  One, has the President spoke to any
other world leaders since Kabul fell to the Taliban?  
   
MR.  SULLIVAN:  Sorry, I was looking at the wrong person.  
   
He has not yet spoken with any other world leaders.   Myself, Secretary
Blinken, several other senior members of the team have been engaged on a
regular basis with foreign counterparts, and we intend to do so in the
coming days.  
   
Right now, the main issue is an operational issue.  It’s about how we
coordinate with them to help them get their people out.  And we are
operating through logistical channels and policy channels to try to make
that happen.   
   
Q    And Jake —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  
   
Q    — just to follow up on that: You just said that you will conduct a
review of what went wrong here on the U.S.’s response.  I know you said
there are other additional factors, like what happened on the ground in
Afghanistan that led to this.  Will you publicly disclose what went
wrong and who misjudged the intelligence here for how quickly the
Taliban could take over?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, I didn’t describe that we were doing a, quote,
“what-went-wrong” review.  What I said is we’ll do a hotwash; we’ll look
at everything that happened in this entire operation from start to
finish.  In the areas of improvement — where we can do better, where we
can find holes or weaknesses and plug them, as we go forward.   
   
And of course, we intend, after we’ve had the opportunity to run that
analysis, to share that with people.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Follow on that?  
   
Q  Thank you, sir.  You noted that you had encouraged Americans on the
ground there to leave and that many chose not to.  I just wanted to
follow up on Weijia’s question.  Will the U.S. government commit to
ensuring that any Americans that are currently on the ground in
Afghanistan get out?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  That’s what we’re doing right now.  We have asked them
all to come to the airport to get on flights and take them home.  That’s
what we intend to do.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    How do Americans trust Taliban for safe passage, now, Jake?  
   
Q    What is the status of the —  
   
Q    Former —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m sorry?  
   
Q    Former officials from multiple administrations — the Obama
administration, the Bush administration — have said they are certain
Afghanistan will become a safe haven for terrorists.  I know you and the
President have disputed that.  What do you think those officials are
getting wrong?   
   
And can you ensure that Americans are safer today because of your
actions than we were several months ago?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I want to be very clear about what our position is.  Our
position is that we are going to have to deal with the potential threat
of terrorism from Afghanistan going forward, just as we have to deal
with the potential threat of terrorism in dozens of countries, in
multiple continents around the world.  
   
We have to deal with the threat of terrorism in Yemen and Somalia and
Syria.  We have to deal with the threat of terrorism across the Islamic
Maghreb.  We have to deal with al Qaeda and ISIS-K.  And we have to do
so using a wide variety of tools: intelligence capabilities, defense
capabilities, and — yes, in some cases — the support we can provide to
local partners to help them deal with the challenge.   
   
And what we have shown is, in many of the countries I just mentioned,
among others, we have been successful to date in suppressing the
terrorist threat to the U.S. Homeland in those countries without
sustaining a permanent military presence or fighting in a war.  And that
is what we intend to do with respect to Afghanistan as well.   
   
So, this is not a question about whether we’re clear-eyed about the
terrorist challenge from Afghanistan.  It is about whether the terrorist
challenge in 2021 is fundamentally different from the terrorist
challenge in 2001.   
   
We believe it is fundamentally different.  And we need to be postured
effectively to deal with the terrorism challenges we find it today as
opposed to 20 years ago.   
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  I’m just wondering: Can you shed light on the
decision to leave behind Black Hawks and other equipment — how that fits
in with the contingency plan the U.S. had?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Leave behind?  
   
Q    Black Hawks and other equipment.  Why give the Taliban access to
state-of-art equipment that they could either use to bolster their own
defenses or to sell off to other countries?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  This is a, I think, a very good example of the difficult
choices a President faces — and a Secretary of Defense and a Secretary
of State and a National Security Advisor face — in the context of the
end of a 20-year war.   
   
Those Black Hawks were not given to the Taliban.  They were given to the
Afghan National Security Forces to be able to defend themselves — at the
specific request of President Ghani, who came to the Oval Office and
asked for additional air capability, among other things.   
   
So, the President had a choice.  He could not give it to them with the
risk that it would fall into the Taliban’s hands eventually, or he could
give it to them with the hope that they could deploy it in service of
defending their country.  Both of those options had risks; he had to
choose.  And he made a choice.  
   
And from the point of view of that particular, narrow example to a for-
— a much wider range of examples that we contend with — at the end of
the day, what the President has focused on all the way through here is
trying to take the information that’s been presented to him — the risks,
costs, and benefits — and make decisions that were in the best national
security interests of the American people.  He has tried to do that.  He
talked about that at length yesterday.   
   
And from that perspective, he believes the decision he made in this
context was the right decision.   
   
Q    Jake?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.   
   
Q    Thank you.  The President has not been shy about undoing many of
the previous President’s policies — many of them.  Why not undo this
one, particularly since the Taliban have abrogated already what they
agreed to back in Doha with President Trump?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  You’re referring to the agreement that President Trump
made with the Taliban in February of 2020, which set a deadline: Be out
by May 1st, 2021.  Walking away from that was not just kind of a
cost-free proposition for the United States.  On May 2nd, the Taliban
offensive was going to start; the Taliban onslaught was going to
happen.   
   
And the question facing the President was: Would increasing numbers of
American troops be in the teeth of that offensive, or would we draw a
bit down and try and give all the capabilities necessary for the Afghan
government and the Afghan Army to step up to bat?  That is the decision
that he took.  That is the situation that he was placed in with a mere
2,500 troops in country when he took over.  
   
This was a choice between dramatically ramping up forces to fight or
drawing them down to end our military involvement.  And that’s the
choice that he made.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  The President said yesterday that he urged Afghan
leaders to engage in diplomacy and seek a political settlement with the
Taliban, but, quote, “This advice was flatly refused.”  Does the
President feel he had a willing partner in President Ghani?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, I would just say: The President was reporting the
facts as they unfolded.  I’m not going to characterize anything about
President Ghani at this point, who is no longer a factor in
Afghanistan.  And I don’t think there’s much merit in me weighing in
more deeply on him.   
   
Yes.   
   
Q    Mr. Sullivan, sorry to labor the point here, but we’re speaking to
Afghan citizens who supported the American mission in Afghanistan who
are now terrified for their lives.  Can you confirm that when it gets to
August 31st — when your troops leave — will you abandon them or will you
stay and save them?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Our plan is to safely evacuate the people who worked with
the United States, who are eligible for Special Immigrant Visas — which
is a generous program set up on a bipartisan basis by our Congress.  We
have identified those individuals and families.  We are making provision
to have them come to the airport and get on evacuation flights out of
the country.  That is what we are going to do between now and the end of
the month.   
   
Yes.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  One question, going back to President Ghani: Have
any top officials of the Afghani government — the former Afghani
government made requests for asylum in the United States?  And would
President Ghani and Vice President Abdullah, among others, be welcomed
in the U.S.?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m not familiar with any such requests, and I’m not
going to get into hypotheticals.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  With the President at Camp David, can we — the
American people — expect to hear from him in the coming days as the
operation to get people out continues?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ll leave it to Jen to answer that.  But yes, you will
hear from him in the coming days.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Jake, thank you.  The President — thanks for taking my question. 
President Biden was expected to repair the damage caused by the previous
administration to NATO.  The way the withdrawal was carried out added
new strains to the Alliance.  How severe is this damage?  And what you
would tell your Allies?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  President Biden has a long and deep history of solidarity
and commitment to the NATO Alliance.  He’s — commitment to Article 5 is
rock solid and sacrosanct.   
   
We just had a very successful NATO Summit where we committed to a new
Strategic Concept and a new way forward on the emerging threats we’re
going to face.   
   
He believes in his personal bonds with the leaders of NATO, and he
believes in the institutional bonds between the United States and
NATO.   
   
And I would just note, also, that our Secretary of State and our
Secretary of Defense went to repeated ministerial meetings of NATO for
consultations on this decision, and ultimately secured an agreement of
the North Atlantic Council for it to be carried out along the timetable
that was laid out.  All of the Allies signed up to that.  
   
What the President also committed to was making sure that every last
NATO troop on the ground in Afghanistan — and there were more NATO
troops in Afghanistan than American troops when Joe Biden took office —
would get out safely and securely without incurring a single casualty. 
And he executed that.  
   
And then, finally, he’s committed to facilitating the flights of our
NATO Allies and partners to get their civilians out and to get others
out.  And he is in the process of doing that.  In fact, planes from NATO
countries have landed and taken off with their personnel over the course
of the past 24 hours.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Mr. Sullivan, I think your previous answers are not enough to
assure U.S. allies and partners because, first, Korean War broke out as
a civil war.  If U.S. — the United States commit only to places that —
without civil war, how can you assure allies that the United States will
defend them in a crisis that can be described as a civil war?   
   
For example, if the People’s Republic of China attacks Taiwan, the
Chinese can argue that it is a civil war among the Chinese.  And how can
you just — how can you justify the U.S. involvement in Taiwan and South
Korea?  
   
And I also understand the United States did not want to make a
sacrifice, but, at the same time, leadership requires sacrifice.  And
how can you just claim to be a global leader without making sacrifice?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I want to start where your question ended, because
the United States made an extraordinary sacrifice in Afghanistan: 2,448
Americans lost their lives in Afghanistan.  Tens of thousands of
Americans were injured in the war in Afghanistan over 20 years trying to
help that country stand up and being able to defend itself.  The United
States spent more than a trillion dollars of its resources in
Afghanistan.   
   
The amount of sacrifice and solidarity and commitment to Afghanistan,
trying to give it a chance, was immense.  And it wasn’t just the United
States; many other countries joined us and had their own sacrifices —  
   
Q    But so —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Excuse me, let me — let me just finish answering the
question.   
   
Q    But what is your response to the civil war —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  And so — so, the idea that there was a lack of sacrifice
on the part of the American people is belied by the rows of headstones
over at Arlington National Cemetery where people have come home.    
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  When it comes to Taiwan, it is a fundamentally different
question in a — in a different context.  
   
Q    The Korean War was a civil war, and the United States
(inaudible).   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  And so from our perspective, what we need to focus on —  
   
Q    How is this different?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I’m sorry.  I’ll take the next question if you
won’t let me answer.  
   
Q    Jake —    
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  
   
Q    So what’s your take on the conference earlier by the Taliban,
especially the comments that they made about protecting women’s rights? 
Do have any trust in the fact that they’re going to hold up to that?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Like I’ve said all along, this is not about trust; this
is about verifying.  And we’ll see what the Taliban end up doing in the
days and weeks ahead.  And when I say “we,” I mean the entire
international community.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    The Biden administration has talked a lot about evacuating
Americans and Afghans who helped the U.S. in the war, but there were
many foreign nationals, including many Africans, who were there.  What
is the administration doing to evacuate them safely?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, the United States is also focused on helping
third-country nationals get out of the country safely.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Back in the spring, you and several administration officials
committed that civilian and humanitarian aid would continue into
Afghanistan.  Now that the Taliban has taken over the government, does
that just completely stop?  Is there a possibility that that would
restart at some point?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We will have to take a hard look at how we proceed with
any — on any basis at all.   
   
And as I said to one of your colleagues earlier, it’s premature to
answer those questions.  That’s something we will have to take a look at
after we get through the immediate task of this mission.  
   
Yeah, in the back.  
   
Q    What is —  
   
Q    Thank you, sir.  
   
Q    What is the status of the Afghan Security Forces and the U.S.
relationship with them?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m sorry, can you repeat the question?  
   
Q    What is the status of the Afghan Security Forces and the U.S.
relationship with them?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The Afghan Security Forces appear to have, essentially —
you know, no longer operate as a coherent entity.  They essentially have
given way to Taliban physical security control over the major population
centers.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    What is the future of the relationship with them?  
   
Q    Follow-up question on — follow-up question about the Taliban saying
they’ll respect the rights of Afghan women.  What tools does the United
States have to hold them to this pledge?  And if not, what does the U.S.
plan to do?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, standing here today, I am not going to go into the
full plano- — panoply of things that we can do, but there are obviously
issues related to sanctions, to marshalling international condemna- —
condemnation and isolation, and other steps as well.  
   
But the reason I don’t want to go into great detail on it is, I want to
be able to have our team communicate directly to the Taliban both what
the costs and disincentives are for certain types of action and what our
expectations are.  That is a conversation that we will intend to have,
and I think many other countries, including likeminded allies and
partners, will be having that as well.   
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you, sir.  President Biden said that there were very few
national security interests for the United States in maintaining some
peace in Afghanistan.  Could — would you actually reiterate that today? 
Would you say that there is no interest for us having some presence on
the borders of Iran, on the borders of Pakistan, on the borders of —
near China?  Would you — or Tajikistan?  Would you say that we’re — that
we should just give that up?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I would say that the President does not believe that the
United States should be fighting and dying in a war for the purpose of
sustaining American military boots near Tajikistan or Pakistan or
Iran.   
   
No, I would say that that is something that is not — we — what — what
you just laid out as a national security interest, we would not agree
that it is right to ask American soldiers to risk their lives for the
purpose of maintaining a presence near Tajikistan.  
   
Q    But —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you.  What happens to the billions of dollars’ worth of
weaponry that the U.S. gave Afghanistan?  Does the U.S. have a plan for
that, or does it remain in the Taliban (inaudible)?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We don’t have a complete picture, obviously, of where
every article of defense materials has gone, but certainly a fair amount
of it has fallen into the hands of the Taliban.  And obviously, we don’t
have a sense that they are going to readily hand it over to us at the
airport.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  Has the President seen these images of what looks
to be people flying off an airplane yesterday?  And then what was his
reaction to those images?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The President, as he said in the remarks — in his remarks
yesterday, has seen — these images are heartbreaking.  
   
And as I’ve said repeatedly today, the human toll of the end of this
conflict in this way is real and it’s raw.  And it’s hard for any of
us.  You guys are journalists.  I work in government.  But, you know,
we’re also people.  And this is — this is tough stuff.  There’s no doubt
about it.  
   
But these are hard choices, too.  And at the end of the day, the
President had to make a hard choice about whether to avoid some of those
human costs — the United States continues to send thousands of troops to
fight, and some of them die and take casualties — that is the decision
that he was not prepared to take.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake, for the question.  I just want to get your
reaction to the Special Inspector General Report on Afghanistan.  I know
this was planned before the fall of Kabul, but I just want to get your
response to that.   
   
And also, how are you going to ensure that Americans and other people
who are refugees, perhaps, have safe passage to the airport?  I know you
talked about securing the airport, but how are you going to ensure that
they can actually get there?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, as I’ve said before, we have been working, engaging,
coordinating with Taliban elements on the ground to ensure safe
passage.  We will continue to work that issue, day by day, until we’ve
completed our mission.  
   
And what was — what was your first question?  
   
Q    Yes.  I just want to get your reaction to the Special Inspector
General Report on Afghan Reconstruction that, basically, essentially
said that administrations were not prepared to come up with a concrete
plan for the reconstruction of Afghanistan?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, one of the findings of that report was that 20
years, hundreds of billions of dollars spent, a huge number of forces
trained, a huge amount of capabilities provided, a huge amount of
advising and assisting — and you had a security force that, at the end
of the day, was not prepared with the will to stand up and fight for
itself.  And that is the collection of decisions taken over the course
of many years.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Jake, thank you.  While we have you, can you address the situation
in Haiti?  Two questions regarding that: Will a U.S. military presence
be necessary to secure the road between Port-au-Prince and the disaster
zone for humanitarian aid?   
   
And then, secondly, does the earthquake in Haiti affect the
administration’s view that elections should be held there this year?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, on the second question, it’s too early to tell what
the impact on the political process of the earthquake is.  We are in the
process of assessing that.  
   
On your first question: Right now, what we’re focused on is getting a
USAID DART team that’s been deployed out and active in helping address
this.  We’ve got U.S. Coast Guard elements.  And SOUTHCOM has mobilized
with logistical and other support to be able to provide the kind of
emergency response that is necessary in a human tragedy and catastrophe
like this.   
   
There are no current plans to speak of to deploy U.S. military personnel
to Haiti.  
   
Yes.  And I’ll make this the last one.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  You said it’s too early to say whether the U.S.
will recognize the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan.  Are there
any steps you’re taking in the meantime around sanctions or foreign
currencies or anything?   
   
Is there a chance that if they do take power, that they’d be able to tap
into quite a fair bit of money that the U.S. might want to head off the
possibility of?  Are there any steps you’re taking in that regard, sort
of, preventatively, I suppose?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We’re working on those options right now.  I don’t want
to get ahead of the President’s decision-making on them.  And I’ll —
I’ll leave it at that.  
   
Q    If you are working on those options, doesn’t that then speak to a
doubt that you might ever recognize them?  And if you don’t ever
recognize them, how can you be — how can you ensure that the President’s
promise of aid continuing to the Afghan people will be enacted?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, so I don’t want to get into hypotheticals, but I
would point out that there are a range of different diplomatic
relationships the United States has with countries around the world,
including some in very difficult or nonexistent relationships with
governments where we still provide forms of aid to people.   
   
And I will leave it at that because we’re not at a point yet where we
can speak directly to how things will play out in Afghanistan, but
that’s at least a partial answer to your question.  
   
I know you guys have many more questions, but I think probably your
patience with me is also wearing a bit thin, so I will leave it at that
and get back to work.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  COVID safe.   
   
I just have a couple of additional updates for you — some of which was
provided by the Department of Defense this morning, but I wanted to make
sure you all had this information as well.   
   
As you may have seen, the airport — and as Jake noted — is currently
open for military flight operations, as well as limited commercial
flight operations.  And throughout the night, nine C-17s arrived
delivering equipment and approximately 1,000 troops.  
   
Additionally, seven C-17s have departed.  These flights lifted
approximately 700 to 800 passengers, and we can confirm 165 of these
passengers are American citizens; the rest are a mix of SIV applicants
and third-country nationals.   
   
And I would also note that, in addition, our — the intention is to have
additional flights out this morning.  There’s obviously going to be
operational updates that will be provided on a regular basis by the
Department of Defense.  But as you saw them brief out, our focus over
the last 24 to 48 hours has been securing the airport and ensuring that
we can begin to expedite flights of both American citizens, SIV
applicants, and others out.  
   
I also just wanted to note that, this morning, on a different topic,
Biden administration officials joined a meeting of the U.S. Conference
of Mayors to discuss our eviction prevention efforts.  CDC Director
Rochelle Walensky provided an update on the state of the pandemic, and
Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta reiterated ways that mayors
across the country can work closely with state and local courts to set
up eviction diversion programs in their cities.    
   
This meeting is just the latest in our efforts to communicate and work
with local officials to ensure we’re getting assistance out to keep
people in their homes.  
   
I know we’ve been here a while, but I know there are lots of topics out
there.  Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  With regard to the booster shots, how many shots does
the U.S. have available for boosters?  And will supplying boosters have
any impact on U.S. vaccine donations around the world?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, let me first note that, tomorrow, the COVID-19 team and
our health and medical experts will host a briefing and will discuss
next steps as it relates to boosters.  
   
I would also note for your planning that you can expect to hear from the
President on this topic as well following their briefing.  So, I will
leave it to them to provide additional details and to answer what, I
know, are your good questions about data and an understanding of what
leads to decisions along those lines.  
   
On the supply component of that, I’m sure they will address that, Josh. 
But one of the things we have said repeatedly — and I will note, I said
back in May; Jeff Zients said again in July — is that part of our
operational focus was ensuring we had enough supply to provide booster
shots should that be a decision made by the FDA.   
   
So that has been in our planning processes for months now.  And
certainly we’ve planned for this contingency, and we’ll wait for a
formal announcement.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Does the President plan and the First Lady plan to get booster
shots?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly, if they are recommended.  Once a formal
announcement or briefing is done, they will certainly plan to follow the
guidelines, of course.  
   
Q    And what’s the rest of the — his week look like? I mean, he’s up at
Camp David now.  Is he still going to Wilmington?  What — what’s the
schedule?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know — I think Rachel asked this earlier.  So, the
President will return to the White House.  I don’t have an exact time
for you.   
   
But tomorrow, he will both be doing an interview with George
Stephanopoulos for ABC, and he will also — where he will, of course, I’m
certain, be speaking to the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. 
He’ll also be delivering some remarks on COVID as well.  
   
In terms of additional portions of the schedule next week, we’re still
working those through, so I don’t have an update for you at this moment
in time.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  On COVID, is the White House concerned that moving
forward with boosters could make it that much harder to get more
unvaccinated Americans to get that initial shot?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, one of the pieces that I expect our COVID team to
speak to tomorrow is our operational plans as it relates to ensuring we
are making sure everybody is vaccinated and following FDA and CDC
guidelines.   
   
I think we — what you can expect to hear from them is that we are going
to follow some of the best practices we have used to date, which is
providing access, providing information.   
   
And right now, we’re in a place where we have — we are focused on
providing access, of course, to vaccines around the country and
communities around the country through a range of mechanisms.  So, we’re
actually at an easier operational point in this regard than we were
several months ago.   
   
But, yes, we understand it’s going to take a significant operational
focus, educational focus, and, you know, PR focus to get the information
out once it’s finalized.   
   
Q    Thank you.  And one more on Afghanistan.  Has the President or any
administration official been in contact with former Pre- — Afghanistan
President Ghani?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not that I’m aware of.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, thank you.  You mentioned at the top that about 700 people
have been evacuated in the past 24 hours.  Pentagon officials, including
Press Secretary John Kirby, expect that number to increase —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — to 5- to 9,000 a day.  Can you talk about what needs to happen
between now and then to ramp the number up and when you expect to hit
it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure, Weijia.  It’s a good question.  I think what — what I
had been referring to, just a few minutes ago, was the fact that our
focus has been on securing not just the perimeter of the airport, but
also operational capacity at the airport, which, of course, is a
Department of Defense operation they’re overseeing, in coordination with
the State Department.   
   
And so, because we’ve had success in that regard, we are hopeful and
expect to expedite additional flights out.  So that was not the place
where we were at this time yesterday.   
   
And given we’ve made progress in this regard, we are hopeful to increase
the number of people — American citizens, SIV applicants, and others —
that we can get out of the country.  
   
Q    I mean, it’s our understanding that Americans have been called to
the airport, but it’s up to them to travel there at their own risk.  Why
isn’t the U.S. providing any support, any transportation for them to get
to Kabul?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would just go back to what our National Security
Advisor discussed, as it relates to the Taliban and discussions with
them about safe passage for people who are coming to the airport.   
   
We’ve also seen — I don’t have an exact number for you; I’m sure the
Department of Defense and State Department can provide that — but a
large number of American citizens and others making their way
successfully to the airport over the course of the last 24 hours.  
   
Q    And then just one more.  I know we all tried to ask Jake this
question, but can you offer any guarantee to the Americans and Afghan
allies that if they remain there past the end of the month, U.S. troops
will help them evacuate —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think —  
   
Q    — past the end of the month?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — Weijia, our focus right now is on doing the work at hand
and on the task at hand — and that is, day by day, getting as many
American citizens, as many SIV applicants, as many members of vulnerable
population who are eligible to be evacuated to the airport and out on
planes.  And we’re going to do that in an expeditious fashion.  That is
the focus of the President, of our Secretary of Defense, of our
Secretary of State, and everybody on our national security team.   
   
So that — that is where we will keep our efforts.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  There’s been some criticism from Democratic lawmakers
on Capitol Hill — Mark Warner, Bob Menendez — saying — Menendez saying,
“I’m disappointed that the Biden administration clearly did not
accurately assess the implications of a rapid…withdrawal.”  What is the
White House’s response to those lawmakers?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first say that we did assess early on, when
the President asked for a clear-eyed assessment, that there would be
impacts and there would be consequences of making the choice he made. 
He also acknowledged yesterday — and I would just reiterate — that this
did happen more rapidly than we anticipated here — than anyone
anticipated.  I think that accounts for members of Congress and people
who are on the ground in Afghanistan.  
   
And what our effort is now — is focused on moving as many people out as
we can from the country.   
   
But I would also note and reiterate to any — anyone who’s a critic that
any President has to make difficult choices as Commander-in-Chief, as
Jake Sullivan just said.  And the President made the choice that he was
not going to ask U.S. men and women — servicemen and -women to fight a
war that the Afghans were not willing to fight for themselves.   
   
It does not mean there aren’t going to be impacts that are
gut-wrenching, that are heart-wrenching, that we’re all watching
transpire over the last couple of days.  But these are the difficult
choices you have to make as Commander-in-Chief, and that’s the choice he
made.   
   
Q    And does he still have confidence in his intelligence teams?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He certainly does.  He works in lockstep, and he’s been
briefed on a regular basis, as Jake just outlined — multiple times a day
sometimes — by members of his national security team.  And we’re working
in close coordination to get the job done each day.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Sort of to follow up on Kaitlan’s question about criticism from
people who are your allies or your friends: David Axelrod has called you
the “best press secretary” in his lifetime, I think —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  My mom would like that.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Okay.  But he’s also said that the events of the last weekend are
in- — and this is paraphrasing here, but indefensible, I think.  He said
you “can’t defend” them.   
   
And he has basically said that you guys should acknowledge that it was a
failure and be willing to say that the events of the last several days
were a failure, even as you, maybe, you know, defend the broader
question of the drawdown in Afghanistan.  Why aren’t — what do you say
to David Axelrod, who is such a fan of yours?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mutual.  There are a few people I respect as much as David
Axelrod in the world of politics.  He’s brilliant.  He’s also a great
human being.   
   
But he would be the first to say that there is a difference between
being on the outside and speaking on television, and being on the inside
and the difficult choices that you have to make.   
   
And, as I’ve noted and as Jake noted, even as we’re watching, over the
last couple of days, heart-wrenching, gut-wrenching footage, photos —
you referred to some of them, Mike — the President stands by his
decision because he knows it’s the — in the interest of the United
States, our national security, and the American people.  And he’s not
going to ask mothers and fathers to send their children to fight a war
the Afghans won’t fight for themselves.   
   
And that does not mean that there aren’t chaotic moments; there are. 
That does not mean there aren’t moments that we may look back and, you
know, take a look at approaches and how to address things moving
forward.  Of course.  That’s a part of how you assess governing and how
you assess operations moving forward.   
   
But right now — and he would be the first — he spent, as you well know,
an important role, a vital role advising President Obama — to
acknowledge that when you’re in government, you’re faced with difficult
choices.  The President is faced with difficult choices, so are members
of his team.  And what you have to always make the decisions based on is
what’s in the interest of the American people.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Does the President believe that his orders were executed as
intended?  In these past couple of days, obviously those images that
we’ve all seen — I mean, is he assessing blame at all for that?  And is
he just — does he feel like he ordered the military to do certain things
and they did it as intended?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, his order was to deploy additional military — military
men and women to go to Afghanistan to help evacuate American citizens,
SIV applicants, and others safely out of the country — some to the
United States — and to help our partners and allies around the world as
well.   
   
We are effectively doing that.  And the photos we’re seeing of chaotic
moments, no doubt — at the airport — are of many Afghans who want to get
out of the country.  We certainly understand that as well.   
   
And as Jake just said, when you’re at a point where things are happening
more quickly than anyone would have anticipated — not just people in
this White House, but certainly people in Afghanistan, people in the
international community, probably people in Congress — then you’re going
to have some chaotic scenes.   
   
But the President is confident in his national security team and their
ability to get the mission done and get the mission accomplished.   
   
And as I just noted earlier, right now, the airport is secure.  We’re
working to expedite flights and get more people out of the country.   
   
Q    And then, just to follow on– the President has been quite clear
that he does not have any trust in the Taliban.  And so I — I guess Jake
kind of went about this in a couple of different ways, but do you guys
have any assurances that the Taliban is clearing the safe passage to the
airports?  And what are the consequences to them if they do not?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the consequences are the full weight and force of the
United States military.  And I think we’ve made that clear.  But right
now — and we’re not trusting, we’re not taking their word for it — we
are watching closely, we are in close contact, and we are certainly
assessing whether they are going to abide by their commitments and by
their actions.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, how many Americans are in Afghanistan, both inside Kabul and
outside Kabul?  And should they get priority on evacuation flights? 
John Kirby said that it’s going to be a mix of SIV applicants and
Americans, but should those remaining American citizens get priority? 
And how many are there in the country right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we are prioritizing a number of groups: American
citizens; embassy employees and their families; our locally employed
staff; SIV holders and applicants; Afghans who would be eligible for
P-1/P-2 refugee programs, which includes, by the way, translators who
may have assisted media organizations and others.  
   
We are — there have been — how the process works, I should say — I’ll
tell you — is that there are individuals who will self-identify as
American citizens — that number is around 11,000.  Beyond that — around
the country — beyond that, though, there are individuals who may not
have self-identified, who may come and request assistance and come to
the airport.   
   
We’re going to work to assist, of course, American citizens, but we also
have a responsibility and an obligation to help the men and women who
served by our sides, many of your — the sides of your colleagues, as
translators, and as interpreters, and our locally employed staff, and
others.  
   
Q    So, just to confirm, 11,000 in the entire country, not just in
Kabul?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would just say, that’s the self-identified number,
right?  So — but we will continue to provide assistance.  And we are
prioritizing American citizens.  We are also working to get additional
officials out who have played an important role.  
   
Q    Just to follow-up on this: Obviously getting them through and
getting them to the airport is the challenge, as everyone else here has
noted, but the administration is left to negotiate with the Taliban,
including one of the commandos who was released from Guantanamo Bay as
part of the Bowe Bergdahl prisoner swap when President Biden was Vice
President.  How does he feel about that?  Does he have any regrets?  And
how is he — how’s he digesting that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would note that — one, I’d go — point you to
the Department of — the intelligence community to assess the identity of
the individual.  I know there’s been reporting on it, but that’s not my
position to do from here.  
   
I would also note that in prior negotiations and commitments made during
the Trump administration, there were thousands of individuals who were
released.  So, our focus, right now, is on, again, not taking the
Taliban’s word for it.   
   
We are assessing.  We are closely watching.  And we are being very clear
about the capacities and capabilities we have at hand should they be
needed.  
   
Of course, that’s not our objective.  
   
Q    And then, the last question: What are we doing to countermessage
with what’s happening right now with China in Taiwan?  The President
said yesterday that China and Russia would love nothing more than to
have the U.S. sink billions of dollars and stay here forever.  But it
seems to be that they’re celebrating this.  They were touting “U.S.
humiliation” in Afghanistan.  In a warning to Taiwan and other allies,
“the U.S. won’t come to help if war breaks out.”  China’s embassy is
functioning as normal.  So what are we doing to counter their
propaganda?  And how does the administration view Russia and China’s
engagement with the Taliban?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we, of course, are in touch with the Chinese
and the Russians as we — as we work to bring men and women out of
Afghanistan and — including our SIV applicants and others.  
   
Our message is very clear: We stand by, as is outlined in the Taiwan
Relations Agreement, by our — by individuals in Taiwan.  We stand by
partners around the world who are subject to this kind of propaganda
that Russia and China are projecting.  And we’re going to continue to
deliver on those words with actions.  
   
Our objective in Afghanistan is to deliver also on what the President
promised, which is to not put the men and women who have served our
country bravely over the past 20 years in harm’s way again.  And that’s
what we’ll also be projecting to them as well.  
   
Q    Jen, why was August better than, say, November or December to be
getting out?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In terms of the August 31st timeline?  
   
Q    Correct.  Because this is the Taliban fighting season, and that
would not be.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I know there’s been a fair amount of focus on that, but I
wouldn’t say that that has been an assessment of a difference here in
terms of what our timeline would have been from the beginning.  
   
Q    So there’s no belief that it would have been any different in
December than it is in August?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t believe that military officials have made that
assessment.  
   
Q    And as we ask about the risk assessment right now, what is the
current risk assessment in terms of terrorism and the potential threat
that exists within Afghanistan against the United States?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, as the President conveyed yesterday and also
conveyed back in May, part of our objective here was to make sure we had
the resources to fight the counterterrorism threat that has changed over
the last 20 years, wherever it is.  And that has not been emanating from
Afghanistan in the way that it was two decades ago, which is
understandable.  
   
We have a range of capacities — over-the-horizon capacities, as well as
capacities where we do effective counterterrorism operations in
countries where we have absolutely no presence in any way at all.  We
will continue to watch closely, continue to assess, but I’m not in a
position — I’ll leave that to our intelligence community to provide an
update on.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    You said just a little bit ago that, you know, if the Taliban does
not agree to the safe passage agreements or conversations that the
consequence would be the full force and weight of the U.S. military. 
But what exactly does that mean?  Does that mean there’s a scenario
where we go back in?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That means that we have been clear, and I think my
colleagues at the Defense Department have also conveyed this — that we
have our own capacity — military capacity from here.  
   
Obviously, we have worked with them to ensure safe passage.  That’s
where our objective is.  I’m not going to outline or detail it
further.  
   
Q    And one more: You said then — the administration said that the
evacuation efforts were stalled in part because some Afghans did not
want to leave earlier; they wanted to stay.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Do you have any specifics on this population?  Exactly how many
Afghan allies are we talking about who were eligible to leave but chose
to remain?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a good question.  I can — I can see if I can give you a
greater assessment of that.  What I can tell you is that, you know, of
the initial numbers of SIV applicants that were granted visas, there was
a good chunk of that number who did not take advantage of those visas
and depart.   
   
Now, that does not change our commitment.  That does not change our
obligation, but it’s just an important component of the story of the
last six months.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Of those 11,000 you mentioned — just for clarity — those are 11,000
self-identified people in the country not who want to leave?  Do you
have any indication of how many Americans are still trying to get out of
Afghanistan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can see if there’s a greater assessment.  I would point
you to the State Department on that though.  They’d have the most
up-to-date numbers.   
   
Q    Do you have a total number of people, overall, including
third-country nationals and Afghan nationals, who you want to get out
over the coming days?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, there are a number of prioritized programs.  I think
we’ve given out some numbers in terms of — if you look at SIV
applicants, we have about 22,000 spots at military bases here, an
additional 8,000 in third countries.   
   
Obviously, we’re going to work to assess and make sure we get — and we
work to get as many people out as possible who are eligible for those
programs, as well as, of course — separately — the American citizens. 
But I don’t have a number or an update for you on the total.  
   
Q    And just briefly, on COVID — I’m sorry, I know they’re going to
announce this tomorrow — but are we talking about booster shots for
everyone?  And if so, why should, you know, healthy, young Americans be
getting a third shot when so many in the world don’t have a first shot
yet?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, they will provide a briefing tomorrow on what the
recommendations are, and I encourage you to ask a question — as I’m sure
you will ask a question at their briefing, Josh, as you’ve been ca- —
following this closely.   
   
I’m not going to get ahead of their announcement or the President
addressing this tomorrow.  But I will tell you that we believe that it —
that is a false choice.  We can do both.  And the United States is, far
and away, the biggest contributor to the global supply — the global
fight against COVID.   
   
We will continue to be the arsenal for vaccines around the world.  We
also have enough supply — and we have long planned for enough supply
should a booster be needed for the eligible population.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  The National Security Advisor said, “When a civil war
comes to an end with an opposing force — force marching on the ground,
there’s going to be scenes of chaos.  There’s going to be lots of people
leaving the country.”   
   
But my question is: Why didn’t you have a better plan to secure the
airport?  How could you not anticipate crowds of people rushing the
tarmac and overwhelming limited security if there was a contingency plan
in place?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I’d note something that Jake Sullivan said and
John Kirby said, which is — and I’ll probably butcher their iteration of
it — but basically, the best-laid plans require adjustment when you get
on the ground and see what the situation on the ground is.   
   
We have secured the airport in a short period of time.  There were
initial scenes of chaos, but we — that has been a priority, and we have
accomplished that task.   
   
Now our focus is on getting planes in and getting American citizens, SIV
applicants, our locally employed staff, some of your colleagues out of
the country.  But we did effectively do that, thanks to the hard work of
the men and women on the ground from the State Department and the
Defense Department over the last 24 to 48 hours.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Oh, let me — I called on you.  Just let me do one
more.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Just two quick questions.  One, a follow-up: Jake said
that the President had not spoken to any other world leaders yet.  Why
is that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jake also said that our focus right now has been on
operational efforts, which includes coordination at a lower level than
leaders and heads of state.  And that is our focus: on working with
third countries to help get their citizens out or, of course, working
with others on the ground to get vulnerable populations out.  That’s
where the focus is at hand right now.   
   
And if there is a benefit in the President picking up the phone and
calling a world leader, he will certainly do that.  And I expect he’ll
do that in the coming days.  
   
Thanks so much, everyone.  Have a great day.
