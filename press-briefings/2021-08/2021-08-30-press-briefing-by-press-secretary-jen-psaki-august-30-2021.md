James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:14 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Good afternoon, everyone.   
   
Okay.  I have two updates for you.  The first is one on Hurricane Ida,
which is lengthy.  I’m just going to give you an advance, but hopefully
we’ll share a number of helpful details with all of you.  
   
Today, as you just saw, the President and his Homeland Security team
continue to monitor the impacts of Hurricane Ida, something that he was
monitoring through the course of the weekend.  
   
This was an extremely large and powerful hurricane.  And as expected,
early reports suggest catastrophic damage in a number of areas along the
Gulf Coast.  And while Ida has now been downgraded to a tropical storm,
it is going to continue to inflict damage as it moves across the state
of Mississippi today and into the Tennessee Valley tomorrow.    
   
This will be a lengthy, whole-of-government, and whole-of-community
response and recovery effort, and we are closely coordinating with state
and local officials at every step of the way.   
   
Today, as damage assessments and response efforts begin in the Gulf
Coas- — Gulf Coast where conditions allow on the ground, we understand
that responders are focused on the following immediate priorities:
search and rescue operations and medical evacuations for those in
distress; accelerating efforts to restore electrical power in Louisiana
and Mississippi, where latest counts say — suggest that more than 1
million customers are without electricity; restoring communications
where they are down; and providing emergency food, water, and shelter to
those in need.  
   
In parts of Louisiana, including New Orleans, energy companies have
reported catastrophic damage to their transmission systems, and we don’t
yet know how long this will take for the local utilities to repair.  But
clearly, that’s a big priority for everyone involved.  It could be weeks
to get everything fully back up and running.   
   
Administration officials are also engaged directly with electricity
sector leadership to help ensure all available resources are being
brought to bear to restore power as quickly as possible.  
   
As you all saw, the President just spoke with governors and mayors from
impacted communities, and he was at FEMA’s National Response
Coordination Center yesterday to receive the latest updates on the
response operations and to thank the hardworking staff who are working
around the clock to support state and local response efforts.  
   
The President also approved — you may have seen this, but — last night,
an emergency major declaration for Louisiana, which allows individuals
in the impacted areas to apply for assistance.  He also approved a
pre-disaster emergency declaration for Mississippi to authorize
emergency preparation and protective measures and direct federal
assistance.  
   
I just want to give you a quick overview to the federal resources that
are supporting state and local efforts as of now, and — many of which
were pre-positioned before the storm.   
   
FEMA is working with its federal, state, and local partners, as well as
nongovernmental agencies to support needs of areas affected by Ida.  The
agency positioned supplies such as meals, water, and generators to
assist states with impacts from the storm.  
   
More than 3,600 FEMA employees are deployed to Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and are ready to provide
additional support as needed.  
   
FEMA has staged more than 3.4 million meals, millions of liters of
water, more than 35,700 tarps, and roughly 200 generators.  
   
Hundreds of additional ambulances and air ambulances have also been
moved into the area.  
   
Seven FEMA Incident Management Assistance Teams — IMATs — and seventeen
Urban Search and Rescue teams have been activated, along with debris
subject matter experts.  
   
The Department of Health and Human Services is deploying a 250-bed
federal medical shelter to Alexandria, Louisiana.  
   
And the U.S. Coast Guard has 27 rotary or fixed-wing aircraft, and the
Department of Defense has 60 high-water vehicles and 14 rotary wing
aircraft prepositioned to assist with — with rescue efforts.  
   
Shelters are open in affected areas throughout the Gulf Coast across the
impacted states, and they are implementing steps to prevent the spread
of COVID-19.

The National Guard has also activated more than 5,200 personnel in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama to support response
efforts.  
   
And finally, the Air — Army Corps of Engineers has activated planning
and response teams for debris, temporary roofing, and temporary
housing.  
   
Again, we are working closely with state and local officials.  Even
though the storm has been downgraded to a tropical storm, damaging wind
gusts continue to be a threat, which likely result in additional downed
trees and power outages as the storm moves to — moves Northeast.  And
Ida will continue to produce heavy rainfall, life-threatening flash and
urban flooding, and tornadoes remain a threat.  
   
Finally, our Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Baton Rouge on Tuesday
morning and will meet with the governor to survey damage.  The FEMA
Administrator will also travel to Jackson, Mississippi, that evening. 
And on Wednesday, she will meet with the governor and tour the damage.  
   
The last update I wanted to provide to all of you is that, as part of
our all-across-government effort/approach to preventing evictions, today
Attorney General Merrick Garland is calling on the entire legal
community to take immediate action to help prevent unnecessary evictions
during this public health emergency.   
   
The Attorney General’s call to action asks major law firms, law school
students, and individual lawyers to work with courts, legal service
providers, and non-profits through pro bono services to ensure access to
justice for vulnerable tenants.  
   
So far, over 40 major law school deans, including from Harvard, Yale,
Stanford, Columbia, Howard, UCLA, and more have already committed their
students and law clinics to help prevent evictions.  
   
And presidents of several major legal organizations — including the
Legal Services Corporation, the American Bar Association, and the
National Housing Law Project — have joined the commitment to immediate
action.  
   
And on Thursday, we will join a nationwide emergency rental assistance
program training held by the Association of Pro Bono Counsel & Law Firm
Antiracism Alliance.   
   
With that, Darlene, why don’t you kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Switching to Afghanistan, as of yesterday, there were
about 300 U.S. citizens who were still there who wanted to get out by
the deadline.  Do you have an update on that number?  Are we still
looking at 300 waiting to get out?  Is it down to 150?  Is it down to
zero?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  Well, I know my State Department colleagues
will have a more specific up-to-date number, but let me give you an
update of where things stand at this point.  
   
Of those who self-identified as Americans in Afghanistan considering
leaving the country since August 14th, we have thus far received
confirmation that about 6,000 have been evacuated or otherwise
departed.  This number will likely continue to grow as our outreach and
arrivals continue.  And we have been providing, as you know, regular
updates to all you on evacuations.  
   
The initial assessment, if we go back to August 14th, was that there
were fewer than 6,000 Americans in Afghanistan who wanted to get out. 
So, as we conveyed at the time, we knew that there could be an option —
one, that people who had registered had already departed; or that people
had registered — had not deregistered; or that there would be additional
people who came forward.   
   
And we believe there are still a small number — I understand your exact
— asking for the exact number who remain.  We’re trying to determine
exactly how many, and we’re going through manifests and calling and
texting through our lists, and we’ll have more of a concrete number for
you as soon as possible.  
   
Part of the challenge with fixing a precise number is that there are
longtime residents of Afghanistan, as we’ve talked about in here, with
American passports — dual citizens, the vast majority who are still
trying to determine if they want to leave or not, or have been over the
last couple of days.  
   
In some instances — in many instances, that’s because they have many
family members there, but they have a range of reasons, and we’ve been
working with them to assess that.  
   
Q    And then one other question on Afghanistan.  The deadline is
tomorrow, obviously.  What can you tell us about what the President will
do tomorrow?  How will he mark this moment?  Should the public, you
know, expect to hear from him tomorrow at some point after this has all
wrapped up?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely, Darlene.  Well, without getting into specific
operational details — I know you’re not asking me for that, but just to
preface — I think that you all can expect and the American public can
expect to hear from the President in the coming days.  
   
I don’t have anything to outline for you in terms of the specific date
or time for that at this point in time.  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On August 10th, President Biden told me, quote, “I do
not regret my decision to withdraw from Afghanistan.”  After watching
the heart-wrenching dignified transfer yesterday, is that still his
position?  Does he not regret the manner in which this withdrawal was
conducted?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that the men and women who gave
their lives — and the President attended, as you noted, yesterday, to
honor their service, honor their sacrifice, and had time — had the
opportunity to meet a number of the family members yesterday.  
   
We can’t — that doesn’t take the place of all of the progress we’ve —
all of the work that has been done to evacuate people.  But I will tell
you something that has been said time and time again by the brave men
and women of the military who are leading this effort: These 13
individuals sacrificed their lives to save tens of thousands of people. 
And that is something that is — should be honored, should be valued, and
we will continue to look for ways to do that.  
   
Q    So, after meeting with the families of the fallen service members,
he still sticks by his decision?  He doesn’t regret at all how this has
played out in the last couple of weeks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, of course, that — for any President, as I said last
week, that a day or a week where you lose 13 service members is the
worst day or the worst week of your presidency. And that is — remains
the case.  
   
And yesterday — and I’ve seen him since he, of course, went to Dover
yesterday — he is — of course, was deeply impacted.  He knows firsthand
that there’s nothing you can say to a family member, there’s nothing you
can say to someone who loses a child that is going to fill the black
hole.  That remains the case.  
   
But I will say, if you just take a step back beyond yesterday, the
President stands by his decision to bring our men and women home from
Afghanistan.  Because if he had not, his view and the view of many
experts in military out there is we would have sent tens of thousands,
potentially — or thousands, at least — more troops back into harm’s way,
risking more lives and more people to fight a war the Afghans were not
willing to fight themselves.  Nothing has changed in that regard.   
   
Q    One more question.  How was that interaction between the President
and those families yesterday?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m obviously not going to speak to private
conversations between the President and the parents of service members
who lost their lives saving others.  He was grateful to be there with
the families yesterday and to honor both the heroic service and the
incredible sacrifice of their sons and daughters.   
   
And while his son did not lose his life directly in combat, as they did,
or directly at the hands of a terrorist, as these — terrorists — as
these families did that they’re mourning, he knows, as I just said,
firsthand that there’s nothing you can say, nothing you can convey to
ease the pain and to ease what all these families are going through. 
But he was honored to be there yesterday and to be able to spend some
time with the families.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Two quick technical questions and one other question.  You said
6,000 have been evacuated or otherwise departed.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Is that apples to apples to the 5,400 that had been evacuated?  Are
we now including people who had registered but forgot — or did not
register on their way out?  I’m just trying to understand that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, as we’re assessing, there are people, as we —
as the State Department goes through and calls or emails, who say “I
have departed” or “I have left.”  That doesn’t change the total number
of evacuees that we have obviously provided to all of you every day on
planes and transport.  But right now, we’re, of course, at the point
where we are trying to assess and get a final number.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, from a chain of command perspective, the President
has been very clear his commanders on the ground have the leeway to do
what they think is necessary on the ground.  For a defensive strike like
we saw last night, is that something that he signs off on?  Does he give
the green light to that?  Or is that commanders on the ground who make
that decision?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can tell you that the President has made clear to
his commanders that they should stop at nothing to make ISIS pay for the
deaths of those American service members at the Kabul Airport.  They
have the authorities necessary; it is self-defense.  Obviously, there
are — these are ISIS terrorists who killed U.S. service members.  And
the President is regularly briefed, but he has directed them to go after
and to kill these ISIS terrorists who have taken the lives of the men
and women serving our country.   
   
Q  Okay.  And one more, kind of dealing with dual, very high-stakes
issues right now inside the White House. We saw the dignified transfer
yesterday; the most dangerous part of the mission right now; a Category
4 hurricane slamming the Gulf Coast. Can you talk about what the White
House has been like over the course of the last 48 hours given these
very, very high-stakes moments that are transpiring?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that addressing crises is what government
is supposed to do.  It’s what any president is supposed to do, what any
vice president is supposed to do, and what the senior members of a
president’s team are supposed to do.   
   
And so when you have moments like this where you are facing, as you
said, multiple crises — I would — I would add, of course, that we’re
continuing to fight a pandemic that has — continues to take the lives of
thousands of people every week — you have to rely on strong and capable
team members, and you have to — you have to be nimble enough to adapt
quickly.   
   
But I think we would argue this is actually government working to do our
best to function as best as we can.  Is it tough?  Yes.  Are the days
long?  Yes.  Is it always going to be perfect?  No.  But this is exactly
what government is supposed to be doing.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, back on the hurricane.  Is the White House seeing reports or
have any data about fuel shortages with some of the refineries impacted
and rail lines suspended?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is something we’re monitoring closely, Jeff.  We have not
seen, to date, that as an issue, but we will closely monitor that and
will continue to over the coming days.   
   
Q    And is the White House, along the same lines, considering or see
the need for Jones Act waivers to deal with fuel shortages?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you noted, the Jones Act, which we talked quite a
bit about just a few weeks ago, there are a range of tools at our
disposal that the federal government has to address fuel supplies
shortages during natural disasters by issuing emergency waivers of
certain fuel standards in affected area.  Obviously, if warranted by
circumstances, EPA’s temporary waivers can help ensure that adequate
supply of fuel is available.  
   
EPA, as well as several components of the government, are in touch with
our state partners in Louisiana and Mississippi, as well as operators of
refineries, pipelines, tanks, and other infrastructure to assess the
situation on the ground and what needs exist to ensure the supply of
transportation fuel.   
   
We have not made that assessment at this point in time, but we do have
those authorities should they be needed.  
   
Q    And just last follow-up on the Afghanistan — the meeting with
family yesterday: Did the President — does the President plan to
continue to stay in touch with those families?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  And he’s going to continue to look for ways of
honoring them and the lives that were lost last week as well.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Just a few others on the ongoing evacuation — with the
caveat that things are changing, winding down — numbers as they get
reported here versus situations on the ground.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    We heard, through the weekend, of Americans who were told to get to
the airport and then unable to do so because of the danger on the
ground.  If for some reason — and we don’t have a specific example just
yet but there very well may be depending on when the final flights out
are — what would be your message to those Americans who may get left
behind who were trying to get out?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you noted, and I appreciate the caveat, we are
continuing — we remain in touch with American citizens, as I noted at
the top to Darlene’s question, and we are continuing to work to evacuate
American citizens.  What our message directly would be that — is that
our commitment is enduring and our commitment does not waver, even as we
bring our men and women from the military home.   
   
And let me just outline for you a couple of the steps that are ongoing
that I expect we’ll give you updates on as details are finalized. 
First, on the diplomatic front, the Secretary of State has — is going to
be meeting with a number of his international partners.  Just over the
weekend, the State Department put out a letter from a hundred countries,
making clear that there must be safe passage for citizens, for Afghans
who want to leave after the 31st.   
   
On Friday, one of the Taliban leaders delivered public remarks conveying
that individuals who wish to leave after the 31st would be able to do
so.  That does not mean we trust what they say, but there — that is a —
but there is an enormous amount of international leverage that we will
continue to work in a coordinated way with our partners around the
world.   
   
And there’s also, of course, a discussion about what our diplomatic
presence may look like moving forward.  As our Secretary of State and
our National Security Advisor confirmed yesterday, our current plan is
not to have an ongoing presence in Afghanistan as of September 1st, but
we will have means and mechanisms of having diplomats on the ground,
being able to continue to process out those applicants and facilitate
passage of other people who want to leave Afghanistan.  We will have
more details for that, I expect, in the coming days.   
   
And can I add one more piece that we’re working on?  The other piece of
this is operational, which of course is the airport and the airports;
there are also regional airports.  And we are currently working with a
range of partners in the region about how to keep those up and
operational.  
   
We need to reopen or figure out how to work with our partners to reopen
the civilian airport and ensure that that is a mechanism.  That is an
area where there is mutual interest by the United States, by
international organizations like the World Food Program who want to get
assistance in, and by the Taliban, to get these airports operational and
running.   
   
Q    You anticipated part of my next one, because this ongoing
conversation with the rest of the world about being able to get people
out if they want to leave.  Is there any sense of how long Afghans who
are trying to leave, who don’t leave by tomorrow, are going to have to
wait for further instruction or sense of whether or not they’re going to
be able to go?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There — well, I will — I will tell you that there’s ongoing,
immediate, urgent conversations happening at a very high level with
international partners now.  And we hope to have more of an update on
that in the coming days.  
   
There are different components of this, right?  The airport operations —
it may take some time to get that going.  But we are working through a
range of mechanisms so that there can be an ongoing efforts to move
people out who are looking to depart Afghanistan.   
   
Q    And just one final one on this because, again, based on things
we’ve heard from people there, did the evacuation of non-Americans — SIV
recipients or people who were applying or eligible enough to leave —
effectively stop after Thursday’s attack?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, we have continued to work to evacuate individuals since
that time.  I think we’ve put out a range of numbers since then who make
clear that we have continued to evacuate Afghan partners and other
applicants.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    As the U.S. — first of all, it’s approaching midnight, at the end
of the 30th, now in Kabul.  Is that the way you view the deadline?  Or
does the White House view the deadline as some point tomorrow?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to get into operational details of when we
will continue our retrograde efforts.  That’s led by the Department of
Defense and our team on the ground.  
   
Q    The President said he believed — recently, you followed and said
the same — that he believed that they were on pace — this was before the
attack — on pace to — for the “achievement of our objectives.”  So, as
we approach that deadline, either tonight or tomorrow night, whatever it
is, did the U.S. accomplish its objective, knowing that there will be
likely thousands of SIV applicants and others still there and certainly
some Americans as well?  Did we achieve our objective?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think, first, we have — we have, to date, evacuated more
than 120,000 people.  That’s 120,000 lives that we have saved, including
6,000 Americans and their families, many of them dual nationals.  And we
are continuing.  Our commitment is enduring to Afghan partners, to
American citizens who may not have decided to leave.  That is their
right to determine when they want to leave.  That commitment is
enduring.  But we have saved more than 120,000 lives, and I would let
you evaluate your — for that for yourself.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    When we talk about, as the U.S. prepares to leave, whether tonight
or tomorrow, there are going to be billions of dollars’ worth of
U.S.-made munitions — arms, military aircraft, armored vehicles — that
have fallen into the hands of the Taliban here, giving them new
capabilities they didn’t have before this.  Are Americans less safe now
because the Taliban now has access to billions of dollars’ worth of
American-made weaponry?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me unpack your question a little bit, because the
U.S. military — part of their retrograde effort is to reduce the amount
of military equipment or apparatus that anyone on the ground has access
to.  I’m not going to get into the details of how they do that, but that
is part of their effort.   
   
I will also reiterate something that our National Security Advisor said
just last week: We had to make an assessment, several weeks ago, about
whether we provide materials to the Afghan National Security Forces so
that they could fight the fight — obviously, they decided not to fight —
or not.  And we made the decision to provide them with that equipment
and the materiel.   
   
The third piece I would note that’s very important here is that we have
not assessed that any group on the ground, whether it’s ISIS-K or the
Taliban, has the ability to attack the United States.   
   
Whoa.  We clearly need to — sorry, that was an aggressive bug. 
(Laughter.)   
   
We need to ensure that remains the case, but that is not a capability
that we have assessed to be the case at this point in time.  
   
There’s a difference between the threat that is posed to U.S. men and
women serving, or people who are gathering outside of the gates in
Kabul, and whether these individuals can attack the United States.  
   
Q    So, I guess, the — but the simple question is — acknowledging that,
you’re going to try to limit what access they do have to some of the
weaponry in ways that you can’t communicate here.  But at the end of the
day, whether it’s not the United States that’s under risk as a function
of this, are Americans around the globe — I mean, are Western interests
now more at risk because the Taliban has new access to all this
weaponry?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, Peter, I would say that we — the world will be
watching.  We have an enormous amount of leverage, including access to
the global marketplace, which is not a small piece of leverage to the
Taliban, who are now overseeing large swaths of Afghanistan.   
   
Certainly, our objective was not to leave them with any equipment, but
that is not always an option when you are looking to retrograde and move
out of a warzone.  
   
But that is our clear leverage we have with the Taliban.  And again, our
capacities are over-the-horizon capacities — which, by the way, killed
two ISIS terrorists just last week and continue to be utilized by our
men and women on the ground — remain in place and remain in place in the
region.  
   
There are other parts of the world — Somalia, Libya, Yemen — where we
don’t have a presence on the ground, and we still prevent terrorist
attacks or threats to U.S. citizens living in the United States or
around the world from growing.  
   
Q    Just last question, and then I’ll share to the next person.   Is
the U.S. more or less safe today than we were before the Taliban took
over?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, we are not going to do anything that’s going to
allow terrorists to grow or prosper in Afghanistan or any terrorist
organization.  That continues to be the President’s commitment, and his
order to his U.S. military over the past several days and the actions
that CENTCOM have announced show that he’s going to deliver on that
promise.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is there any concern or disappointment here that China and Russia
didn’t sign on to the letter that the State Department put out the other
day?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It remains an open letter that they are welcome to sign on. 
I will tell you, though, that it will be important and we will continue
to engage with a range of partners, including those where we have at
times adversarial disagreements with about — about the need to maintain
safe passage for individuals who wish to leave Afghanistan.  There are a
range of international organizations and mechanisms to have those
discussions, and they’re ongoing.   
   
Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Sorry, one —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    — other question, unrelated to this, if I might.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    The IAEA has put out a report that indicates that the North Korea’s
— North Korean’s main nuclear reactor may be restarting.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    The IAEA says it’s a matter of serious concern.  What’s the White
House’s reaction?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are, of course, aware of this report and closely
coordinating with our allies and partners on developments regarding
North Korea.  This report underscores the urgent need for dialogue and
diplomacy so we can achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.   
   
We continue to seek dialogue with the DPRK so we can address this
reported activity and the full range of issues related to
denuclearization.   
   
Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I wanted to go to this New York Times report about
the students from the American University in Afghanistan.  The Times
reported that they had been left behind, and they were contacted
apparently to try to get out, held in safe houses for a period of time,
and then were told that the evacuation had stopped.  And that,
separately, the university president apparently told these students and
their parents that their information had been handed over to the Taliban
— obviously, to give them safe passage, which has not yet happened.  
   
But my question is: As this sort of draws down, don’t we sort of owe a
group like that — where we’ve given out their information, their
passport numbers, their names — aren’t we obligated in some way to
ensure that they get onto these last flights, given the fact that the
Taliban, soon after coming into Kabul, posed at the front of the
universities, saying that this is where, you know, the Americans trained
people, and they’re obviously threatened and scared by that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  Well, first, let me say that there have been
reports that we provided or the U.S. provided lists of people who want
to leave Afghanistan to the Taliban.  That’s inaccurate.  That’s
misreported and misconstrued.   
   
We have also confirmed, repeatedly, that we have had to coordinate with
the Taliban.  And so, there have been limited, limited cases where it is
possible that when buses or individuals are at a border checkpoint and
they’re trying to get through, in order to get them through to evacuate
them successfully, we have had to coordinate and provide details.  
   
I don’t have confirmations of those events, but that is the scenario in
the limited cases where that would happen.  And in vast majority of
cases — I’m not aware of any that that hasn’t been — those individuals
have been evacuated.   
   
I understand what the president of the school said.  I don’t have any
confirmation that that has actually happened on the ground or any — from
anyone who is leading the effort on the ground.  
   
And, certainly, our commitment remains to American citizens, to Afghans
who want to leave, like these individuals and these young people who
have been courageous, to get them out of the country.  And we are in
touch with all those individuals on the ground.   
   
I’d also note, and as they know: It is scary, and it is a — it is a very
dangerous situation on the ground.  Another attack could happen at any
time.  And when we give these security briefings or security warnings,
or tell people to move away from the gate, it is because we also want to
save them and protect them.   
   
So, what we’ve been trying to do is work with individual cases, with
families, with groups to get them evacuated if and when we can.   
   
I’d also note our commitment is enduring.  I just — this is a very fluid
and dangerous situation on the ground, and I just don’t have a detail on
this — the current state of this particular case.  
   
Q    Okay, thank you.  And then, on the drone strikes, it seems that
we’re witnessing these happen, you know, with more frequency. 
Obviously, we have the, you know, over-the-horizon ability to get this
done; we’ve got the intelligence to do it.  But my question is, you
know, why is it that we weren’t able to do — use similar action to
prevent the attack that happened on Thursday?   
   
And then, part of that is: Because we now are, you know, hearing reports
of how these are being carried out — one of the drones had to fly eight
hours, I think, from UAE — is there any concern that we’re limited in
our ability to respond in a timely manner if we’ve got eight hours of
flight time and then they can only hang out over the target for, like,
four or five hours before they’ve got to turn around and go back?  Is
there a future, sort of, ongoing worry that we’re going to be behind the
eight ball again?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say the fact that we have had two
successful strikes confirmed by CENTCOM tells you that our
over-the-horizon capacity works and is working.  
   
In terms of the specific threats, what we — when we had — what we had
with respect to the Kabul Airport, we, of course, had been warning about
for days, which was the potential for the rising threats — the rising
threats from ISIS-K, that such atta- — an attack could take place and
could take place at any moment in time.  
   
What we can do and what our commanders on the ground do who have access
to all this information as well is mitigate risks.  We can’t eliminate
risk.  And if we were going to continue to evacuate tens of thousands of
people — American citizens, Afghans, our partners — we had to mitigate
risk; we couldn’t eliminate it.  And that’s — that’s how we proceeded.  
   
Now, the President has been clear to his military and to the commanders
on the ground that force protection is of utmost concern.  And I know my
colleague at DOD confirmed the closure of gates earlier today.  There
have been steps that have been taken.  And obviously, as we’ve gone
through the retrograde process over the last couple of days — and it has
been incredibly dangerous — there are steps that have had to be taken as
these threats have increased.  
   
Q    And the last one, just on overland groups: As I understand, we’re,
you know, looking for other ways, after our military pulls out, to get
people back and out, but has this been at all hampered by Putin, you
know, rejecting a U.S. effort to put counterterrorism forces or bases
for drones in Central Asian countries bordering?  I know Putin also, in
that reported June meeting, spoke for China in that.  Did we ever get an
answer from China ourselves on their position on this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can’t speak to these private diplomatic conversations from
here, but I can tell you we have a range of partners in the region who
we continue to work with and have discussions with so that we can
maintain the over-the-horizon capacity.  
   
Go ahead, Ashley.  
   
Q  Thank you.  Going back to the President’s meetings with the families
at Dover yesterday: The sister of one of the Marines killed in the
airport attack told the press that the President’s comments struck her
family as “scripted” and “shallow.”  And she said, quote, “You can’t
\[F\] up as bad as he did and say you’re sorry.  This did not need to
happen, and every life is on his hands.”  So my question is: How — can
you talk a little about how the President thought the meeting with the
families went?  And also, what responsibility, if any, for these deaths
does he think he bears?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the President made clear, as the Secretary of
State and our National Security Advisor made clear that we’re all
responsible.  And their response- — they feel a responsibility.  And the
buck stops with the President.  And I think you heard him say that on
Thursday when we — he spoke to the loss of life of these servicemen and
-women, as soon as it — shortly after it had happened.   
   
It is certainly the — the right of any individual who met with the
President yesterday to speak publicly about their experience, but I’m
not going to speak about the President’s experience beyond what I’ve
said already.  
   
Q    And following up, you mentioned that the President absolutely plans
to stay in touch with those families.  Is there the possibility he may
attend any funerals or speak at any funerals?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Well, I will say: What’s important to remember here is that
this is the worst thing that’s happened ever in the lives of these
family members, and last Thursday or Friday was the worst day of their
lives.  And what role the President plays or doesn’t play is probably
not front and center for them.  
   
But he’s only going to do things that are of comfort to the family, are
supportive of remembering the lives that have been lost, and he’s going
to continue to look for ways to do that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Two quick questions.  First, on Afghanistan.  The drone strike that
the United States conducted appears, according to family members in
Afghanistan, to have killed 7 children, as part of 10 people.  Does the
President feel the same sense of responsibility and loss for those lives
as he does for the American service members?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say that we take efforts — take steps
from the United States to avoid civilian casualties in every scenario,
and probably more than almost any country in the world.  I can’t speak
to or confirm the numbers or cases of civilian casualties in this case. 
There is an investigation.   
   
I will note that in the CENTCOM statement that they put out yesterday,
what they — last night, I should say — what they noted is that there was
also the explosion — there were explosives in this vehicle that could
have led to additional damage.  There’s an investigation to determine
how this happened.  But, of course, the loss of life from anywhere is
horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they’re living in the
United States or around the world.  
   
Q    And then my second question is about American families: 7.5 million
Americans are set to lose unemployment benefits next month — not just
their federal supplement but all benefits.  Given the expiration of the
eviction moratorium, what’s going on with the Delta variant, has the
President considered asking Congress to extend those benefits further?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, if Congress were to vote to extend — to extend the
eviction moratorium, the President would sign that into law, and he’d be
happy to do that.   
   
Q    No, the benefits — the unemployment benefits.  Would —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We — look, I think he made a decision based on where things
stand and our economic recovery at this point in time.  There’s
additional assistance that continues to go out to people across the
country — which you are very familiar with and know well — whether, it’s
the Child Tax Credit or additional funding that is still being
distributed by the American Rescue Plan.   
   
Our objective continues to be to work with states and localities to keep
people in their homes, make sure people have the assistance they need. 
That’s why there was a range of programs and a range of assistance the
President advocated for, fought like hell for, and signed into law that
is going to be implemented over the course of the next year and not just
ending this summer.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    The President regularly talks about the fact that he’s the fourth
President to deal with Afghanistan.  He made a point in his April speech
to say he’d called President Bush.  I’m wondering, has he been in touch
with President Bush, President Obama — I’m going to assume he hasn’t
been in touch with President Trump, but I’ll ask anyway — about this
over the past few weeks as this withdrawal has played out?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not aware of any calls he’s had with those Presidents
over the last few weeks.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, on — the EU voted to implement new travel restrictions.  It’s,
obviously, up to the individual countries on whether they want to allow
U.S. citizens and U.S. travelers into their countries.  Obviously, we
have not been letting many of those same — people from the same
countries come to the U.S., but what’s the administration’s reaction to
the EU taking that step?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s, first, important to note that today’s
announcement by the EU impacts people who are unvaccinated and not
people who are vaccinated.  And we concur- — continue to encourage
people to get vaccinated.  And the fastest path to reopening travel is
for people to get vaccinated, to mask up, and slow the spread of the
deadly virus.   
   
We continue to work across federal agencies to develop a consistent and
safe international travel policy.  This includes travel from Europe. 
This will involve stepping up efforts to protect American people,
including by potentially strengthening testing protocols for
international travel.  It may also involve ensuring that, over time,
foreign nationals coming into the United States are fully vaccinated,
with limited exceptions.  
   
No decision has been made yet, but these internal discussions have
benefited greatly from our engagement with our international partners.  
   
Q    And just a smaller thing related to the hurricane: Are you
anticipating that the President will visit Louisiana at some point?  And
do you think that that will likely be later this week?  I know things
are obviously fluid at this point —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — but since you have the Homeland Security Secretary already going
there tomorrow.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Right.  It is different, as you all know, for the President
of the United States to travel somewhere, from the Secretary of Homeland
Security, given the footprint.  The President would not want to go if it
were to impact — until it does not impact recovery and rescue efforts on
the ground.   
   
So, I don’t have any prediction of that at this point in time.  We will
see how the next few days go.  
   
Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  We’ve had reports of hospitals down in Louisiana that
are full of COVID patients trying to evacuate some patients.  They’re
having issues of roof damage, some generators failing.  Can you give us
a sense of the scope of the impact on hospitals in that region and what
the federal government is specifically doing about that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  So, first, let me say that I know there have
been a range of reports out there but, as of late last night, no
hospitals had run out of oxygen — as of late last night.  That is
something, of course, that we are watching very closely.   
   
We have — prior to the storm, we had more than 300 federally deployed
healthcare personnel on the ground supporting COVID surge response in
Louisiana and Mississippi.  The Department of Veterans Affairs has made
beds available, prior to the hurricane, to support local hospitals and
will be available to assist in response.  And HHS and FEMA are working
to assess/deploy additional assets as needed.   
   
So, on hospitals: We also have approximately 39 facilities, as I
understand, using generator power.  And we are, of course, working
around the clock to get power back on where we can.  But this is
certainly an area where we — not only did the President speak
purposefully several — over the course of the last few months, and many
of our high-level officials have spoken out about the need for people to
get vaccinated, but we’ve also worked preemptively to put in place
generators, equipment, emergency personnel to help address — and I
expect as we continue to discuss with the governor and health
administrators, we’ll determine what additional assistance we can
provide.  
   
Q    And just a follow-up on something you said in your opening — that
shelters are open in the area and they’re implementing steps to prevent
the spread of COVID.  Can you give us more details on what’s being done
in those shelters?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There are steps, including social distancing wherever
possible — which, I know sounds challenging, but we’re working — that is
being worked to implement; masking wherever possible; and, again, I
would note that the President and several other high-level members of
the administration made a strong case over the course of last couple of
months for individuals to get vaccinated.  We had seen increases in
numbers of vaccination in the region, although not simply not enough to
prevent the spread.   
   
Go ahead, George.  
   
Q    Can you give us any kind of update on the American hostage that the
President mentioned the other day, Mark Frerichs?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  It is — the case of Mark Frerichs is someone — is a
case that has been raised repeatedly by our officials from the State
Department, and also managed — the State Department is working closely
with the Special Representative — Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage
Affairs and the Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation. 
They’ve continued to press the Taliban for his release, continued to
raise the status in senior level engagements in Doha and in
Islamabad.   
   
Obviously, that is overseen — is of great importance to the President,
but is overseen in the day-to-day operations by the State Department,
who would have any additional updates if there are any.  
   
Go ahead, Patsy.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  So, President Biden has said that there is a thorough
security screening process at the Kabul airport for everyone who is not
a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.  So he says that anyone arriving
in the United States would have undergone a background check.  Can you
clarify where this vetting process is taking place?  Because our sources
have said that the President has instructed Ambassador Ross Wilson to
essentially be more permissive to just get as many people on planes
first, and then vet later.  Can you confirm that?   
   
And then I have another question to follow up.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I mean, I don’t think that’s a secret.  That is something
we’ve conveyed clearly.   
   
And that is also one of the reasons why we’re so grateful to several
dozen countries out there — some of whom are serving as lily-pad
countries, where individuals are going as, for many of them, their
screening process is continuing before they proceed to the United
States.  
   
Q    Okay.  And can you respond from — respond to allegations from
groups assisting evacuations that it’s very difficult to get deserving
Afghans out because procedures that were given to the Marines on the
ground and officers on the ground change constantly, sometimes even
daily?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first say that it’s an incredibly difficult
and challenging security situation on the ground, as is evidenced by the
fact that 13 men and women gave their lives on Thursday and we dealt
with rocket attacks overnight.  And of course, force posture and the
protection of our troops is going to be a top priority.   
   
But I would note that we’ve still evacuated — if you subtract the nearly
6,000 American citizens, that’s 114,000 people — many of whom are
Afghans, others are partners — who we’ve evacuated from the country —
SIV applicants and others — and saved their lives.  So, that would be my
response to that person.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Can you clarify, though, how many of those people from the 120,000
— when will you give breakdowns of the nationalities, how many are SIVs,
how many are third-country nationals?  When can we expect that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would expect that would come from the Department of
Homeland Security, and they’re working through that now.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    There’s a wildfire bearing down in South Lake Tahoe right now.  Is
the administration tracking its advance?  What plans does it have for
this?  And, you know, what are your thoughts on the fires that have been
going on right now?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, absolutely we are tracking the wildfires and — and ones
that have unfortunately continued in different parts of the West, it
seems, over the past several months.   
   
I would note that even as the President did regular briefings on
hurricane preparedness, which of course have made us equipped to deal
with the moment we’re facing in the Gulf Coast, he also prioritized
preparing for fires and fi- — and ensuring that — that communities have
the resources they need and that we have the response needed.  
   
I can check with our FEMA team and see if there are specific resources
that are being deployed there at this moment in time and get back to you
on that as well.  
   
Q    And obviously, the administration is trying to boost pay for
firefighters so they get more firefighters on the frontlines.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely, yes.  
   
Q    Is the administration confident that the resources are what’s
needed, you know, given that initiative?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that is our objective, but we will continue to assess
if additional resources are needed.  And again, I would note that when
the President came in, he looked at the impact of wildfires and the fact
that, in the past, there has been cases where we didn’t have the
resources needed and he wanted to preemptively take steps to prepare for
that, to make sure we had those resources as we went into fire season.  
   
Yamiche, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks so much, Jen.  One on Afghans that helped the United States
and helped U.S.-funded NGOs and contractors: Is there any estimate on
how many may be left behind?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, Yamiche, what we’re working through right now
is — how many left behind who have applied for programs or —   
   
Q    Yes, how many may be left behind after the deadline.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, Yamiche, that — I just wanted to
make sure I understood your question — that our commitment to working
with not just any American citizen who has not yet decided to leave but
others who stood by our side, fought by our side — that’s enduring. 
That will continue.   
   
That is one of the reasons why our Secretary of State has been so
focused on working with international partners, assuring that there was
this statement by 100 countries out there, sending a clear message.  
   
I’d also noted earlier the statement by the Taliban about safe passage,
and why we’re working through what the mechanisms and modes are — will
be for our diplomatic presence even as we’re not anticipating having one
directly on the ground after the 1st.  
   
Q    And if there’s no number — it seems maybe that you’re not going to
get into — I wonder —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the difficulty of getting to a number,
Yamiche, is that there may be people who haven’t even applied yet, so we
can’t count those people.  If they’re eligible, then we’ll — and they
want to depart, we’ll work with them.  
   
Q    And related to that, what is the President’s message to veterans
who are feeling even hurt, maybe a bit embarrassed — people that I’ve
talked to — who say that they feel like there are people who help them,
who even in some cases saved their lives, who are now being left behind
after the deadline, whether it’s tonight or tomorrow.  What’s the
message — what’s the message from the President to these veterans?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we’ve been closely engaged with a range of
veterans’ groups because we’re grateful, of course, for their service
and also for their advocacy for so many of these brave translators,
interpreters, and others — tens of thousands of whom we’ve evacuated. 
But you’re right, there could be some that are still there who may not
have applied or have not been able to depart the country yet.   
   
Our message to them would be: We remain committed.  These are our
partners.  These are our allies who have courageously stood by our side
for the last 20 years.  That’s why we’re so focused on ensuring we have
a mo- — means and mechanisms of having diplomats on the ground, being
able to continue to process applicants and facilitate the passage of
other people who want to leave Afghanistan.  
   
Q    And a quick one on the hurricane.  Louisiana is going to see highs
of 80s.  There are reports of no water, no power.  How — what’s the plan
to get to people who may not have cellphone service, who may not have
access to the Internet, who are stuck in their homes given the
circumstances that they may be dealing with.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, this is why I did such an extensive laydown in the
beginning because, as you know, it’s not just one thing, right?  We are
working to — working with — with indiv- — with companies who — to get
the power back on.  That could take weeks.  We don’t know.   
   
We have also — preemptively had set up a range of resources — food,
water, and other resources that we can get to people on the ground.  And
we have deployed an across-government entities and resources — whether
it’s from FEMA, to the Health and Human Services, to the Coast Guard —
to get out to communities to save lives, to recover, to get people to
food, water, and assistance that they need.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, last one.  You got under — you got under Darlene’s,
you know, thumb there.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Two quick ones.  The Washington Post reports that the
Taliban offered to stay out of Kabul and let the United States forces
secure the city.  We told them that we only needed the airport.  Is that
reporting accurate?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have not seen this reporting.  I’d have to look at it.  
   
Q    And then, a moment ago, you said that some of the reporting about
the United States giving lists of the names of Afghans or SIV or
Americans to the Taliban was inaccurate at times and misconstrued.  I’m
wondering if you can just clarify a little bit more, because last week
the President said that, you know, there had sometimes been instances
where maybe a bus is coming through and some names have been given.  But
then he also added that “I can’t tell you with any certitude that
there’s actually been a list of names.  There may have been, but I know
of no circumstance.”   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think that’s entirely consistent with what I just said —
what I — or, several minutes ago.  What I was conveying is that reports
or suggestions that we were giving a preemptive, proactive list of
Afghans or any individuals who wanted to leave the country to the
Taliban are inaccurate.   
   
And what the President said and what I also said, maybe in slightly
different phrasing, is that there — there could be cases where
on-the-ground commanders who are coordinating with the Taliban to get
people through checkpoints to get — save their lives, get them evacuated
— were saying, “Here’s individuals we need to get through.”  And in any
case that we’re aware of, those individuals came — got through.   
   
But again, these are — these are — this is coordination that’s happening
on the ground.  And I think we can all agree there’s a big difference
between providing a list of people who want to depart proactively and
working at the moment on the ground in a coordinated, tactical way to
get people out and evacuated and save their lives.  
   
Q    So it’s a prudential, on-the-ground decision, rather than a general
massive list?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  Thank you, everyone.   
   
Q    Iran-related question, Jen.  One Iran-related question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ll be back tomorrow —   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — and I’ll be here.  Thank you, everyone.   
   
3:01 P.M. EDT
