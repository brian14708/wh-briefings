12:52 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Okay.  Happy Wednesday.  I have a couple of
notes for you at the top.  
   
Today, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge released
a statement committing to do everything in HUD’s power to stop evictions
for families with HUD assistance or families who rent in housing that is
insured by the Federal Housing Administration.  This is part of
delivering on what the President announced — or we announced in our
statement just a couple of days ago.    
   
And while the Emergency Rental Assistance funds are in the hands of
state and local governments, one of the critical roles that the
administration can continue to play is to act as a leading hub to
convene states and cities and to share best practices, as we have done
at two major eviction prevention summits.  
   
So, this morning, Treasury published examples of simplified forms that
are being used effectively by Emergency Rental Assistance programs
around the country.  I think Ebony may have asked a version of this
yesterday — a question about this.  But Treasury has repeatedly
discouraged undue documentation burdens that limit access for eligible
families and is sharing these example forms to make it easier for state
and local governments to put that into practice.   
   
Places that have are seeing results.  I mentioned Virginia yesterday,
but, as an example, Virginia is the second-highest nationwide
distributor of ERA funds in the nation and has given out $223 million to
tenants and landlords in need.    
   
Virginia followed Treasury’s guidance to eliminate documentation burdens
that slow down application processing for eligible families.  And the
state was able to significantly cut down application processing times by
streamlining what is often the most time-consuming part of the
eligibility verification and a barrier for people applying.  
   
So this is a process that we’re trying to share best practices, and the
Treasury Department is trying to simplify these forms to make it easier
for families.   
   
As I mentioned yesterday, we’re going to continue to highlight what the
bipartisan infrastructure deal will mean for families across the
country, as we will digitally as well.  Right now, there are up to 10
million homes with lead service lines and pipes.  Children in up to
400,000 schools and childcare facilities are at risk of exposure to
lead.   
   
For kids, high exposure to lead can negatively affect academic
performance and can lead to cardiovascular disease later in life.  And
the President clearly thinks that’s unacceptable, as do a number of
members of Congress.  And that’s why the deal makes the largest
investment in clean drinking water in American history, replacing all
the nation’s lead pipes and service lines, from rural towns to
struggling cities.  The deal invests in water infrastructure across
America, including in Tribal nations and disadvantaged communities that
need it most.    
   
I wanted to also take a moment to recognize the passing of Pentagon
Force Protection Officer George Gonzalez, who was tragically killed
yesterday in the line of duty.  His life was one of service, a veteran
of both the police and the military.  He served the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, the Transportation Security Administration, and the United
States Army where he was awarded the Army Commendation Medal for his
service in Iraq.  He lost his life protecting those who protect the
nation.  We mourn his loss and offer condolences to his family.  
   
Two more short notes — hopefully helpful.  This morning at the White
House, as part of our ongoing efforts to every — to do everything we can
and engage everyone we can to encourage vaccinations, Surgeon General
Dr. Vivek Murthy and members of the White House COVID-19 Response Team
convened a historic gathering of all living, former U.S. Surgeon
Generals, including Dr. Antonia Novello, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, Dr. David
Satcher, Dr. Richard Carmona, Dr. Regina Benjamin, and Dr. Jerome
Adams.  
   
These esteemed public health leaders who served under both Republican
and Democratic Presidents discussed the importance of ensuring that
communities of color, those hardest hit by the virus have the
information and access they need to get vaccinated.  And they discussed
how we can work together, of course, moving forward.  
   
Last point for all of you: The President spoke — or called, I should say
— Shontel Brown last night and extended his congratulations to her.  He
is focused on delivering for the people of Ohio and across the country,
as is she.  We know his agenda, including investi- — investing in our
country’s infrastructure; helping grow our economy, creating
good-paying, middle-class jobs is broadly popular with the American
people.   He’s laser focused on delivering.  More Democrats means more
ability to deliver on that.  
   
I know you were up way too early this morning, based on my television. 
(Laughter.)  I’ve been waiting to do that joke all week.  
   
Here we are.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    I appreciate the pun, Jen.  Thank you.  
   
A few questions all on the same topic — short ones, perhaps.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Yesterday, the President said Governor Cuomo should resign.  The
governor has not done so.  Has the President called the governor?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  
   
Q    Has anyone from the White House called the governor or the
governor’s staff?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not that I’m aware of.  
   
Q    When was the last time the President and Governor Cuomo spoke?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would have to check on that.  
   
Q    Okay.  And there’s two more on this.  If the governor refuses to
resign, does the President want to see him impeached and removed from
office?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President made clear yesterday that Governor Cuomo
should resign, and believes — and I believe we should start with that. 
There’s obviously a process that’s going to proceed, and leaders in New
York spoke to that yesterday.  We’ll leave it to them to speak to
that.   
   
But the President believes Governor Cuomo should do the right thing:
resign and leave space for future leadership in New York.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then there’s been a lot of discussion in here, including
from the President, in recent days, about the vital role that governors
play in the nation’s COVID response.  In this period, while Governor
Cuomo is still in office, does the President have confidence in him
leading New York State’s response to the pandemic?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, again, the President made clear, because of
the abhorrent allegations that were made public yesterday, that it is
time for Governor Cuomo to resign.  
   
At the same time, we do not want the people of New York to be impacted
in a negative way, as they’re working to fight COVID.  And we’re going
to continue to work with the administration in New York, with leaders in
New York, to continue to fight COVID.  That will continue.  And
obviously, if leadership changes in the state, we will work with a
different leader.    
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Can you walk us through what changed from Monday to
Tuesday, when it comes to the eviction ban?  On Monday, Gene Sperling
stood here and said the CDC has been unable to find the legal authority
for even new targeted eviction moratoriums.  There are many people
across the administration who said the same thing.  And yet, the CDC did
just that yesterday.  So what changed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s important to take a step back a little
bit before that, to Sunday, when we were engaged — the administration,
the White House was engaged directly with the CDC, at the direction of
the President, to ask them to look into what legal options, if any — if
any existed — there were to extend the eviction moratorium.  
   
That process was underway for a couple of days.  The announcement
yesterday was a reflection of exactly that.  
   
And when we put out a statement on Monday, right before Gene Sperling
came out to the briefing, right before we came out to talk with all of
you, that also made clear in there that at that time they had not yet
found a legal pathway forward.   
   
What was announced yesterday was not an extension of the existing
moratorium, which was, of course, national; it was a more limited
moratorium that was going to be impacting and helping areas that were
hardest hit by COVID.  So, different than the last moratorium.  That was
also reflected in the statement that we issued on Monday, that that was
the President’s ask — to look into a more limited moratorium.  
   
They did that.  They — and yesterday’s announcement was a reflection of
that process.   
   
Q    So, what’s your message to progressives who say they’re worried
that President Biden’s concerns about the constitutionality of this move
will end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy and motivate opponents to
go ahead and file suit now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would first say the President shares their desire,
their commitment, and their interest in keeping renters and people in
their homes, and that is exactly why he took the step of asking the CDC
to look into what legal pathways forward there were.  And yesterday’s
announcement was a reflection of that.  
   
We don’t control the courts; we don’t know what they will do.  We are
all aware of the Supreme Court decision at the end of June and what was
outlined in their decision at the end of June.  
   
This is also going to be a temporary — temporary solution regardless,
and a longer-term solution will require legislative action.  But his
message to anyone who’s been a passionate advocate is that he shares
their concern, he shares their commitment.  He wants renters to be able
to stay in their home, and that’s why we took this step over the last
few days.  
   
Q    And on one other topic, if you don’t mind.  I know that the
President has asked the Defense Secretary to look into the possibility
of making the COVID vaccine mandatory for servicemembers, but according
to the U.S. Code, it’s actually the President who has to grant a waiver
to the military to make vaccines mandatory.  Has he granted that waiver
yet?  And if not, does he plan to do so?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President is looking for a recommendation from the
Secretary of Defense.  That hasn’t been made yet.  And when — if and
when that is made, I would expect he would respond accordingly.   
   
Go ahead, Kelly.  
   
Q    The earlier moratorium used the same legal justification that the
new one is using, which, in layman’s terms, is about preventing the
spread of disease if you evict people at a time of pandemic.  So the
only real difference is narrowing location, but the rationale is the
same.   
   
So, after the President was clear that it wasn’t legal, Gene Sperling
was clear that it wasn’t legal, is this a “roll the dice and see if it
gets challenged” position from an administration that may be doing
something it knows is not on legal standing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President would not have supported moving forward
with any action where he wasn’t — didn’t feel there was legal standing
and legal support.   
   
We obviously don’t control what the courts do.  And we have, of course,
seen what the Supreme Court decided and how they ruled, which was not
related to public health — as you well know, Kelly — and was related to
the relationship between the landlord and the renter.  
   
But this is different in that it is more targeted, it is focused on
counties with higher substantial case rates to protect renters, and the
CDC ultimately decided to adopt it.  
   
I would also note that the conditions have changed.  The rise of the
Delta variant, especially in communities where there are large numbers
of unvaccinated individuals, where there are growing case numbers, is
certainly something that has raised the alarm for us, it has raised the
alarm for members of Congress, and it has certainly added to the need to
take this additional step.  
   
Q    We were in the event with Dr. Murthy earlier, and he talked about
the likelihood that boosters would eventually be required.  For
Americans who are sort of taking it on their — themselves and trying to
seek out a third shot, what is the administration’s view of those who
are trying to, you know, “self-boost,” for lack of a better term?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’ve never heard that term before, but — (laughter) —
I am — it’s interesting.   
   
Okay, I would say that what we’ve been conveying to officials around the
country who have implemented this in some places is that this is not in
alignment with the guidance of the public health — of public health
officials, whether that is the CDC or the FDA.  And we are certainly in
touch with local officials on that matter and conveying exactly that.   
   
We also, at the same time, are prepared if the FDA decides that they are
going to recommend a booster.  That is why we ordered the number of
doses we did order several months ago, because we are like Boy Scouts
and Girl Scouts and always want to be prepared.  So we’re prepared for
that, but it is not what the FDA and the CDC are recommending, and we
are conveying that directly to officials.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  There’s been a major push here recently to protect
tenants from being evicted right now.  Why isn’t more being done to help
the landlords who are struggling to pay their bills because they’re not
being paid?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, actually, the landlords can benefit from exactly the
same emergency rental assistance that renters can benefit from.   
   
Q    But, right now, as we understand it, many states are not
distributing that money.  The Washington Post says that this measure
could drive thousands of minor landlords to bankruptcy.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that’s exactly why — and I’m happy to have you as a
partner in this effort — we are trying to advocate for states,
localities to get this money out.  There’s no reason it’s not going out
to landlords, to renters; no reason that people who are eligible are not
benefiting.  
   
And we’ve seen a number of states — red states and blue states — do this
very effectively.  Texas is an example I used yesterday.  Virginia is
one I highlighted today.   
   
This is why we’re doing as much of this outreach and engagement as we’re
doing, and simplifying forms, making it easier for people to
understand.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then, on immigration, it’s been almost four months since
the President told migrants, “Don’t come.  Don’t leave your town.” 
Almost two months since the Vice President went to Central America to
say, “Do not come.”  But people are coming in record numbers.  Does the
President think his immigration plan is working?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President continues to convey to anyone, as you’ve
said, who wants to come to the United States: Now is not the time to
come.  It is not the time to come and try to go through irregular
migration.   
   
We want to have an effective process where you can apply for asylum,
where you can apply for legal status.  We have increased our investment
in areas like the Central American Minors Program, allowing people to
apply from within country so they are not making that dangerous trip.  
   
There’s more that needs to be done.  We’ve also instituted a number of
additional steps recently, including expedited removals, to move people
out of the country more quickly.  But it’s a — we’re still at work on
improving a process and improving a system that was very broken when we
took office.  
   
Q    So, the message to migrants is the same, even though they are
coming — a 21-year high, 210,000 encounters at the border last month?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And I would also note the number of people who were — who
were removed from the border, which is an important part of the context,
which is almost half of that number.  
   
Q    But he’s saying, “Don’t come.”  And they’re coming.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there are a number of factors, as you well know, that
are happening in these countries.  And we’re working to address those as
well, and the Vice President is leading those efforts.   
   
We don’t expect that to be a switch, but addressing root causes in these
countries — corruption, economic downturn, people are fleeing a range of
challenges, persecution — those are issues we need to address at the
same time.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Sort of a housekeeping question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Given the status of COVID and the Delta variant, what is the status
on the permanent pick for an FDA commissioner?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update for you.  Obviously, the President
would love to have a permanent pick in place and wants to nominate the
right person, but I don’t have an update on the timeline for that.  
   
Q    But what’s taking so long?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’s not going to get — he’s not going to expedite it if he
does not — has not identified the right person to nominate quite yet.  
   
Q    And on the Governor Cuomo issue: If this is potentially such a
stain on the party, the President — as the leader of this party — why
not pick up the phone and ask him to resign at this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think the President was pretty clear publicly; he asked
him to resign yesterday.  
   
Q    No plans to call him, though?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any — no plans to call him to preview, no.  
   
Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    Jen, sort of picking up on Kelly’s question: The WHO today called
on countries basically to put a halt on booster shots of the COVID
vaccine.  I know that’s not the policy yet of the United States, but it
does appear as though we’re moving in that direction — at least for
people who are immunocompromised.  What’s the White House reaction to
his call to put that off until at least the end of September so that
poorer countries can get more vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Jeff, we feel that it’s a false choice and that we can
do both.  We announced just yesterday that we hit an important milestone
of over 110 million vaccines donated to the world.  That is more than
any other country has shared, combined.   
   
We also made clear that that is the beginning, and we also started to
donate the 500 million doses of Pfizer we’ve purchased.  We will start
to donate those later this month.   
   
So, we’ve taken action on the global level far more than any country
around the world.  We’re asking the global community to also step up. 
We saw some action at the G7; more needs to happen.  But we believe we
can do both.   
   
We also, in this country, have enough supply to ensure that every
American has access to a vaccine.  We will have enough supply to
ensure.  If the FDA decides that boosters are recommended for a portion
of the population, to provide those as well.  We believe we can do both,
and we don’t need to make that choice.   
   
Q    All right.  On a separate topic, is the White House tracking the
case of the Belarus Olympian who was forced to go to the airport and
then ended up going to Austria instead of back to her own country?  And
is the U.S. providing any assistance to her or anyone else from the
Belarusian team?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are aware of the case.  I would have to check if there’s
direct assistance.  The State Department may be the best source for
that, but I will check with them and see if there’s anything to provide
to all of you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Who inside the administration signed off on the legality of what
the CDC proposed yesterday?  Is that the CDC’s lawyers, the Justice
Department?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The CDC’s lawyers, as well as our Counsel’s Office — yes. 
I’m not aware of the Department of Justice’s engagement, but of course,
that might make sense.  I would have to check on that.   
   
Q    And then, you know, the President alluded yesterday to — “Look, if
this gets struck down in court, if nothing else, it buys time for the
federal funds from the state level to be kicked out and disbursed.”  How
much of that was a driving force behind the decision to move forward
with this?  Like, “We need to figure out some way to buy time as states
figure this out.  Let’s just go ahead with this.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President would not have supported moving forward
if he did not support the legal justification.  He is old school in that
way.  
   
But I would tell you that regardless of what is decided by any court —
if anything is decided by any court — this is not a permanent solution. 
It is extended through the beginning of October.  And I think you’ve
seen that recognition by a range of members of Congress and leaders and
advocates who have been so passionately talking about the need to extend
the eviction moratorium.  It would require legislative action.   
   
The other piece of this that I know we keep talking about but is really
a solution here, and that’s why we keep talking about it, is getting
this money out to states and localities.  This is really about money —
right? — and funding.  And all these states and localities have money to
extend the moratorium in their states by a month or two months.   
   
There have been challenges that are understandable, including the fact
that there’s no federal infrastructure for distributing this money.  The
states are doing it on their own.  There are challenges where even
well-meaning landlords and others are trying to figure out how to accept
applications.   
   
We’re working through those challenges, but that is a solution for the
short term, and that’s why we’ve talked about it and why we’ve spent so
much time investing in that as well.  
   
Q    And then just one more quick one.  The President was very sharp on
just, kind of, his perspective on Republican governors put — or blocked,
I guess, specific potential public health options, and echoed something
you said yesterday in a very sharp tone: Either you’re with it or move
out the way.   
   
Is that an intentional shift?  What’s driving kind of a very sharp tone
in regards to these specific actions by Republican governors?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me be also clear that, as the President said
yesterday, the vast majority of leaders — and as I’ve said too —
continue to step up and do the right thing.  People like Governor
Hutchinson have been traveling their state, hearing from their
communities, and answering questions about the vaccine.   
   
We’re also in constant communication with our nation’s governor.  So
even as we called out steps that — and he called out steps that we felt
should’ve been taken by the governors of Florida and Texas — we’re in
touch with those offices about providing additional assistance and
seeing if we can figure out what their needs are and how we can help
meet them.  
   
And we had our first FEMA team on the ground in West Virginia just days
after entering government.  Right now, our Surge Response Teams are
working hand in hand with the hardest-hit states that are not
traditionally blue and Democratic states — Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana
— focusing on everything from contact tracing, technical expertise, and
vaccine confidence.  
   
But at the same time, that wasn’t an evaluation — a partisan evaluation
or assessment; that was an assessment of what isn’t happening that would
help protect people’s lives and save people’s lives.  And there are
leaders who are not stepping up and are getting in the way of the
American people — companies and others — who are trying to save lives
and stop the spread of Delta.   
   
And we are going to keep calling that out.  That’s not meant to be
partisan.  It’s not meant to be political.  It’s just meant to convey
that more action is needed in some parts of the country, even where
there are many states where positive action is being taken.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, you mentioned that the new moratorium is a targeted one and
not one that’s nationwide as justification of why this is — meets the
legal threshold.  But Gene Sperling, earlier, actually pointed out — he
said, “To date, the CDC Director and her team have been unable to find
legal authority, even for a more targeted eviction moratorium that would
\[just\] focus…on counties with higher rates of COVID spread.”  So I’m
trying to just pinpoint what exactly is different than what they were
looking at then that makes this now a —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That was also in our statement.  We said, “to date,” and we
looked at all the — and we were continuing to look at all of the legal
authorities and options, as were the lawyers at the CDC and our lawyers,
to see what we felt was legally viable.  That process was a couple-day
process.  It wasn’t concluded on Monday when Gene Sperling came to the
briefing room.  Yesterday it concluded, and of course, they made the
announcement as a result.  
   
Q    And then one more question.  What is the White House doing to push
forward the nomination of David Chipman at the ATF?  The vote could
hinge on the vote of Senator Angus King, in Maine, who has been pushed
by the local Maine sportsman groups and national gun rights advocates. 
Has the White House reached out specifically to Senator King on this
issue?  And is the White House fully committed to Chipman, or might it
go with a different nominee at some point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not going to read out private conversations with
members of Congress, but I will tell you that we knew this wouldn’t be
easy.  ATF hasn’t had a confirmed director in six years and only one
confirmed director since the position became Senate-confirmable.   
   
So we’ve been eyes wide open into the challenge from the beginning.  But
we are disappointed by the fact that many Republicans are moving in
lockstep to try to hold up his nomination and handcuff the chief federal
law enforcement agency tasked with fighting gun crimes.  It speaks
volumes to their complete refusal to tackle the spike in crime we’ve
seen over the last 18 months.   
   
This is someone who has 25 years in distinguished service to our country
as an ATF agent.  He has the exact set of skills and experience we need
to revitalize the bureau’s work to crack down on gun trafficking, keep
guns out of the hands of criminals.   
   
So certainly, yes, we stand by his strong qualifications and
nomination.  
   
I’m just going to jump around and then I’ll come back.  Okay.  Go
ahead.  In the middle.  In the middle.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Question on —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, oh, sorry.  Go ahead, right there.  In the middle, right
there.  In the middle.  Yeah.  I’m trying to get to people I haven’t
gotten to.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I appreciate it.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, okay.  And then right in front of you.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Oh, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You — go ahead.  You’re good.  You’re good.  It’s fine.  We
can do everyone.  
   
Q    On infrastructure, when you talk to local officials about this,
they’re really excited about the possibilities of what might happen, but
they can’t say with any certainty what they’re actually going receive
and what they’re actually going to be able to do.  So as this bill
advances, you know, what would you say to folks who are wondering how
much of these big pots of money are actually coming to our community? 
And how quickly, assuming it passes, might they find out and see those
benefits?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, one, we have put out state-by-state
factsheets.  And if different businesses or communities haven’t seen
those, we’re happy to provide them.   
   
It is true that, as is true with any piece of legislation, there are
components of these — the project funding that would be through grants
and some through applications that — where communities will have to
apply for funding.  Obviously, it would be in our interest to get that
going as quickly as possible, and the Department of Transportation and
others will implement that.  
   
But we have been pretty clear about benefits that will help every
community: replacing lead pipes, making sure people have access to
broadband, making a historic investment in climate.   
   
I know people are asking — and I think you’re asking specifically about
people who are — who want to know if their specific bridge is going to
be repaired.  Some of that will be through grant funding; some of it
will be through, you know, funding that will be designated in the piece
of — in the bill. But, you know, it will, of course, take a little bit
of time to implement, but we’ll be eager to get that done as quickly as
the bill is signed into law.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    So, two questions — one about gun violence.  And you just alluded
to efforts to combat gun violence.  The White House has recently touted
these strike forces that are going into a few cities, talking about
that.  Are there any plans to expand that?  Kansas City, for example,
has had 91 homicides this year, most of them gun related.  And how do
these DOJ efforts differ from the ones that were going on in the Trump
administration when there was a lot of ballyhooed effort about going
into cities to fight crime?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I’m not as familiar nor can I speak to the Trump
administration efforts.  What I can tell you is that the Department of
Justice identified these five or six cities where officials from our
team, who are experts, could work in lockstep to help crack down on gun
trafficking and preventing guns from getting into the hands of people
who shouldn’t have them.   
   
And we will see.  It’s early stages of the process.  We will see what
the success looks like.  We’re quite hopeful.  
   
In terms of whether they have intention or plans to expand, I would
point you to the Department of Justice and see what they have to say
about that.  
   
Q    And my question on evictions is: What role did Congresswoman Bush’s
protests play?  A number of Democratic leaders were giving her a lot of
credit for raising the issue.  I know the Vice President spoke to her
Monday.  What role did that play in the ultimate decision of the White
House to move forward with the new order?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I don’t think anyone could hear Congresswoman Bush’s
own personal story and experience and see her advocacy and her passion,
and not be moved by that.  I know a number of members of Congress were
moved by that as well.   
   
What I will tell you is that the President had a number of calls with
Speaker Pelosi over the weekend.  Her advocacy, her commitment to
looking to see — kicking every tire, just to go back to the analogy of
yesterday — to see what was possible is something that was certainly
impactful and influential with the President.  But I would just
reiterate that the President called for the extension of the
moratorium  back in January.  CDC extended it three times.  We also have
spoken to this over the course of the past several months, and we’ve
been in close touch with a range of members of Congress.  
   
So, absolutely, the passion, the advocacy of a number of members is
something that I think everybody watched closely, but I think it’s
important to note that we all share the same objective and have from the
beginning.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It’s been a while, so I’m
hoping to ask you two questions if that’s all right.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    First about the coronavirus pandemic, and then about — a follow-up
to Governor Cuomo, the report on him.  
   
On COVID-19, former President Trump has called for China to pay the
United States more than $10 trillion in reparations as a result of
letting the coronavirus escape Wuhan and infect other countries causing,
of course, 600,000 American deaths and economic devastation.  President
Biden hasn’t called for reparations from China.  Does he support them? 
Does he think that China should pay us financially for what it has
allowed to spread?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our policy hasn’t changed.   
   
Q    So, is he open to —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Did you have another question?  
   
Q    Yes.  In a follow-up to the report on Governor Cuomo’s sexual
harassment, a lot of men in politics have been accused of sexual
harassment.  President Biden was accused by female Secret Service agents
of skinny dipping in front of them, offending them, according to former
Washington Post reporter Ronald Kessler, who’s an author as well.  
   
His former Senate aide, Tara Reade, accused him of sexual assault.  The
Washington Post and The New York Times published multiple accounts of
women who objected to the way President Biden touched them.  Should
there be an independent investigation of allegations into the President
as there was into Governor Cuomo?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say, the President has been clear and
outspoken about the importance of women being respected and having their
voices heard and being allowed to tell their stories and people treating
them with respect.  That has long been his policy, continues to be his
policy.   
   
That — those were — that was heavily litigated during the campaign.  I
understand you’re eager to come back to it, but I don’t have anything
further other than to repeat that he has called for the governor to
resign.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    If and when the Senate passes the bipartisan infrastructure deal,
would President Biden like to see the House come immediately back into
session, or is he okay waiting until the recess ends at the beginning of
next month?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He certainly is going to be guided and be talking regularly
with Speaker Pelosi about what she recommends and what she thinks is the
best path forward looks like.  
   
Q    And you guys have said you guys are not going to return to
lockdowns.  Now, is that based just on current COVID conditions or — Dr.
Fauci, today, in an interview warned that he is worried about a
potentially worse variant that could more effect vaccinated people.  So,
is the guidance on lockdowns just based on current conditions or is that
just a — and could change — or is it forever more are there not going to
be lockdowns?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins have both spoken to
this in recent days.  And what they have conveyed and what it’s based on
is the fact that we have made a significant amount of progress in the
past six months — even as we are fighting the Delta variant, the most
transmissible variant we have seen — and that includes 70 percent of the
American people getting their first shot — 160 — more than 162 million
Americans at this point.   
   
That’s progress.  That ensures that a lot of communities are going to
have a great deal of protection, and we’re in a different place than we
were when there was the period of lockdown, so it’s a reflection of
that.  
   
Go ahead, Katie.  
   
Q    Thanks.  The President, sort of, dismissed a question yesterday
about whether he would call Governor DeSantis to discuss the situation
on the ground in Florida.  Does he feel that there is no point in
personally reaching out to leaders in Texas and Florida?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think, just to give you an understanding of how this
works: Our team, led by COVID Coordinator Jeff Zients, is in touch with
all of the governors and is — we are working closely with the Florida —
Florida public health officials and the governor’s team to see if we can
send a team down there to help address their needs.   
   
So that is ongoing.  It doesn’t mean we aren’t going to call out when we
think there’s more steps that can be taken, but that’s an ongoing
process, and we’re hopeful about making progress there moving forward.  
   
Q    Okay.  And the President had a meeting earlier today about
preventing future pandemics.  Can you give us a readout on what he heard
or discussed?  And what’s the administration learning about — about that
issue?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the President’s view is that, even as we’re
fighting the pandemic and we’re continuing to fight it, we need to do
everything we can to prepare for future pandemics.   
   
That means making sure we have the funding we need, and we’re headed
toward a historic number in this infrastructure bill on that front, but
also making sure that he engages with our nation’s top scientists and
experts — and Dr. Lander is certainly one of them — about how we should
prepare, how we should think about preparing.   
   
So it is part of an ongoing discussion and ongoing focus that we can’t
keep our eye off of that, even as we’re fighting the current pandemic.  
   
Q    So does the President feel strongly that that funding should be
preserved in the reconciliation package?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He feels confident there’s going to be a historic amount of
funding in the reconciliation package and is pleased to see that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    To go back to Cori Bush for a second, can I just confirm or ask:
Did the President himself personally ever speak with Representative
Bush?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t believe so, no.  
   
Q    Okay.  And in terms of vaccines, what does the White House — or
what does the administration intend to do to get other countries to step
up and meet some of those vaccination goals?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you know it was a part of the discussion at the G7,
and there was a significant announcement made by G7 countries about
their contribution to the global effort.  That’s an important step
forward.   
   
But I think you’ve also seen international public health experts convey
that we’re going to need 10 million — 10 billion, 11 billion — more
doses than we currently have in the global community.   
   
So, I think our effort is going to be continuing to make this a
front-and-center discussion at global engagements, at global meetings,
whether it’s UNGA or the G20 or meetings we will have in the future,
because it is going to require all of the richest countries in the
world, including the United States, to step up, to increase vaccine
donations, to increase manufacturing capacity.  
   
So, I think it’s more about making it front and center in the global
agenda, which the President is indicating he will intend to do —
continue to do moving forward.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just two questions, Jen.  The President — we know President Biden
has called on Cuomo to resign — Governor Cuomo — but in the meantime,
does the White House intend to strip him of his leadership position on
those biweekly governor COVID calls?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not sure when the next one is scheduled.  But again, I
would convey that our objective is not to hurt the people of New York in
the fight against COVID.  If he is no longer the governor of New York,
which is certainly what the President made clear of his — is his
preference, then we will engage with other people.  But we are not going
to take steps to hurt the people of New York in the fight against
COVID.  
   
Q    And just a second question.  Should renters be prepared for the
eviction moratorium to end for good on October 3rd?  What is the White
House’s thinking on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it really depends on whether there is
legislative action or not.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    One more question on the eviction moratorium.  I’ll approach it
this way: The President may support the legal justification, but he also
publicly gave voice to doubts about the constitutionality.  What’s the
White House’s message then to Americans who heard what happened
yesterday, heard what was said at this podium on Monday, can’t square
the two, and are now disappointed that the President is signaling that
he doesn’t respect the rule of law.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not sure there are Americans evaluating it to that
degree; maybe there are some of you have talked to, I don’t know.  What
the President has — his message to the American people, especially those
who are concerned about losing their homes, being kicked out of their
homes, is that he’s going to do everything in his power to make sure
they can stay in their homes as long as possible.  That is not just an
extension of the eviction moratorium — which, obviously, a step was
taken yesterday; it is also about using every tool at our disposal to
get this money out.  
   
Again, states have the funding to extend the eviction moratorium in
their own states.  That’s because there was funding in the American
Rescue Plan to get that done.  So that includes asking his team, members
of his Cabinet, whether it’s — whether it’s Secretary Fudge, who
obviously made an announcement today, or the Department of Treasury, who
made an announcement about the simplification of forms — that this is a
priority, that they are to use all resources at their disposal to make
sure they’re communicating with Americans, that we’re making it easy to
get this funding out because that’s the overall objective.  
   
The overall objective is not about one tool; it is about keeping people
in their homes.  That’s the goal.  
   
Q    But the President is a lawyer; spent 36 years in the Senate, was
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, eight years as Vice
President, half a year as President.  He speaks often about democracy
versus autocracy.  He’s issuing or overseeing this order from the CDC in
the face of doubts about its constitutionality, which he seemed to echo
yesterday.   
   
If there’s no inconsistency here, the President is — I mean, there are
many people out there who say that the President is essentially not
giving voice to the ethic that he campaigned on.  He didn’t call
Congress back.   He asked Congress to act; it didn’t.  How do you square
all that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know I’m going to ask you who’s saying that.   
   
Q    Well, there are plenty of people who are saying it.  They are not
just Republicans.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, I’ll leave that to others to figure out.  But I think
what’s important to note here is that the President would not have moved
forward with a step where he didn’t feel comfortable and confident in
the legal justification.   
   
It is also a reality that there are legal steps that have been taken by
the Supreme Court in the last few months, and we have spoken to that
publicly.  We’re not going to hide from that.  But he asked the CDC and
his legal experts to look at what is possible.  This is a narrow,
targeted moratorium that is different from the national moratorium; it’s
not an extension of that.  It’s a different moratorium, from a policy
and legal standpoint.  So, he felt comfortable in the justification and
the legal approach to this effort.  
   
Q    A quick follow-up on that, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Uh-huh, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You mentioned that the President is “old school,” and
Steve noted that the President spent a significant amount of time in the
Senate and is also a lawyer.  When — what was the moment that the
President became certain that he was on solid legal standing to move
forward with this extension?  And what was the argument — specific legal
argument that won out and changed his mind?  Because yesterday he seemed
to be weighing the two — the two options.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, as I’ve been discussing, the justification from
the legal team is that this is a different moratorium.  It’s narrow. 
It’s targeted at the highest — at the areas highest impacted.  It is not
an extension of the national moratorium that was struck down just six
weeks ago.  
   
Q    So is the sense here that, you know, this is temporary, it’s still
an open question about the constitutionality, but —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is temporary.  It was extended until Oct- — or October
3rd.  
   
Q    Okay, so it’s still a question of whether or not it’s
constitutional but it’s worth it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I didn’t say that.  I would —  
   
Q    I know, but is that the sentiment?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He would not have advocated for and supported moving forward
with something if he was not comfortable with the legal justification.  
   
Let me just go around.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead to the middle here.   
   
Q    Yeah, thanks, Jen.  Two quick questions.  First, I was hoping you
could preview a little bit the President’s meeting tomorrow with the
AAPI leaders.  I’m just curious what they’ll be discussing and why you
chose to invite them to the White House this week.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  Well, I should have had more of a preview for
you, but I will tell you that the President looks forward to meeting
with leaders of the AAPI community tomorrow.  They will discuss a range
of topics including, of course, economic investment; the fight against
COVID; voting rights, which is certainly an issue that is of great
importance to a range of communities who have been quite active on this
issue; and, obviously, continuing discrimination that members of the
AAPI community experience.   
   
We’ve also — proud of the number of nominees from the AAPI community
that we have put forward for a range of important jobs in the
administration.   
   
But those are some of the topics on his agenda, and I’m sure they’ll
come ready with a number of topics they also want to discuss.   
   
Q    And one, quickly, just on COVID.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    The President, yesterday, was asked whether he thinks more cities
and states should follow New York City’s lead and institute rules, you
know, essentially requiring people to — who have been vaccinated to go
to their restaurants and stuff like that.  And he said, “I do,” but then
he later seemed to suggest maybe it should fall more on those
businesses.   
   
I was just hoping you could clarify: Does the President — would he urge,
you know, cities and states to follow New York City’s lead?  Or does he
feel that it’s more, sort of, a private-sector matter, where businesses
should be the ones, you know, taking the lead on this type of thing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, both.  I mean, there are steps that are going to be
taken by localities.  There will be steps taken by businesses.  The
President supports local efforts to keep communities safe; they’re going
to be different from community to community.   
   
And our view is that any verification program should meet a few
standards: accessibility — it needs to be free and available in paper
and digital formats; it should be secure and private; nondiscriminatory,
given equity is at the center of our agenda.   
   
But he does — we know — we will see more local communities do more and
more things in this space, including verification and employee mandates
that will incentivize vaccinations.  And we’re encouraged and supportive
of innovative steps at the local level.  
   
I just want to jump around.  Go ahead, to the back.  Yeah, go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Oh, I’ll go after.  Go ahead.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Give — go ahead.  
   
Q    I have two questions.  One on Quad.  Earlier this year, during the
virtual summit, Quad countries decided on vaccine production.  Has the
President set a deadline or timeline for when these vaccines will be
produced for the rest of the world?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t believe there’s a deadline that has been set.  It’s
a good question.  Let me see if there’s anything more specific.  
   
Obviously, working with the Quad on COVID vaccines is an important part
of our — oh, let me see.  Okay.  Thank you for the question because I
was like, I know something more on this.  
   
Our Quad partnership is on track to help produce at least 1 billion
doses of COVID vaccines in India for the Asia region by the end of
2022.  So, that is the timeline.  Obviously, more — hopefully more
sooner rather than later, but that’s the timeline for the work with the
Quad.   
   
Q    My other question is about the kids of legal immigrants.  Because
of the aging-out process, many of them feel that they will be deported
back to a country where they have never lived.  Some of them have been
moving around the city, meeting the congressmen, at the White House as
well.  One of them, at least, has met the President in Pennsylvania. 
Has the President given any assurance to these kids that, instead of
focusing on their studies, they’ve — they are now right to focusing on
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  For DACA recipients?  Or —  
   
Q    The legal immigrants — kids of legal immigrants, not the DACA
recipients.  Because the aging-out process, they might be forced to go
back.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  It’s a great question.  I’ll have to check. 
Obviously, taking steps to ensure we are providing a legal pathway to
citizenship, and especially for kids who came into this country, as you
referenced, you know, innocently with their family members.  But I will
see if there’s anything new to report on that front.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.   
   
Q    I wanted to ask about a different moratorium — the payments of
student loans — that expires at the end of September.  What is the White
House doing, at this point, to get ready for that date and figure out
next steps?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any preview for you on what determination will
be made on that front.   
   
Q    Do you have any information on how you’re preparing?  I mean, we
got to the point of the moratorium that we’ve been talking about
earlier, where you’re at the date.    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    What are you doing between now and that date?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are certainly well aware of the date, well aware of the
impact.  But I don’t have anything to preview in terms of a decision.  
   
Q    And I wanted to ask one more question about the Justice
Department.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    The slot for Solicitor General is still open.  With  
the Supreme Court ending — first session ending several months ago, at
this point, and going into some cases that I’m sure the administration
really cares about, where are you at on picking someone?  And what are
you doing to get ready for that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to preview for you on any personnel
announcements or decisions.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, Shelby.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I wanted to ask about a Harris Poll released this week
that indicates the majority of Americans believe the worst of the
pandemic is still ahead.  And this is a big change from a few weeks
ago.  And so this is despite, as you said, 70 percent of Americans being
vaccinated and CDC data showing that the vaccine is protecting
vaccinated Americans from serious illness.   
   
So, why is the American public so panicked?  And is the White House
concerned at all that it’s fueled this dramatic shift in public
sentiment?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That we have fueled it?  
   
Q    Yeah, through — you know, like returning the mask recommendations
for vaccinated Americans.  Is there — is it concerned at all?  What can
it point to as a reason for Americans —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I haven’t really taken a close look at this poll.  
   
What I will tell you is that a poll before this — I believe it was a CBS
poll — showed that more vaccinated Americans were concerned about the
rise of Delta than unvaccinated.  So, it was — that was even prior to
the mask guidance putting — being put in place.   
   
And certainly, as people see, you know, the rise in cases in certain
communities — unvaccinated communities — of course that’s concerning. 
We understand that.  But we also believe that it is our responsibility
to provide accurate public health information and also make clear to
people the impact of being vaccinated and the fact that the vaccines are
doing exactly what they should do, which is protect the vast majority of
people from serious illness and hospitalization.   
   
But, yes, we are — we know that it is a — it is a challenge.  And
fighting a pandemic and communicating about it is a challenge.  But
certainly, that’s why we do as many briefings as we do, why we come out
here every day as we do, and why we’ll continue to allow our public
health guidance to be — to be in the lead.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, on infrastructure: The House Speaker is still saying that the
reconciliation bill and the infrastructure bill should be connected. 
Which bill would the President like to see on his desk first: the
bipartisan infrastructure bill or the reconciliation bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President looks forward to signing both into law, and
he’s eager to do that.  We’ve certainly made progress.   
   
And I’ll also note that, on the reconciliation package — which I know we
haven’t talked about a lot because the infrastructure bill has been
front and center — but in the meantime, behind the scenes — which is, by
the way, where most of the work happens in places like the White House —
our legislative affairs team has had over 375 meetings and calls with
members and senior congressional staff about just the reconciliation
package.  
   
Q    But there’s no preference from the President whether he wants to
see the reconciliation first?  Or —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’s going to stay in close coordination and rely on the
guidance and leadership of Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi.  
   
Q    And how does — as the leader of the Democratic Party, how does he
get House Speaker Pelosi on the same page that they’re not connected?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, I think the President has been clear that he
wants to sign both into law.  We’re encouraged by the movement of the
infrastructure package forward.  And we’ve been doing a lot of work
behind the scenes, and the President will continue to advocate for,
publicly, the reconciliation package, given how important his Build Back
Better agenda is to him.   
   
Q    We’re told you have a hard out shortly.  Just one or two more.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    The President made an announcement on Lebanon recovery today.  Can
you outline that for us?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    And also, give us a sense — given the fact this is the one-year
anniversary of that blast that devastated Beirut,  
how important is Lebanon’s political and economic stability to the
United States, given the crisis it’s in right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  It’s very important.  On behalf of the country,
the President sent his deepest condolences to all those who were
injured, lost loved ones, and still struggle to recover from the trauma
from the catastrophic explosion at the Port of Beirut one year ago.  
   
Today, we actually did a video from him that we’re happy to provide to
anyone who is interested.   
   
We also recognize that the people of Lebanon have suffered more over the
past year because of avoidable political and economic crises.  
   
So what we announced today is — we — nearly $100 million in new
humanitarian assistance.  That is on top of the almost $560 million in
humanitarian aid that we have provided to Lebanon over the last two
years.   
   
We recognize the important role Lebanon has played in the region, as you
referenced, and also their role in hosting over 1 million Syrian
refugees for a number of years.  And we’re quite proud of our
longstanding support for the Lebanese people.   
   
And the President urges his fellow leaders in capitals around the world
to also step up their support for the Lebanese people.  No amount of
outside assistance, of course, will be enough to repair the pain from
the blast just last year.  
   
Okay.  Nikki, go ahead.  
   
Q    Great.  Are there any plans for the President to hold a press
conference before he goes to the beach?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect he might take some questions at some point, but no
plans for a formal press conference.  We’ve got a lot going on here, as
you all know.  
   
Q    And then, also any chance that Team USA might be visiting
post-Olympics?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I hope so.  They’re invited.  I’m inviting them here to my
house — (laughter) — anywhere you want to come.   
   
I hope so.  I have nothing to pre- — I don’t have anything on the
schedule, but certainly that’s a tradition and the President is probably
as obsessed with the Olympics as I am, if not more, so I expect there’ll
be an invitation at some point.  
   
Q    Jen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we have to wrap it up to — thank you, everyone. 
Have a great day.  See you tomorrow.  
   
1:41 P.M. EDT
