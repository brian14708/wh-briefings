James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:19 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.   
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi.  Okay, sorry again for the brief delay.  I was — I know
you were all interested in what our Secretary of State had to say.  
   
Just to note — and I know all of you have been following this quite
closely — but to reiterate, a total of approximately 19,000 people were
evacuated from Kabul over a period of 24 hours that, of course, ended
early this morning.  This is the result of 42 U.S. military flights
which carried approximately 11,200 evacuees, and 48 coalition flights
which carried 7,800 people, for a total of 90 flights out of Kabul —
which, if I get my math right, that’s approximately a flight every 39
minutes.  I believe the Department of Defense gave that statistic.   
   
And just to reiterate: Since August 14th, we’ve evacuated — the United
States has evacuated and facilitated the evacuation of approximately
82,300 people on U.S. military and coalition flights as part of one of
the largest airlifts in world history.  Since the end of July, we have
relocated approximately 88,000 people on U.S. military and coalition
flights.  
   
Two other items unrelated to that topic: Today, we are also announced —
we’ve announced new actions to help protect vulnerable tenants and
landlords.  For months, the administration has worked to speed up the
delivery of emergency rental assistance, as we’ve talked about quite a
bit in here, and help keep American families safe and in their homes.
   
   
And as the President has made clear, no state or locality should delay
in distributing resources that have been provided by Congress to meet
families’ critical needs.  And we want to continue to take steps to make
that easier.   
   
So, today, the Treasury Department is strengthening existing guidance
and implementing new policies to ensure that state and local grantees
can further accelerate the distribution of ERA funds to struggling
landlords and renters most at risk of eviction.  Specifically, they’re
providing explicit permission for grantees to use self-attestation
without further documentation of their economic circumstances, to give
you a specific example, in order to speed the delivery of assistance to
households in need during the public health emergency.   
   
There are also a number of steps that are being taken by USDA, HUD, the
VA, and HHS, including USDA is working with owners of 400,000 rental
units in USDA-backed properties to mitigate all evictions.  HUD will
ensure tenants in public housing first have the opportunity to access
emergency rental assistance money before facing eviction, and HUD will
extend the eviction notice period from 14 to 30 days during the COVID
national emergency period.  And the VA will expand rental support to
at-risk veterans and their families from just seven states to now all 50
states and the U.S. territories.   
   
So this is just some of the examples of steps we’re taking.  
   
Aamer, go ahead.  
   
Q    On Afghanistan, there seems to be a disconnect.  Veterans
organizations, refugee advocates are saying that Afghans with visas are
risking death and facing beatings at the airport.  And I hope I’m
framing this right, but there’s been the sense — and I’ve heard, I
think, from you and others in the administration — that the Taliban has
by and large met its commitment to allow people with the right papers on
to the airport.   
   
Can you try to help Americans that are seeing and — what seems to be a
disconnect between these two different statements?  What is happening?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say, I wouldn’t see it as a disconnect,
and let me explain to you why.  I noted earlier that – or we put out
earlier today that 19,000 people were evacuated, the vast majority in
the last — in a 24-hour period.  The vast majority of those were, of
course, Afghans, as you know by the numbers that the Secretary of State
just put out.  That does mean that a great number of people are making
their way into the airport and onto flights to evacuate from the
country.   
   
There are certainly cases and incidents — and we have heard, you have
reported — where individuals are not getting through that should get
through.  And we are approaching those and addressing those on a
case-by-case basis as those are raised.  But I would note that, again,
19,000 people in a period of time — the vast majority of them are
Afghans, SIV applicants, individuals who are — have the appropriate
paperwork to evacuate — and that was just in a 24-hour period.  
   
Q    And also, can you give us an update on where things stand with the
President and the coronavirus origins review?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   
   
Q    I understand that he’s gotten a copy of the 90-day report.  Was
there any conclusions that the IC was able to come up with?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, let me confirm for you, as you noted, he did
not just receive a copy, he received a briefing yesterday on the 90-day
origins report.  It was a classified briefing, so, of course, that’s not
information we would provide publicly.   
   
Because of the prioritization we’ve given to this and the importance of
this information for the public, the intelligence community has been
simultaneously working on an unclassified version of summary — a summary
version to provide publicly.  I don’t have a timeline for you on when
that will be provided, but they’ve been working expeditiously to prepare
that, and we have also been doing classified briefings.  
   
But until that unclassified version is available, I won’t be able to
provide any more details of the assessment.   
   
Q    Without getting into details, the broad upshot of the report, do —
is there a better understanding of what was the ultimate origin?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I can’t obviously speak to a classified briefing.  I
know you’re eager to receive an unclassified summary.  That is something
the intelligence community has been working to produce, and as soon as
that is available, it will be put out publicly from the intelligence
community, from ODNI, and we will also ensure you all have access to
it.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Secretary Blinken just said, and Jake Sullivan said
the other day, that even after August 31st, that the U.S. government is
committed to helping Americans and Afghans who are still in the country
eligible to get out, to get out safely.  How do you do that if the
military is gone?  How do you safeguard these people and get them where
they need to go without the U.S. military in the country?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know, Nancy, as you mentioned, that the Secretary
was asked that.  He didn’t go into detail for a reason: because we are
currently having those discussions through diplomatic channels.  But
what he assured, I think, the public of, and I can reiterate from here,
is that we are looking at a range of options for how we can continue to
provide consular support, facilitate departures for those who wish to
leave after August 31st.  
   
And our expectation and the expectation of the international community
is that people who want to leave Afghanistan after the U.S. military
depart should be able to do so.   
   
We’re working on that.  As soon as we have more to provide to all of you
— more information — we will do exactly that.   
   
Q    And then, based on the numbers that you’ve provided of Americans
who have been evacuated, it sounds like there are at least 70,000
Afghans who have been evacuated.  How do you possibly vet all of those
people in a timely fashion when, clearly, the Customs and Border Patrol
and the relevant officials must be completely overloaded?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They are.  And I will say this is a reflection of the fact
that we have hundreds of employees of our intelligence community working
24 hours a day to do the vetting necessary and reviews necessary to move
people into the United States.   
   
Now, I would remind you that there are a number of people — tens of
thousands of people who are departing Afghanistan who are going to third
countries — “lily pads,” as we’ve been calling them — and where
additional vetting can take place, either because they’ve only proceeded
through certain steps of this — of the immigrant visa process, or
because their vetting process has not yet been completed.  
   
I can give you a little bit more detail too on the vetting process if
that help — if that is helpful.   
   
So, the screening and security vetting is conducted by a combination of
the intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals
from across government.  So the Department of Homeland Security;
Department of Defense; the FBI; the State Department; the NCTC — the
National Counterterrorism Center; and additional intelligence community
partners.  
   
What they are doing are they’re conducting screening and security
vetting for all SIV applicants and other vulnerable Afghans before they
are allowed into the United States.  This includes reviews of both
biographic and biometric data.  And if an individual is not through that
vetting process, they’re not coming into the United States.  
   
Q    And are there any estimates for how long it’ll take to work through
that backlog?  Could these people be going through the system for months
or years?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You mean people who are in third countries?  
   
Q    Mm-hmm.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what I will tell you is that it typically takes months
to go through this process, and what this is a signal of is the fact
that this is a top priority for the President and the intelligence
community and the individuals who oversee this vetting process who have
massively expedited the process in order to move through the necessary
steps — thorough steps — in order to process individuals and get them
moving through the system.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  At the tail end of the President’s remarks today
about cybersecurity, he was asked about Afghanistan, and he made a
joke.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think Peter asked him that question.  
   
Q    The other Peter did.  And he made a joke.  So what’s so funny?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the question he was asked, if I remember
correctly, was about when he will provide information about a decision
on August 31st.  I don’t want to paraphrase the question, if that was an
inaccurate description of the question.  
   
Q    It’s very important to a lot of people watching.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of course, it’s a very important question.  
   
And I think what he conveyed — what — is that he has not — well, what I
can convey from here, I should say, is that, as he stated yesterday, and
as the Secretary of State just stated, we’re on track to complete our
mission by August 31st.   
   
Obviously, there are discussions, and the President received a briefing
just this morning.  As I noted, he asked yesterday for contingency
plans, and he received a briefing on them this morning.  These are
incredibly serious issues, and they’re discussions that are happening
internally.  
   
And I’d note that, in addition to the contingency plans that he
requested, he also — I will reiterate, as we stated yesterday, that this
is all contingent on us achieving our objectives and our continu- — and
the continued coordination with the Taliban.  
   
And the President has spoken, I would say, to this issue, Peter, as you
know.  You’ve been — attended a number of these multiple times over the
last several days.   
   
And he has also highlighted the fact that we are closely watching,
closely following the threats from ISIS-K, which he also received a
briefing on this morning.  
   
Q    And in his remarks last night, he gave a lot of time to the
domestic agenda.  Does he think that the Build Back Better plan is as
urgent and as time-sensitive as this evacuation of Americans and Afghan
friendlies from Kabul?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first of all, I think it’s important to the American
people who care deeply about whether they’re going to have jobs, whether
they’re going to have childcare, whether they are — whether we are going
to be able to compete with China and countries around the world to
understand that we have to do multiple things at the same time.  That’s
exactly what any President of the United States has to do.  
   
Q    And the next one, just — as these negotiations about safe passage
for Americans and SIV holders continue, why haven’t we heard the
President say, “The United States does not negotiate with terrorists”? 
Is that still the U.S. policy?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, of course it is, Peter.  But I would also say that
there’s a reality that the Taliban is currently controlling large swaths
of Afghanistan.  That is a reality on the ground.  
   
And right now, our focus and our priority is getting American citizens
evacuated and our Afghan partners evacuated. And I would say, given the
numbers that we’ve outlined and briefed for you, that we’ve had — made a
great deal of progress in doing exactly that.  
   
Okay.  Go ahead, Justin.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I had a couple, but actually to, kind of, follow up on the
question that Peter just asked.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    You’ve talked about the coordination with the Taliban and that
there’s — the President has obviously made this threat of a severe
response if they disrupt the effort to get Americans out.  But I’m
wondering, has the U.S. offered the Taliban anything in terms of cash or
supplies to help facilitate this coordination?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  This is not a, quote, “quid pro quo.”  We have laid out
clearly what our expectations are about moving American citizens and our
Afghan partners, allies out of the country, and that’s what we’re
working to deliver on.  
   
Q    The Fed has their big meeting in Jackson Hole this week — or a
virtual one pegged to that.  I’m wondering if the President has spoken
to Chairman Powell ahead of that meeting, or met with him.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, I don’t have any updates or previews or readouts of
meetings or engagements with Chairman Powell.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  A question about the lawmakers who traveled to
Afghanistan.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Was the White House aware of those members of Congress that
traveled to Kabul?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We were not aware when they were en route, no.  
   
Q    What’s your — what’s the White House’s reaction to that trip?  Was
it beneficial, or — what’s the White House’s reaction?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our guidance continues to be to all American citizens,
including elected officials: This is not the time to travel to
Afghanistan.  And our focus, our objectives, our resources need to be
laser-focused on evacuating Afghan partners, evacuating American
citizens, and that’s best done in the hands of the Department of Defense
and State Department professionals who are on the ground.  
   
Q    One more.  The 31st, of course, is the deadline for the drawdown,
but when do the gears shift from evacuation mission to withdrawing
troops?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I noted a little bit earlier that the President was
briefed this morning on contingency plans and continues to have
optionality should he decide to change plans, even as we are on track to
complete our mission by August 31st.  
   
I would also note that my DOD colleagues have put out some information
about steps that are being taken.  So, as we’ve made consistently clear,
commanders on the ground are empowered to make any adjustments as they
see fit, when they see fit, and that includes changes to the
footprint.   
   
To that end, they confirmed last night, I believe it was, that — of the
departure from Afghanistan of several hundred U.S. troops.  These troops
represent a mix of headquarter staff, maintenance, and other enabling
functions that were scheduled to leave and whose mission at the airport
was complete.  It does not have an impact on our mission at hand.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just to follow up on Afghanistan —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — and people traveling there.  The LA Times has a story saying that
a group of students and their parents are in Afghanistan.  Do you have
any more information on that?  Or is that a — is that a true story?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I do not.  Who have recently traveled into Afghanistan?  
   
Q    Who are — who are apparently stranded in Afghanistan after having
traveled there.  I don’t — I don’t know for certain that this is a legit
story.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly don’t have additional information on that.  I
know — as our Secretary of State just noted when he went through a
thorough summary of American citizens and our contacts and our focus
over the last several days, he gave an update.  I’m happy to take their
information if there’s something more detailed you have.  
   
Q    Okay, terrific.  And then, just on another issue.  On the Fed, you
know, the — we’re all waiting for some news about Fed appointments.  Can
you give us any kind of a —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ve heard that.  
   
Q    — timeline for a decision on that?  Is there any — can you give us
any guidance on when to expect —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any — any guidance for you on the timeline.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then just —      
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    Just real quick.  I’m so sorry.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    On Afghanistan, we just heard from Anthony Blinken that 45 to 46
percent of those evacuated have been women.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    There’s been a lot of consternation about the plight of Afghan
women going forward.  I know this is an issue of concern to you as well,
but can you say what provisions you’re making to ensure that, you know,
women are actually, sort of, an equal part of that population that is
being evacuated and not quite representative for the population?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, I know that our Secretary of State spoke to
this just a few minutes ago, but what I can reiterate — or add to, I
suppose — is, one, we are going to continue to work with the United
Nations and ally — our allies and partners around the world to continue
to provide humanitarian assistance and a range of assistance to
Afghanistan, even when we don’t have a presence on the ground.  
   
There are also messages we’ve made clear to the Taliban, and I think
that Secretary Blinken also reiterated this about what our expectations
are and what the global community expects once we depart Afghanistan.   
   
I don’t have additional details beyond that, but I will tell you that
our commitment to the incredibly brave women and leaders and population
in Afghanistan that has fought alongside us, that has bravely stood up,
does not change, does not diminish, even after our military is departing
from the ground.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Jen, you’ve — Anthony Blinken today gave us numbers for — the
numbers of Americans that are believed to still be in Afghanistan.  But
yesterday, during a briefing, we asked questions about how many Afghans
and Americans have arrived in the United States.  And we were unable to
get those numbers.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And I provided details on Americans yesterday.  
   
Q    But not on the number of Afghans that have arrived at these
military bases.  Do you have a specific breakdown of the numbers — of
people that are coming in?  I know it’s fluid.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  First, I confirmed — I confirmed yesterday that it was 4,000
Americans who’d been evacuated.  Obviously that number increased, and
the Secretary of State gave an updated number this morning.  
   
I would remind you that the U.S. military is overseeing the evacuation
of individuals out of Afghanistan, and the State Department oversees the
visa processing, hence the update was provided by the Secretary of
State.  
   
During his briefing that he just gave, he also noted that he would work
to provide additional numbers of Afghans.  But I would note, since we
provided a detailed number of Americans and we have also provided on a
day-to-day basis, twice a day, the numbers of people coming out, the
vast majority of those are Afghans, by numbers.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    The Secretary gave us some specificity in terms of what the
President may consider “completing the mission” or “achieving the
objectives,” as it pertains to Americans.  Do you guys have a specific
threshold or number when it comes to Afghans about what would define
“completing the mission” or your objectives by August 31st, in terms of
evacuations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ve never put a cap on the number of Special Immigrant
Visa applicants, the number of individuals who can apply for our variety
of programs that are overseen by the State Department.  And I’m not
going to put a cap on that today.  
   
I’d also note that, as the Secretary of State said, we will continue and
we are continuing to look at a range of options to provide support and
to provide a means for departing Afghanistan, even after we — our U.S.
military departs.  
   
Q    So there’s nothing where you guys are looking at maybe the existing
SIV backlog, pre-August 14th, and saying we want all 18,000, or
whatever?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are not putting a cap on the number.  We are continuing
to work every day to get as many people evacuated as we can.  
   
Q    And just one more quick question.  You know, you guys have been
very clear in stating these numbers are Americans that want to leave.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    There are clearly Americans, many of them dual citizens, who
perhaps are choosing not to leave.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    What is the level of concern inside the administration about dual
citizens or American citizens who choose to stay in the country at this
point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know this is very hard to understand for many people
sitting here, and I think this is why you’re asking this question — or
not sitting here, even.  I should say people who watch your — watch your
shows or read your newspaper.   
   
But the — many, many of the people — we suspect many of the people of
these 1,000 contacts are dual citizens.  Some, as Secretary Blinken
noted, are people who may not be ready to leave for a variety of
reasons.  Maybe they have an extended family — extended family there. 
Maybe they’ve spent their entire lives in Afghanistan and they have not
yet made the decision to depart.  Maybe they’re working on a range of
projects they’re not ready to leave.   
   
I know that it’s hard for us to understand as we’re looking at the
images, but for many of these Afghans, this is their home.  And, yes,
they are dual citizens.  Yes, it is absolutely our responsibility to
make sure we are reaching out to them multiple times.  We are providing
opport- — we are providing opportunity.  We are finding ways to get them
to the airport and evacuate them.  But it is also their personal
decision on whether they want to depart.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Could I just follow up a little bit on some of Nancy’s questions
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — about the refugees?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.   
   
Q    So, first, you talked about the vetting that’s going on outside of
the United States, after they leave Iraq — I’m sorry, Afghanistan.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, not — I didn’t mean to imply outside — well, some of it
is happening in Qatar, but some of it is happening here.   
   
Q    Okay, but I mean — but I mean, it’s before the people come to the
United —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    — States, right?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    It’s happening before they arrive.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    So, a lot of that vetting — some of the pace of that vetting is
within your control — you can add more people, you can add more
interviewers —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And we have done that.  
   
Q    But a lot of it is not in your control, right?  Like somebody comes
to you with no documents.  You know, it takes time to figure out where’s
the actual birth certificate.  It takes time to find documents that
prove 10 years of residency.  It takes time to get the kind of proof
that the FBI and some of these agencies —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — like to use.  So, you know, does that all add up to refugee camps
in these transit centers across the globe with tens of thousands of
Afghans sitting for months, years, whatever?  I mean, it doesn’t sort of
add up to those of us who sort of have seen —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    — that process.  You know, back in 2015, when you were in a
previous administration, one of the things that you guys argued was that
the refugee community in particular was the most vetted —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — community of people entering the United States.  And you pointed
to the fact that it takes a year or two for the typical refugee to sort
of meet that burden.   
   
So, I guess the question is: What — how can you possibly not have this —
and where are you going to put these people?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, okay, there’s a lot of questions wrapped up in there. 
Let me do the best I can here.     
   
Q    Sorry.  Apologies, everyone.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, it’s okay.  I mean, all good questions.  First, I would
say, even prior to the last month or two, we took steps to expedite
processing in the SIV pipeline.  And I would remind you that, for quite
some time, it was a program that was frozen in March of 2020, and hardly
anything was done — for policy reasons, in part — by the prior
administration; it wasn’t a program they necessarily supported — and
also because of COVID.   
   
So, we worked to expedite and actually had some success over the course
of the few months in the spring, even before evacuation flights took
place, to do exactly that.   
   
As Jake Sullivan said the other day, it was also not a program — to your
point — that was planned for speed because of all of the requirements. 
Because what Americans should also be assured of is that there are —
there is no one coming in through any of these programs who has not gone
through a background check process and has been vetted.  That is our
responsibility to the American people and one we will abide by.   
   
Hence, we are incredibly grateful to these third countries who are
providing a place for a number of many — tens of thousands of people to
be for this period of time.  And we have put a wide range of staff,
personnel, and others on the vetting process from a range of agencies to
ensure that we can take steps to expedite as quickly as possible.   
   
You’re right that some of this is dependent on documents and is
dependent on information being available.  But I will just close with —
and then I may have missed some of your questions — but this is
incredibly difficult.  We’re not — we’re very clear-eyed about that. 
And these Afghans, many of them who are departing who are still in
process, made the decision — and we made the decision too — that
evacuating them because they are vulnerable, because their lives are at
risk, and moving them to a third country, even if they are in transition
for a period of time, is preferable to their lives being threatened.   
   
Q    Okay.  And I have one more question here.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Okay, so assume that the people that are vetted, once they’re
vetted —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — they come to the United States.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yup.  
   
Q    Is it the commitment of this administration that all of those
people — 100 percent of the people who have gotten through the vetting
screens — obviously, there might be some that fail and won’t come the
United States — but that all the people that come are going to be
granted legal permanent residency and a path to citizenship in the
United States?  Or is it possible that some of those people will have to
apply through other programs and could be deported back to
Afghanistan?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, once individuals arrive in the United States, they
will be eligible to apply for asylum or other available immigration
pathways, which have — which have, as a condition, additional screening
processes and procedures.   
   
So, no, we can’t guarantee anyone anything.  But certainly we are also
working with a range of countries around the world to ensure there are
safe places for individuals, who are freeing \[sic\] — fleeing from
Afghanistan, have safe places to be.   
   
Q    So, you wouldn’t see a situation where you might reject somebody’s
asylum application and send them back to Afghanistan?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t anticipate that being the plan.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Is the White House aware of any other members of
Congress who are planning to make a trip to Afghanistan at this time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any more information on that, no.   
   
Q    And have you learned anything about sort of how they made this
trip, how they were able to get into the country?  Did they show up on
any manifests or anything?  Do you guys have any more information on
that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think you should ask their offices that question.  
   
Q    And can I ask you a question on cybersecurity —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — in light of today’s summit.  Does the White House believe that
the private sector can make sufficient cybersecurity improvements
without government mandates?  Or do you believe that Congress needs to
pass legislation mandating reports of cybersecurity incidents to sort of
better address this situation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we certainly have made clear that we expect
private-sector companies to report when they have experienced a cyber
breach.  We have worked in partnership with some to address these cyber
breaches.  And also, there is an impact on the American public, in many
cases.   
   
There is congressional legislation that some are considering, and there
are a range of options that could be taken by Congress.  And we’ll look
at those as they move forward and if they move forward.   
   
But our view has long been that it is a combined responsibility of the
federal government to put in place clear guidelines, clear best
practices, and the private sector to take steps to harden their own
cybersecurity.   
   
Q    And one last question.  Has the White House learned anything more
about this possible — these possible cases of Havana Syndrome in
Vietnam?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any more information, no.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Not to belabor the point — I know that the Secretary of
State talked about this, and I know that you’ve answered —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — some questions on this.  But I really just want to kind of drill
down on: How confident is the administration that all Americans who want
to get out will be out by August 31st?  I know that you put out the
contacts, you’ve been text messaging — all the message to the contacts,
to people.   
   
Is there any concern that there could be people who have somehow fallen
through the cracks, haven’t been able to get in contact and they want to
get out?  Like, how will the administration determine on August 31st, or
whatever day the military pulls out, that all of the Americans who
wanted to get out have been able to get out?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I think the reason the Secretary of State gave
such a detailed overview is because it’s not as simple as you’ve just
laid it out.   
   
Certainly, there could be American citizens, dual citizens, individuals
who may want to depart who have not yet decided to depart by August
31st.  We know that is a potential, and therefore we want to ensure we
are looking at a range of options for how we can allow them to depart
and enable them to depart after that date and time.   
   
It is also true that there may be individuals who have not — we’re not
yet in contact with; they have not contacted us.  And we want to leave
optionality for that as well.  But he also provided the specific
information on the numbers to give you an understanding — all of you,
everybody — an understanding that while we started with as many as 6,000
— a population of as many as 6,000 Americans in Afghanistan — over the
last 10 days alone, 4,500 of those Americans have been safely
evacuated.  In the last 24 hours, we’ve been in contact with
approximately 500.   
   
So, we’re looking at a relatively small population — we all — left. 
Right?  We also believe that there are individuals in that set of 1,000
who may not want to depart for a range of reasons, as we’ve also
outlined.   
   
I would also note that a big factor on the President’s mind, and the
Secretary of State noted this as well, is the real threat of ISIS-K,
which is the reason why — and the President, again, received a briefing
on that, as he does regularly from his national security team — that is
why we are concerned about numbers around the airport.  That is why we
are in direct contact, through a range of means, with individuals about
how and when to come to the airport.   
   
And, you know, that is something we have to evaluate each day as well,
because putting our servicemen and women at risk is something that
weighs heavily on the President’s mind.  
   
Q    And a question on the Supreme Court decision —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — well, the Supreme Court basically kicking back on the Remain in
Mexico.  What is the White House response to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know the Department of Homeland Security put out a
statement on this last evening, so let me reiterate some of those
points.  
   
We respectfully disagree with the district court’s decision, and we
regret that the Supreme Court has declined to issue this stay.  DHS has
appealed the district court’s order and will continue to vigorously
challenge it.  We are also, though, in this — in the same vein,
compelled to, by law — to now proceed with means by which we abide by
the ruling.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Does that then mean that negotiations are now underway between the
U.S. and Mexico on the — returning to the Migrant Protection
Protocol?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the Department of State, DHS — with DHS support, is
engaging in diplomatic discussions with the government of Mexico as part
of our efforts to implement the Court’s order.  
   
And I would just note — I should have said this a little earlier — I
mean, our point of view continues to be that this program is — was not
implemented in a moral way.  It was inefficient.  It used resources by —
CBP resources.  It led to a backlog in the system.  And it is
fundamentally a program we have opposed, but we are also abiding by a
court order.  
   
Q    Can I ask you a threshold question about the —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — the range of assistance that the U.S. is now promising to offer
to Afghanistan after August 31st?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    You talk about consular services.  Is it the President’s
expectation that the Taliban will continue to allow safe passage for
Afghans to the airport after the U.S. leaves?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is our — again, this is part of an active discussion, and
I understand certainly why you’re asking the question, but we continue
to believe that there will be American — there could be, I should say —
American citizens, there could be Afghans who are — would be eligible
for Special Immigrant Visas or would be individuals eligible for a range
of our programs who would want to depart.  That would require a means of
departing, and that’s what we’re working through now.  
   
Q    So if there’s no guarantee yet from the Taliban to continue to
allow safe passage for the people that the U.S. is hoping —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, these are ongoing discussions, and that is our
expectation and what we’re working toward.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    A couple of quick questions.  Yesterday, the President and you, I
think, said that he had asked the Pentagon and State Department for all
contingency plans.  Has he received all the contingency plans, or is
there a full set that he’s still waiting for more of?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, he received the bri- — a briefing this morning.  
   
Q    He rec- — so he has received, in totality, all the contingency
plans that they’re providing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, this is an ongoing discussion, right?  
   
Q    Understood.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  And — as you well know.  And the President has lengthy
meetings, sometimes more than once a day, with his national security
team.  But, yes, the contingency plans he requested, he received a
briefing on this morning.  
   
Q    Perfect.  That helps.   
   
Earlier, we heard from the Secretary of State saying that there are as
many as 1,500 Americans, by my math, who still want to get out, who are
in Afghanistan right now.  Is it possible that they could be evacuated
before?  Could this — could these evacuations end before that date? 
Could it finish before August 31st?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it could, Peter.  I think — and I would just note by
the numbers — right? — 4,500 Americans were evacuated over the last 10
days.  That doesn’t even count their family members, whether it’s a
spouse, or a spouse and children, or a combination — and that we’ve also
been in contact with an additional 500.  So it’s actually more like a
pool of 1,000 who we are reaching out to multiple times a day, through
multiple communication channels — phone, text, e-mail, WhatsApp, et
cetera.   
   
As I noted a little bit earlier, we also have an expectation that there
are a number of these individuals — dual nationals, people who may have
expansive — extended family — who may not have made the decision to part
at this point in time.  
   
Q    So then let me ask you: Earlier, one of my colleagues asked you,
and you said you didn’t want to provide a cap as it relates to Afghan
allies — vulnerable Afghan allies who are still seeking to leave the
country right now.   
   
Recognizing you don’t want to provide a cap, can you provide us a
baseline?  What is the stated goal, as provided to the President, of the
number you estimate it is “at least as many as” so there’s some context
for these numbers of 80-plus thousand people who have now been
evacuated?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just — that is similar to me in giving a cap.  And there
are people who are not yet through the process, who may — may not count
as an SIV applicant at this point in time, or may be eligible for a
range of programs.  
   
Our objective, as you’ve seen by the numbers over the past several days,
is to evacuate as many people as possible who qualify for any of these
programs.  
   
Q    I guess, why can’t — why can’t the White House or the
administration say what that stated goal is, even as a baseline, so
people get a sense of what we’re shooting for in this process?  What’s
the harm in saying that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Because I don’t think there’s a benefit in giving a cap. 
That’s not our objective.  
   
Q    Well, it gives con- — it gives context to when you say 80,000. 
Eighty thousand is a lot, but is it —   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think — I think —  
   
Q    — out of how many?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Fair.  I think important context, though, is that we’ve now
evacuated, again, 88,000 people — well, 82,000 people on U.S. military
and coalition flights.   
   
You know, just a week ago, some people were saying we couldn’t do
50,000.  We’ve done 82,000.  And so just to put into context — again,
that’s a flight — yesterday — every 39 minutes.  That is thousands and
thousands of people coming through the airport every single day; 19,000
people yesterday.  
   
I think these numbers do provide context, and we’re going to continue to
press every single day to get more people who are eligible out of the
country.  
   
Q    Of course, we don’t know, of those 80,000, how many are
SIV-eligible applicants.  Right?  Some may just be those who wanted to
evacuate the country, which is part of why I ask.  Last —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think that what’s important to note here is that,
you know, the people who we are prioritizing are American citizens, are
SIV applicants, and others who might be eligible for a variety of
programs.   
   
And in order to prevent a mass crowding at the airport, those are the
people we are in direct contact with.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, let me ask lastly about the two congressmen who
went over there.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    I know your — the statement you put out about “they shouldn’t be
doing this,” that this was the wrong decision to be made.  About the
merits of what they said, though, having now returned — they said that
because the evacuations started so late, there’s no way the U.S. will be
able to get all those necessary evacuees out even by September 11th. 
What does the White House say to that criticism that those two lawmakers
are saying based on their firsthand experience?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say first that we’re on track to have the
largest U.S. airlift in history, and I think that speaks for itself.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi.  Can you speak to what a colleague is reporting — that the
administration plans to recommend vaccine boosters in six months, not
eight?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have not seen that report.  But I would note we just put
out the guidance — the CDC just put out the guidance, a couple of weeks
ago or last week — it’s all running together — two weeks ago — on eight
months.  And if they update that guidance, it would certainly come
directly from them.  
   
Q    Do you know if that’s under — is that under consideration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would point you to the CDC.  
   
Q    And then, secondly, what is President Biden prepared to do to push
the Chinese on the Wuhan lab investigation?  There’s been reporting that
the Chinese are not being cooperative; they’re pushing back at the U.S.
on that.  What is he prepared to do to free up more information on
that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think it’s well known they haven’t been cooperative
— right? — through your reporting, other reporting — and just the fact
that they obviously have not, in a publicly available way, provided the
data and the information that we have been requesting.  
   
In terms of an assessment of what steps we might take, I don’t have
anything to preview for you on that front.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I know you don’t want to get into the details of the
COVID origins report assessment.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  I will be happy to when there is an unclassified
summary for all of you.  
   
Q    Right.  But, of course, the purpose of the 90-day review was to put
a focus on this question.  So, if at the end of the question we don’t
have clarity or the smoking gun or high confidence, what’s the next
step?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ll talk about that once the summary is out in public.  
   
Q    And then just —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q    Well, I — just, if you can update us on the White House role in
responding to the crisis in Haiti.  I know USAID and —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — SOUTHCOM have given us updates, but what has the White House been
doing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, this is something, I think as you know — and you’ve
been following closely — we’ve been deeply engaged with and involved
with under the leadership of our — of Samantha Power, who is the
Director of USAID.   
   
In terms of are you looking for specific assistance and specific — what
we’re getting to the ground, let me get you updated numbers that we have
provided as of today.  I think the last information I have is about a
day old, but it’s an ongoing process.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I’m just wondering if you could give us a preview of
the President’s upcoming meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister, and if
we can expect any announcements on the reopening of Palestinian offices
in Washington and the consulate in Jerusalem.  And if not, what’s the
status of those projects?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  I know we did a briefing call to provide a preview of
that last night — or I believe yesterday, at some point in time.   
   
I will say that the President is looking forward to welcoming the prime
minister, who is already in town, as you know, having a variety of
meetings today.  
   
I would expect — we expect their conversation to be wide ranging, to
cover a range of topics of mutual interest — everything from COVID-19
and our efforts to address the global pandemic, to regional security
issues, which could include a range of topics, including security within
Israel as well as, you know, Iran and other issues of mutual concern.   
   
And I expect we’ll have a readout once the meeting concludes of anything
coming out of the meeting.  
   
Q    Do expect any decisions on these things to be announced, though?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ll have more to say once the meeting concludes.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  To follow up on my colleague Stephanie’s question:
She asked about the gear shift that might be taking place over the next
couple of days.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    And you’ve talked about the contingency plans and optionality.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    But can you say, today, when the last flight will leave, in order
to get the drawdown done by that deadline?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think that’s information we’re going to be providing
publicly at any point in time.  
   
Q    How would we know then?  I mean, you’re giving the updates on
data.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Once it’s complete, we’ll provide that to you.  
   
Q    You’ll say, “This is it” —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — “This is the last update we’re going to give on the numbers”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, we are in direct contact with people who are
departing and evacuating from Afghanistan, whether they are SIVs,
whether they are eligible for other programs, whether they are American
citizens.  
   
Our objective is to provide — to do that in as safe a manner as possible
with rising threats from ISIS-K.   
   
So, again, DOD will provide operational updates, as they did yesterday,
about moving military out, moving equipment out, et cetera.  And as
we’ve noted, that would be in advance of the 31st in terms of, you know,
equipment that would need to move out.   
   
But I don’t — I don’t anticipate that we’re going to give you an exact
date or — or an exact time, for security reasons.  
   
Q    And then, after it happens, though — you guys have been very good
about giving data, twice a day —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — on these numbers.  Is there going to be one of those updates that
will say, “And that is it.  That’s the last evacuation flight”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m — I’m sure we will make clear to all of you when it is
the last flight.  Absolutely.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  NBC has announced it’s doing an interview tomorrow with
the officer — Capitol officer who shot Ashli Babbitt.  Do have any
concern for his safety, having his name disclosed like that, or any
reaction to the announcement?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I had not seen that report of NBC’s planned interview, so I
don’t really have an immediate reaction to it.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yes, Jen.  What is the reaction of the administration to private
contractors now selling seats for thousands of dollars on charter
flights out of Kabul?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we are evacuating people free of cost because that is
the right step to take, and certainly we wouldn’t be supportive of
profiting off of people who are desperate to get out of a country.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Jen.  I have a question on Afghanistan and
then about a criminal justice matter.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    On Afghanistan, one of the real villains of the Taliban takeover
has been former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.  President Biden has
faulted him for not fostering national unity and not putting up much of
a fight against the Taliban.  
   
There are reports that he fled the country with millions of dollars in
cash, and members of Congress are asking the Biden administration for
answers.  Whether that is indeed true, do — does the U.S. government
know if Ghani fled to Dubai with millions in cash?  And will there be
efforts to bring him to justice if so?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any more information on what — who — what the
former president did when he fled the country.  
   
Q    So, you don’t know that answer?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any information on — more information on
that.  
   
Q    And on criminal justice, you said in response to a Zolan question
recently that President Biden is exploring using clemency for nonviolent
drug offenders.  It’s rare for presidents to use clemency in their first
year in office.  Should we expect any grants of clemency this year, in
2021?  And does that mean that the President is working toward honoring
his campaign pledge to free everyone in prison for marijuana?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have a timeline for you.  I would just stand by what
I said in response to Zolan’s question about how he is considering
clemency for nonviolent drug offenders.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Earlier this summer, the President had plans to
take some downtime this August, and I was wondering if there was still
any vacation time on the books or anything coming up that we should be
aware of.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not at this time.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I wanted to ask a follow-up to something Steven asked.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Is the expectation that there will be able to be diplomatic, sort
of, consular embassy-style services after the 31st withdrawal for those
who may still need it in Afghanistan?  And if so, like, how would that
work?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly understand the question, and it’s a good
question, and our Secretary of State answered a version of this.  This a
discussion we’re having right now to ensure that we look ahead to
capabilities and capacities to evacuate individuals who want to depart
after we — our military leaves.  
   
Q    And then, one other one on infrastructure.  Is the President
satisfied with the House holding off a vote until the end of September? 
And did the White House or the President play a role in, sort of,
disagreement between the Speaker’s Office and the group of Democrats
that were threatening to hold up the larger reconciliation bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, the President sees yesterday, and
the step forward yesterday, as an enormous step forward for not only the
legislation, but for the American people, because the piece of
legislation — the pieces of legislation that move forward include an
extension of the Child Tax Credit, more housing assistance, a great deal
of funding and support for addressing the climate crisis, and a great
deal of tax credits for the American people, and components that will
lower costs for people across the country.  
   
He supports the process that Speaker Pelosi has laid out.  Obviously,
there’s a lot on the agenda, and yesterday was a positive step forward,
in his view.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  You’ve mentioned how the United States has been in
touch with the Taliban because that’s necessary —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    — because of the situation on the ground.  I’m wondering, has the
administration been in touch with Ahmad Massoud or any of the other
anti-Taliban fighters there are on the ground?  You know, what is the
President’s view of this?  Does he expect that we will support some of
these anti-Taliban fighters?  Or, you know, as this 20-year war does
come to a close, at this point, are they on their own?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question.  I’ll have to talk to our team on the
ground to see if there’s any more specifics we can provide.   
   
Q    And then, I know you don’t want to get ahead of, you know, the
declassified report on the COVID origin, but is there any scenario where
President Biden would be satisfied with an inconclusive result about the
origin of the pandemic that killed so many Americans?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can assure you the President wants to get to the bottom of
the root causes of COVID-19 that has — as you noted, has killed hundreds
of thousands of Americans, and wishes that there had been more done
earlier on to get to the bottom of it and to, of course, save more
lives.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, I just wanted to follow up on Steve’s question —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — about the sort of for-profit effort.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    What is the administration doing to kind of protect people from
exploitation?  Given the desperation, there are reports that the defense
contractor Erik Prince is offering seats on a plane — evacuation plane —
out for $6,500.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    And some people in desperation are taking that, not knowing there
might be an NGO option, and are — I mean, essentially this is
exploitation.  What is the administration doing to kind of protect
people when they are so desperate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are evacuating tens of thousands of people every day for
free, and that’s the focus that our military on the ground and our
diplomats have on the ground.  And if you’re asking me about
consequences or additional steps, I will have to check and see if
there’s any additional steps.  
   
Q    Could you comment specifically though on Erik Prince?  I mean, he
has already made so much money from the Afghan conflict and now, in the
sort of final waning days, is once again essentially exploiting people
in order to make profit.  I mean, what is the position of the
administration that this has taken place as you are offering flights
free of charge?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think any human being who has a heart and soul would
support efforts to profit off of people’s agony and pain as they’re
trying to depart a country and fearing for their lives.   
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, just a follow-up on the rental assistance.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    What is the — what is the White House or what is the
administration’s understanding for the delay of these billions of
dollars not getting out?  Is it at the state and local level?  Or is
there red tape at the federal level?  Or is it a combination of that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, a great deal of it is at the state and local level. 
It is, though — one, I think a couple things that may be misunderstood,
maybe not by you, but about the program, which is that the program was
designed to be distributed over the course of three years.  So, we
didn’t anticipate that all of the funding would be out in the course of
nine months; it’s not.  We still think it should be faster.   
   
We also have a responsibility from the federal government, of course, to
make this easier.  There is not a system that has been set up to
distribute this type of funding on a federal level.  So, even very
well-meaning leaders in states and localities are figuring out how to
break through the bureaucracy and get this money out.  Some states need
to do a better job of that.   
   
I will note that in the data that was released today, there are some
interesting statistics.  And this just shows you state to state where
the differences are, right?  So, in Kentucky, the program has shown
consistent growth, most recently assisting 65 percent more households in
July than in June.  That’s a dramatic improvement, of course, in that
state.  And program administrators attribute the recent growth to
Treasury guidance that allows for self-attestation for the application
process.   
   
So, we’re going to continue to try to cut red tape from here, too, if it
makes it easier for states.   
   
Texas attributes their leveling off to having fully addressed existing
application backlogs.  They’ve done a very good job of getting this
money out to people who need it.  
   
And North Carolina, which is a state to slower — slower to distribute
assistance in prior months, saw notable increases this month as the
investments they made in the developing of the program’s infrastructure
paid off.   
   
So, point is, it’s really different state to state.  Certainly, as we’ve
said, states and localities should not hesitate, should not delay in
getting this money out because this is how they — we can keep people in
their homes.  But we’re also going to work from a federal level to cut
red tape wherever we can.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Going to be the one out of left field today.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    But the Vice President is going to be campaigning for Governor
Newsom on her way back from Asia.  Previously, President Biden expressed
at least an interest in campaigning for him.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    You know, with everything going on, I’m wondering if that’s still
on the table.   
   
And, secondly, whether you all feel any sense that this recall is in
some ways a referendum on democratic policies, including the handling of
coronavirus amid this Delta surge?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, I can confirm the President does
still plan to go and campaign for Governor Newsom in California.  I
don’t have a date for you at this point in time, but that is still,
certainly, his plan.  
   
And I will leave the analysis on the roots of the recall to others.   
   
Go ahead.  Go ahead, Shelby.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I have one question and then a quick clarification on
something.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    So, first, Blinken was really specific in giving numbers —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — for Americans that actively want to get out of Afghanistan.  Has
the State Department made direct contact and confirmed with all American
citizens that they want to stay — that they might want to stay in
Afghanistan?  Or is the op- — is the assumption that if they haven’t
contacted the embassy or the State Department, that they must not want
to leave?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, we’ve sent out — as Secretary
Blinken noted — 19 messages to American citizens over the course of the
last few months.  We’ve also done a great deal of outreach and
advertising, providing information for anyone who wants to leave,
including the offering of financial assistance, in recent weeks, for
people who want to leave Afghanistan.   
   
But what I also would note — and this is an important caveat: It is
possible there could be Americans who have not yet conta- — contacted
us, who we don’t know about.  And that’s why we want to leave
optionality, because of our responsibility to help these Americans
depart.   
   
Q    And then, this is, sort of, for my clarification: So, earlier you
said that the administration is looking at a range of options to get
Americans out after the 31st, and then I believe you said that the
President did receive the contingencies he had asked for.  So is there
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would put those in two different categories.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Because the contingency plans he requested would be — should
— should — for optionality to stay longer than the 31st.  That was
something he asked for.   
   
I’m talking about beyond, when the military leaves for the option of
allowing Americans to depart —  
   
Q    So is there —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — or others who are eligible for programs.  
   
Q    So is there currently a set contingency specifically for Americans
left in the country after August 31st, or is that still being worked
out?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, so I want to make sure I’m not confusing anyone.  So,
the contingency plans the President requested was to have maximum
optionality, given there are a range of factors, including the threat of
ISIS-K — which is very much on his mind and a threat to our U.S. men and
women who are serving; including the need for the Taliban to continue to
coordinate.  That is about staying longer than the 31st.  Those are the
contingency plans.   
   
I also spoke to, and Secretary Blinken also spoke to, the fact that we
are also looking for options, post the departure of our military
presence, to allow for Americans and others who are eligible for
programs to evacuate.  That is something we’re working through and
having discussions about.   
   
And as we have more to update, we will provide that to you.  But I would
look at them as two separate things.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, Jen, just one on coronavirus.  Thanks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    The Eu- — the EU, excuse me, is voting tomorrow to reimpose
sanctions on the incoming U.S. citizens.  Is the President in contact
with his contemporaries about that decision?  And what does this mean
for our own timeline for lifting travel restrictions on EU
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Imposing sanctions?  
   
Q    I’m sorry, imposing coronavirus travel restrictions.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, I was like, that’s concerning.  (Laughter.) Okay.  
   
Q    We’re at about 400 cases per 100,000 over their threshold for
barring travel.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say we are in touch through working groups and
through a range of channels at the diplomatic level, and through our
health team with Europeans and others, about travel restrictions.   
   
Q    So we have no updates on the timeline?  Just clarifying.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any updates on the timeline.  No.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Thanks, everyone.  Have a great day.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.
