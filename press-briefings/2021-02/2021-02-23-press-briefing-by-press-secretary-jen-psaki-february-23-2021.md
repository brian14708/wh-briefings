James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:05 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  I have a few updates for all of you at the top.  

Today, President Biden will meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau.  President Biden’s first phone call, as you all know, was to —
to a foreign leader was to the Prime Minister, and it’s a fitting
testament that with this bi- — that this is his first bilateral
meeting.  The President will highlight the strong and deep partnership
between the United States and Canada as neighbors, friends, and NATO
Allies.

Both leaders will review joint efforts in areas of mutual interest and
establish a roadmap for an ambitious and whole-of-government approach on
issues such as recovery from COVID-19, a sustainable and inclusive
economic recovery, tackling the climate crisis, advancing diversity and
inclusion, bolstering security and defense, and strengthening global
alliances.

Vice President Harris, along with the Secretaries of State, Defense,
Treasury, Transportation, and Homeland Security, and the Special
Presidential Envoy for Climate will also be participating in the
bilateral session with their Canadian counterparts.

Today, the President will also meet virtually with a group of black
essential workers to thank them for their critical roles during the
pandemic and to discuss how to encourage vaccinations.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding economic crisis are
devastating black communities.  While black Americans comprise 13
percent of the U.S. population, they represent nearly 24 percent of
age-adjusted deaths from COVID-19.  The President also looks forward to
discussing how his American Rescue Plan will deliver immediate relief to
the participants, their communities, and the American people by keeping
frontline workers on the job with $350 billion in emergency funding for
state and local governments; providing $1,400 per-person checks to
working families; and investing $160 billion in supplies, testing,
vaccinations, and public health workforce to defeat the virus.

Today, on his weekly governors call with America’s governors, our COVID
Coordinator, Jeff Zients, announced the fifth consecutive week of supply
increases.  States will now receive 14.5 million doses this week, up
from 8.6 million doses per week when the President took office.  That’s
an increase in vaccine allocations of nearly 70 percent during the
Biden-Harris administration.

The Retail Pharmacy Program has also performed well, despite the winter
storm.  We announced last week an increase of 1 to 2 million doses.  And
the — our COVID Coordinator, Jeff Zients, I should say, conveyed to the
governors we will increase that allocation by 100,000 doses this week.

Thanks to the President’s efforts, we are also on track to have enough
vaccines for 300 million Americans by the end of July.  And we continue
to encourage Americans to mask up, respect social distancing, and abide
by the public health guidelines. 

One more update from here.  Actually, sorry, two more updates.

On the winter storm: Yesterday, FEMA announced that Texas homeowners and
renters in 31 additional counties who suffered damage from the winter
storm may now apply for individual disaster assistance.  The 31
additional counties join the 77 counties previously approved for
individual disaster assistance.

In Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, sheltering operations continue to
decrease, power and transportation are back to normal, and water
restoration continues.

However, 9.8 million people are affected by water system outages and
remain under boil water notices.  Over 9 million liters of water have
been delivered or are en route.  There are over 200 locally managed
water distribution sites supported by local, federal, private sector,
and donated resources.

Finally, the — I have one travel announcement, which you all have been
asking about.  We, of course, remain in close touch with state and local
elected officials to monitor the recovery.  And, on Friday, the
President and the First Lady will travel to Houston.  The President will
meet with local leaders to discuss the winter storm — relief efforts,
progress toward recovery, and the incredible resilience shown by the
people of Houston and Texas.

While in Texas, the President will also visit a COVID health center
where vaccines are being distributed.  Clearly, there are still more
details of the trip coming together, and as we have those, we will make
those available to all of you.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two questions.  S&P reported this morning that home
prices are up 10 percent over the past year.  We’ve seen inventories of
homes for sale at record lows.  And that means first-time buyers aren’t
able to make the step into housing that’s been a bedrock of middle-class
identity.  What is this administration doing on housing affordability? 
What do you deal with — do with runaway prices?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President is committed to ensuring homeownership
is something that more Americans can participate in.  He knows owning a
home is a key measure of building generational wealth, and he’s already
taken steps through executive actions to help provide some security to
Americans struggling to keep their homes in the midst of this crisis by
extending foreclosure and forbearance moratoriums.

The American Rescue Plan would also provide $10 billion for the
Homeowners Assistance Fund to help struggling homeowners keep up. 

And as part of the broader Build Back Better agenda, which I know you’re
all eager to hear more about, one of the tenets he is of course
interested in is looking for ways to increase the supply of affordable
housing, making it easier for more people to buy homes.

Q    And then, you’ve been asked repeatedly about how we should properly
memorialize the deaths from the coronavirus.  After last night’s
service, has this administration given any more thoughts in terms of how
to honor the dead?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I don’t know — I watched last night, and I’m
pretty — you know, I’ve seen a lot of presidential events, and I found
myself getting choked up when I watched the events happening on the
television screen in my office last night.

And the President and the Vice President will continue to look for ways
to memorialize the lives that have been lost and remember the families.

But our view here is that the best memorial we could offer to those who
have lost their lives to COVID is to end this pandemic and reduce the
numbers — the number of others who would otherwise perish and the number
of families who will be impacted.  And that’s our focus now.

And when we have this crisis behind us — we’re at war, as we’ve — as
we’ve said many times — we will consult broadly on the proper way to
mark this horrible loss of life.  And certainly we’re open to that, but
at this point of time, our focus is on the pandemic and saving more
lives.

Go ahead.

Q    Thank you.  Does the White House have a plan B if Neera Tanden
doesn’t work out?  And could you give us a sense of what that looks
like?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, the White House’s focus, the President’s focus is on
working toward the confirmation of Neera Tanden to lead — to be the OMB
director.  That is our focus.

Q    And could you say anything about Gene Sperling or Ann O’Leary, who
have also been floated recently?

MS. PSAKI:  There’s one candidate to lead the budget department, and her
name is Neera Tanden.  And I can give you a brief update though on, kind
of, the outreach that’s happened.  And I know there’s been a couple of
questions along those lines.

She has had 44 meetings now with senators of both parties.  She’s spoken
with 15 senators from both parties since Friday.  Some of those were
repeats of people she had spoken with previously.  But as I noted
yesterday, she’s committed to rolling up her sleeves, having those
conversations, answering questions as they come up, reiterating her
commitment to working with people across the aisle, and also sharing
some of her own experience of working with people of different
viewpoints.

Q    And just really quickly, on the Supreme Court decision to allow
Trump’s tax returns to be shared with New York prosecutors, I just
wondered if you had a reaction.

MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  There’s been reporting through many — many of your
sources, probably yours as well, of multiple other ongoing
investigations, so we’re not going to comment on this specific ruling.  
The President did make clear on the campaign trail that the American
people expect and deserve transparency from their President.  That’s why
he released over two decades of his own tax returns.

Q    And just one more.

MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead.

Q    On the Canada meeting, I just wanted to see if you could say a
little bit more about what Biden plans to bring up with Trudeau, and
also what his view is of this decision by Canada recently to make
Facebook pay for news content.

MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President’s focus for — of the meeting will be to
continue to discuss ways for them to work together on multiple levels on
the crises that are facing both countries, whether it’s COVID-19 or
getting our economy back. There’s obviously a long bilateral
relationship and an important one, hence the first bilateral meeting.

I’m not sure — I don’t have anything on that particular — I don’t have
any reaction in particular on Canada’s announcement.  I can talk to our
team and see if there’s more to provide on that front.

Okay.  Go ahead.

Q    On the outreach to senators by Neera Tanden, you said it’s 44? 
Fifteen since Friday?

MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.

Q    Do you know if that includes Senator Manchin, Senator Collins,
Senator Portman, among those who said yesterday, at least, that they
hadn’t heard from her?

MS. PSAKI:  It includes a number of Republicans.  Obviously, Republicans
are — or any members, I should say — can — are free to share whether
they’ve communicated with her or other nominees, or not.  But we’re not
going to read out specific names from here.

Q    Has the President made any calls to senators for her nomination?

MS. PSAKI:  The President is in touch with a range of members of
Congress about issues ranging from the American Rescue Plan to his
nominees.  I don’t have any other calls, though, to read out from him
either.

Q    So that’s a maybe?

MS. PSAKI:  That is: I don’t have any more calls to read out.

Q    Okay.  On Keystone XL, I know that’s one issue that will come up
today.  Obviously, the Canadian Prime Minister feels differently about
this than the President does.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Administration officials said that this decision, which was a
day-one decision, had essentially used the Obama administration’s
assessment as the reason to go back — I believe is what they said.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    There was no other reason to explore it.  There is an economic
effect though, of course, now: 11,000 people had jobs connected to this
in the United States at least.  What does the White House say to those
people, to the Canadian workers, who now are going to be out of a job if
this pipeline is indeed shut down?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that it was the Obama-Biden
administration when the assessment was done and done by the State
Department at the time.  And the President was very consistent through
the campaign, and even before then, about his view that that — that it
should be revoked.  And he had conversations, of course, with the Prime
Minister about it.  The Prime Minister raised his concerns directly with
the President — has previously — and he’s, of course, welcome to
today.   
   
But the President made clear that this is a commitment he’s — he has
made in the past, that it’s not in the interest of the United States,
and that we want to try to address our climate crisis while also
creating good-paying union jobs.  
   
And he has a — he has a plan.  He has talked about his plan, I should
say, on the campaign trail to create millions of clean energy jobs.  And
he is eager to continue to work with the policy team and outside
stakeholders and experts on delivering on that in the months ahead.   
   
But he believes you can do both.  And he has been consistent about his
opposition to the Keystone pipeline.   
   
Q    And then the Senate has launched this inquiry into the Capitol
assault on January 6th.  You know that the House is going back and forth
on the composition of a potential commission that would look into this
further.   
   
There are proposals that include the President appointing some of those
positions to the — to a commission.  Does the White House have any
opinion on that?  Is he weighing in at all with lawmakers as they put
that together?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we certainly support the desire and the interest of
members of Congress to put together a commission.  It’s up to them to
make that determination.  We’ve been in touch with them about a range of
options, but I don’t think there’s anything final at this point, so I
don’t have anything more to read out on our particular view on which
proposal.  
   
Q    And would there be concern that there could be overlap or conflict
with whatever the Justice Department is doing in terms of investigations
and prosecuting some of these people?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, I certainly would venture to avoid that.  But,
of course, any investigation, any process of moving forward toward a
prosecution would be done independently by the Justice Department, and
that is a commitment the President is firm on.  
   
Q    And in his conversations with lawmakers, have there been any other
conversations about a joint address to Congress?  I know you got asked
about this recently.  And if it’s not in person, would he be willing to
do it virtually if he had to?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, he’s clearly willing to hold events virtually,
hence the bilateral meeting today with the Prime Minister of Canada. 
And we’re certainly open to a range of formats.  I don’t have any update
on a date or a timeline for joint address.   
   
Go ahead.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead.  And I’ll come around to you.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I want to ask you about a report that’s out: that
the Biden administration is prepared to sanction Russia for the
SolarWinds hack but also a range of other malign cyber activities.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Are you able to confirm that those sanctions are coming down?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we announced our ongoing review, and the
President spoke about it in his conversation with President Putin just a
few weeks ago.   
   
We have asked the intelligence community to do further work to sharpen
the attribution that the previous administration made about precisely
how the hack occurred, what the extent of the damage is, and what the
scope and scale of the intrusion is.  And we’re still in the process of
working that through now.   
   
But it will be weeks, not months, before we respond, but I’m not going
to get ahead of the conclusion of that process.   
   
Q    Any more specific on the timeline, as far as weeks?  I mean, are we
talking by the end of this month, or can you put any more finer point on
it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The end of this month is a couple days away.  That would be
a very short timeline.   
   
Q    That’s true.  February does have 28 days.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.)  I was thinking, “Is it March yet?”  “Weeks, not
months” is the best definition I can give for you.  Of course, we want
to focus on giving our team the time they need to take additional steps
to fine-tune the attribution.  And we reserve the right to respond in a
— at a time and a manner of our choosing.  
   
Q    And then, on the Tanden nomination, Senator Murkowski said
yesterday that she had not heard from the White House, even though she’s
undecided.  Was that an oversight by the White House, and has that been
rectified?  I mean, has she been reached out to since then?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, you know, Neera Tanden has rolled up her
sleeves.  She’s getting to work.  She’s working the phones.  People here
are working the phones.  And we’re just not going to provide day-by-day
updates on exactly each senator and office that we’ve communicated with,
but they can communicate on their own, of course, if they’ve been
reached out to or — you know, or what communication they’ve had.  
   
Q    And then, on the Canada visit, I wanted to clear up something you
had said the other day —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    — which is on the — on the Buy America provisions, you had said
there’s essentially no changes, and the Canadians had raised concerns
about whether they would be able to obtain waivers like they did during
the Obama administration.  So when you said you didn’t anticipate any
changes to that policy, did you mean to suggest that the Canadian
companies will not be able to obtain waivers under the policy of the
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, I appreciate that — or I appreciate the ask for
clarification, I should say.  So, of course, the President signed and
made — signed a Made in America executive order in the first week, I
believe, of the administration, and we’re still evaluating the
application of that and how it will apply.  I don’t expect him to make
any commitments during the meeting today.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then just one more logistical thing on the Canada
visit.  Usually during these foreign leader visits, obviously, as you
know, there’s a two-and-two element for the questions.  Are we going to
see that later this afternoon with Prime Minister Trudeau?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t expect that’s going to be part of the program
today.  Obviously, there are several components, as I noted: a smaller
meeting, a more expanded meeting, and then some comments at the end. 
But that’s the program at this point in time.  
   
Q    Will you commit to it for future foreign leader visits?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We certainly — it certainly has been standard in the past,
and we’ll — you can — I can assure you that, in the future, there will
be one-and-one and two-and-two and other opportunities to ask questions,
even when foreign leaders are not visiting.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  A few on immigration really quick.  Merrick
Garland was asked yesterday if illegal entry at the border should remain
a crime, and he said, “I haven’t thought about that question.”  Does
President Biden believe that illegal entry at the border should remain a
crime moving forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think he was being asked as the Attorney General —
the future Attorney General.  I think he’s looking ahead to be confirmed
of the United States.  And if he wants to make considerations
independently, he can certainly do that.  But the President has spoken
to this, and we believe in abiding by our laws.  
   
As you know, there of course is a process underway at the Department of
Homeland Security to re- — to take a fresh look at prioritization and
who is detained and who is sent back home.  So that is something
happening from the Department of Homeland Security.  
   
But again, if he’s going to lead an independent Justice Department, it
is his prerogative to take a look at, you know, any policies under their
purview.   
   
Q    And, to that point, why is the Biden administration reopening a
temporary facility for migrant children in Texas?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, the policy of this administration — as you all
know, but just for others — is not to expel unaccompanied children who
arrive at the border.  And the process — how it works — is that Customs
and Border Control continue to transfer unaccompanied children to the
HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement.  That can take a couple of days.  I
just want to give this context, as people need to understand the
process.  
   
But because of COVID-19 protocols, the — like social distancing
requirements — the capacity at existing Office of Refugee Resettlement
shelters has been significantly reduced, because of course you can’t
have a child in every bed.  There needs to be spacing, and we abide by
those spacing to protect the kids who are living in those facilities for
a short period of time.  
   
And to ensure the health and safety of these kids, HHS took steps to
open an emergency facility to add capacity, where these children can be
provided the care they need while they are safely — before they are
safely placed with families and sponsors.  
   
So it’s a temporary reopening during COVID-19.  Our intention is very
much to close it, but we want to ensure that we can follow COVID saf- —
COVID protocols, as we — as unaccompanied minors come into the United
States.   
   
Q    But it’s the same facility that was open for a month in the Trump
administration.  Summer of 2019 — that is when Joe Biden said, “Under
Trump, there have been horrifying scenes at the border of kids being
kept in cages.”  And Kamala Harris said, basically, babies in cages is a
human rights abuse being committed by the United States government.  So
how is this any different than that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We very much feel that way.  And these —  
   
Q    So if —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  These are facilities — let me be — let me be clear here. 
One, there’s a pandemic going on.  I’m sure you’re not suggesting that
we have children right next to each other in ways that are not COVID
safe, are you?  
   
Q    I’m suggesting that Kamala Harris said that this facility — putting
people in this facility was a human rights abuse committed by the United
States government.  And Joe Biden said, “Under Trump, there have been
horrifying scenes of border” — “at the border of kids being kept in
cages.”  
   
Now it’s not under Trump.  It’s under Biden.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  This is not kids being kept in cages.  This is —  
   
Q    But it’s the same facility.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  This is kids — this is a facility that was opened that’s
going to follow the same standards as other HHS facilities.  It is not a
replication.  Certainly not.  That’s — that is never our intention of
replicating the immigration policies of the past administration.  
   
But we are in a circumstance where we are not going to expel
unaccompanied minors at the border.  That would be inhumane.  That is
not what we are going to do here, as an administration.  We need to find
places that are safe under COVID protocols for kids to be, where they
can have access to education, health and mental services consistent with
their best interest.  Our goal is for them to then be transferred to
families or sponsors.   
   
So this is our effort to ensure that kids are treated — are not close —
in close proximity and that we are abiding by the health and safety
standards that the government has been set out.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    And just quickly, on climate: Last week, the Climate Envoy John
Kerry said that there are only “nine years left” to save the world from
the effects of climate change.  Does President Biden share that
assessment: nine years?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have a new timeline to give you from here.  I can
confirm for you, though, that the President agrees with former Secretary
Kerry that it’s a crisis, that time is of the essence.  We need to act
quickly, and that’s why climate is a key part of his agenda.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I’m — well, I have a follow-ups on immigration —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    — but I know Kaitlan has been waiting.  So —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead, Kaitlan.   
   
Q    Go ahead, Kaitlan.   
   
Q    I can wait for your immigration follow-up.  
   
Q    Well, yeah, just because — picking up on this discussion about the
HHS facility versus Customs and Border Protection facilities, there’s a
law that says you’re supposed to get kids out of those facilities — a
CBP facility —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — in three days.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.   
   
Q    But data we obtained said that there were at least 179 kids who had
spent more than three days in those kinds of facilities in January,
despite internal policy dictating that all minors should get out within
three days.   
   
Immigration attorneys — attorneys that work with these kids, advocates —
seeing all of this and saying, “This isn’t that much better than what
was going on before.”  In regards to the HHS — the use of the HHS
facilities, they say, “It’s a step backwards.”   
   
So there’s the criticism that was made by candidates Biden and Harris,
and then there’s the criticism concerned now of these attorneys who work
with and represent these children who say, “This isn’t much different
than the Trump administration was doing.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well —  
   
Q    What say you?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Let me — let me first say that you’re right that kids —
there’s about a 72-hour time- — timeframe where kids should be
transferred from CBP facilities to HHS-sponsored facilities, and that is
certainly our objective.  
   
In terms of the specific kids that you mentioned, I would send you to
DHS to give you more information on that.  But that is not — that is not
what we are hoping to achieve.  We want these kids to be in facilities
where they are getting access to health and medical assistance, to
education.  As you know, there are a number who have come into the
country, and we’re trying to manage that as well and ensure that we are
able to transfer them as quickly as possible.  Not just to stay in HHS
facilities either — to get them into families and sponsored homes, that
is our human and moral objective from this administration.  
   
But I would send you to DHS for any more specifics on those kids.  It’s
a fair question.   
   
Q    And I asked you a few weeks ago when you guys announced the
outlines of the immigration executive orders: What is the message to
people in Central America who are thinking of making this trip?  You
gave an answer then.  I guess I’d ask you: Is the administration — is
the U.S. government doing enough to make clear to that part of the world
it’s not worth making this kind of a trip?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we can always do more.  And I think the challenge
here, as you know, is that people are fleeing prosecution.  They’re
fleeing very difficult economic circumstances and hardship.  And there
hasn’t been enough time to do enough to impact the circumstances on the
ground in a number of these communities.   
   
And obviously, as these unaccompanied kids come to the border, it’s
completely heartbreaking.  We’re not going to expel these kids.  We want
to process and get them into facilities as quickly as possible.  But
certainly, we’re always looking for ways to do more to communicate more
effectively and clearly with communities in the region about why this is
not the time to come.  We need more time to put in place a humane and
moral immigration system.  
   
Q    So parents should not be sending their kids north right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely not.  This is not the time to come.  We don’t —
we have not had the time to put in place an immigration system, an
immigration policy.  We don’t have the processing we need at the
border.  Obviously, we’re continuing to struggle with facilities to
ensure that we’re abiding by COVID protocols.  So this is definitely not
the time to come.  
   
Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q    Okay, back to Neera Tanden.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Tomorrow, the committee is set to vote on her.  Does the White
House still expect that tomorrow she will be President Biden’s nominee
to run the Budget Office?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s certainly our expectation.  And as I noted earlier,
you know, Neera has rolled up her sleeves.  She’s getting to work. 
We’re getting to work.  And we understand that we need to continue to
engage with a range of members, from Democrats to Republicans, and we’re
going to keep doing that.  But she is the President’s choice because
she’s experienced and qualified.  And we’ve — we continued to stand
there.  
   
Q    So you’re talking about the outreach to Republicans.  What we’re
seeing with this, you know, potentially being derailed is how one
senator can really derail, potentially, the President’s staff picks or
his policy, potentially, with the minimum wage maybe not making it into
the coronavirus relief bill.  Is he frustrated by that?  And how does he
plan to handle that going forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President comes to this role having served 36
years in the Senate, so he has the benefit of experience of recognizing
the power of any one individual senator or one individual member, and he
certainly respects that.   
   
We disagree, as we talked about a little bit yesterday, with the
senators who have come out in opposition to Neera Tanden, but we al- —
are also going to look for ways to work with them on the President’s
agenda.  And that’s the experience he takes and the perspective he takes
to this office.  
   
Q    Senator Manchin has proposed an $11 — or says he will propose an
amendment that would make the minimum wage increase $11, not the $15
that President Biden has proposed.  Would he sign a coronavirus relief
bill that had an $11 minimum wage in there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President proposed $15 because that’s what he
feels is right for the American worker — American workers, I should say
— and the men and women who are working hard just trying to make ends
meet.  And that’s why that number was in his package.   
   
It hasn’t even passed the House yet.  We expect that to happen this
weekend.  There’ll be an opportunity for Senator Manchin and others to
put forward ideas and proposals, and we’ll see where that process
lands.  
   
But he proposed the $15 increase for a reason, and he stands by it.  
   
Q    And he said that he would be open to compromise with this.  So is
$11 something that he would be willing to compromise with Manchin on?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, you know, there’s going to be a process that works
its way through the Senate.  We don’t even know where it’s going to end
up, outside of when it works its way through the “Byrd bath” — I just
want to keep just using that phrase here.  And we expect that to happen
in the next couple days and then we’ll see where it goes from there.   
   
Q    Okay.  My last question is on the meeting with Canadian Prime
Minister Trudeau.  Canada wants to get vaccines from the U.S., mainly
the Pfizer plant in Michigan, but so far the U.S. has a contract with
them that their first 100 million doses are going to the U.S.  And they
expect that, according to the advisors, by the end of June.  So does
that mean Canada should not expect to get vaccines from the U.S. until
at least the summer, until at least June?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President’s first priority is ensuring every
American is vaccinated.  And our focus right now is getting shots in
arms at home.  He will — of course, he looks forward to engaging with
the Prime Minister, as we’ve already discussed, and there are multiple
ways we can work together on COVID response.   
   
All options are on the table down the road, but I don’t have anything to
update you on about Pfizer providing vaccinations, other than we remain
committed to getting Americans vaccinated.  
   
Q    So you don’t expect him to give Prime Minister Trudeau any kind of
a timeline of when they can expect to be able to receive vaccines from
the U.S. and Canada?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t anticipate that.  No.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Two questions, if I might.  The first one: Polls
have shown that three quarters or so of Republicans still apparently
believe that the election was stolen.  This is what the President calls
“the big lie.”  And obviously that has been connected to the events of
January the 6th, which some liken to a terrorist action.  So in other
words, a serious, serious issue.   
   
How does the President feel about former President Trump going to CPAC
this weekend?  He will have a huge audience; it’s an enormous platform. 
Does the President think that’s actually a — you know, a problem — a
threat, in his view?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President’s view is that we’ve spent a whole lot
of time — not we, but in this briefing room — talking about President
Trump over the last few years.  I guess for good reason; he was
President.  And that his view is: We’re going to spend the time focusing
about the American people, and our objective is to help them and our
commitment to helping them.   
   
So I wouldn’t say he’s thought a lot about the President — former
President’s visit to per- — you know, I was going to say “performance.” 
Maybe that’s appropriate at CPAC.   
   
Q    But if he goes with the former guy’s strategy, (inaudible) could
boil it down to that — you know, obviously former President Trump isn’t
just sitting — going to sit on his hands.  He’s got his message to give
out.  And — but the point is: This message, according to President
Biden, is literally dangerous.  So, does he have a problem with such a
high-profile person giving out what he thinks is a dangerous message?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we haven’t even seen the former President speak at
CPAC.  Obviously, President Biden has spoken to his concerns about the
rhetoric of the former President, how he was unfit for office.  That’s
why he ran against him and why he defeated him.  But we’re not going to
spend too much time here focused on or talking about President Trump —
former President Trump.  
   
Q    Okay, one other, if I can, on Afghanistan.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    Given the concerns about the timeline of this withdrawal — and it
all looks rather up in the air now — is the President worried — in the
longer-term, bigger picture, is he worried that the Taliban are going to
take over Afghanistan once the U.S. pulls out?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, obviously there’s a timeline for a decision on the
next steps here.  I don’t have any update on that.  And once that’s
made, we can certainly have that conversation.  
   
Q    Would he be okay with that — if the Taliban ruled Afghanistan?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly, I wouldn’t say he’s — no, I don’t think he would
say he’d be okay with that.  But again, there’s an ongoing process of
considering the next steps in Afghanistan. That’s an ongoing discussion,
and I’m not going to get ahead of where that sits at this point in
time.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yes.  Two questions, if I may.  The first, we’re approaching tax
season, and by some estimates, of the unemployment assistance that
states have paid out, more than half of it, Americans have not withheld
taxes on.  So is the administration concerned that there may be millions
of Americans who are going to face a surprise tax bill, some of whom are
still unemployed?  And has the administration considered changing the
way the IRS looks at, at least, the pandemic-related unemployment
assistance, treat it like disaster aid and so it doesn’t have taxes
withheld?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s a really interesting question.  I would certainly
send you to the Treasury Department for that.  I’m happy to help you
make a connection there to discuss that further.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, the other question is, does the administration
have a response to the raid in the Republic of Georgia where the top
opposition leader was arrested by government forces yesterday?  Is there
any consideration of sanctions or other kind of pressure on the
government of Georgia?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, I certainly saw the reports this morning.  I didn’t
have a chance to talk to our national security team, but we’ll venture
to get you something after the briefing on that as well.  
   
I didn’t help you much today.  I will try to do that after the
briefing.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  A few points, but I just want to pick up on what
Sebastian was asking about former President Trump first.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    It sounds like you just plan to ignore him and essentially try to
deprive his message of oxygen.  But do you plan, or does the White House
plan, rather, to engage with him in any way, particularly if he launches
political attacks on this administration and its policies?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In what way engage with him?  
   
Q    I mean push back in any way on those.  I mean, again, as you say,
you can’t know what former President Trump will say during CPAC, but
it’s pretty likely he’ll have some things to say about the sitting — the
sitting President and this administration.  So do you plan to engage
with him on those things or just ignore him?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I guess we’ll have to watch and see.  But our overarching
objective is to keep the focus not on any one individual, whether it’s
the current President or the former President, but on the American
people and what we’re doing to help bring them relief, to get the
pandemic under control.  And certainly there’s been more than enough
time spent on former President Trump.  And so if there’s not a reason to
do it, we’re probably not going to be adding more commentary on it.  
   
Q    Okay.  And on the topic of immigration, the Biden administration is
also reopening a detention center in Florida, formerly known as the
Homestead Detention Facility.  The administration plans to house migrant
teens in that facility. Will that also be a temporary emergency center
like the one you were discussing before?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to talk to the Department of Homeland Security
about that.  I would certainly send you to them to talk to them more
specifically and directly about it.  
   
Q    It was also privately run before, which is part of the question
here — is if whether or not the Biden administration plans to have that
privately managed again, given the pledge by the President to close down
privately run detention facilities.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  I know you’ve asked this question before, and I
would be happy to connect you with someone from the Department of
Homeland Security.  They obviously oversee those facilities, so they’re
best prepared to answer any questions on it.  
   
Q    Could I ask one more on Florida?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    We’re on Florida.  Let’s just stay on Florida (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s okay.  A big Florida day.   
   
Q    All right.  So there are reports that President Biden  
is considering former Florida Senator Bill Nelson to be his NASA
Administrator.  Are those reports accurate?  Is he under consideration? 
And when do you expect an announcement?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any personnel announcements for you or any
expectation of when we will have an announcement on a NASA Administrator
or a list of atten- — a list of potential people.  But that’s an
interesting — interesting one.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  A couple questions.  One for another colleague who
couldn’t be here today.  But I wanted to start with one more on the
Neera Tanden nomination.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Does the administration believe there is a double standard at play
here that Republicans and perhaps some Democrats are pointing to her
partisan tweets, offensive tweets, as a reason to oppose her nomination,
and that they have not held certain men to the same standard?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President was proud to nominate a historic set of
nominees who not only were — many of them were barrier breaking,
including Neera Tanden, but also incredibly qualified and experienced. 
And he certainly believes that members of the Senate are going to
consider them and should — will continue to consider them with the best
of intention.   
   
So, from here, we’re going to keep our eyes focused on outreach to
Democrats and Republicans and working toward getting Neera Tanden
confirmed so we can get the budget process moving.  
   
Q    Okay.  Another one from a colleague regarding Postmaster General
DeJoy and his appearance before the House Oversight Committee tomorrow
and some proposed changes that he has put forth that some people are
concerned will slow down mail further, raise the cost of mail, do away
with airmail.  The question is: Is there any indication of when
President Biden will appoint members to the three vacancies of the Board
of Governors for the Postal Service?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  It’s a great question.  It is a priority for the
President to appoint — to announce the appointment of, I should say,
additional members of the Board of Governors.  As you are familiar with,
but others may not be, it’s really up to the Board of Governors to
determine the future leadership of the Postal Service, and we certainly
recognize that filling those vacancies is an important step in that
process.  So, it’s a priority.  I don’t have a timeline for you on when
those will be announced though.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  About the — again, the bilat between the Prime
Minister and the President — the expression used is “a roadmap for
renewing Canada-U.S. relationship.”  From the White House and the
President standpoints, how did the relationship needed mending?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  How did it need mending?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think that the objective for the President is to
look forward and to take — you know, continue to build the relationship
with Prime Minister Trudeau — obviously who he knew previously from when
— or had engaged with previously from when he was Vice President — and
to work together on addressing many of the shared crises we’re facing,
from economic downturn, to COVID-19, to issues in the global
community.   
   
And I don’t know that they’re going to provide a lot of — spend a lot of
time analyzing the past. They’re going to look to the future.  
   
Q    Still, does the President feel that the relationship was in bad
shape when he got into the White House?  
   
QMS. PSAKI:  The President views his role as — in the global community
as one who needs to rebuild relationships, rebuild trust with a range of
partners, including the Canadians, and that’s why this meeting today
will be forward looking and focused on a range of topics.  
   
Q    Trust that was damaged in the last four years?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ll leave that to the Prime Minister to speak to,
but certainly we’re eager to continue to build the relationship moving
forward.  
   
Q    And another question, Jen.  Thank you.  My other question is —
we’re talking a lot about the economic relationship and restarting the
North American economy.  Would the reopening of the border be discussed
(inaudible)?  Because this is a major point, like, stopping, blocking
the economies from working —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The Canadian border?  
   
Q    Yes.  Canadian-U.S. border being closed for a year now.  Do you
know if it’s going to be discussed and if we can see an end to this in a
short run?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Related to COVID-19, or related to —  
   
Q    Well — so, in the “roadmap” is this discussion of restarting the
North American economy.  We have the COVID crisis at the moment, but the
closing of the border, and per the possibility of improving the
economies between the two countries and the North American economy at
large, do you think they’ll be discussing the reopening of the border
faster than not?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sure there’ll be a range of topics discussed, and
obviously they’ll both bring up issues.  I can only speak to what
President Biden will bring up, and we’ll have a readout after the
meeting.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I have a couple on COVID, but first I’d like to
follow up on the homeownership question from the top.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
So, the President’s economic plan from the campaign trail had a
provision in there for the $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit. 
Q    Can we expect the President to push for that in not the American
Rescue Plan, but the recovery plan that’s said to come shortly
afterwards?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, our focus right now is on getting the American Rescue
Plan through.  We expect the House to pass it this weekend, and then it
will go to the Senate.  And as we’ve been talking about a little bit
here, there’ll be a robust discussion about members’ views on different
components of it.  I don’t expect we’re going to preview or make — even
make necessarily final decisions on what comes after.  
   
But as you noted, there are a number of components of the Build Back
Better agenda that the President talked about on the campaign trail. 
Obviously, homeownership, caregiving, infrastructure, strengthening
access to affordable healthcare — those are all components that are
under discussion.  The order, the size, the timeline — that’s what has
not been determined at this point.  
   
Q    And then, on COVID, Jake Sullivan has been expressing some concerns
about the World Health Organization’s latest assessment, specifically
because China has not really handed over any of its data from the early
months.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    So when can we see some traction on a U.S.-led assessment, like
Sullivan has been suggesting, or perhaps some — some details on how we
can force the world community to exert pressure on China to open up its
doors and be transparent?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, you’re right that one of the concerns that we have
expressed from here is a lack of data sharing.  We’ve not seen the
initial data or the base of data that the report has been based on.  And
we have concerns and questions about the process … and we have concerns
and questions about the process used to reach the final conclusions.  
   
What we’ve been calling for and will continue to advocate for is an
open, transparent international organization, led by the World — I
should say investigation — led by the World Health Organization.  
   
And certainly getting to the bottom of what happened here, preventing it
from happening in the future, is a topic of conversation in a range of
conversations the President has, the Secretary of State, our National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has, and I expect those will continue.  
   
Q    And then, on that same report, former Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo and Matt Pottinger from NSC have both come out and said they
still believe that coronavirus somehow originated from a research
facility in Wuhan.  Do you know if President Biden has made a
determination on whether or not gain-of-function research facilities,
like the Wuhan Institute of Virology, should be eligible for U.S.
funding?  They currently are, even though they’re not slated to receive
any money in the near future.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, there will be — we support a robust, international
investigation.  We also have taken steps under the State Department to
ensure we have full staffing in our Beijing embassy to ensure we have
eyes and ears on the ground.  
   
As you noted, there’s no funding anticipated or planned to go to that
facility at this point in time.  So I don’t have any additional updates
beyond that.   
   
Q    Last —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, go ahead.  
   
Q    Last one, sorry, on coronavirus.  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Okay.  
   
Q    Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky has suggested that people will
need a yearly coronavirus vaccine booster.  Do you know if Dr. Fauci or
any of the medical experts agree with that assessment?   
   
And then, if that’s the case, would the government shift the purchasing
responsibility to American citizens after this first round this summer? 
Is there a timeline on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the FDA has talked about research and work they’re
doing on boosters.  And some of that comes — is related to variants and
addressing variants and needs they may have in the future.  But in terms
of what is next, I think we’re focused now on first getting 300 million
Americans vaccinated.  And then, any guidelines on whether a booster
will be needed — the timeline of it — we would certainly defer to health
and medical experts.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen, and thank you for taking so many questions.  I’d
like to quickly hit on three points.  Yesterday, the White House
publicly confirmed that President Biden had mandated that he have full
visibility on potential drone strikes overseas.  This sounds like a
potential — or it sounds like resumption of the Obama-era so-called
“kill list” policy.  I was hoping that you could tell us what President
Biden sees as his guiding principles on deciding whether to allow a
strike or not.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think I have anything more for you on that from the
podium.  
   
Q    And a question on New York.  I’d like to confirm that President
Biden intends to pick his own four appointees for U.S. Attorneys offices
— that he intends to do all four of them and not leave off the Southern
District.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That he intends to nominate?  
   
Q    Nominate his own people for each of the four U.S. Attorney slots in
New York.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything in — to — for you either on kind of
upcoming personnel announcements.  Obviously, there was an announcement
made just last week or the week before about U.S. Attorneys, and that
went through a normal process.  But I can certainly talk to our
personnel team and see if there’s more on that front.  
   
Q    Great.  And another one — the focus — or one of the focuses on the
Hill today is on the Capitol riot, and I wanted to follow up on that. 
There’s been some talk about the potential need for greater surveillance
of domestic threats.   After 9/11, of course, the government secretly
reinterpreted the Patriot Act as allowing the dragnet collection of our
phone records.  Is the Biden administration committed to not secretly
reinterpreting laws to expand domestic surveillance?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think the President has spoken to this in the past,
including when he was Vice President.  Our focus right now is on, of
course, supporting the hearings that are happening on the Hill.  And we
will remain engaged with members of Congress about how we can work
together to address gaps and to prevent it from happening in the
future.   
   
We also have a process that’s underway and a review from our national
security team on domestic violent extremism.  And when that process has
concluded, I’m sure there will be recommendations made on policies that
should be put into place.  
   
Q    And the administration has emphasized transparency.  There would be
transparency on any additional surveillance of domestic threats?  That
would not be secretly interpreted?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think that’s fair to say.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Jen, thanks so much.  I have a couple of questions. The first is:
Over the last few months, we’ve seen reports that say that people
outside of black and Hispanic and vulnerable communities have been able
to access the vaccines in those communities.  In California, there are
wealthy residents who are using access codes.  In New York, we’re seeing
that happen.  What’s the White House’s plan for stopping this, and why
is it still happening?  This has now been happening at least over two
months.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You’re right. I’ve seen those reports as well.  And I think
one of the reports I saw was around some of the mass vaccination sites
in Oakland and the concerns about whether people in the community were
actually getting access to the vaccines as planned.  
   
I don’t have specific data and numbers.  And I can certainly talk to the
COVID team, or you can, of course, ask them during one of their three
briefings about the actual data behind it — beyond the anecdotal
stories, which alone are certainly concerning.  
   
But one of the pieces the President has been talking about and our team
has been focused on is the fact that if you don’t have internet access —
right? — if you don’t have, you know, access to ways to easily sign up
to get your vaccine — we need to continue to look for ways to get deep
into communities.  That’s one of the reasons that the President has been
so supportive of community health centers that are embedded in
communities, know the people in the communities, can make phone calls
and do outreach to people they know will need the vaccine.  
   
But we also need to continue to find ways to reach people who don’t have
Internet access, who may not have the — you know, the ability to sign up
in a way that others are and address some of those discrepancies.   
   
So it continues to be a big focus.  And, as you know, we have, you know,
an entire task force focusing on addressing inequities in how we address
COVID, and they’re continuing to look for more ways to creatively do
that and effectively address problems that are arising as we see them.  
   
Q    Just to clarify: On that point, there’s a team that’s working
specifically on trying to stop wealthy residents or we- — or people from
those communities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   No, I think what I was conveying is, as you know, there is
an equity task force that’s a part of the COVID team, led by Dr.
Marcella Nunez-Smith.  And obviously, reports that individuals who are
not from the communities intended to, you know, be the primary
recipients of the vaccines, if — you know, that is, you know, certainly
something they would focus on and work on issues to address.  I would
encourage you to ask them about that at the next COVID briefing
though.  
   
Q    And then a couple of other questions.  The first is: You stopped
short of saying that the President — that President Biden would sign
H.R.40, the bill to study reparations.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    I’m just wondering, now that it’s been a few days after the
hearing, whether or not there’s any update on that, given that the
President has said that he would back a study on reparations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So he would certainly would back a study.  I don’t think
anything’s changed, though, from what I conveyed a couple of days
ago.   
   
Q    But you stopped short of saying he would sign the bill.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I said he would support a study, and he certainly would. 
And we’ll take a look if there’s legislation that is passed by
Congress.  
   
Q    And then, at the joint hearing today at the — on the House, on the
attack on the Capitol, there was an officer, Captain Mendoza, who said
she still has chemical burns on her face and hasn’t fully healed from
that attack.  I wonder if the White House is considering any sort of
effort or any sort of fund or any sort of help to officers and others
who are still recovering from their injuries.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, that’s certainly something we’d be happy to have a
discussion with members of Congress on.  And I know they have also
expressed gratitude, as has the President, for the work of the members
of the Capitol Police and the sacrifices, of course, some made, but also
those who have been injured in the events of January 6th.  And we’re
certainly open to having that conversation.  
   
Q    And then one more on sexual assault.  And the Pentagon says, this
week, they’ll announce the naming of a commission on sexual assault in
the military.  Senator Gillibrand and others have wrote — written to the
President, saying that this needs to be an independent commission that’s
outside of the DOD.  I’m wondering if the President is planning on
appointing anyone to that commission, if he’s been briefed on this
issue, and if that thought of it being set up outside of the Defense
Department is top of mind.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s certainly an issue that he has thought about, talked
about, engaged with policy experts internally on, and — including with
Secretary Austin — I know, during the transition and probably since
then.  But I don’t have anything more for you on, kind of, the format of
it.  I think right now it’s under the purview of the Department of
Defense, hence why they discussed the issue.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, everyone.  
   
12:54 P.M. EST
