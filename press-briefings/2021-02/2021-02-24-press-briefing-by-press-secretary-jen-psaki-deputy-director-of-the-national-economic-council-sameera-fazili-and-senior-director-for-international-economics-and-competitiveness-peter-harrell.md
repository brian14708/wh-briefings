James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:37 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Well, we are very excited
that later today the President will sign an executive order that takes a
whole-of-government approach to securing critical U.S. supply chains,
ensuring we can withstand crises and create good-paying jobs in the
process.  
   
The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need for resilient supply
chains and robust domestic manufacturing so all Americans have access to
essential goods and services in times of crisis.  
   
The EO will direct immediate 100-day reviews of supply chains for
critical products that go into everything from phones to
pharmaceuticals.  It will also direct reviews of industrial-based
sectors, including defense, public health and biological preparedness,
information and communications technology, transportation, energy, and
food production.  This is an issue with strong bipartisan support.  
   
And later this afternoon, the President will meet with a bipartisan
group of House and Senate members to discuss supply chain resilience and
the need to work together in strengthening it.  We’ll provide you all a
list of that later this afternoon as it’s finalized.  
   
Joining us today to talk through the details of the executive order are
Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Sameera Fazili — I may
have butchered your last name, as mine is butchered sometimes; I’ll keep
working on it — and Senior Director of International Economics and
Competitiveness at the NSC Peter Harrell.  Thank you for joining us.  
   
And they will take — we’ll see if we have time to take a couple
questions.  They have good reason — they have to go see the President
shortly.  
   
Okay.  
   
MR. HARRELL:  Thank you very much, Jen, and thanks to all of you.  It’s
a privilege for me to be here.  As Jen said, this afternoon, the
President will sign an executive order that takes a critical step in
ensuring that America’s supply chains can withstand any crisis, as well
as supporting jobs across the country.  
   
Last year, in the early months of the pandemic, frontline healthcare
workers couldn’t find the masks, gloves, and PPE that they needed to
keep themselves safe as they treated COVID-19 patients.  
   
Today, automakers across the country are having to take workers off
factory lines because they can’t get access to enough computer chips to
maintain full production.   
   
Last July, President Biden committed that, as President, he would direct
his administration to take a comprehensive approach to securing
America’s supply chains.  He said then, and he will reiterate later
today, that America should never face shortages of critical products in
times of crisis.  Our supply chain should not be vulnerable to
manipulation by competitor nations.  
   
The EO that the President will sign later today formally launches the
initiative President Biden committed to last year to build strong and
resilient supply chains.   
   
This is the first whole-of-government approach to promoting the
resilience of America’s supply chains, from pharmaceuticals to foods. 
We’re going to get out of the business of reacting to supply chain
crises as they arise and get into the business of preventing future
supply chain problems.  
   
As Jen said, the EO the President will sign will direct immediate
100-day reviews of supply chains for four critical products: computer
chips for everything from cars to phones; large-capacity batteries, such
as those used in electric cards \[sic\] — cars, so that America leads in
making next-generation electric vehicles; pharmaceuticals and active
pharmaceutical ingredients — the key ingredients to American medicines;
and critical minerals and strategic materials, such as rare earth
minerals that are essential to American industry and to America’s
defense base.  
   
The EO will also direct six sector-specific reviews — to be completed
within one year of today — to be focused on defense, public health and
biological preparedness, information and communications technology,
transportation, energy, and food production.  These sectoral reviews
will be modeled after the process that the Defense Department uses to
regularly evaluate and strengthen America’s defense industrial base.  
   
Make no mistake: We are not simply planning to order up reports.  We are
going to be taking actions to close gaps as we identify them, just as we
have been working with industry in recent weeks to ensure that U.S.
automobile manufacturers have the parts they need to keep making cars
here in America.  
   
But we expect that by taking this type of comprehensive approach to
supply chain resilience, we’ll be able to strengthen our supply chains
for the long term.  
   
And with that, I’m happy to turn this over to my friend and colleague,
Sameera.  
   
MS. FAZILI:  Thank you, Peter.  Creating more resilient supply chains is
an opportunity for our country to come together to create well-paying
jobs for workers across our country.  That is why today’s action
reinforces the President’s overarching commitment to help our country
build back better.  
   
We know that even before the COVID crisis, the economy was not working
for most Americans.  Worker pay was too low.  Many families could not
make ends meet.  Many of the jobs that served as the heart of the middle
class had been lost due to changes in both technology and the structure
of the global economy.  
   
Disruption is inevitable.  But over the past few years, we have moved
from crisis to crisis when some essential product was suddenly in short
supply.  What we need is the capacity to respond quickly when hit by a
challenge.  This executive order moves the whole government towards
being more prepared.   
   
These sector-specific reviews that the President orders today, we’re
going to be asking agencies to do the following: They’re going to review
risks in supply chains and in our domestic industrial base.  They’re
going to think broadly about risk.  There’s climate risk and
geopolitical risk, but there’s also risk in not having enough workers
ready to meet the needs of that sector, or enough factories or the right
equipment to make a good — or retool a shift — to shift to a new spike
in demand for an essential good.  
   
They’re going to be recommending actions to improve resiliency.  In some
instances, that action might be the data that government can publish so
the public sector can plan and mobilize and take action.  But in other
instances, we have levers, like procurement authority, that we can use
to support stockpiling or support some level of domestic production.  
   
We are also going to be looking for opportunities to work with Congress
to give us more tools so that we can improve our preparedness.  And
today’s conversation with members of Congress is going to be part of an
ongoing conversation we’ve been having with them on this.  
   
Finally, a big part of this executive order is consultation with
stakeholders and experts.  We are going to be reaching out to talk to
the American people.  Government action alone will not solve complex
supply chain challenges.  This is going to be broad engagement, broad
conversations that will include business, labor, local communities,
academia.  This work is going to require a new commitment to
public-private partnerships, and we need all voices at that table to
help us design those partnerships.  
   
This is a real opportunity to invest in the future of America and build
on our nation’s strengths.  There are opportunities for small-business
development to help diversify supplier networks and alleviate the risk
of “too big to fail” companies in the supply chains for critical
goods.   
   
There are opportunities to improve worker readiness and training so they
have the skills needed to ramp up research, production, or distribution
of a critical good.   
   
And there are opportunities to bring more jobs to communities around the
country, including communities of color, to leverage the ingenuity and
grit of the American people.  
   
This is going to leverage U.S. scientific leadership.  It’s going to
further advance our research and development prowess.  It will do so
while also recognizing that our ability to maintain our innovative edge
in research requires us to invest in both research and manufacturing in
communities across America.  Because when you pair thinkers and doers,
that’s how you create the technologies and products that help us tackle
tomorrow’s challenges.  
   
I want to reiterate what my colleagues have said: This work is not going
to be about America going it alone.  The answer to these weaknesses is
not always to be to ramp up domestic production.  We know these
vulnerabilities affect not just American households; it’s a global
problem in some of these supply chains.  
   
We are committed to working with partners and allies to reduce these
vulnerabilities that are affecting all of us.  
   
The work ahead builds upon America’s historic legacy of making strategic
investments in our future that lay the foundation for broad-based
economic growth.   
   
Smart investments in research, manufacturing, domestic capacity, and our
workforce has, in the past, unleashed decades of economic expansion, and
an expansion that raised wages and living standards for American
families across the country.  
   
We can and should build upon that legacy, and that is how we will
approach the supply chain work.  This problem was decades in the
making.  We can solve it by making smart investments that are long term
in nature, that will reach families and workers in all of America.   
   
Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Let’s see if we can take questions.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Presidents, for decades, have been promising to
create factory jobs.  We’ve got about 12.2 million factory jobs; that’s
down from 17 million in 2000.  How many jobs do you think this
initiative can create?  And what are your metrics of success?  
   
MS. FAZILI:  Yeah.  I’m happy to take that.  I think we think it’s
important to have a broad lens and broad view on how you measure the
jobs and the job creation in the manufacturing space, because
manufacturing is not — doesn’t just support and create jobs in the
manufacturing sector.  There are broad spillover effects that it has.  
   
There are going to be R&D jobs here, research jobs here.  There’s going
to be jobs in the, kind of, supplier networks, in the services
industry.  So I think it’s — we have to start tracking and understanding
that manufacturing’s contributions to our economy can’t just be narrowly
counted in that way.  That’s what I would suggest.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Jennifer.  
   
Q    When you talk about incentivizing and funding, on the budget that
you’re — your upcoming budget, do you think that you will propose some
sort of federal funding to help increase the supply of semiconductors?  
   
MS. FAZILI:  You know, we are still in the process of formulating the
budget, so at this time, I’m not able to talk in specifics about the
budget proposal.  But what I would say is we are looking forward to
talking with members of Congress about what more we can do in
partnership with them to give us the funds we need.  
   
MR. HARRELL:  Can I add on that?  I’d just like to step back for — you
know, for a moment.  Obviously, we’re talking about multiple different
supply chains here.  And I think that the solutions we will be proposing
and implementing will vary a little bit by supply chain.   
   
You know, the supply chain for semiconductors obviously looks quite
different from the supply chain for rare earths.  So I think what you’re
going to see is us come forward with a comprehensive suite of
recommendations that will be tailored for each of the different critical
goods that we are looking at.   
   
In general, across the board, we’re expecting we’ll be using a mix of
incentives to encourage production here.  We’re looking at ways to
ensure there’s surge capacity available for things that might need to be
ramped up quickly — stockpiling; working with our allies and partners to
make sure that we have, you know, cross-border open flows with our
allies and partners, where we might collectively need take some
action.  
   
So I think we’re really going to be looking at a range of different
tools here, not just any particular single tool.   
   
Q    The Defense Production Act, is there — would you think that the
White House would consider using the Defense Production Act for —
specifically for the semiconductors?  
   
MR. HARRELL:  You know, I don’t think we’re here to talk about how we
would use the DPA on any particular supply chain at this point.  But
clearly, as we look at making resilient supply chains across the board,
all tools are on the table for this administration.  
   
Q    And then, on Taiwan, can you say how has Taiwan reacted to some of
your requests for assistance on this?  Have they been receptive to your
pleas for help on boosting the supplies of the chips?  
   
MR. HARRELL:  I don’t want to get into the nuances of specific
diplomatic conversations we have had.  Clearly, Taiwan is an important
partner of the United States, and we’ve had constructive conversations
with them.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sorry, we have to let them go.  But I know there’s a lot
of interest in this.  And what — we can do follow-up questions
afterwards as well.  
   
But thank you both so much for joining us at the briefing, and you’re
welcome back anytime.  
   
MS. FAZILI:  Thank you.  
   
MR. HARRELL:  Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, I just have a couple of additional items at the top.  
   
As you heard in our COVID public health briefing just a few minutes ago,
starting next month, we will begin to deliver millions of masks to food
banks and community health centers around the country.  These are two
nationwide networks that disproportionately serve hard-hit
populations.   
   
Today, many low-income Americans still lack access to this basic
protection.  That’s why we’re think — taking this thoughtful and
targeted action to keep Americans safe.  We will deliver more than 25
million masks across the country.  These masks will be available at
homes — oh, I’m sorry — at more than 1,300 community health centers and
around 60,000 food pantries.  Any American who needs a mask will be able
to walk into these health centers or food pantries and pick up a
high-quality American-made mask that is consistent with CDC guidance.  
   
This program is made possible through existing funding at HHS.  And with
this action, we are hoping to level the playing field, giving vulnerable
populations quality, well-fitting masks.  
   
A couple other things.  I know, lots going on today.   
   
I wanted to make sure you saw a letter released this morning by over 160
CEOs representing some of America’s biggest and most representative
company — respected companies calling on Congress to act on the
President’s Rescue Plan.   
   
There is growing consensus across the country for this package, and
that’s reflected in polling showing a bipartisan majority of Americans
back it.  As the more than 160 business leaders put in this — their
letter to congressional leaders, previous federal relief measures have
been essential, but more must be done to put the country on a trajectory
for a strong and durable recovery.  
   
Also, a winter storm update: Temperatures are back within normal ranges
for this time of year across the states that have been impacted by the
storm — that’s, of course, good news — but water system outages and boil
water advisories, although improving, remain an ongoing issue across the
region, requiring additional federal support.   
   
Delayed shipments of COVID-19 vaccine doses are anticipated to be filled
in the coming days, as we noted last week, and vaccination sites have
reopened and are doubling up appointments to accommodate those canceled
last week.  All major airports are open.  All rail carriers have
returned to normal operations.  Interstate and state highways are open. 
Transit agencies are returning to normal operations.  And ports are
operating under normal circumstances.   
   
Federal assistance continues.  We noted the additional 31 counties
yesterday, and of course, we’ll continue to consider additional requests
moving forward.  
   
Finally, to remain transparent with you and the American people, we
wanted to share that the President tested negative for COVID-19 on
Monday.  We will venture to provide this update the following day in the
future.  But this is part of our regular COVID safety protocols that I
mentioned a couple of weeks ago.  The entire White House complex, as you
know, continues to adhere to strict mask wearing, social distancing, and
other mitigation strategies.  
   
Okay, sorry.  A few things at the top.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On the masks, any sense of why the White House is
using cloth masks instead of N95s, which are also made in America, if we
have supplies?  And do you have a list of manufacturers of the masks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, I would say that these masks are all — adhere
to CDC guidelines, and certainly they meet those requirements set by our
federal standard.   
   
Tell me your second question again.  
   
Q    A list of the manufacturers of the masks.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have a list of those.  I can see if there’s more
details we can provide.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then, separately, Vladimir Putin said today that Russia
is going to redouble its efforts on opposing foreign powers, who he says
are basically trying to undermine Russia.  Does the White House believe
that tensions with Russia are increasing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we believe that, certainly, over the last several
years, there have been more concerning steps that have been taken by
Vladimir Putin and by members of the Kremlin, as the President has
expressed and expressed during the campaign.   
   
And that is why he asked his national security team to launch a process
of looking into not only hacking — reports of hacking around the 2020
Election, but also the bounties on our troops that was of concern; of
course, the SolarWinds hack; and to take a close look at that so we have
our own assessment.   
   
As you know, the President also spoke with President Putin just maybe
two weeks ago, and did not hold back in expressing his concerns about
the actions of his government.  But we are letting that process see
itself through.  As I noted yesterday, it will be weeks, not months,
before it’s concluded and we have more details about a response.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  So, I just wanted to see if you could confirm that the
President is speaking with King Salman of Saudi Arabia today, and if
he’ll do that in advance of the report on Khashoggi.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as we’ve noted in the past, we remain committed to
releasing — through the DNI, of course — an unclassified report that we
expect to happen soon.  I don’t have an updated timeline for you on
that.  I know there were also reports on a proposed call.  We also
expect that to happen soon.  We’re still in the process of scheduling
when will happen.  
   
Q    And what are they going to be talking about in that call?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, when we have the call and the President has the call,
I’m sure we’ll do a readout of it.  Of course, we’ve had engagements at
many levels with the Saudis to date, but we’ll do a readout once we
conclude the call.  
   
Q    And do you have a status update on Neera Tanden, with all of the
delays on Capitol Hill, as far as her confirmation?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Tell me more about what you mean by that.   
   
Q    An update as far as whether you’re going to withdraw that name.  It
doesn’t seem like the votes are there for her at this point.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first state that, as the President repeated
yesterday, we’re fighting for the nomination, and she and our team
remain in close contact and — close touch with senators and key
constituency groups.  She is an expert whose qualifications are critical
during this time of an unprecedented crisis.  And she has rolled up her
sleeves.  She’s very engaged and doing outreach to senators, to members
on the Hill — answering any questions they have and offering to do
that.  And we’re doing the same.   
   
I know there was an announcement about a delay of a confirmation vote
today.  And they put out a statement to make clear that, of course,
they’re going to do due diligence, as are we, to continue that outreach
and continue to fight for her nomination.   
   
Q    Follow, Jen?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Jen, thank you.  How big of a setback does the White House view the
fact that the Senate committees have delayed the vote on her
confirmation to be?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, they put out the statement from the leadership
of the committee conveying clearly that they wanted to continue to do
work to build support for her nomination.  
   
Q    But does the White House see this as a setback to Neera Tanden’s
confirmation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn’t put it in those terms.  I think we are committed
to continuing to fight for all of our nominees, continuing to do the
outreach needed, to answer questions, to address concerns anyone has, to
reiterate the qualifications of all the nominees that the President has
put forward, and to do due diligence in fighting for the team he’s
nominated.  
   
Q    Even if she is confirmed, does it undercut the President’s budget
agenda to have this confirmation delayed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as I noted a couple of times here, but it’s worth
repeating: Neera Tanden has a record of working with people who disagree
with her, working with people who — who have different viewpoints and
different objectives and priorities.  And that’s something she would
certainly take into the job if she’s confirmed.  
   
Q    And just one more, Jen.  Richard Shelby has said he would support
the confirmation of Shalanda Young.  What is your reaction to that?  Is
she a potential replacement should Neera Tanden not follow through?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, there’s one nominee to lead the budget department; her
name is Neera Tanden, and that’s who we’re continuing to fight for.  
   
Q    Are there discussions about Shalanda Young?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are — we are focused on fighting for the person the
President has nominated.   
   
Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q    On Neera Tanden, one more follow-up on that.  Has she offered to
withdraw her nomination yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are working in close touch with Neera, and — with Neera
Tanden and with members of Congress on continuing to do the outreach and
engagement to fight for her confirmation.  That’s where our focus is.   
   
Q    But no “yes or no,” whether she’s offered to withdraw?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s not the stage we’re in, Kaitlan.  We’re — the stage
we’re in is working to continue to fight for her nomination.  And as you
know, it’s a numbers game.  Right?  It’s a matter of getting one
Republican to support her nomination.  We’re continuing to do that
outreach, answer questions they have, and continue to reiterate her
qualifications.  
   
Q    And on the call with King Salman that’s expected to happen — you
said you’re still working on scheduling it — does President Biden want
the Saudi Crown Prince to be on that call?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President’s intention, as is the intention of this
government, is to — to recalibrate our engagement with Saudi Arabia and
to have counterparts communicate with counterparts.  And Prince- — he
communicated — Prince Salman communicated with the Secretary of Defense;
that’s the appropriate line of communication.  And the President will
speak with the King at the appropriate time.  It will be soon.  And as
soon as we have an update on that being finalized and, of course, when
it happens, we’ll provide you all with a readout.  
   
Q    I know that, again, they’ll be speaking, but will he — is he okay
if he’s on the call?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would anticipate the call being directly with the King — a
one-on-one call.  Or a call, of course, you know, as — you know, those
would be the primary participants.  
   
Q    Okay.  And my last question is on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as
it’s moving toward authorization.  It looks like Jeff Zients, the
coordinator, said today they believe they’re going to have between 3 and
4 million to ship, pending authorization.  That was initially supposed
to be much higher, according to the contract that they — that Johnson &
Johnson signed with the federal government: closer to 10 million, I
believe, in February.  So is President Biden disappointed that Johnson &
Johnson is not going to have closer to 10 million vaccines ready to go
if and when they get authorization?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Kaitlan, we were — we were surprised to learn that
Johnson & Johnson was behind on their manufacturing.  As you noted, it
was kind of reported earlier to be about 10 million, and now it’s more
like 3 to 4 million doses that they would be ready to ship next week, if
they are moved through the FDA process, which has not yet concluded —
just to note.  And we are going to continue to work with them on
ensuring that that can be expedited, so if they’re — if the Johnson &
Johnson vaccine is approved.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I want to follow up on what you just said about recalibration with
the Saudis.  Is that the extent of the recalibration, just having the
President deal directly with King Salman?  You say that MBS has been
engaging with his counterpart at the Defense Department.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    If the U.S. government believes that Mohammed bin Salman was behind
or in some way related to the death of Jamal Khashoggi, how can this
administration continue to deal with him?  And in what way do you intend
to?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we’ll wait for the unclassified report to be
released, which will be released through the DNI.  And while I don’t
have an update on that, I expect that will be soon — to speak
further.   
   
And, of course, as I — when I talked about recalibration, I was
referring to, of course, the counterpart to counterpart, because that
was, kind of, how the question was posed.  But, you know, we always look
— the President is taking a fresh approach to how he engages with
foreign leaders around the world, and different from the prior
administration.  And that means he will not hold back, and he will speak
out when there are concerns he has about human rights abuses, about the
lack of freedom of speech or the lack of freedom of media and
expression, or any concerns he has.   
   
At the same time, we have a long relationship with Saudi Arabia.  They
are being attacked in the region.  And that is certainly an area where
we continue to work with them on.   
   
But I suspect we’ll have more to say when we get — post the release of
that report.  
   
Q    On an unrelated question, what is this President’s view toward the
loyalty that teachers union should have towards students?  Teachers —
this President is a strong supporter of unions — public sector unions. 
Is a teachers union’s obligation to the workers and their concerns about
safety, or is the teachers union obligation also to students?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I can’t speak to the obligations or the — I’m not a
spokesperson for the teachers union; I’m a spokesperson for the
President of the United States.  So I can convey to you that his
commitment is to the students and to the teachers and to the parents who
want to have their kids back in school, and he wants to do that safely. 
And that’s what his focus is on, and that’s the role he can play from
the federal government.  
   
Go ahead, David.  
   
Q    Jen, just back on the Saudi issue.  I understand that until you’ve
had the conversation, you’re not going to talk much about the policy
implications.  The President did have some things to say during the
campaign.  He said, “We were, in fact, going to make them pay a price
and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are.”  And later he said,
“There was \[is\] little social redeeming value in the present
government in Saudi Arabia.”  Any reason to believe his view — his
overall view of the Saudis — Saudi government as a “pariah” and “little
redeeming social value” has changed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President, as you well know, David — because you’ve
probably been covering him for a good chunk of this time — has had a
long time he spent in the world of foreign policy, and he is certainly
familiar with the leadership in Saudi Arabia, as he is in the Middle
East and many parts of the world.  And I would certainly not say his
concerns or his views have changed.  He is, of course, now President of
the United States, and in that role he is not going to hold back, as I
noted, in speaking out when there are concerns.   
   
Of course, he has the right to take action of any kind, as the President
of the United States, but there are also areas where we will work with
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on, including ensuring that they have the
protections they need to face the threats that are facing them.   
   
Q    Well, a little more on this, and following on how you, sort of,
think about this.  We have a pretty good idea of what’s in the
declassified report — or when it comes out — because many elements of it
leaked two years ago when it was first — first came out.  If you come to
the conclusion that there were any senior Saudi officials who were
involved in the Khashoggi murder, would those officials be welcome to
the United States?  Could they conceivably be subject to criminal
prosecution as accessories to a murder and thus not want to enter the
United States?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I certainly understand the line of questioning, and I know
there’s an eagerness for the full report to be released.  I’m not going
to get ahead of the policy process or the release of that report.  And
you’ll have to come back — others will have to come back on the day
after it’s discuss- — released, or the days after, and we can discuss it
further.  
   
Go ahead.  Oh, sorry.  We’ll come back to you next.  I didn’t see your
hand.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  A New York-related question, if I may.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    I know you’ve been asked about whether the President has confidence
in Governor Andrew Cuomo, given all the controversy surrounding the
nursing home issues in New York during the pandemic.  But more broadly,
I’d like to ask if there are any lessons to be learned here, if the
administration believes that — or has, you know, it kicked off any
discussions in terms of what role of the federal government should play
in providing guidance during an outbreak of future infectious disease to
nursing homes and whether there should be some sort of standardized data
collection so that you don’t run into these issues with states providing
different data at different times.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, it’s a — it’s a — I think there are a lot of
lessons learned from what we’ve gone through as a country over the last
year.  And as you know, New York is one of the hardest-hit states in the
country and earliest states hit hard in the country.  It was, kind of,
on the frontlines of that and the challenges that came up.   
   
You know, I will say that our focus at this point in time is on working
with governors from across the country — from red states and blue states
— and working with them to ensure we can take the steps now to increase
vaccines that are being distributed to states, as yesterday we announced
another increase in that to — an over 70 percent increase since the
President took office — to increasing communication, to increasing the
number of vaccination sites that are on the ground.   
   
There’s going to be plenty of time to look back.  There will be many
lessons learned, but right now we are still in the midst of the crisis,
and we need to keep our resources and our focus on saving more lives.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Did the White House — any White House officials reach
out to some of those CEOs who signed the letter?  Was there any
communications ahead of that letter?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the letter was put together by a group from the
outside — or a couple of groups, I should say, from the outside
business.  Ford, I think, was one of them, and there were a couple of
other organizations.  We, of course, engage with business groups and
business leaders all the time, but it was not put together — it was put
together by these outside groups.  
   
Q    And did the White House specifically talk to any of them — any of
the CEOs before they signed the letter to encourage them to sign the
letter?  I know it was put out by other groups, but just wondering.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We didn’t play an organizational role here.  As I understand
it, it was done by these outside groups.  But we, of course, engage with
business leaders all the time, so, you know, I don’t know that I have
more specifics to lay out.  
   
Q    And on Neera Tanden, has the White House specifically talked to
Bernie — Senator Bernie Sanders or Senator Kyrsten Sinema about the
viability?  Have they talked to them today about what’s going to happen
going forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  About the viability of her nomination?  
   
Q    About the nomination, correct.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We have been engaged — I noted yesterday, and I don’t have a
new number update, that Neera Tanden herself had engaged directly with
44 senators.  We’ve also engaged with many more far beyond that —
Democrats and Republicans.  Some of them have been over the last three
days, some of them were before that, some of them have been repeats. 
But we don’t — we’re not going to read out the individual conversations
from here.  Obviously, any senator can speak to our engagement from
their platform if they choose to.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  We spoke yesterday about immigration and this
facility — HHS facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas, for migrant
children.  And you said it is not “kids in cages.”  We’ve seen some
photos now of containers.  Is there a better description?  Is it “kids
in containers,” instead of “kids in cages”?  What is the White House’s
description of this facility?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me — let me give a broader description of what’s
happening here.  We have a number of unaccompanied minors — children —
who are coming into the country without their families.  What we are not
doing — what the last administration did was separate those kids, rip
them from the arms of their parents at the border.  We are not doing
that.  That is immoral, and that is not the approach of this
administration.   
   
These kids — we have a couple of options.  We can send them back home
and do a dangerous journey back.  We are not doing that either; that is
also putting them at risk.  We can quickly transfer them from CBP to
these HHS-run facilities.  That’s one option.  Or we can put them with
families and sponsors without any vetting.  There were some problems
that that process ran into as well.   
   
We’ve chosen the middle option.  And these HHS facilities — this is one
of them you’re referring to — we had to expand and open additional
facilities because there was not enough space in the existing
facilities, and — if we were to abide by COVID protocols.   
   
That’s the process and the step this facility in Texas, which has been
reopened, has been revamped, has been — there are teachers, there is
medical facilities.  And our objective is to move them — move these kids
quickly from there to vetted, sponsored families and to places where
they can safely be.  This is a difficult situation.  It’s a difficult
choice.  That’s the choice we’ve made.  
   
Q    So just one step back from that.  We’ve been talking to people down
at the border who say that, right now, DHS and the Border Patrol are
using the same kind of facilities now that they did during the Trump
administration, and there’s a facility right now — it’s in Donna, Texas,
instead of McAllen, Texas, but it’s tents and chain-link fence around
it.  And so —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A CBP facility before they’re transferred to the HHS
facilities?  Is that what you’re referring to?  
   
Q    Yes.  And the issue would be that, just in the last couple days,
they had hundreds of kids that they were holding for over 72 hours,
which is the legal limit to keep somebody in a temporary facility.  So
I’m just curious: Why is this happening?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let’s be clear though, because I know you want to be
clear with the public —  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — about the differences.  The CBP facilities — which you’re
right: The objective is to move kids, unaccompanied minors, as quickly
as possible, under 72 hours, to these HHS-sponsored facilities, which is
the one where we’ve been referring to in Texas.  They are two different
things.   
   
There has been some — there were some delays last week because of
weather and because some of these facilities to safely move these kids
to did not have power and were not in a place where they could — they
had the capacity to take in these kids and do it safely.  That is not
our objective; that is not our goal.   
   
So some, unfortunately, did stay four days, five days, or longer.  But
the objective is to move them as quickly as possible to the
HHS-sponsored facilities.  
   
Q    Has the White House seen the comment from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
who, speaking about that HHS facility in Carrizo Springs, said, “This is
not okay, never has been okay, never will be okay – no matter the
administration or party”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the difficulty is — I haven’t seen the full
context of the quote or interview —  
   
Q    No, it was a tweet.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  — of the tweet that was — that she shared.  But I would say
the difficulty is what I outlined earlier: We have kids coming across
the border.  It is heartbreaking.  I think we all, as human beings, are
heartbroken — as parents, as mothers, as fathers too.   
   
We only have a couple of choices.  What we are not doing is dividing
these kids and separating them from their parents at the border, which
is what the last administration did and why President Biden — or
then-candidate Biden and then-candidate Harris were outspoken at the
time about these kids being pulled from their parents.   
   
What we are doing is working as quickly as possible to process these
kids into these HHS facilities, which have been revamped, which have
medical and educational services available, so that we can then transfer
them to families.  That’s what our approach is.  
   
Q    And so if there is this big difference, would the administration
support — if they could be done safely because of COVID and with privacy
concerns for the children in mind — would the administration support
letting reporters in and press in to see what the difference is?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think you’d have to talk to the Department of Homeland
Security about that.  They are obviously safety protocols about that,
privacy concerns, but I certainly encourage you to reach out about
that.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Totally different Texas questions.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    About the President’s visit on Friday.  So the President’s
infrastructure plan includes a promise to, quote, “modernize \[the\]
nation’s electric grid, making it smarter and more resilient.”  Can that
be done without federal oversight of the Texas grid, which we all got a
reminder is not under federal oversight?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You’re right.  And some parts of Texas are on the — are on
the federal grid.  As you well know, as somebody who knows a lot about
Texas.   
   
Look, I think there’s going to be a lot of time in the future to have a
discussion and debate about what weather- — weatherization, what
preparations should have been taken in advance.  We’re not going to have
that debate today.  We’re not going to have that debate on Friday.  The
President is going to Texas because he wants to show this support,
because he wants to survey the damage on the ground, see how people are
impacted, see how we can tap into additional resources in the federal
government.  
   
As you know, and as I noted at the top, Texas is still in a state of
emergency.  There are millions of people who are impacted.  We can have
a policy debate later.  Right now we’re going to help the people who are
still suffering and going through a really challenging time.  
   
Q    Does the President consider what happened in Texas last week — and
as you know, we still have the aftereffects — does he consider that to
be a natural disaster or a manmade disaster?  And how does that affect
the policy response?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, there’ll be a policy discussion.  And I’m sure,
as we look ahead to delivering on the President’s Build Back Better
agenda — as you know, he’s been a longtime fan of infrastructure.  He
loves infrastructure.  So one of the things that I’m sure we’ll be
talking about in the months ahead, but — and protecting our nation’s
critical infrastructure, which we all know is outdated.  
   
But we’re not going to put new labels on it today.  We’re just going to
focus on how we make sure people have drinking water; how people have —
you know, not in the cold; how families have a place to live.  And we
will have plenty of time to have a policy debate.  
   
Q    Two quick follow-ups on this.  Any significance to picking Houston
as the place to go — significance with the fact that it’s Ted Cruz’s
hometown, for instance?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Any other significance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That is not a significance.  I would say that we — while the
President is there, he wanted to also visit a vaccine — a place where
vaccines are being distributed.  So that was another component of the
trip.   
   
In addition, we worked in very close coordination, as I’ve noted — as we
were trying to figure out the timing of the trip — with experts on the
ground, with our Acting FEMA Administrator on where it would be most
appropriate to visit.  
   
Q    And you may have, sort of, already addressed this, but I just want
to be clear: Can we expect any sort of announcement while the President
is in Texas or going to Texas — investigations, new aid, deliverables,
anything?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’ve been, kind of, reviewing every day new assistance that
can be distributed, which I’ve been trying to read out at the top of the
briefing, in coordination with our Acting FEMA Administrator and Liz
Sherwood-Randall.  So I don’t know, it may be that there may be more,
because we’re just trying to get as much out the door as possible.  But
I wouldn’t expect — I wouldn’t — there’s nothing that we’re holding, I
should say, for Friday, if that makes sense.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, Jen.  One for me, and then, I’m the pooler today, so one for my
colleagues.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    What’s the White House view on this variant that’s emerged from
California and how it might factor into your modeling on a timetable for
a return to normalcy and your vaccination campaign?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, one of the reasons we’ve been quite careful, or
I have tried to be, about predicting a return to normalcy is because
there are unpredictable components of the things that come up with the
virus — right? — as we’ve seen with other variants, and certainly the
California variant is an example of that.   
   
The reporting on this is quite new, as you know, and our health and
medical experts will, of course, take a close look at it and make some
evaluations about what they foresee the impact as being.  So I would
certainly defer to them on that perspective and send you to them to ask
any health questions.  
   
Q    And has the President been briefed specifically on the  
California variant?  And is he concerned, alarmed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President is briefed regularly on COVID.  He asks
questions about COVID and updates.  And I would not be surprised if he
had not asked this morning.  I was not in any policy meetings with him
this morning, so I don’t have any update on his briefings.  
   
Q    So, from my colleagues outside the room, I actually received
several different questions on —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure, go ahead.  
   
Q    — on some of the Saudi– the call with the Saudi King Salman, as
well as the Khashoggi report.  And I know you’ve addressed this, but is
it important for the President to speak with the King in the context of
the release of the report?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to preview his call with the King.  Obviously,
they’ll cover a range of topics, and when we have concluded that call,
I’m sure we’ll provide a readout to all of you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, just a quick follow on the Tanden nomination.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    We were told that Senator Sanders wasn’t consulted at  
all before you guys announced her nomination.  And I just wanted to ask,
why didn’t Sanders get a heads up on it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We consult, I mean, the process — and having worked on the
confirmations team, I can give you a little insight onto this — the
process, during the transition, of nominees being selected.  You know,
there often was consultation with a limited number of members.  It
usually — typically wasn’t very broad in advance of a selection. 
Obviously, the President selects people he’s going to nominate for
positions and then, oftentimes, the immediate follow-up to an
announcement is immediate outreach from the nominees to a range of
senators and a range of officials in Congress.  So that’s a normal part
of the process.  
   
Q    He said (inaudible), though.  So was there any reason why he wasn’t
given a heads up?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I don’t think I can speak to, you know, her
announcement or who was or wasn’t consulted in the days ahead, from
several months ago.  But Senator Sanders is someone who we consult with
regularly at many levels, including at the President’s level, and expect
we’ll work with him on confirmations, but also a range of the
President’s objectives.  
   
Q    And then, just a quick follow on immigration.  Some House and
Senate Democrats have raised the possibility of putting a pathway for
undocumented essential workers into a second reconciliation package. 
Pelosi even said it would be wonderful if it could fit.  Does the
President support that option?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sure he’ll have discussions and consultations with
Speaker Pelosi, as he does frequently, and others about how they want to
move the path forward on immigration.  And he proposed the comprehensive
bill with several components because he thinks they all are pivotal. 
But, you know, we’ll have — we haven’t had any extensive conversations
on that yet, so I don’t have anything to read out for you.  
   
Q    On a second reconciliation or —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Say it again.  
   
Q    On a second reconciliation, you haven’t had (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  No.  We’ll see — we’ll let Congress play out the process of
what they want to propose or how they want to work through the
components of the immigration package.  He’s proposed it in a — as a
full, multi-step, comprehensive package because he feels that smart
security, a pathway to citizenship, and addressing the root causes are
all pivotal.  But we expect this to be an ongoing conversation about
different components of what members support.  
   
Q    And then, if I could, just one more.  I mean, as you know, the UI
benefits expire March 14.  Is there a backup plan if the COVID package
doesn’t pass Congress by that time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that, you know, the President is
focused on moving this forward as quickly as possible because, as you
noted, there is a timeline — in the middle of March — when millions of
people would lose their benefits.  And it’s not everybody on that day,
and it’s — there’s a progression of it.  But that is of great concern,
and that is one of the reasons why there is significant urgency in
moving this forward as quickly as possible.   
   
And as you also know, covering Congress, you know, a backup plan — most
scenarios would involve Congress.  This is the best pathway to
preventing millions of people from losing their benefits, and that’s why
we are hopeful that it will move quickly through the House, as we
anticipate it will, and then quickly through the Senate, and we’ll be
able to get the Rescue Plan signed into law so that that is not an
issue.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I have two questions on Iran and Yemen.  On Iran,
the President opted for diplomacy, but there’s worries in the region,
and Europe as well, that the ballistic missile development and Iran’s
interference in the region might not be addressed or linked to the
nuclear file.  Can you assure us that actually this is the case?  
   
And second, do you believe that Iran is testing your resolve in Iraq by
attacking the Green Zone and Erbil Airport recently?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, on the first question, can you just say the
last part of it again?  You were saying — I’m sorry, masks make it
difficult.  
   
Q    I know.  Whether you guys are going to link the ballistic missiles
development and Iran’s interference in — for Arab countries to the
nuclear file, or are you guys — just leave it separately?  Because there
are worries that, actually, you’re very eager to secure a deal and
you’re going to leave this behind, like it happened in 2015.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, the President’s — Iran is a long way from
compliance, as you well know from covering this issue quite closely.   
   
And the President has been clear that if Iran comes back into full
compliance with its obligations, we will do the same and, of course,
then use that as the platform to build a longer and stronger agreement,
including addressing ballistic missiles and many of the concerns that,
as you noted, countries in the region, our European partners have about
the actions of Iran.  
   
But we are not at that point.  The point we are at is that the United
States has expressed an openness to an invitation to have a diplomatic
conversation.  That’s the stage we are at.  As you know, we have not
taken any steps to roll back on sanctions — or to provide, I should say,
sanctions relief as has been requested.  And we are in a place where
we’re waiting to see if Iran will — you know, what their response will
be to the Europeans’ invitation.  
   
Q    So are why you not responding to the attacks in Iraq and
elsewhere?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The attacks in Iran?  
   
Q    Iraq.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well — the attacks in Iraq, I should say.  Well, first, we
have not made a final attribution of — but I — of the attacks.  We will
— I will say, as you know, the President spoke with the Prime Minister
last night.  They — this was an extensive part of the conversation.  We
do hold Iran accountable for the actions of their proxies.  And, of
course, we reserve the right to respond in a manner and at a time of our
choosing, but we will respond in a way that’s calculated, on our
timetable, and using a mix of tools seen and unseen.  What we will not
do — and what we’ve seen in the past — is lash out and risk an
escalation that plays into the hands of Iran by further destabilizing
Iraq.  And that is our priority.  
   
Q    And if I may, on Yemen: Since you unlisted the Houthis as a
terrorist organization, do you believe that the humanitarian situation
has improved, considering that now they are trying to take Marib, which
is a big city?  And some say that they may be emboldened by lifting them
from the terror list.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  And, as you know, our issue has never been with the
people of Yemen.  Right?  And certainly the humanitarian situation has
been a longtime concern.  I don’t have an assessment of the humanitarian
situation on the ground.  I — the State Department is likely going to
have the best assessment of that, but I can also talk to them, or you
can, of course, reach out them directly to get an assessment.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks, Jen.  I have two quick questions, if you don’t mind. 
The first, on voting rights: We’re seeing several states consider bills
to restrict voting rights — or restrict voting.  Is the administration
willing to work with Congress to pass legislation to expand access to
voting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly, expanding access to voting, making it easier for
people to vote is a priority of the President’s, a priority of the Vice
President’s, and we’re happy to have that conversation.  
   
Q    In what ways would — would you be willing to do so?  Democrats have
sent a letter to the President asking for policing of voting-related
crimes.  Is that something that the administration is willing to look
into?  And what are other specific steps that they — the administration
is willing to do to help combat some of these pieces of legislation that
we’re seeing in other states?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have not taken a full look at all the different pieces of
legislation.  I’m happy to talk to Ambassador Rice, who is running point
on this.  And I expect we’ll have more to say on voting rights soon. 
But let me do that, and we can see if we can get you more specifics
after the briefing.  
   
Q    And then shifting gears, I know that you have talked about
supporting a study of reparations.  But another note, we’ve talked about
the impact that COVID has had on the black community —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    — whether it’s in deaths, in the job losses.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Is the administration considering some type of targeted relief for
black communities or communities that have been hit hard?  That may not
be reparations, but it may be job training or something to help
communities build back from this pandemic, specifically communities that
have been hit hard, such as black communities.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, let me first say that the American Rescue Plan
is the package — that we hope we will have signed into law soon — that
is going to provide relief that is targeted at the communities and the
people and the families who have been hardest hit — from direct checks
and payments; to more money for vaccinations to get them out to
communities that have been hardest hit; to the reopening of schools that
is certainly impacting many, many communities, including black
communities.  
   
Beyond that, obviously, the President will consider a range of options —
things that he talked about on the campaign trail — to build the economy
back better.  That’s not anything we have to preview or that’s been
finalized at this point in time. But our objective, right now, is to get
the American Rescue Plan passed and to get that direct relief out to a
range of communities.  
   
Q    And I understand $1,400 checks are one thing, but, I guess, down
the road, helping communities — people that have lost their jobs —
training them for these jobs of the future, is that something —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, job retraining, helping the manufacturing sector,
doing better with caregiving, impr- — improving our nation’s
infrastructure — these are all components of the President’s agenda that
he talked about on the campaign trail and is certainly a blueprint for
what he would like to do as President.   
   
But, right now, we’re just focused on the Rescue Plan — getting it
passed, getting it through, getting that direct relief out — and then I
expect we’ll have more to say, he will have more to say after that is
concluded.  
   
Go ahead, Kristen.  
   
Q    Jen, if I could ask you one on the minimum wage.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    One of the points of debate, as it relates to the President’s COVID
relief package: Would the President support anything below $15 — for
example, the proposal for an $11 minimum wage?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President put $15 minimum wage — an increase — in his
package because that’s what he believes the increase should be.  As you
know, it is working its way through a parliamentary process at this
point in time.  Hopefully, we’ll have more news on that in the coming
days.  And — but his support is for the $15 increase.  
   
Q    Senator Sanders has said there’s no room for compromise.  Does the
President think there is room for compromise on that $15 wage?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the compromise will be between members of the Senate
who may have disagreement on where the minimum wage should sit and what
the process should be.  But the first step is the Byrd Rule — the “Byrd
bath.”  I just like to say that every day.  And then members will — and
we’re certainly hopeful that that will conclude with the minimum wage
being included in there, but that is up to the parliamentarian for that
process to conclude.  And then senators will have to debate what a final
package looks like.  
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Just a quick one.  There has been some survey data that suggests
there’s a hesitancy within the armed services for taking the vaccine. 
The Commander-in-Chief, in theory, could require that members of the
military take the vaccine.  Is that something he has considered doing
and is wanting or willing to do?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s a really interesting question.  Everyone’s questions
are interesting, but that’s a very interesting question.  I have not
spoken with him about that or to Secretary Austin about that, who — any
decision like that would be in consultation and at his recommendation. 
I’m happy to follow up with it — on it, or I would suggest you talk to
my old friend John Kirby about where they stand on that question.  
   
Go ahead, David.  
   
Q    Just following up on Kristen’s on the minimum wage there.  It
sounds, from your description, of the negotiation underway now between
House and Senate on that — on the wording — that the President will
basically sign whatever comes out of conference here.  That would be the
implication of your — your statement: that he doesn’t really have a
choice on the minimum wage at this point.  Is that what you meant to
say?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That — that is not my implication.  I hope that’s not what
other people took from what I said.  But what I was conveying is that
there’s a process that this has to undergo, and it needs to move through
the parliam- — Senate parliamentarian process.  We don’t even know where
they’re going to conclude and whether the minimum wage is in the package
or not in the package.   
   
And certainly — and I’ll leave the analysis to all of you — there would
be many who would support it not being in the package and there would be
many who would oppose it not being in the package.  We understand that. 
We know how a bill becomes a law.  What I’m conveying is we’re not going
to get ahead of that process, and that —  
   
Q    You’re not saying the President won’t sign it if it doesn’t have a
minimum wage provision?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think we’re — we are not even at the stage — the President
proposed an increase in the minimum wage in his package; that’s what he
wants to be in the final package.  He also was in the Senate for 36
years and has great respect for the parliamentary process.  We’re going
to see that through.  Once that’s concluded, we can all talk further
about the next steps.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    There’s a report that South Korea is working with the Iran to
possibly unfreeze $7 billion in Iranian money, but they would need a
waiver from the U.S. State Department.  Is that something that the
administration would consider?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have not seen those reports.  I’m happy to follow up with
our team at the State Department, but it would probably be more direct
if you follow up with them directly.  
   
Q    Okay.  And one more vaccines.  What does the White House think when
they see a governor, like the Democratic Governor of Connecticut, Ned
Lamont, who says he thinks if he goes his own way — not with the
national recommendations — to distribute vaccines just based on age,
then he can get them out faster and more equitably than if he follows
the recommendations from the federal level.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we make recommendations at the federal level for a
reason, because there are groups that we feel should be prioritized,
whether they’re frontline workers, healthcare workers, individuals over
a certain age — as you noted.  And our objective, of course, is to get
to the stage where there’s recommendations for people who are much
younger, who don’t have pre- — you know, health conditions that would
mean they would qualify.   
   
So that’s what — that’s the reason we laid them out as we do. 
Obviously, governors make different choices about the prioritization and
the prioritization order.  But we stand by the guidelines we’ve
recommended at a national level.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, everyone.  
   
Q    Thank you.
