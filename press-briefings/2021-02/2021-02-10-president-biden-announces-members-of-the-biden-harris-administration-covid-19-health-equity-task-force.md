*The COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force will provide recommendations for
addressing health inequities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and for
preventing such inequities in the future*

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to plague the country, it has had a
disproportionate impact on some of our most vulnerable communities.
Shortly after COVID-19 was first identified in the United States,
disparities in testing, cases, hospitalizations, and mortality began to
emerge. These inequities were quickly evident by race, ethnicity,
geography, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other
factors.  
  
President Biden and Vice President Harris have released a National
Strategy to combat the pandemic that has equity at its core. To help
ensure an equitable response to the pandemic, the President signed an
executive order on January 21 creating a task force to address COVID-19
related health and social inequities. This Task Force is chaired by Dr.
Marcella Nunez-Smith.  
  
Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris announced the following
individuals to serve as non-federal members of the Biden-Harris COVID-19
Health Equity Task Force. Individuals selected by the President are:

**Mayra Alvarez** of San Diego, CA  
**James Hildreth **of Nashville, TN  
**Andrew Imparato **of Sacramento, CA  
**Victor Joseph **of Tanana, AK  
**Joneigh Khaldun **of Lansing, MI  
**Octavio Martinez **of New Braunfels, TX  
**Tim Putnam **of Batesville, IN  
**Vincent Toranzo** of Pembroke Pines, FL  
**Mary Turner **of Plymouth, MN  
**Homer Venters **of Port Washington, NY  
**Bobby Watts **of Goodlettsville, TN  
**Haeyoung Yoon **of New York, NY

The twelve Task Force members represent a diversity of backgrounds and
expertise, a range of racial and ethnic groups, and a number of
important populations, including: children and youth; educators and
students; health care providers, immigrants; individuals with
disabilities; LGBTQ+ individuals; public health experts; rural
communities; state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments; and
unions.  
  
As Chair, Dr. Nunez-Smith will also ask six additional Federal agencies
to be represented on the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force as federal
members. This includes the United States Department of Agriculture,
Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services,
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Justice, and
Department of Labor.  
  
The Task Force is charged with issuing a range of recommendations to
help inform the COVID-19 response and recovery. This includes
recommendations on equitable allocation of COVID-19 resources and relief
funds, effective outreach and communication to underserved and minority
populations, and improving cultural proficiency within the Federal
Government. Additional recommendations include efforts to improve data
collection and use, as well as a long-term plan to address data
shortfalls regarding communities of color and other underserved
populations. The Task Force’s work will conclude after issuing a final
report to the COVID-19 Response Coordinator describing the drivers of
observed COVID-19 inequities, the potential for ongoing disparities
faced by COVID-19 survivors, and actions to ensure that future pandemic
responses do not ignore or exacerbate health inequities.
