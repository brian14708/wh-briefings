12:36 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  I will tell you masks are a little tricky with
earrings on, so just bear with me here.  Okay.  
   
So, just have a couple of items at the top.  Okay.  Learned my lesson on
earrings.  All right.  
   
Today, the President will deliver remarks to mark the 50 — mark 50
million shots that have been administered since he entered office.  In
his remarks, he will provide an update on the strong progress we’ve made
across our pandemic response to date.  He will commend the COVID
Response Team’s extraordinary whole-of-government effort to get shots in
the arms of Americans, as well as the work of so many Americans who have
stepped up to the plate in this moment.  
   
He will also remind Americans that now is not the time to let our guards
down, especially in the face of new variants.  He will continue — he
will encourage people to continue wearing a mask and get vaccinated when
it is their turn.  
   
I also have some brief updates on the winter storm that affected a few
states last week.  As many of you saw, last night the President approved
the State of Oklahoma’s Major Disaster Declaration request.  This action
will authorize FEMA to provide both public and individual assistance,
including grants for temporary housing and home repairs; low cost loans
to cover uninsured property losses; and other programs to help
individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Power and water restoration continue across Texas, Louisiana, and
Oklahoma.  Accelerated vaccine shipments are occurring.  And vaccination
appointments are being rescheduled and expanded to accommodate those
canceled last week.  
   
And as you all know, the President is, of course, traveling to Texas
tomorrow.  
   
Today, the Vice President also visited a local Giant Pharmacy in
Washington, D.C., that is participating in the administration’s federal
Retail Pharmacy Program.  The program is increasing access to COVID-19
vaccines across the country.  The Biden-Harris administration is
committed to ensuring Americans have access to vaccine in their own
communities, including at local pharmacies.  And last week alone, the
administration doubled our allocation to pharmacies to over 2 million
doses across 7,000 pharmacies.  
   
With that, Darlene, why don’t you kick it off?  
   
Q    Great.  I have a question to start off with about Neera Tanden.  So
when she tweeted that, quote, “a vampire has more heart than Ted Cruz,”
when she compared Senator McConnell to Voldemort, and when she called
Senator Collins, quote, “the worst,” did those comments meet the
President’s standard of treating everyone with dignity and respect?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first I’ll note that when Neera Tanden testified just
a few weeks ago, she apologized for her past comments and that she would
be joining an administration where, as we’ve noted in here, there’s an
expectation of a high bar of civility and engagement, whether that’s on
social media or in person.  And we certainly expect she would meet that
bar.  
   
Q    Did the President and the transition team underestimate how much of
a problem her tweets would become?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President nominated Neera Tanden because she is
qualified, because she is experienced, because she has a record of
working with people who agree with her and disagree with her, with — and
she has decades of experience, and plus, she has lived experience of her
own, having benefited from a number of the programs that she would
oversee, as a daughter of a single parent and somebody who benefited
from food stamps at certain points in time.  She would bring a new
perspective to the role.  That’s why he nominated her to the job and why
we’re continuing to fight for her confirmation.  
   
Q    On the 50 millionth shot, this afternoon, does the White House — is
the White House able to say where and when that shot was administered,
what state, even some characteristics about who may have received it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah, it’s a — it’s a great question.  I think the challenge
is that we get data in from so many different sources on a daily basis —
from states, from pharmacies, from mass vaccination sites — that we hit
that point — hit the 50 millionth shot sometime yesterday, if not a
little bit before, but we can’t fine-tune exactly the person who hit
that point — hit that shot.

Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Any update on the President’s phone call or scheduled phone call
with King Salman of Saudi Arabia?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update.  As I noted yesterday, as soon as
that call happens — we expect it to be very soon — we will, of course,
provide a readout to all of you.  
   
Q    And you said, when they do talk, that the President won’t hold
back.  Will he be following up this talk with actions?  Are sanctions on
the table?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think there are a range of actions that are on the table,
but the first step is — the next step, I should say, is for the
President to speak with the King.  We expect that to happen very soon. 
As you know, we’ve committed to the release of an unclassified report
that would come out from DNI and not from the White House.  And, of
course, our administration is focused on recalibrating the relationship,
as we’ve talked about in here previously, and certainly there are areas
where we will express concerns and leave open the option of
accountability.  There are also areas where we will continue to work
with Saudi Arabia, given the threats they face in the region.  
   
Q    What’s the holdup to the phone call?  Is the King avoiding your
calls?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think that’s the characterization.  The President
has a busy schedule.  The King, obviously — I can’t speak to his
schedule — I’m not his spokesperson — but we expect the call to happen
very soon.  I think there was some inaccurate reporting about it being
confirmed when it wasn’t a confirmed call yet.  
   
Q    And you have made clear that the President is going to be speaking
with his counterpart, with the King, not with the Crown Prince.  But
given the Crown Prince’s role in the future of the Kingdom and that he
is expected to be implicated here, why not speak to the person expected
to be responsible?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the President’s conversation will cover a
range of topics with the King.  There’s obviously a lot to discuss with
Saudi Arabia and with the leaders of Saudi Arabia.  And as I noted —
previously noted — the Crown Prince has been engaged with his
appropriate counterparts.  The President will be engaged with his
appropriate counterparts.  And we’re engaged at many levels with leaders
in Saudi Arabia.  
   
Q    So will the Crown Prince’s counterparts here (inaudible) — speaking
to him about this issue, though?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He spoke with him last week; they did a readout.  I don’t
think I have anything more about their call to read out.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you.  I just want to ask about the Post Office — a couple
of questions.  You said earlier today that there was some concerns, I
guess, with the leadership.  Quote, “It’s clear that the leadership can
do better, and so that’s our hope.”  Can you clarify whether you want a
change in the Postmaster General, now that you’ve named new members to
the board?  
   
And, secondly, they’ve announced the purchase of a new fleet.  The
President, of course, announced on January 27th a study pursued — aiming
at electrifying the government fleet, including the Post Office.  Only
10 percent of the fleet, (inaudible), will be electric.  Do you plan to
change that order or seek changes to it at all?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  The second question, I’ll have to follow up on more
specifics on it.  That is certainly something that presidents committed
to.  I don’t have an update on it, but I can venture to get one for
you.  
   
On the first question, some people may not be following this as closely
as you and I have, so let me just give a little more context.  Of
course, the President is committed to the Post Office — the Postal
Service’s success, which is why yesterday he nominated three extremely
qualified individuals to fill the empty spots on the Board of Governors:
Anton Hajjar, Amber McReynolds, and Ron Stroman.   
   
And the American people highly value the Postal Service and the men and
women who deliver our mail every day.  And we’re working hard to do
exactly that.  
   
But I think we can all agree, most Americans would agree, that the
Postal Service needs leadership that can and will do a better job.  
   
Now, as you know, and — but not everybody knows — it’s up to the Board
of Governors, of which we just nominated three individuals to serve, to
determine the future of leadership there.  And we certainly leave it up
to their discretion.  
   
Q    It sounds like you’re signaling that the board could take a look at
it.  Does the President have confidence in the current Postmaster
General?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think the President is certainly familiar with the
process.  He believes the leadership can do better.  And we’re eager to
have the Board of Governors in place.  
   
Q    Okay, can I ask on a slightly separate subject?  You may have seen
that GameStop is spiking again, as are similar stocks — or “stonks” dare
I call them.  Do you have views on whether the SEC or the administration
— the Treasury Secretary will weigh in if we continue to see these sort
of “meme” stocks fluctuating and spiking like this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you know, the SEC had been — had had over- — has
oversight, I should say, and certainly has been watching it closely,
monitoring it closely.  The Treasury Secretary also convened a meeting
just a few weeks ago, but I would certainly send you to them on what
their plans are for monitoring engagement or speaking to it.  
   
Q    But there’s been no update since that meeting?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would send you directly to them to give any update on
their progress and how they’re monitoring it.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    The President is going to Texas tomorrow.  He’s obviously going to
show empathy for victims of the storm.  Does he have a message for the
leadership in Texas on how to better prepare for winter storms?  And
what can the federal government do to kind of coerce private industry
there to better prepare?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that he’ll be traveling for most of
the day with the governor, and he’ll be — they’ll be surveying the
damage, and I’m sure he’ll be getting an update and briefings from him
directly.  
   
The President doesn’t view the crisis and the millions of people who’ve
been impacted by it as a Democratic or Republican issue.  He views it as
an issue where he’s eager to get relief to tap into all the resources in
the federal government, to make sure the people of Texas know we’re
thinking about them, we’re fighting for them, and we’re going to
continue working on this as they’re recovering.  
   
There’s plenty of time to have a policy discussion about better
weatherization, better preparations, and I’m sure that’s one that will
be had.  But right now we’re focused on getting relief to the people in
the state, getting updated briefings, tapping into all of the levers of
federal government.  
   
Q    Sure.  There’s a lot of hearings on the Hill about how the Capitol
Police responded or prior to the January 6th events.  Mike Pence and his
family were there that day.  Secret Service had intelligence briefings,
presumably.  Is there any concern or review about how the Secret Service
assessed intelligence briefings and whether there was any missteps on
their part?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Review by the —  
   
Q    Secret Service.  I mean, Mike Pence and his family were at Capitol
Hill that day.  Clearly, there was intelligence out there that suggested
things could happen.  I’m curious to whether there’s been any review by
the Secret Service, or ordered about the Secret Service’s actions that
day, and how they handled (inaudible).  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d encourage you to reach out to the leadership of the
Secret Service to get a further comment on it.  
   
Go ahead, Kristen.  I’ll come to you next.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  A little bit of housekeeping.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    A follow-up on the Texas questions, if I could.  Will President
Biden invite Senator Cruz and Cornyn to Texas with him to travel on Air
Force One?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Dr. Biden is traveling, of course, with us to Texas —
with the President to Texas.  There are some limitations on space
available, so there are not members, I don’t believe — I will double
check on this — of any party traveling with the President to Texas.  
   
But again, he’s going to be spending the day traveling with Governor
Abbott and surveying the damage on the ground.  
   
Q    Will they be a part of his plans to survey the damage? Will they
join him in any of those events tomorrow?  Has there been any invitation
extended?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to follow up on it for you, Kristen, but I’m not
aware of their plans to participate in the events tomorrow.  But I can
check.  
   
Q    Okay.  I want to ask you about the uptick in migrants at the
border.  Some members of the Democratic Party are displeased with the
way the administration is handling children who are being held at the
border.  Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this: Quote, “This is not okay,
never has been okay, never will be okay – no matter the administration
or party.”  Is this a failure on the part of this administration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I can’t speak to what “this” is that is being
referred to —  
   
Q    Holding children in these detention facilities at the border.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, that’s not what’s happening.  And, you know, we will
be doing some briefings, of course, with members of Congress.  But what
is happening now is there are children fleeing prosecution, fleeing
threats in their own countries, traveling on their own, unaccompanied,
to the border.  And our focus is on approaching this from the view of
humanity and from — and with safety in mind.   
   
And so the steps that we have taken is: They are, of course, processed
as quickly as possible, ideally with a maximum of three days, through
CBP.  Then they are transferred to facilities overseen by HHS.   
   
We had to open — reopen a new facility that had previously been closed
because of COVID protocols, because previously — because we can’t have
kids in beds next to each other; we need space appropriate.  It’s been
revamped.  There are — there’s educational services there.  There are
health services and medical services.  But our objective is to move them
as quickly as we can to families that have been vetted and to, of
course, reunite kids with their families.  
   
Q    How do you respond to Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, though, who says she
sees these images and “it’s not okay,” from her perspective?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, look, we will work, of course, with Congresswoman
Ocasio-Cortez on a range of issues, and we look forward to doing
that.   
   
What I’m conveying from here is what the actual circumstances on the
ground and the tough choice that we have had to make.  There are only a
couple of options here.  So either we send kids back to a very dangerous
journey back to their countries.  That’s not a good option.  I don’t
think anyone would support that option.  We send them to families that
have not been vetted — we’ve seen challenges with that in the past where
kids have then been trafficked.  That is not a good option, in our
view.   
   
Our best option, in our view, is to get these kids processed through HHS
facilities where there are COVID protocols in place, where they are
safe, where they can have access to educational and medical care.  
   
There are no — there are very few good options here, and we chose the
one we thought was best.  
   
Q    And I just want to ask you about CPAC.  I know you got some
questions about this yesterday.  If I could try again.  Based on our
reporting, former President Trump is going to be talking about President
Biden’s immigration policies.  He will point to the uptick in migrants
coming to the U.S.  How is the administration planning to respond?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re not looking to former President Trump or any of
his advisors as a model for how we’re approaching immigration.  In fact,
we’re in the circumstance we’re in because not only was their approach
inhumane, it was ineffective.  And so we’re going to forge our own path
forward.  We’ll see what he says, but our focus is certainly not what on
President Trump is saying at CPAC.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  The head of the group the President is going to
meet with today, the National Governors Association, Andrew Cuomo, is
being accused of sexual harassment by a former staffer named Lindsey
Boylan.  She says that Cuomo, while he was governor, gave her an
unwanted kiss on the lips.  He asked her to play strip poker.  Is the
White House worried about this becoming a distraction from an important
meeting about COVID response?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say that the President has been
consistent in his position.  When a person comes forward, they deserve
to be treated with dignity and respect; their voice should be heard, not
silenced; and any allegation should be reviewed.  
   
Governor Cuomo is also the governor of one of the largest states in the
country that has been one of the hardest hit, with millions of people
still suffering from an ongoing pandemic and an economic crisis.  And
our focus is to continue working with governors from across the country,
from a range of states, on how we’re helping people in their states.  He
also is still head of the National Governors Association, hence he’s at
the event today.  
   
Q    And to him being in charge of the governors and in charge of such a
big state, will the President talk to him about these accusations from
Democrats in the New York legislature that Cuomo misled the public about
deaths in nursing homes throughout the pandemic?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, this is a meeting and a conversation with a range of
governors about how we can all work together to address the pandemic and
get relief to the American people, and that’s what I expect the focus of
the meeting to be on.  
   
Q    There are some Democrats in New York who want a — who want
congressional hearings about these deaths in nursing homes. There was a
Cuomo aide who told lawmakers, in February, that the Cuomo
administration withheld the number of residents who died in hospitals
from the public due to the fear that it would be used against them by
federal prosecutors.  Is this something the White House thinks would be
appropriate for a congressional hearing?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s really up to Congress to determine how they want to
review or have hearings on those reports.   
   
Q    And I know you were asked about this this weekend, but I’ll try
again: Does President Biden still think Andrew Cuomo is the “gold
standard” for COVID leadership and that he’s doing a “hell of a job,”
which he has said about him?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first of all, I think, to be fair, let’s put all of
the comments in context, which sometimes is missing from these
conversations we have in here or during interviews.  At the time — which
was, I believe, April of last year — the President spoke out and said
positive things about a range of governors, Democrats and Republicans,
who were stepping in when there was a vacuum of leadership at the
federal level, when they were getting no information, when they were
getting no help and no guidance from the former Trump administration.   
   
He had — he made some positive comments about Governor Cuomo and his
role in New York at the time, as he did about a range of governors.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then one more.  On climate change: There’s been some
reports about a meeting with airlines CEOs next week.  How important is
it to the White House to reduce airline emissions as part of an overall
climate agenda?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not actually familiar with that meeting.  Do you know
who it’s with?  
   
Q    Gina McCarthy and some of the airline company CEOs.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to look back into it.  I don’t have any more
details on that meeting.   
   
Q    Okay, thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m happy to.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I just want to follow up on the unaccompanied
children.  Is President Biden open to the creation of an ombudsman
within the Health and Human Services Department?  This has been proposed
by Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal.  This person
would be able to go in and check out the facilities, see the care that
the children are receiving, and report back to Congress.  Would the
administration support such a role within Health and Human Services?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have actually not spoken with the President about that
proposal by Congresswoman Jayapal.  We have, I should note — I think
someone asked this the other day — we have had cameras.  HHS has had
cameras in there also to make sure people and the public — the media —
are able to see the conditions in these facilities, and we’d certainly
be open to supporting that in the future.  But I’d have to follow up
with him and our legislative team on that proposal.  
   
Q    And that includes lawmakers obviously being able to go in and see
the care of the children?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We would certainly support that.  Sure.  
   
Q    And then, one more question.  In 2018, it was discovered migrant
children were being forced to take psychiatric medication without
knowing the drugs they were taking — things like lithium and so on. 
What’s being done?  Obviously these children need psychiatric care.  In
some cases, they’ve been traumatized, they’ve had a difficult time. 
What can the administration do to assure these kinds — while the
children are getting the care they need, there would be no such
abuses?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, we are not using the past
management as our guide.  And the — we have — the Secretary of Homeland
Security is, of course, overseeing, in coordination with the Health and
Human — Health and Homeland — sorry, HHS Secretary — it’s a mouthful —
to ensure that these children are treated humanely, they are provided
with the medical assistance they need, the mental health assistance they
need.  And you’re absolutely right — I mean, these kids have been
through a trauma, and we want to treat them humanely and make sure
they’re kept safe.   
   
So I would send you, of course, to the HHS team to get more specifics of
how it’s monitored, but certainly that’s our expectation.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Hello.  Has the President been following Brexit?  And has it gone
as he expected so far?  And does he share the position that President
Obama expressed in 2016, when he said Brexit would put the UK at the
“back of the queue” for trade deals with the U.S.?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, a lot has happened on Brexit — and in the world —
since 2016, I think it’s fair to say.    
   
I will say that President Biden is focused on strengthening our domestic
economy through significant investments in American workers and
competitiveness.  That’s his focus.  He’s committed to prioritizing
those investments at home before signing new trade deals.  That’s his
approach, and that’s how he sees trade deals in general around the
world.  Making those investments is critical to restoring the middle
class and making us more competitive.   
   
So our team is still reviewing negotiations that were begun under the
prior administration.  Ambassador-designate Tai, of course, had her
hearing this morning, and she will be essential to that review.  
   
Q    Has the President spoken to leaders from Africa yet?  And how
concerned is he about competition from China in Africa?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly we’ve long been concerned — the United
States has long been concerned about competition from China in Africa. 
We provide readouts whenever he does calls with foreign leaders, so he
has not quite made it to every foreign leader at this point in time. 
But I’m sure that engagement with China and the bar and the — we expect
to be set would be part of those discuss- — many of those discussions.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said
this week that he’s open to using reconciliation to pass the President’s
infrastructure package.  Is the President open to that approach, and has
he spoken with Bernie Sanders about it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That would require having an infrastructure package — right?
— to decide how it would pass.   
   
Well, let me first say that our focus is on the American Rescue Plan. 
And, of course, the President has talked about what his Build Back
Better agenda would look like on the campaign trail; infrastructure is a
part of it.  He’s been a long fan of investing in infrastructure — long
outdated — long overdue, I should say.  But he also wants to do more on
caregiving, help our manufacturing sector, do more to strengthen access
to affordable healthcare.   
   
So the size — the package — the components of it, the order, that has
not yet been determined, and I feel like that’s the next step.  I don’t
expect the President or any of us will preview anything until we have
the American Rescue Plan through.  
   
Q    And just one more.  The Chief of Staff said yesterday that the
President would overrule the parliamentarian if she decides that you
can’t raise the minimum wage as part of this broader economic relief
package.  If that is the decision, what’s the next step on raising the
minimum wage?  Does he expect to introduce a standalone bill?  Would it
be part of this upcoming economic — broader economic (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say it would be a serious step for the
Vice President to take that step.  And obviously, she and the President
respect the historic institution of the Senate.  It would also require
50 votes.  So there’s — it’s not just a standalone step that any Vice
President could take.  
   
In terms of the minimum wage, you know, we’re still waiting for the
conclusion of the parliamentarian’s view on whether or not raising the
minimum wage should be included — can be included, I should say, in the
American Rescue Plan.  That’s where the state — the step is — the
process is at this stage in time.  The President included an increase in
the minimum wage because he believes it should be — it’s long overdue,
and American workers should not be struggling to make ends meet.   
   
But that’s the next step, and we’ll have to go from there.  
   
Q    And just one more.  Is the administration considering easing social
distancing rules for unaccompanied minors in these detention facilities
to allow more unaccompanied minors to be in the facilities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not aware of that consideration.  I mean, one of the
reasons that we opened this facility — revamped this facility is because
we did not want to put unaccompanied minors at risk.  And we obviously
follow CDC guidelines, which is six feet of separation, so my
expectation is we would continue to follow those guidelines.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  So, March 21st is coming up as the first anniversary
of border restrictions between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico.  Back in
October, Republicans and Democrats in Texas demanded that the Trump
administration release a plan for reopening the border.  These
restrictions have obviously divided families.  They’ve (inaudible) the
economy on the border.  Can we expect a plan from the Biden
administration anytime soon on potential border reopenings?  And what
would the parameters for that look like?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I do expect there will be more on this soon.  It would
likely come from the State Department, so I would send you to them for
an update on the status and the timeline.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you very much, Jen.  I wanted to ask about the domestic
terrorism review.  The President asked for a 100-day domestic terrorism
review.  He had the DNI take charge of that and work closely with the
FBI and DHS.  What does the President expect to come out of that review
at the end of 100 days?  Does he want to see a report, a list of
recommendations?  What is he expecting to see, and what would we expect
to see out of that review?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we have more than 60 days left until we hit 100 days. 
In terms of the format of what the review will look like, I would expect
some form of a report.  I don’t know yet if it will include specific
recommendations or if it will then launch a policy process.  I can talk
to our team and see if there’s more specifics.  
   
Q    Has the President been briefed and updated on the progress of that
review?  We’re about 33 — 35 days into it.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  As you know, the President has daily meetings as a part of
the PDB and is certainly tracking threats to our homeland, as a part of
what’s discussed there, but I don’t have any update for you on updates
on the overall report that’s not due for more than 60 days.  
   
Q    And what’s the President’s assessment now of the threat from
domestic terrorism?  You know, we obviously saw domestic terrorists
involved and groups — and armed groups involved in the January 6th
insurrection.  In the subsequent weeks, how has that changed?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the reason that he asked his national security team to
do a comprehensive review was so that he wasn’t looking at it, and we
weren’t looking at it, through the prism of one event versus another
event, or through a political lens.  So I’m not going to be able to
offer for you a day-by-day or week-by-week assessment.  We’re going to
wait for this review to conclude, and then we’ll use that as guidelines
for our process and our policies moving forward.   
   
Go ahead, George.  
   
Q    Great.  Thanks, Jen.  I have a question for myself and then one for
reporters who can’t be here.   
   
On the budget: New Presidents put their own stamp on the budget, and all
recent new Presidents have given a speech in February that talks about
the budget, and then within a month or so, submitted their revisions. 
Can you talk about what your — the President’s timetable is, given — and
how much it’s affected by the fact that the pandemic, the
less-than-cooperative transition, and the failure to confirm a
director?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure, George.  Well, the President is certainly looking
forward to sharing his budget priorities for the fiscal year with
Congress and, of course, the American people as our nation faces
unprecedented challenges.   
   
We anticipated during the transition — and we talked about it a bit
during the transition — that the budget would be delayed due to some
intransigence we encountered from political appointees at OMB during the
transition.  Those roadblocks definitely delayed the process.  We have a
strong place in team — team in place, of course, at OMB, many of whom
are career officials who are working through administrations to put
budgets together.  But the lack of a confirmed head of OMB certainly
doesn’t help to expedite the process.   
   
So we certainly anticipate it will be delayed.  I don’t have an exact
timeline on it, but I wouldn’t expect a budget rollout or announcement
in February.  
   
Q    Do you think it will be possible to give that kind of traditional
speech, or does the pandemic make that impossible?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A traditional budget speech?  
   
Q    A speech to the Congress.    
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we would be looking at a nontraditional
approach to a joint session.  I don’t have any update on what that will
look like at this point, simply because I don’t think anyone could
envision 500 members of Congress in there with a President of the United
States during a pandemic.  But I don’t have any updates on the timeline
or format.  
   
Q    And the one from other reporters — it’s sort of a follow-up to your
earlier answer.   When you do make the –declassify the report on Saudis,
will that come at the same time as you announce any kind of sanctions or
actions, or is that a separate timetable for those two?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to be in a position to preview that.  I would
just say the unclassified report would be released from DNI, not from
the White House.  And I would just broadly remind you that, oftentimes,
any actions related to global issues don’t come out of the White House;
they come out of a range of agencies.  But I don’t have anything to
preview for you at this point in time.   
   
Go ahead, Lalit.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I would like to ask you about — India and Pakistan
today announced ceasefire along Kashmiri border, including Line of
Control.  This for the first time, I think, after 2003 that they have
announced this kind of ceasefire.  What does the White House to say on
this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the United States welcomes the joint statement between
India and Pakistan: that the two countries have agreed to maintain
strict observance of a ceasefire along the Line of Control starting on
February 25th.  This is a positive step towards greater peace and
stability in South Asia, which is in all shared — is in our shared
interest.  And we encourage both countries to keep building upon this
progress.   
   
Q    And do you think Pakistan is doing enough in the fight against
terrorism?  
   
MS. PSAKI:   Couldn’t — sorry — I’m sorry, the masks always make it hard
to hear people in the way back.  Can you say that one more time?  
   
Q    Is Pakistan doing enough in the fight against terrorism?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, of course we remain closely engaged with a range of
leaders and officials in the region, including those in Pakistan.  But
in terms of an assessment of that, I would point you to the State
Department or the intelligence department — team.  
   
Q    Yesterday, President issued a proclamation in which he revoked the
previous — his predecessor’s policy on green — issue of new green cards
to (inaudible) people who are outside the country.  There are a lot of
legal immigrants who leave their country and they want to make this
country as their home, but they’re having a decade-long wait for the
issue of green cards so that once they get it, their potential is
unfolded: They can open their company, they still have the startups, and
they give employment — create employment and generate employment in this
country.  
   
What’s the President’s message to those legal immigrants in this
country?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President believes that it’s important and long
overdue to put in place immigration — to modernize our immigration
system, and that includes taking steps to help ensure that high-skilled
workers can stay in the country and can go through the proper process to
stay in the country.  So we’re eager to work with Democrats and
Republicans in Congress to get that done.  
   
Q    One more.  Final one.  Several Republicans on the Hill, and
including Nikki Haley, the former U.S. Ambassador of U.N., are urging
President Biden to — not to participate in next week’s Chinese Winter
Olympics.  Has the President taken a decision on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There hasn’t been a final decision made on that.  And, of
course, we would look for guidance from the U.S. Olympic Committee.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Back on immigration.  Do you believe that you have
a crisis at the border?  And is the government now acting as if you had
a crisis at the border?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly, you know, having unaccompanied minors
travel across the border, and so many that we are looking — we had to
open new facilities, is something that we take incredibly seriously. 
And we, you know, are eager to, of course, address humanely and with the
focus of keeping them safe.  
   
I don’t think I’m going to put new labels on it from here or from the
podium, but it is a priority of the administration, it’s a priority of
our Secretary of Homeland Security, and certainly of the President,
who’s kept abreast of the developments.  
   
Q    On family reunification, the lawyers — the pro bono lawyers that
have been working with the families on trying to get them together
announced yesterday that about 100 families have been reunited from
those 600 kids that were in the system and lost.  Has the government
been working with those pro bono lawyers, as well, to get that process
going?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, this program is being overseen — the family
reunification task force — by the Department of Homeland Security, by
our Secretary of Homeland Security.  Of course, he will be doing an
official report at about the 120-day mark, but I would send you to them
for any updates or status of our work with those lawyers.  
   
Q    And on the Texas ruling about the 100-day moratorium on
deportation, will the government appeal to a higher court?  Will the
legal process continue?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me first say a couple of things about this,
because we haven’t talked about this in the last couple of days.   
   
The pause on deportations was a time to reset our enforcement priorities
so that we focus on threats to national security and public safety as
opposed to mothers and fathers who are longstanding members of our
community, who are in many cases performing essential work during the
pandemic.  
   
So the Department of Homeland Security has put in place interim
enforcement priorities and is reviewing the prior administration’s
policies and practices.  The court’s ruling still allows us to do
this.  
   
In terms of next steps or how we will approach it from here, I would
send you to our Department of Justice.  
   
Q    And will the President address immigration at all down in Texas
tomorrow?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President will be certainly speaking, you know, about
COVID and addressing the pandemic.  He will also be speaking about the
impact of the storm on the people of the state.  And I know immigration
is an issue on the minds of many people there, but I don’t have anything
to preview in terms of whether he’ll address it while he’s there.  
   
Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) vaccine event this afternoon, the President has made
equity a key part of his response.  Some mixed results on that.  Some
states have no data — for instance, on race — of people vaccinated. 
Other states, the data is showing that white and Asian people are
getting the vaccine disproportionately as compared to black and Latino
people.  Does the President think enough is being done with regards to
equitably distributing the vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President has always known from the day he took office,
and as has the Vice President, that addressing — ensuring that we
equitably distribute the vaccine would be a big challenge because there
was a lack of accurate data, as you referenced; because it is
challenging.  You have to use a number of approaches to get into
communities where there is vaccine hesitancy, which is an ongoing issue
that we’re working to address.  
   
So, of course, he feels that there is more that needs to be done and
that there’s more that, across his team, he will continue to encourage
people to take action on.   
   
Now, there are a number of steps, including partnering with community-
and faith-based organizations; enhancing public transit options; working
— of course, distributing vaccines to pharmacies; opening mass
vaccination sites that we are taking as an administration to more
equitably distribute the vaccine.  But there’s more work to be done.   
   
And we expect, as we get to the point where there are enough vaccines
for Americans — 300 million by the time we get to the end of July, or if
not sooner — that one of the challenges will be, you know, ensuring it’s
equitably distributed and that people who are — have a history of
vaccine hesitancy take the vaccine.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    There are reports that if Congress launches a 9/11- style
commission to investigate the January 6th insurrection, Nancy Pelosi
would want it to have seven Democrats and four Republicans as part of
the makeup.  Would the White House be satisfied with that, or would you
rather see it more evenly distributed by party?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We leave that up to Congress — leaders in Congress — to
determine what that will look like.  
   
Q    And on immigration: Why does the White House think there is this
surge of unaccompanied children right now?  Your critics are saying it’s
because you’re not sending anybody back — any of these unaccompanied
children back.  Do you share that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think there’s a couple reasons.  One, there’s
conditions that are in these countries that we have not done enough to
help improve.  And that’s why there is funding in the President’s
immigration bill and why — one of the reasons we’re eager to have it
passed.   
   
We don’t feel that sending unaccompanied minors, kids, back to take a
dangerous journey is the right step to take.  And that’s not something
that we’re going to do as an administration, and it won’t be our
policy.  But we always need to keep communicating more effectively about
how this is a dangerous time to travel; this is a dangerous time for
families to come, for children to come.  And we’ll continue to work to
do that more.  
   
Q    And when the President had half a dozen Republican lawmakers in the
Oval Office yesterday, they came out, they shared they thought it was a
good meeting.  But they said the COVID-19 rescue package never came up. 
Why not?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, did they raise the COVID-19 rescue package?  
   
Q    I don’t — the President says that he makes it a top priority.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of course.  
   
Q    He talks about it with great urgency.  He could’ve brought it up. 
And I’m just curious why he didn’t.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the meeting was about a supply chain executive order,
something that there is a great deal of interest on and bipartisan
support for.   
   
The only time the President talks about the American Rescue Plan is not
in meetings in the Oval Office; he picks up his phone and calls
Democrats, Republicans, and others on a regular basis.  And I think he’s
used every opportunity he has to make the case publicly to have those
conversations.  And it’s probably why more than 70 percent of the
public, including the majority of Republicans, support the plan.  
   
Q    So that is not a signal that the President has conceded he is just
going to pass the package with Democrats?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hardly.  Look, I think the President’s view is that this is
a package that will help get the pandemic under control; it will help
put people back to work.   
   
If somebody has a better idea, by all means, bring it forward.  We have
not seen one.  This is a plan that he remains committed to, and he is
hopeful that Republicans, many in Congress, will follow what their
constituents want.  And the American people clearly want this Rescue
Plan passed.  They clearly want money for vaccinations.  They clearly
want schools to reopen and funding to reopen schools.  And they clearly
want direct checks.  
   
So, hopefully, members will listen to that.  And we have plenty of time
for Republicans to vote for the package.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you, everyone.
