James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:31 P.M. EST  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  Hello.  
   
Q    Hello.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Joining us today is Bharat Ramamurti, the Deputy Director of
the National Economic Council for Financial Reform and Consumer
Protection.   
   
Bharat was formerly the Managing Director of the Corporate Power Program
at the Roosevelt Institute.  He also served on the Congressional
Oversight Commission for the CARES Act, a position he was appointed to
by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer last year.  Previously, Bharat
was the top economic adviser to Senator Elizabeth Warren during her 2020
presidential campaign and Senior Counsel for Banking and Economic Policy
in her Senate office.  
   
He will give you some brief — deliver some brief remarks, take a few
questions.  And thank you so much for joining us.   
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  Good afternoon.  Earlier today, the President had the
chance to visit a couple of small businesses here in town.  One is a
locally owned hardware store that’s been around for 150 years.  The
other, which leases part of the same space, is an urban farm that was
founded just eight years ago.  
   
Like other small businesses across the country, these companies help
serve their communities.  The hardware store sponsors Little League
teams and holds events with the Cub Scouts.  The urban farm serves
hundreds of local households and supplies food for local farmers
markets.   
   
Unfortunately, a lot of companies like this, with fewer than 20
employees, were left out of previous rounds of small-business relief. 
Too many mom-and-pop businesses and too many minority-owned businesses
were left behind, while larger, well-connected businesses got funds
quickly.  
   
The President and the Vice President have made it a top priority to
ensure that this round of small business relief is distributed more
equitably and that the companies that may not have gotten relief before
have a shot at getting relief now.  So, today we want to share some
early results of how this administration is already making good on that
commitment.   
   
On Monday, February 22nd, the President announced important changes to
the Paycheck Protection Program, which is the primary small-business
relief program that the federal government offers.  These changes were
intended to ensure that mom-and-pop businesses, minority-owned
businesses, businesses in rural areas, and other underserved categories
of businesses got the help that they needed.  
   
These changes included instituting a 14-day period — starting on
Wednesday, February 24th — during which only businesses with fewer than
20 employees could apply for relief.  The idea behind the exclusivity
period was to give lenders time to focus on reaching out to smaller
businesses, including businesses that may not have — that they may not
have worked with before, and to make sure that these smaller mom-and-pop
shops had their — had time to get their applications in and approved.  
   
And at the same time as the President’s announcement, the administration
launched a whole-of-government effort to let small-business owners and
lenders know about this opportunity; the Small Business Administration
launched a series of conversations, reaching thousands of community
leaders through webinars every day; White House officials held calls
with — that ended up reaching thousands of small-business owners
directly; and the administration partnered with Congress to help members
spread the word about the changes and conduct outreach with their
constituents.  
   
So now we’re reaching the end of the two-week exclusivity period and the
results are pretty striking.  When comparing the data from the
exclusivity period with the 10 days preceding the exclusivity period,
we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of loans to the smallest
firms, to minority-owned and women-owned firms, and to first-time PPP
participants.   
   
Specifically, we’ve approved more than 300,000 loans for businesses with
fewer than five employees, and that’s a 15 percent increase compared to
the pre-exclusivity period.  We’ve approved nearly 200,000 loans to
first-time PPP borrowers, which represents a 25 percent increase.   
   
There’s been a 20 percent increase in loans to minority-owned
businesses, and that translates to an additional 1,000 minority-owned
businesses accessing relie- — relief every single day of the exclusivity
period.  
   
There’s been a 14 percent increase in loans approved to women-owned
businesses, which translates to an additional 600 women-owned businesses
accessing relief every day.  
   
And there’s been a 12 percent increase in loans approved to businesses
in rural areas.  
   
But that’s not all.  On February 22nd, the President also announced
several other changes to expand access to PPP.  And as of last Friday,
the SBA had implemented all of these changes.  And we’re already
starting to see some early momentum from those changes as well.    
   
For example, nearly 30,000 loan applications had previously been flagged
because the small-business owners were delinquent on their federal
student loans.  We removed that restriction and can now advance those
applications.  And tens of thousands of new applications have already
come in after we increased the amount of relief available to sole
proprietors and the self-employed.  
   
So I want to take this opportunity to say to the small-business owners
out there: There’s still plenty of time left in this program.  There’s
still plenty of money available to you.  Go to SBA.gov, contact your
lenders, and see if you qualify for relief.   
   
The administration is going to continue to conduct outreach and spread
the world — the word about these relief efforts and what’s available to
small businesses.  But, of course, our view is that that’s not enough,
and that’s why the American Rescue Plan includes more than $50 billion
in additional aid for small businesses.  It provides more than $28
billion in grants to support the hard-hit small restaurants through the
Restaurant Revitalization Fund, which was a bipartisan proposal in
Congress.  It provides $15 billion in grants to help the smallest, most
severely affected businesses, especially those that serve lower-income
areas.  It provides $10 billion to restore the successful State Small
Business Credit Initiative, which leverages private dollars to provide
working capital to small businesses.  And it creates a Community
Navigator program so that small-business owners can get help figuring
out how to actually get the relief that they’re entitled to, even if
they don’t have a team of lawyers and accountants on call.  
   
So, with that, I’m happy to take some questions.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, go ahead.   
   
Q    This is related to something that we’re seeing on the Hill.  And
there is, sort of, an increasing movement amongst Senate Democrats to
get extended unemployment insurance and stimulus checks added to the
next Build Back Better legislation.  As you’re aware, Senator Durbin has
signed onto it.  And they argue that this is needed to sort of keep —
both of these things are needed to keep people out of poverty.  I’m
wondering if you agree with that assertion from an economic standpoint,
and what your thoughts are.  
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  Well, number one, the American Rescue Plan has been
documented by several independent experts as providing a tremendous
amount of relief all by itself to lower-income and middle-class
families.  Between the economic impact payments, the checks, the changes
to the Child Tax Credit, this — there’s going to be an enormous infusion
of relief for lower-income and middle-income families.  
   
As you know and as the President has said, this is only step one.  Step
two is the Build Back Better agenda.  And I think we’re still trying to
think through what the aspects of that program are going to be.  We
actually — we have received the letter from the senators who’ve talked
about potentially including recurring relief payments in it.  We’re
looking at the idea, but we’re still thinking through the contours of
what’s going to be in that next package.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you.  So, earlier today at the event, President
Biden said that “a lot of \[PPP\] money went to people who shouldn’t
have…” got it.  I was hoping you could elaborate on that.  
   
And also I was wondering if you had any thoughts on concerns about
inflation with the new stimulus bill that’s about to be passed.  
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  Sure, so on — on one — on the President’s statements, I
believe he was referring to the fact that in the previous round of PPP,
in the previous administration, there was documented problems from the
Inspector General of the Small Business Administration that tens of
thousands of companies that were not eligible for PPP ended up receiving
it.  In part, that was because the previous administration did not put
any checks in place on the front end — in other words, when the
application was received — to make sure that these were eligible
companies.   
   
We’ve changed that.  There is now significant upfront checks to make
sure that any application that’s submitted meets the criteria for the
program.  And at the same time that we’ve instituted those, we still are
processing nearly 100 percent of applications within 48 hours.  So we’ve
tried to find the right balance between making sure that folks who are
not eligible don’t get the — don’t get the relief, but the folks who are
eligible get it as quickly as possible.  And we think that’s a
significant change from the previous administration.  
   
On inflation: It’s something that, as the President has said, as
Secretary Yellen has said, we are monitoring carefully.  You know, our
belief has been, from the beginning, that the risk of doing too little
to help American families outweighed the risk of doing too much.  That
said, we will always be carefully monitoring inflation, and we will
continue to do so going forward.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Given the President is on the verge of signing the
relief bill overseeing vaccines rolling out at a quicker pace, could you
give us just a broad sense of where you think we will be with the
economy at the end of this year?  Secretary Yellen has addressed
employment for 2022, but what about the forecast for right now — the end
of year, I should say?  
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  So, Moody’s, which is an independent Wall Street firm,
projected that the American Rescue Plan would bring back roughly 7
million additional jobs by the end of the year.  You know, we — we think
that that’s a pretty reasonable forecast.   
   
There are — as we said, there’s a significant amount of relief that is
going out to lower-income, middle-income families through this bill.  As
you said, the vaccine rollout is accelerating.  Obviously, that, in many
ways, is the key to accelerating the economic recovery, so we’re
optimistic about that.  And there’s good, credible, independent experts
that suggest that we will be making a big, big step towards getting
these 10 million jobs that we’re short back by the end of the year.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Aamer.   
   
Q    Low interest rates have made it possible to finance many of these
initiatives.  How much debt is too much debt?  
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  Well, look, I think the way to look at it is not in
terms of, necessarily, the sheer amount of debt, but what are the
payments that you have to make on the debt.  And then that — that’s why
the interest rates are relevant to this.   
   
We are in an extended period of historically low interest rates.  And
not to get too wonky, but there are some structural factors that would
suggest that interest rates are going to remain permanently or — or —
there’s pressure keeping them down over the long term.   
   
We are carefully monitoring this.  The President has made clear that
being fiscally responsible is a priority of his.  He’s also made clear
that, right now, one of the best things that we can do is deficit
finance these investments because that’s what gets the economy moving
more quickly.  And in the long term, growth helps bring down the debt
and deficit levels as well.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, the last one to Bloomberg.  I promise he’ll come back,
but we promised we’d let him go soon.  
   
Q    Thank you.  As the administration considers what elements are going
into the Build Back Better plan, some economists have written the White
House to ask that a path to citizenship for some undocumented
immigrants, including essential workers, be included in that.  So, can
you describe the White House’s current thinking on whether to include
that provision in the plan?  
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  That is a priority of the President’s.  I think we have
not made a decision yet on whether to include or not include that. 
Honestly, in the short term, we are focused on trying to get the
American Rescue Plan into law, and then going out and telling the
American people what was in the American Rescue Plan and how it’s
helping them.   
   
You know, we will continue to work on putting together the next step of
this — the recovery part of this that the President has previewed — but
we’re not quite there yet.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you so much.  Thanks for joining us.   
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  And we’ll look forward to having you back in the future.  
   
MR. RAMAMURTI:  Thanks.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  As the President said last week, once the Rescue Plan
is signed, we’ll be able to start getting payments out this month. 
Treasury and IRS are working tirelessly to make that happen.  The IRS
and Bureau of the Fiscal Service are building on lessons learned from
previous rounds to increase the number of households that will get
electronic payments, which are substantially faster than checks.   
   
And a number of you, and obviously the American people, have asked a lot
of good questions about how this process works, so we thought we’d try
to answer some of them.  
   
For households who’ve already filed their tax — their income tax return
for 2020, the IRS will use that information to determine eligibility and
size of payments.   
   
For households that haven’t yet filed for 2020, the IRS will review
records from 2019 to determine eligibility and the size of payment. 
That includes those who used the “non-filer por-” — “non-filer portal”
for previous rounds of payments — which is a question I think somebody
asked, sort of, about, yesterday.  
   
For tax returns with direct deposit or bank account information, the IRS
will be able to send money electronically.  And for those households for
which Treasury cannot determine a bank account, paper checks or debit
cards will be sent.   
   
Of course, we’re not taking anything for granted.  We’re pushing through
the finish line here, but you all have asked some really good questions
about the implementation that we wanted to get ahead of.  
   
So here’s what this all means for a typical family of four with parents
making under $150,000 a year combined, and with kids in school age eight
and five:  
   
Because of the President’s Rescue Plan, that family of four will soon be
getting $5,600 in direct payments.  And because of the expanded Child
Tax Credit, they’ll get $2,600 in addition to that.  So that’s $8,200
more in the pockets of this family as they try to weather this storm, on
top of additional money in this bill to reopen schools safely, get shots
in arms, and help those who’ve lost their jobs through no fault of their
own.  
   
Another scheduling announcement for all of you: On Friday morning,
President Biden will meet virtually with his counterparts in the Quad:
Prime Minister Suga of Japan, Prime Minister Modi of India, and Prime
Minister Morrison of Australia.  
   
   
Formed in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami and formalized in 2007, the
Quad has met regularly at the working and foreign minister level. 
However, Friday will be the first time that the Quad is meeting at the
leader level.   
   
That President Biden has made this one of his earliest multilateral
engagements speaks to the importance we place on close cooperation with
our allies and partners in the Indo- Pacific.  A range of issues, of
course, will be discussed — we expect to be discussed, I should say —
facing the global community from the threat of COVID, to economic
cooperation, and of course, to the climate crisis.  
   
Earlier today — final piece here — our COVID Coordinator, Jeff Zients,
had a weekly governor — call with governors from across the country.  He
announced Pfizer and Moderna supply will get increased to 15.8 million
doses going out to states, tribes, and territories, along with 2.7
million first doses going to pharmacies.  He also highlighted the
progress we’ve made as a nation on vaccinations.  
   
On January 20th, there was a seven-day average of 890,000 shots per
day.  Today we’re averaging 2.17 million shots per day.  So that’s
obviously a significant increase.  
   
Finally, of course, he reiterated our commitment to working and
collaborating with governors from both parties and continued — and
encouraged continued focus on masking, social distancing while our
vaccination program continues to ramp up.   
   
Why don’t you kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks.  Question on what the influx of young people and just
migrants in general to the southern border.  Is there any sense — and I
ask this question with the pers- — obviously, you’re only two months
into the administration, but early on, you and Secretary Mayorkas very
much stressed humanity in trying to move away from the last
administration.   
   
Do you — does the message need to be tweaked at all?  Do you need to say
that it’s not just about humanity, but also “You might not get in,” or
“You probably aren’t going to be able to stay”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, humanity will always be a value from the President on
down.  But you are right that we are continuing to work to convey to
people in the region that this is not the time to come, that the
majority of people who come to the border will be turned away, which is
factually accurate.   
   
And what we’re really talking about, in terms of the people who are
being let in, are unaccompanied children — that is a policy decision
which we made because we felt it was the most humane approach to
addressing what are very difficult circumstances in the region.  And
that means there are more children — kids under the age of 18, of course
— coming across the border.  
   
Q    At this point, is this a crisis at the border?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Look, I don’t think we need to sit here and put new labels
on what we have already conveyed is challenging, what we have conveyed
is a top priority for the President, what our policy teams are working
on every single day.   
   
They, obviously — there was a trip to the border this weekend.  They are
working over the course of every day since then on putting in place
policies that can help address what we’re seeing and help ensure that we
are keeping these kids safe and moving them as quickly as possible from
Border Patrol facilities to shelters where they can have access to
educational resources, health resources, mental health resources, legal
aid, et cetera.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On — follow-up on that, Jen.  Thanks.  There are reports out there
that the number of unaccompanied migrants detained at the border has
tripled in the last two weeks to 3,200-plus.  Is that number
accurate?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to confirm numbers from here.  Obviously, the
Department of Homeland Security and others are — oversee the programs
and the engagements that happen at the border.   
   
I will say that there are a couple of reasons.  I know Aamer asked about
our, kind of, change in policy, but there are a couple of reasons why we
think people are coming to the border.  Of course, individuals are
fleeing countries where individuals and families are — you know, they’re
fleeing prosecution, fleeing violence, fleeing economic hardships, and
other things.   
   
The region has also experienced two hurricanes in the fall, putting
further stress on the conditions in these countries and the
circumstances that are facing individuals.  And all of this is taking
place during a global pandemic that has impacted other countries’
economies, placing undue hardships on its people, just as it did in the
United States.  So there are also a range of factors that are leading
individuals to come to the border.  
   
Q    But, Jen, why won’t you confirm that number?  That’s a very
important number.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I — we’ve been very clear that there is an increase, that
there are more children coming across the border than we have facilities
for at this point in time.  Those numbers are tracked by the Department
of Homeland Security, so I’m certainly — I’m just suggesting that you
talk to them about specifics.  
   
Q    But we’ve talked to them, Jen.  They won’t confirm the numbers.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would encourage you to go back to them and ask them
again.  We’re not going to confirm them from the White House.  It’s not
our program; it’s the Department of Homeland Security’s —  
   
Q    Are you encouraging the Department — is the White House encouraging
the Department to release those numbers then, in the spirit of
transparency that the Secretary promised here at this podium?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We certainly encourage transparency, but what I also think
is important is to talk about what the root causes are here and what
we’re doing from a policy standpoint to try to address the challenges
that we’re facing and that these kids are facing as they come across the
border.  
   
Q    And on COVID relief, do — should we expect to see the President
travel to — perhaps after he signs this bill — to highlight the benefits
of — to the American —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  After the American Rescue Plan is signed?  
   
Q    Yes.  Yes.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  We certainly recognize that we can’t just sign a bill
again.  We’re not taking anything for granted.  We’re getting across the
finish line, but — that we will need to do some work and use our best
voices — including the President, the Vice President, and others — to
communicate to the American people the benefits of this package; how
they can benefit from the package; how they can have access to checks —
part of the reason I wanted to do that at the top; how it will help
schools reopen.   
   
And so I think you can certainly expect the President to be doing some
travel, and we’ll have more details on that in the coming days. 
Absolutely.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  You talked about the need of getting these 3,000 or
so — potentially — children out of the Border Patrol facilities and into
HHS facilities that are meant to house children.  How quickly can that
be done, and what is being done right now to make sure it happens?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me walk you through a little bit of what the
considerations are and what our team is working on now.  
   
So, first, the reason why these kids are being let in — I’ve talked
about that a bit — but the majority of people come to the border are
still turned away or expelled under Title 42 — so families, adults, et
cetera.  We’re talking about children; I’m just level-setting here.  
   
When children are apprehended at the border, they are initially
processed, as you’ve noted, through Customs and Border Patrol
facilities, where they are held until they can be sent to HHS shelters
where the children have access to education services, medical and mental
health services.   
   
We’ve talked about this a little bit, but just to reiterate the reason
why: One of the challenges we’ve had is that COVID-19, the pandemic, had
initially severely limited the amount of children that could be taken
into HHS facilities and the pace at which that could happen.   
   
So one of our focuses is on working on seeing how we can address that. 
That includes looking at additional facilities.  It includes — there
were some CDC guidelines that was — that were released on Friday, and
those guidelines for HHS facilities will allow capacities to be returned
to pre-COVID numbers, all while taking other steps like increased
ventilation, additional masking, and other member — measures to continue
to keep these children safe.   
   
So one of the things we’re doing is implementing — working to implement
these recommendations so that we can ensure there are more kids who can
be safely in these facilities.  We are also, as I noted, working to
expedite — we’re looking at additional facilities where we can safely
house children and ensure they have access to all of the resources that
I noted.   
   
And finally, we’re also looking for ways that we can expedite the way
that we vet and process families and sponsor host families where these
kids can go.  Because, of course, once they go from CBP facilities,
which we are working to expedite that — we don’t want them to be in the
CBP facilities.  We want them to be in shelters as quickly as possible. 
And then ultimately, we want them to be in families and homes where
their applications can be — can be processed.  But we are looking to
expedite the way that we consider — the way that we vet families and
sponsor homes as well.  
   
Q    And last week, you weren’t ready to confirm that new facilities
might be brought online, including perhaps Fort Lee in Virginia or
Homestead, Florida.  Can you give us any new details about how many new
facilities might be repurposed and how quickly?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a good question.  I don’t have anything to confirm for
you in terms of new facilities.  We are looking at facilities; a lot of
consideration is underway.  And certainly, part of the reason is we’re —
we want to have more kids able to transfer from CBP facilities to HHS
facilities.  So the CDC guidelines helped us ensure there are more kids
able to have safely in a lot of these facilities.  But also, we’re
looking at facilities, but no decisions have been made at this point.  
   
Q    And can you tell us anything about any diplomatic efforts that are
taking place between the Biden administration and these Central American
countries to find ways to deter some of these children from coming to
the border?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a great question, and it’s a key part of our strategy. 
I’ve actually asked Roberta Jacobson if she could come join us in the
briefing room.  So we hope to do that sooner rather than later because
those are great questions that, I think, she would be an excellent
person to address.  
   
Q    But in the meantime, no information about any conversations that
are taking place between the U.S. and the —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — Honduras government, or —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, all I was conveying is a commitment to get you an even
— an expert —  
   
Q    Right.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  — that can — that is involved in these discussions who can
help answer your questions.   
   
But — and I also conveyed that it is a key priority for us and that
there are conversations going on at a number of levels — obviously
through our National Security team, through the State Department — about
the importance of conveying clearly this is not the time to come;
working with countries on how we can address the root causes.   
   
As you know but everyone may not know, one of the key proposals in the
President’s immigration bill is additional funding to address the root
causes, and that’s something we’re certainly communicating about.   
   
So — but I think what I heard from you is specific questions about
engagements.  A lot of those would be read out from the State
Department, but I’ve invited Roberta to come, and we’ll look forward to
having her here soon.    
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  So airlines have been urging the administration to
develop the guidelines for a travel passport so Americans can begin
traveling the country again.  Is that something the administration is
considering doing?  And do you think it’s a good idea for the government
to make those kind of guidelines?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  “Vaccine passports,” I believe they’re calling it.  Right?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we recognize that as many Americans get vaccinated,
questions will come up, and they’re already starting to come up, as to
how people will be able to demonstrate they are vaccinated.  I think
it’s important to remember only about 10 percent of the American
population is vaccinated at this point.  We’ve obviously made progress,
but we have more work to do.   
   
And right now, our focus, as the U.S. government, is on getting more
people vaccinated.  And we’ll think about how people can demonstrate
they are vaccinated as we get more people vaccinated.  But that’s where
we’re putting our energy and resources toward.  
   
We also know that the private sector, as you noted in your question, is
concerned and has raised this.  And we believe they and not-for-profits
will be driving this initiative, in all likelihood, moving forward.  
   
Q    So it sounds like the administration doesn’t want to get involved
in setting the standards for what would qualify someone for a vaccine
passport.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think a vaccine passport is something that’s been
designated by the — or an idea coming from the airlines.  What I’m
conveying is there are lots of ideas that will come from the private
sector and nonprofits.  We welcome those.  But our focus from the
federal government is on getting more people vaccinated, and that’s
where we feel we can use our resources best.  
   
Q    And on another subject, there’s a report today out in the South
China Morning Post that the U.S. and China are trying to set up some
sort of high-level diplomatic meeting in Alaska to try and reset
relations.  Is that — any kind of meeting like that — under — is that
being planned or is that under consideration right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have heard — or seen those reports.  I don’t have anything
to report out to you.  Obviously, the President spoke with President Xi
back — February 10.  And we will look forward to seeking opportunities
for engagement, but we don’t have any details finalized or confirmed at
this point.  
   
Q    And then, lastly, is there any further updates on when the
President —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The website?  Are you going to ask about the website?  
   
Q    Not the website.  Not today.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  You can.  You can.  I was ready.  
   
Q    I’ll save that one for next week.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    But on — for possibly next week, has the President chosen a date
yet or working with Congress on a joint address to Congress?  And what’s
that going to look like, as far as being virtual or in person?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any update on that for you.  And, certainly, as
soon as we have a date confirmed — we are looking forward to doing a
joint address.  We’re working through that with Congress.  Our focus now
is on the address the President will be delivering on Thursday night
during his first primetime address.  He’ll talk about COVID, what we’ve
been through as a country, and what the path forward looks like.  And
we’ll focus on the next address once we get through that.  
   
Go ahead, Kaitlan.  
   
Q    A few questions for you, but one on the stimulus checks.  You were
talking about who is getting them.  You and the President have both said
that they’re going to be going out this month.  But the last round, they
went out pretty quickly — I think within a few days.  So do you know any
more specific timing on when people should expect them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s something our Treasury team is working on and working
to expedite, of course.  And that’s a priority to the President.  
   
One of the steps they’re taking is working to ensure more people can get
them electronically because that, of course, speeds it up.  So let me
actually just give you — because I have a little bit more detail here,
Kaitlan, in terms of how it will work.  
   
So, the first batch of payments will go to all taxpayers who provided
direct deposit in their 2019 or 2020 returns, followed by taxpayers who
didn’t provide that information, but for whom the IRS has payment
information from other programs.  
   
And, of course, as the President said: Once the bill is passed, we’ll be
able to start getting these payments out this month.  But in terms of
more specifics, we’re waiting for them to get all their systems in
place, and then we’ll hope to have an update.  
   
Q    And any update on whether or not he wants his signature on there
like former President Trump demanded?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we are — we are doing everything in our power to
expedite the payments and not delay them, which is why the President’s
name will not appear on the memo line of this round of stimulus checks. 
The checks will be signed by a career official at the Bureau of Fiscal
Service.  
   
This is not about him; this is about the American people getting relief
— almost 160 million of them.  
   
Q    So did — he did not want his name to appear on the checks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He didn’t think that was a priority or a necessary step.
 His focus was on getting them out as quickly as possible.  
   
Q    Okay, thank you.  
   
And on immigration: You said you wanted to stay away from labels.  I
know the DHS Secretary has not wanted to call it a “crisis,” but instead
refer to it as a “challenge.”  But right now, since it is 3,200
unaccompanied migrant children, according to documents from Monday —
that’s higher than the peak of the 2019 border crisis when it was around
2,600 then.  And at that period, there were kids sleeping on floors. 
There were overcrowded facilities.  So when his delegation traveled
there, did they see that: people sleeping on floors and overcrowded
facilities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, one of the reasons is because there — we have a
different policy than the last administration.  We’re not turning kids
away at the border — unaccompanied children.  We’re also, of course, not
ripping them from the arms of their parents.  
   
And so, we know and — that we knew — we know there is going to be an
increased number of kids coming across the border.  There are several
steps, as we’ve talked about a little bit, that we’re working to address
that.  
   
The team, of course — we put out a readout of their meeting.  They are
going to do a meeting, of course, and give the President a full rundown
of what they saw on the ground — a trip they — that he asked them to
take.  And I’ll let them do that before we have more specifics.   
   
And we, of course, are committed to ensuring there’s transparency and
access for cameras to the facility as well.  
   
Q    So do we have a timeline on that: on when reporters will actually
be able to go in and see?  Because that was kind of — that was what was
so helpful last time —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — in showing people what it looked like inside there.  So is that
going to happen within the next week, or is it going to be pushed
further down the road than that?  When can cameras actually get inside
those facilities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We’re committed to doing that.  I don’t have a timeline for
you at this point in time.  We want to do it with respect for the
privacy of the people staying there, people who are being housed there —
but also abiding by COVID protocols.  And so we’re working through some
of those steps.  
   
Q    Okay.  My last question is: Did President Biden agree that the
travel restrictions should not be changed for people who are fully
vaccinated like the CDC said yesterday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The CDC guidelines?  That that was a determination made by
the CDC.  It wasn’t driven by or directed by the White House.  And as —
as Rochelle — Dr. Walensky has said, it’s just a first step.  And as
more people are vaccinated, they’ll look at ways to ease additional
restrictions.   
   
But there were some reasons, as she outlined, that travel was not a part
of this, according to what the health and medical experts who are
working at the CDC determined, which includes the impact of travel.  You
know, 10 percent of the population is vaccinated; 90 percent is not.   
   
It still remains, of course — it still is a concerning — a concerning —
there’s still a concerning impact of travel on people who are not
vaccinated, and also because we are still tracking and looking at the
impact of variants.  
   
So they will look at all these factors.  This, again, was just a first
step on guidelines, as she has said, and I’m sure they’ll look at a
range of factors, as they’ve committed to, as more people in the country
are vaccinated.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  A couple questions.  To follow up on the border, why
has this administration been so reluctant to call it a “crisis” with the
huge uptick in the number of migrants being detained, including
thousands of children?  If that doesn’t qualify as a crisis, what
does?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, because we think that it’s most important to explain
the substantive policy of what’s happening, what the root causes are of
why these kids are coming, and why — what we’re doing to try to solve
what is a very challenging circumstance at the border.  And that’s the
information the American people are looking for, so that’s what we’re
working to provide.  
   
Q    On a different note, can you clarify for us what happened with the
President’s dogs?  There’s some reports that one of them was involved in
a biting incident.  Can you clarify exactly what happened?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Champ and Major, the President and First Lady’s dogs
— members of the family — are still getting acclimated and accustomed to
their new surroundings and new people.  And, on Monday, the First
Family’s younger dog, Major, was surprised by an unfamiliar person and
reacted in a way that resulted in a minor injury to the individual,
which was handled by the White House Medical Unit with no further
treatment needed.  
   
It had been previously planned already for the dogs to be cared for by
family friends in Delaware during Dr. Biden’s travels to military bases
this week — she has a three-day trip this week — and the dogs will
return to the White House soon.  
   
Go ahead, Sabrina.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Two questions for you.  First off, House Democrats
are preparing to bring back earmarks as part of an effort to build
support for infrastructure legislation.  Does President Biden support
the return of earmarks?  And are there specific restrictions that he
would seek to prevent the kind of abuse that has occurred in the past?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Well, we don’t have an infrastructure bill yet. 
Don’t even know that it will be an infrastructure bill.  And in terms of
what it will look like and what the negotiations will require, we are
happy to have that conversation when it’s — when it’s appropriate.   
   
But right now, we’re focused on the American Rescue Plan, so we’re not
going to get ahead of the legislative strategy for a future bill.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) about President Biden’s position on earmarks more
broadly?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think anything has changed about his position.  He
obviously was in Congress for 36 years.  But in terms of what it will
look like or what restrictions would be on a new package, I’m sure he’ll
hear from and will be eager to listen to members of both parties and —
about their views on this issue.  And we’ll certainly factor it in as we
put together a new — his next step in the Build Back Better agenda.  
   
Q    Thank you.  And the second question: The Indian government has
threatened to jail employees at Facebook and Twitter if they do not
comply with the government’s data requests or requests that they take
down accounts associated with these farmers’ protests that have been
ongoing for months now.  What is the administration’s view of a foreign
government threatening to jail employees at U.S. companies?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly we believe in freedom of speech, freedom of
press, freedom of expression.  And it is a concern that the President
and others at the highest level raise at every opportunity, even — with
allies, with adversaries.  
   
And — but in terms of specific conversations about this, I expect the
State Department would be closest to those engagements.  
   
Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  So my question is on the CDC guidelines yesterday. 
It’s obviously very big news for families.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    But the message that we heard from officials was all about
families.  We didn’t hear anything about school reopening tied to these
guidelines.  If vaccinated grandparents can be with their unvaccinated
children without masks, how do you apply that same standard to
schools?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, these guidelines were — I don’t want to get over my
skis here, as a non- — I am not a doctor.  But these guidelines were
very specific to the — to what — recommendations made for people’s
homes, right?  So, Karen, you and your husband and your kids can, you
know, engage with and have dinner with your neighbors when everybody is
vaccinated.  That is certainly a positive step forward for many, many,
many Americans.  
   
These were not guidelines for a workplace, whether it is the White House
or a business or a school.  There were guidelines provided, of course,
for schools.  And I think the CDC is — sees it as imperative that they
take different circumstances with different — looking at the — the very
specific engagements, the number of people, the risks as a factor in
what guidelines they’re going to put forward.  
   
Q    When can we see guidelines as more people get vaccinated, then,
applied to schools or applied to workplaces, or with these same
standards?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, they will continue to review, as Dr. Walensky has
said.  As more people are vaccinated, there’s a greater opportunity to
make recommendations that will allow people to spend time together; to
hug grandparents, cousins, teachers — and certainly that’s all of our
hope.    
   
But they look at all the factors, including the impact of variants, as
she’s talked — as she talked about when she rolled this out — and make
recommendations based on how to keep the public safe.  
   
And, you know, there is a concern that has been raised by all of our
medical experts about not taking our foot off the gas here.  We are — we
are close, relatively so, given the last year we’ve been through.  And
they put out these guidelines because they feel comfortable that — you
know, about the data they have, as it relates to vaccinated
individuals.  
   
But, of course, they need to continue to analyze data, look at health
and medical advice, talk to the doctors at the CDC before they make
additional recommendations.  
   
Q    The President is vaccinated.  How will he change his behavior based
on these guidelines?  Will he see grandkids more?  Will he see family in
a different way than he was doing before these guidelines came out?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, of course, the President abides by the CDC
guidelines, as no one would — would be expected to hear, but he also
believes he needs to be a model for the American people and all
citizens.  I haven’t — this is a great question.  I haven’t talked to
him about how it will impact him personally in that way.  I’m happy to
venture to do that, or all of you could ask him next time you have the
opportunity.   
   
But I noted that — and this was a good question someone asked, I think,
over the last 24 hours, about how it impacts us here.  And, you know,
the White House is a place of work, right?  It is not a private home. 
And so we will continue to wear masks, we will continue to be tested, we
will continue to socially distance until our health and medical experts
tell us otherwise.  
   
Go ahead in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  So two follow-ups and then a couple of questions. 
First, the follow-ups about the Quad virtual meeting.  Can we see this
as a prelude to reengaging the TPP?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn’t see it as a direct connection to that, no.  This
is an opportunity to engage —  
   
(A staff member’s chair makes a squeaking sound.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:    — at a — engage at a —  
   
Newbie.  (Laughter.)  
   
— engage at a high level — at an even higher level than has been done in
the past with key partners to the United States.  Japan, Australia —
they’re –- they’re key partners to the United — and India, sorry —
they’re key partners to the United States.   
   
There’s a range of issues to discuss and work together on — whether it’s
addressing the climate crisis, whether it’s working together to address
the global pandemic, or, of course, economic cooperation.  But I
wouldn’t see it through those prisms.  The President has been clear
about his commitment to rebuilding the middle class and looking at any
engagement — trade engagement through that prism.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.  As for Jordan’s story — question about the South
China Morning Post eventual discussion in Anchorage, I have a — my
colleague from Kyodo News, the Japanese news agency, is asking: How will
the Biden — more broadly, how will the Biden administration plan to
engage with the Chinese?  Are direct talks under consideration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Direct talks with the Chinese?  
   
Q    That’s correct.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I mean, the President has spoken with President Xi
already.  So, of course, we remain engaged directly through — at a range
of levels, and that will continue.  
   
Q    Like summit — like a summit type of event?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not here to predict a summit.  Of course, there’ll be a
range of engagements that the President and his National Security team
will have with China and other countries in the region in the months and
years ahead, but we are directly engaged.  There are a range of issues
we, of course, have talked with the Chinese about through those
engagements.  We don’t hold back about our concerns, but we also look
for opportunities to work together.  
   
Q    Jen, just a week — actually, eight days, precisely, before the
President entered the White House, the previous administration put Cuba
back on the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.  Does the President
share this view?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve talked about this a little bit in here before
and nothing has really changed, but I’m happy to reiterate our policy.  
   
Our policy, as it relates to Cuba, will be governed by two principles:
First, support for democracy and human rights will be at the core of our
efforts through empowering the Cuban people to determine their own
futures.  Second, Americans, especially Cuban Americans, are the best
ambassadors for freedom and prosperity in Cuba.   
   
A Cuba policy shift is not currently among President Biden’s top
priorities, but we are committed to making human rights a core pillar of
our U.S. policy, and we’re committed to carefully reviewing policy
decisions made in the prior administration, including the decision to
designate Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  
   
Q    Very, very last question.  I promise.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Okay?  It’s about the border.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    You keep repeating, “This is not the time to come.”  Will there be
a — isn’t that sending the signal that there will be a time to come? 
“Just wait.”  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first to be clear, even these unaccompanied children
who come across the border — who we’ve talked about; we want to keep
safe; we want to ensure they are in shelters where there is access to
education services, legal services, health services; we want to ensure
that they are then quickly moved to vetted families or sponsor homes —
many of them don’t stay because they go through the process of having
their applications reviewed.  We just want to keep them safe because
they are kids under the age of 18.   
   
And when we say, “It’s not the time to come now,” the reason is: This is
a — we are still digging our way out of a dismantled, immoral, and
ineffective immigration policy that was being implemented by the last
administration that was largely based around funding for a border
wall.   
   
It’s going to take us some time.  And we do want to put in place —
modernize the immigration system, which means investing in smart
security, which means creating a pathway to citizenship, which means
funding and supporting efforts to address the root causes in the
region.  And we — as a part of that, we want to ensure that there is
effective processing at the border.   
   
We’re not trying to close our borders.  We are trying to keep — create
an effective, moral, humane system.  It’s going to take some time to do
that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  I’d like to ask about three things, if that’s
okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of course.  
   
Q    The dogs, immigration, and then Governor Cuomo.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Another dogs question?   
   
Q    Right.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, go ahead.  
   
Q    I’d like to follow — just a quick clarification on the dogs.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Okay.  
   
Q    Can you confirm that it was a Secret Service member who was
bitten?  And can you also reassure the public that Major Biden will not
be euthanized as a result of this?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, certainly, Major Biden is a member of the family, so I
can assure you that.  I don’t have details on the individual.  I would
encourage you to ask the Secret Service, but I’m not going to have any
more individ- — details, other than that.  
   
Q    Then, on immigration, you’ve said repeatedly, “Now is not the time
to come,” but you’ve also noted there is a distinction for unaccompanied
minors that they’ll be allowed in.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    I want to revisit something that Secretary Mayorkas said last
week.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    He said that, quote, “loving parents,” end quote, were sending
nine-year-old children alone.  Of course, there are frequent — there’s
frequently physical and sexual abuse for migrants on — in transit and
also in U.S. custody.  So I was hoping to drill down on the messaging
there.  Do you think it’s important to send the message to children —
unaccompanied children that “now is not the time to come”; and to their
parents that it’s not a, quote, “loving act,” to send them?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think it’s imperative that we send the message that this
is a dangerous journey.  Children don’t make it.  They experience very
difficult circumstances on the journey.  
   
Now, the circumstances in a lot of these countries is such that the
parents feel that taking that risk is better than the circumstances
they’re living through.  
   
But we are very clear about this message in the region: that this is not
the time to come; that this is a dangerous journey; that we, of course,
are focused on modernizing our immigration system and making it a system
that can better process people at the border — make it more humane.  We
are going to abide by our laws and continue to implement those laws. 
But I can assure you that messages being sent clearly in the region.  
   
Q    So now is not the time to go for children as well?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Correct.   
   
Q    Okay.  And for the Governor Cuomo question: You’ve been asked this
many times about his — the sexual harassment allegations against him.  I
just wanted to confirm that you have spoken with both President Biden
and Vice President Harris about the allegations.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  And I’ve reiterated on their behalf that they believe
all women should be heard, that they should be treated with respect. 
They — there’s an independent investigation, as all of you know, that is
being led by the attorney general, who named, I believe, some individual
lawyers who will be in charge of that today, if I’m — if I’m reading
reports correctly.  And certainly, they respect that and believe that
should move forward.   
   
Q    Will either of them be speaking themselves about this — these
allegations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to predict for you on that front.  I’m
here to speak on their behalf, so that’s what I venture to do on a daily
basis.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    First off, my actual question is: We’ve heard a lot about dogs; we
were promised a White House cat.  What happened to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Where is the cat?  Today is a good day for the cat.  I don’t
have any update on the cat.  We know the cat will break the Internet,
but I don’t have any update on its status.  
   
Q    Okay.  And has the President now ruled out nominating Shalanda
Young for OMD Director?  Is she deputy for keeps?   
   
And he said Neera Tanden would have a job in the administration.  Where
are we on that?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Neera only pulled herself out of consideration six
days ago, if I’m doing my math — seven days ago, sorry — if I’m doing my
math correctly here.  The President is committed to her serving in a
role in the administration because he values her perspective and her
experience.  
   
In terms of Shalanda Young: No, we are — we have not made it — the
President has not made a decision about who he will nominate.  He thinks
so highly of her that he nominated her to serve as Deputy Director of
OMB — which is an enormous job in the administration.  And once she’s
confirmed, she will serve as Acting Director of OMB.  But I don’t have
any updates on the timeline or decision-making for the nominee.  
   
Q    And people in the running for some of the ambassadorships have been
told that Bob Igor has got the gig in London.  Are you able to make an
announcement today?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, they would be incorrect, given the President hasn’t
made any decisions about any ambassadorial roles.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On climate, John Kerry is on his first overseas trip in Brussels
right now.  What is President Biden hoping he’s going to accomplish
there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President asked John — former Secretary of State,
my former boss — to serve in this role because he knows about his — he’s
very familiar with his personal commitment to addressing the climate
crisis not just domestically, but, of course, internationally, which is
the role that former Secretary Kerry is playing.   
   
This is an opportunity for him to engage directly, now that we’ve
officially regained — rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, and to have
discussions with counterparts, with officials that the former Secretary
knows well from his experience as Secretary of State and working on
these issues for many decades.   
   
And I’m sure that he will be reporting back to the President when he
returns.  
   
Q    And Kerry mentioned in his remarks that he wants to raise the
ambition of the initial Paris Agreement.  How much more ambitious than —
than that agreement is the administration is willing to go?  And is
there a timeline for when you guys are going to announce the 2030
emissions targets?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s a great question.  I think we’ll wait for the
Secretary to return from his trip, and I’m sure he’ll have a
conversation with, of course, both Gina McCarthy, the President, the
Vice President, and others about what his recommendations are and what
there’s an appetite for out there in the global community.  But I don’t
have any predictions for you at this point in time.   
   
Great.  Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Joe Khalil with NewsNation.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes, hi.  First time here.  Right?  
   
Q    Yes.  Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Welcome.  
   
Q    I’m a newbie as well.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Good.  There you go.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    So, on the American Rescue Plan, there are two far-reaching
measures — the Child Tax Credit, which you’ve mentioned, and the
Affordable Care Act subsidies — that are both now temporary measures. 
There are some calls on the Hill to make them more permanent.  Is
President Biden interested in working with Congress to make them more
permanent?  
   
And if you could, please address some of the criticism that those two
measures specifically have been getting — that they are not in any way
related to COVID relief or stimulus directly.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say: If you’re a family with kids, then the
notion that the Child Tax Credit is unrelated to the economy is an
absurd notion.  So I don’t know who the critics are, but I would be
surprised if they had small children.   
   
I would say the President had talked about making the Child Tax Credit
permanent during the campaign.  He certainly is open to continuing to
look for avenues to do exactly that.  He believes that benefits, like
the $3,000 Child Tax Credit that is included in this package, are
benefits that help address what he and the Vice President feel is a
crisis, which is the large number of women who are leaving the workforce
and have left the workforce since the pandemic started.  So he will
certainly continue to look for avenues on that.  
   
What was the other piece — I’m sorry — you asked about — the other
one?  
   
Q    The Affordable Care Act subsidies.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, of course.  Look, I think one of the things the
President is committed to, what — has talked about — talked about on the
campaign, I should say, when he ran, was strengthening access to
affordable and accessible healthcare.   
   
So one of the things we did was we reopened the period of time where
people could apply to — on the — to get access to the benefits from the
Affordable Care Act.  We’ve seen a huge — a huge influx of people who
were not previously covered with health insurance do that.   
   
And he will certainly continue to look for ways to reduce the cost of
health insurance, to look for ways to expand it, to make it more
accessible.  And certainly, having lived — all lived through a pandemic,
the need for greater access to affordable healthcare is pretty front and
center for him and others in the administration.   
   
Sabrina.  
   
Q    Just a quick clarification on infrastructure —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — because President Biden has spoken often about the need for a
two-step rescue and recovery approach to the economy.  He’s held many
meetings on infrastructure and said the recovery plan would focus on
infrastructure, manufacturing, and other issues.  Were you saying that
you’re not sure there’s going to be an infrastructure bill, when I asked
about earmarks?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the — no decision has been made yet internally about —
look, the President has not made a secret about what he — what is in his
Build Back Better agenda; he talked about it on the campaign trail. 
Infrastructure is a part of that, and it’s something he’s had a long
commitment to.  He’s also had a long commitment to investing in
caregiving; to doing — investing in our manufacturing sector; to doing
something about our tax system.   
   
So there are a lot of components of his Build Back Better agenda.  What
I’m conveying is we’re still in a policy process, internally, about what
the next part of his agenda will look like and what the format, the
size, the order will look like.  So that’s all I was conveying.   
   
But certainly infrastructure is one of the areas where he feels there’s
opportunity for bipartisan support and for Democrats and Republicans to
work together.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    If I could follow up on that too.  The President made overtures to
Republicans when it came to COVID relief, inviting many of them to the
White House.  And, at this point, you have zero Republicans in the House
or Senate voting for this package.  Is there going to be a similar
effort to try to get Republicans on board if the next agenda item is an
infrastructure package?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he’s already had two bipartisan meetings on
infrastructure to date as he’s looking to gather ideas and hear from
Democrats and Republicans about how they feel we can continue to work
together and rebuild the economy.  
   
I would say that while we don’t expect — or did not receive, I should
say — to date, Republican votes for the American Rescue Plan, the
individual — the Republicans in D.C. are in — living in this ZIP Code,
are — seem to be outliers in the country, given the majority of people
in the country.  The majority of Republicans support this package.  So
maybe it’s a moment of self-reflection.   
   
But the President will continue to leave the door open to work with
Republicans on his agenda moving forward.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Another process question on Build Back Better —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    — which is:  I know it’s early days, but is the White House
committed to getting bipartisan support for an infrastructure package? 
Or — and would you rule out, at this stage, moving that through
reconciliation, like you guys did the American Rescue Plan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President’s preference is certainly to work
together in a bipartisan manner.  That’s part of why he’s had two
bipartisan meetings on infrastructure in the Oval Office.  But we
haven’t made a determination about what’s next in his agenda, and
certainly we’re not going to take that off the table in terms of paths
forward that Congress may choose.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Is there enough money to deal with the surge into the border?  And
has there been any discussions of invoking emergency de- — an emergency
declaration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You mean in terms of opening additional facilities?  
   
Q    Right.  Right.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s a good question.  I’m happy to talk to our immigration
team and see if that’s part of the structural issue.  It may — as I
understand it, part of the issue is finding appropriate facilities and
determining what process steps can be taken to expedite the processing,
but I’m happy to talk to them about that —  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — and get an answer back to you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    On the infrastructure bill package: There was a bipartisan push
last year to knock down the payment of the top-paid federal employee:
the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, who reportedly earned $15
million last year in compensation.  There are Democrats in Congress who
support this.  The former President supported this.  Some conservatives
do.   
   
Does the Biden administration believe that an infrastructure bill should
slash this $15 million compensation for a federal employee?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I appreciate the opportunity.  The President believes
everyone should pay their fair share, but we don’t have a bill that
actually exists, so we’re not going to talk about what components would
be a part of it or not at this point in time.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Well, at the risk of asking you what is one of the components in
this hypothetical bill, a question from somebody who can’t be here
today, Andrew Feinberg: President Biden has repeatedly spoken of both
the need to upgrade the nation’s transport infrastructure and his desire
for the U.S. to become a leader in zero-emission vehicles.   
   
So since the federal Highway Trust Fund is funded by taxes on gas and
diesel fuel, which obviously wouldn’t be collected from zero-emission
vehicles, does that mean the President will insist that any
infrastructure bill will include a new funding source for it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I just am not going to get ahead of a bill that has not been
designed, formalized, finalized, packaged in terms of size, scope, or
timeline at this point in time.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay, thank you, everyone.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Have a great afternoon.
