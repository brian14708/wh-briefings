title: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, March 29, 2021

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:40 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.   
   
Q    Hello.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hello.  Okay, a couple of items for all of you at the top. 
First, welcome Andrew Bates, our new deputy press secretary.  Anyone who
covered the Biden campaign knows Andrew quite well.  And he just joined
our team after being — staying on the transition for the last two
months.  
   
Okay, this Wednesday, the President will be laying out the first of two
equally critically — critical packages to rebuild our economy and create
better-paying jobs for American workers.  He’ll talk this week about
investments we need to make in domestic manufacturing, R&D, the
caregiving economy, and infrastructure.  
   
In the coming weeks, the President will lay out his vision for a second
package that focuses squarely on creating economic security for the
middle class through investments in childcare, healthcare, education,
and other areas.  Throughout this process, we look forward to working
with a broad coalition of members of Congress to gather their input and
ideas, and determine the path forward, create good jobs, and make
America more competitive.  
   
I’ll also note that he’s doing this in Pittsburgh, where he launched his
campaign for the presidency just two years ago.  
   
Today, the CDC also announced a 90-day extension of the federal eviction
moratorium.  The news was out earlier today.  The moratorium was
scheduled to expire on March 31st and is now extended through June
30th.  The President is committed to supporting renters and small
landlords through the COVID-19 crisis.   
   
Essential to that effort is, of course, the American Rescue Plan, which
delivers an additional $21.5 billion in emergency rental assistance to
help millions of families keep up on rent and remain in their homes. 
This, of course, is an act that included coordination from the Treasury
Department, from HUD, from the USDA, the CFPB, and the FTC.  They’re all
coordinating efforts.   
   
Today, the White House convened leaders from across the administration
and is taking coordinated steps to announce a set of bold actions that
will catalyze offshore wind energy and create good-paying union jobs. 
The President recognizes that a thriving offshore wind industry will
drive new jobs and economic opportunity up and down the Atlantic Coast,
in the Gulf of Mexico, and in Pacific waters.   
   
We just released a factsheet on this announcement — pretty detailed. 
The Department of Interior — Interior, Energy, and Commerce announced a
shared goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind in the United States
by 2030, while protecting biodiversity and protecting ocean co-use. 
Meeting this target will trigger more than $12 billion per year in
capital investment in projects on both U.S. coasts, create tens of
thousands of good-paying union jobs with more than 44,000 workers
employed in offshore wind by 2030, and nearly 33,000 additional jobs in
communities supported by offshore wind activity.  
   
It will also generate enough power to meet the demand of more than 10
million American homes and avoid 78 million metric tons of carbon
emissions.   
   
Additionally, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Maritime Administration
today is announcing a Notice of Funding Opportunity for port authorities
and other applicants to apply for $230 million for port and intermodal
infrastructure-related projects through the Port Infrastructure
Development Program.  
   
Last item is, I have a — some — an update for you on the flooding that
has occurred in the Tennessee Valley.  The Department of Homeland
Security and media sources report four fatalities and over 150 rescued
in the Tennessee Valley as heavy rainfall swamped the area, flooding
homes and roads, including parts of Nashville.  The President and the
White House continue to monitor the situation very closely and stand at
the ready, should any federal — federal assistance be requested or
required.  At this time, no request for federal assistance have come
in.   
   
The National Weather Service reports over nine inches of rain has fallen
over the past 24 hours, of course causing this massive flooding.  
   
Jonathan, why don’t you kick us off?  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  The CDC director today delivered an impassioned
warning against a rise in COVID cases and said it filled her with a
sense of, quote, “impending doom.”  We’re seeing cases rise in many
states.  My question is: Does the President plan out to reach directly
to governors, including the Democratic governors in states like New
York, New Jersey, in Michigan that are seeing real rises?  And does he
plan to ask them to slow down or pause them reopening their states?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Jonathan, we are in very close touch with governors of
those states and states across the country, not only through our weekly
governors call that is led by our COVID coordinator, but through calls
and engagements that happen through the course of the week and through
the course of every day.   
   
And the President has not held back in calling for governors, leaders,
the American people to continue to abide by the public health
guidelines, whether they are mask mandates on federal land and buildings
or on interstate travel; whether it’s, you know, encouraging people to
hand wash and abide by social distancing.  He will continue to do that
through all of his engagements and, of course, through calls he has with
local officials.  But we are in very close touch with leaders across the
country.   
   
Q    So, my follow-up to that is — but this is probably the most
precarious moment the country has had, in terms of the virus, since the
President took office.  This was according to CDC direct- — CDC director
today.  Will the President not take that additional step to get — to
talk to governors and ask them to slow down reopenings?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Jonathan, the President uses every opportunity he can,
whether it’s public — publicly, through every interview, through nearly
every public engagement he has.  He has remarks later this afternoon, as
you know, on COVID, providing an update on our effort to defeat the
virus.  He also does that through private engagements as well.   
   
But there are a range of officials at very high levels who are in touch
with governors and leaders across the country who will continue to
emphasize the need to abide by public health guidelines.  
   
Q    And one other topic.  Earlier, Majority Leader Schumer is making
the case that budget reconciliation can be used once more in the Fiscal
Year 2021.  If the Senate parliamentarian agrees with his argument, this
could be used a couple more times over the next year or so.  Does the
White House support that move?  And what would it mean for the
President’s agenda?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the White House and the President will leave the
mechanics of bill passing to Leader Schumer and other leaders in
Congress.  Our focus is on proposing an agenda — an ambitious agenda to
invest in infrastructure, to help caregivers across the country, to
ensure that we are doing more to help Americans get through this
challenging period of time.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank, Jen.  On infrastructure, since the President is set to
unveil his proposal in a couple of days now, what is his current
thinking or his economic advisors’ current thinking on how much of this
package needs to be paid for with tax revenue?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President has a plan to fix the infrastructure of
our country.  We’re currently 13th in the world; no one believes we
should be there.  And he has a plan to pay for it, which he will
propose.  But, right now, once he proposes that, our focus is also on
having that engagement and discussion with members of Congress.   
   
If they share a goal of building our infrastructure for the future but
don’t like the way he’s going to propose to pay for it, we’re happy to
look at their proposals.  If they don’t want to pay for it, I guess they
can propose that too.  Maybe they don’t support infrastructure
spending.   
   
So the President has an ambitious goal.  The most important thing is to
figure out how to invest in — put forward the investments in our
much-needed — that are much needed in our infrastructure.  What’s
irresponsible is not to address the urgent needs of that investment. 
But the means and mechanisms of paying for it — we look forward to
presenting his plans but also hearing proposals for others who may have
a difference of view.  
   
Q    Is there a concern that if you don’t pay for enough of it, that
it’ll have a drag on the economy, specifically by increasing the debt
and deficit?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, he’s going to have a plan to pay for it.  I’m
sure that if there are proposals out there that are differing from his,
in terms of what they will cover, we’ll have that discussion.  But he,
of course, believes that investing in our infrastructure, continuing to
create good-paying union jobs is front and center, but he also believes
that we have an opportunity to rebalance, to take — to address our tax
code that is out of date, and — and some could pay more in our country
that are not currently.   
   
Q    And on that front, just a clarification: Last week, you said the
tax increase threshold for the President is $400,000 a year, both for
individuals and households.  Is that correct?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  
   
Q    And what does the White House say to moderates who might be
concerned that hiking the corporate tax rate to, say, 28 percent will be
a drag on growth?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We haven’t seen evidence in that from economists, but if
they have alternative proposals to how to — for how to pay for investing
in our nation’s infrastructure, rebuilding our roads and our railways,
and putting Americans back to work, we’re happy to hear it.  
   
Q    And then finally, on the vaccine, Andy Slavitt talked about the
idea of a “vaccine passport” in the COVID briefing this morning.  He
said it’s primarily going to be spearheaded by the private sector.  But
what’s the President’s position on whether, once the vaccine is more
readily available, businesses should be able to tell employees who don’t
want to get the vaccine for whatever reason that they can’t come back
into the workplace, or that airlines could reject people from getting on
the plane if they have decided not to get a vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re going to provide guidance, just as we have,
through the CDC.  There’s currently an interagency process that is
looking at many of the questions around vaccine verification.  And that
issue will touch many agencies as verification is an issue that will
potentially touch many sectors of society, as you have certainly alluded
to.  That’s guidance we’ll provide.   
   
We expect — as Andy Slavitt, I think, alluded to — that a determination
or development of a vaccine passport, or whatever you want to call it,
will be driven by the private sector.  Ours will more be focused on
guidelines that can be used as a basis.  And there are a couple key
principles that we are working from.  One is that there will be no
centralized, universal federal vaccinations database and no federal
mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.   
   
Second, we want to encourage an open marketplace with a variety of
private sector companies and nonprofit coalitions developing
solutions.   
   
And third, we want to drive the market toward meeting public interest
goals.  So we’ll leverage our resources to ensure that all vaccination
credential systems meet key standards, whether that’s universal
accessibility, affordability, availability — both digitally and on
paper.  
   
But those are our standards.  It’s currently going through an
interagency process.  We’ll make some recommendations, and then we
believe it will be driven by the private sector.  
   
Q    And when do you anticipate those guidelines will come out?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have a timeline to provide you at this point, but
it’s obviously something we’re working through.  And we want to provide
that clarity to the public.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I want to talk about George Floyd.  Will the President be watching
or receiving updates on Derek Chauvin’s trial today?  And has he been in
touch with George Floyd’s family in the lead-up to trial?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, he certainly will be watching closely, as Americans
across the country will be watching.   
   
You know, at the time of George Floyd’s death, he talked about this as
being an event that really opened up a wound in the American public, and
it really brought to light for a lot of people in this country just the
kind of racial injustice and inequality that many communities are
experiencing every single day.  
   
And he’ll be watching it closely.  He’ll certainly be provided updates. 
Obviously, this is a trial that’s working its way through a law
enforcement — or a legal process, so we wouldn’t weigh in further than
that.   
   
But these were events that, at the time, he spoke about as being just a
reminder of also the need to — and it certainly impacted how he’s
thought about, in his own government, making equity central to what we
do, instituting and putting in place — racial injustice and addressing
racial injustice as a priority — one of the key crises that he believes
he is facing and we are all facing as a country.   
   
So it will continue to be central to what we do, and he will of course
be watching the trial closely.  
   
Q    And has he spoken to the family of George Floyd in the lead-up to
the trial?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not — I don’t have any calls to read out.  He obviously
spoke to them — or not “obviously.”  For those of you who didn’t follow
this closely, he did speak to them last spring, and spoke at the time
and commented at the time about their grace.  And I know he conveyed
that, and he was just impressed by their courage, and he continues to
believe that.  
   
Q    You said it redoubled his commitment to advancing racial justice in
this country.  He also committed to creating this national police
oversight commission during his first 100 days in office.  Has that been
created yet?  Is that still on track to being created?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’re encouraged, first, by the interest and
engagement by members of the House and Senate in the George Floyd bill,
which is making progress, and there’s discussions that are active at
this point in time.  That’s really where our focus is going to be at
this moment.   
   
We believe that — and he believes, I should say — that it is imperative
to put in place — in order to rebuild trust among communities, that
there needs to be accountability and there needs to be systems in place
to ensure that — and laws changed to ensure that that can be carried
out.   
   
So that is where our focus is.  The President supports that piece of
legislation.  And we’re hopeful that he will be able to — he will
receive a landmark reform bill on his desk.  
   
Q    So will the commission still be established in his first 100 days
in office?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any update on it other than to convey that this
bill is an opportunity to put in place a number of the actions that —
that he, that many in the advocacy community feel are imperative at this
point in our country’s history.   
   
Q    So it’s still kind of an open question here.  No firm commitment to
—  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any update on the timeline, but I think what’s
important to note is that the George Floyd bill, which would put in
place and make law a number of the accountability measures and actions
that he and so many who watched these events in horror feel are
imperative at our — this point our country.  
   
Q    One last question, if I could, Jen.  Thank you.  I want to just
turn to immigration really quickly here.  President Joe Biden has said
that surges like this happen every year.  We know that these cycles do
happen.  Axios is reporting that they have received documents that show
the surge of minors coming to the southern border is expected to last
seven or more months.  I just got back from the border; I spoke with
Texas state troopers who said they have never seen this many
unaccompanied minors crossing the United States border.  Are you guys
tracking that timeline for this current surge — that it’s going to last
seven months or more?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, what we’re working to do is put in place steps and
actions to help address the situation at the border, including, of
course, expediting processing and opening up additional shelters, but
also reinstituting policies like the Central American Minors Program to
encourage young people to apply in their country and not make that
treacherous journey.   
   
We are also in a circumstance where we are digging out of a broken
system over the past four years — not just the inhumane policies, but
the fact that there were never efforts put in place to look for and seek
shelters where these children could be safely and humanely housed.  They
had a different policy than the President has, of course, but also there
was a hiring freeze at ORR in the Refugee Resettlement Office, which
made it something that we had to also dig out of when we started.  
   
So that’s where our focus is on.  We are hopeful that, as we put these
in place — these measures — we can help to address and stem the
challenges at the border.  
   
Q    Just a quick follow-up, just firm answer here: Is the
administration expecting a surge in unaccompanied minors over the next
several months?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any predictions.  Those would certainly come
from CBP or the Department of Homeland Security.  But our focus now is
on ensuring that we have enough shelters, facilities to house
unaccompanied children.  We just opened three last week that would allow
for almost 7,000 additional beds.   
   
So that’s what our focus is in at this point in time.  We’ll leave the
projections to other agencies.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Just a couple of follow-ups.  On the commission,
there was some talk that that would be among the first things that he
did in his first week or two in office.  Did something happen that, kind
of, took that off the table and took your focus more towards the
legislative efforts?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  No, I think it’s just a reflection of our — I just don’t
have an update on it, but we are working with — very closely — with
outside advocacy groups, with many who have been passionately fighting
for greater accountability and greater reforms to be put in place.  And
we’re looking for the most effective means to get that done.  And the
George Floyd Bill is an opportunity to do exactly that, so that’s where
we are putting our energy and efforts at this point.  
   
Q    And then, one follow-up on Nancy’s first question.  Are you saying
the entirety of the President’s proposal laid out on Wednesday, you will
have payfor mechanisms, dollar for dollar, across the board?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Certainly.  Yep.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, the forthcoming WHO report — I know some people
have drafts of it — do you put — does the administration put any stock
into it whatsoever, given how it was put together?  And also, is the
U.S. working in a parallel way via its intelligence community, its
public health officials, to produce its own conclusions about the
origins of coronavirus?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s a little early for that last piece right now, but
let me give you an update on kind of where we are.   
   
The report — under embargo, of course — is now in the hands of U.S.
government experts from the CDC, FDA, NIH, HHS, USDA, DHS, and USAID —
that is a lot of acronyms.  Seventeen experts, longstanding leaders in
the fields, including epidemiology, public health, clinical medicine,
veterinary medicine, infectious disease, law, food security, biosafety,
biosecurity — we have a lot of experts in government — will be reviewing
this report intensively and quickly, and we have some of our best people
in government focused on reviewing it right now.  
   
We are also communicating closely with our partners and allies around
the world to share our ongoing concerns, which we have stated in the
past, of course, about the process and our scientific analysis of the
report itself once these individuals have concluded their review.   
   
We will wait for that review to conclude.  We have been clear that an
independent, technically sound investigation is what our focus is on. 
And once this is reviewed, we’ll have an assessment about the steps
forward.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then, last one.  A number of House committees last week
sent letters to, I think, 16 different agencies and the White House
about sending over documents of any communications in the lead-up to
January 6th and the lead-up to the joint session.  Do you guys plan to
cooperate with that inquiry?   And will you be responding both from the
White House side and on the agency side with that inquiry?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sure we will be cooperating with Congress, but I also
know there are many documents that some believe we have here that may
not be here; they might be in the archives.  So I think we’ll have to
look and see what documents they are, and I’ll talk to our counsel’s
office and see what our expectation is at this point in time.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Two questions, Jen.  On the campaign, the President talked about
how — and his aides held the view that spending on traditional
infrastructure, like roads and bridges, did not necessarily have to be
paid for because it created jobs.  And I’m wondering if you could just
talk about if he still has that view and how the package unveiled on
Wednesday will balance that view of spending versus tax increases.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we’ll have more to say about it once we
actually roll out the package.  But I think what I wanted to note today
and what we want to make clear is that the President has a plan to fix
our infrastructure and a plan to pay for it.  But we are also open to
cont- — having that discussion, and we certainly expect to have the
discussion with members of Congress, as we move forward, about areas
where they agree, where they disagree, where they would like to see
greater emphasis or not.   
   
So we’ll look forward to having that conversation once the plan is
announced on Wednesday.   
   
Q    And just one more thing.  On Friday, the White House announced that
it was nominating Gayle Manchin, Senator Joe Manchin’s wife, for the job
of federal co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission.  This is a
group responsible for steering millions of dollars in states like West
Virginia.  That nomination came as a surprise to some people on the
Hill, and I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the process
and how the White House settled on Gayle Manchin for that job, and what
type of input Senator Manchin had on that.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’ll have to follow up with our personnel team on the exact
process there, but we can do that for you after the briefing.  
   
Go ahead, Jeff.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  The ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal has been
freed.  I’m sure the White House has been monitoring that.  Do you have
any sense of what economic impact that weeklong — a little bit more than
weeklong event is going to have?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, my understanding is it’s been freed, but it’s not yet
open — right? — the canal.  And that will still happen, and there are,
of course, ships waiting to pass through the canal.  We, of course, are
monitoring and will be assessing the impact, but I don’t have anything
to update you on that from here.  
   
Q    Okay.  Wonky question alert.  
     
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  I like the — I like the preview.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    The stocks are falling today because — on Wall Street — because of
the default of a hedge fund.  Is this something that the White House is
monitoring?  And do you have any concerns about it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would send you to the SEC on that for any further
comments.  But we, of course, are monitoring as an administration.  
   
Q    Less wonky.  Do you have any updates on the White House’s thinking
about sanctions against Myanmar and reaction to the latest deaths and
killings there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  Let me — let me give you a reaction and also —
because we haven’t talked about this that much in here recently — an
update on some of our recent actions.   
   
We’re deeply concerned by the recent escalation of violence against
peaceful protestors in Burma.  Burmese security forces are responsible
for hundreds of deaths in Burma since they perpet- — perpetrated a coup
on February 1st.  We condemn this abhorrent violence against the Burmese
people.  The Burm- — the Burmese junta continues to use lethal force
against its own people.  
   
Last week’s killing of children is just the most recent example of the
horrific nature of the violence perpetrated by the military regime.  We
continue to make clear that we will impose costs on the military regime
for the deadly violence against peaceful protestors and the suppression
of human rights.  
   
Today, USTR announced the suspension of all U.S. engagement with Burma
under the 2013 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, effective
immediately.  This suspension will remain in effect until the return of
democratically elected government. Additionally, the sanctions on
military-owned holding companies, MEC and MEHL, were — we announced last
week are the most significant action since the February 1st coup to
impose costs on the military regime.  
   
We’ve also announced a number of actions by the Department of Commerce:
new export controls on Burma, and added four Burmese entities to the
entity list in response to the military coup and violent crackdowns.   
   
We, of course, continue to work with our allies and partners and
like-minded institutions as we condemn the actions of the military, call
for the immediate restoration of democracy, and hold those who seize
power accountable.  
   
Q    And very last one — also as a follow-up to the CDC and White House
briefing this morning on COVID: They made very clear that they’re urging
Americans to continue to take action to prevent a fourth surge,
including nonessential travel.  Is the warning against nonessential
travel something that the White House is taking into consideration with
regard to upcoming travel by the President and Vice President, both for
business and for personal reasons?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say the President travels, as does the Vice
President, on a private plane.  That is the purview of every President
and Vice President throughout American history.  That is, of course,
different than traveling on a commercial flight and going to mass
events.  As you know, we don’t — the President is not hosting rallies,
nor is the Vice President.  We take the role of sending — being models
quite seriously.  But I think most Americans would recognize the
difference.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Just on — a clarification on the payfor question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    When you said that it would be paid dollar for dollar — that the
infrastructure component will be paid for dollar for dollar, were you
applying that also to the entirety of the package that will be released
both Wednesday and in April?  Or — I just want to make sure we’re
understanding what’s — what will be paid for.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think we’re focused right now, I should say, on the
Wednesday proposal.  Obviously there’s still more that’s being worked
through, but I can — for the proposal later in the month — I should say,
“next month,” which is still being worked — working its way through our
economic team.  But I can assure you that when the President lays out
his infrastructure plan, he will also lay out a plan to pay for it, but
is, again, open to ideas and proposals from members of Congress if they
have a difference of view.  
   
Q    And there was an op-ed in the New York Times today by a well-known
virologist with the title, “We Can’t End the Pandemic Without
Vaccinating Kids.”  The argument is basically that, over time, there’ll
be mutations that can be more dangerous for children.  What is the
administration doing to prepare for the possibility of vaccinating
children?  And does the President have a specific time period for when
he would like to see children begin to get the vaccine?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we leave that to our health and medical experts and
the FDA process — and CDC, I should say, process of outlining guidelines
for when it is safe to utilize the three approved vaccines, or which one
is the best for children.  So we will rely on the advice and counsel of
our health and medical experts on that front.  
   
Q    And just one more: When should we expect the President to announce
his next slate of judicial nominees?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have a preview or an update for you.  Stay tuned.  
   
Q    And can you just say — can you give us any insight into the process
behind the scenes about, you know, who’s leading that process
internally?  How are you coming up with this slate?  I think there are
68, or so, vacancies right  
now.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, I can convey that the President wants to nominate
people who have — who are qualified, who have a breadth of experience,
who bring perspective to these roles.  And obviously he seeks to meet
his own bars of diversity when he’s nominating any individuals to serve
in his administration. But we’ll look forward to discussing further at
the point when we’re ready to announce nominees.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, if I could just quickly follow up on Jeff’s question.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Is it the White House position that the CDC travel guidelines don’t
apply if you have a private plane?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think the President — he was asking me specifically about
the President’s travel and the Vice President’s travel.  And the
specifics of the guidelines — you can certainly ask the CDC for further
clarification.   
   
But what I’m conveying is that the President — and as any President does
— travels on Air Force One, whether he is traveling to visit a community
in this country or whether he is traveling to go to his home state of
Delaware.  And I think most people recognize that as being a
difference.  
   
Q    But if I could ask a foreign policy question actually —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — on Ethiopia.  Senator Coons recently traveled to Addis on behalf
of the President.  Since then, we’ve seen Prime Minister Abiy announce
plans for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Tigray.  Do you have
some reaction on that?  And is that something that President Biden was
demanding?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, we are grateful to Senator Coons for traveling
to Ethiopia on behalf of President Biden.  We appreciate the time and
the deliberation of the president — the Prime Minister, I should say. 
We’re encouraged by the Prime Minister’s announcement that the
government of the State of Eritrea has agreed to withdraw its forces
from Ethiopia.  The immediate and complete withdrawal of Eritrean troops
from Tigray will be an important step in deescalating the conflict and
restoring regional peace and stability.  
   
We hope both governments will make good on this commitment on the ground
urgently.  Certainly it was a part of the discussion that Senator Coons
traveled there to communicate about.  
   
Q    And if I may, just quickly, on the President’s health: He last
released a comprehensive health report in 2019 during the campaign.  Can
we expect him to make a trip to Walter Reed soon for his physical?  And
will you commit to releasing a comprehensive health report in the near
future?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  I don’t have a timeline, but absolutely we will
do that.  And I’ll check and see when he’s due to go back to the
doctor.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, Jen Psaki.  Rachel Sutherland, Fox News Radio.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, Rachel.  
   
Q    Hi.  I just wanted to follow up on Juan Gonzalez’s recent trip to
Guatemala.  What kind of progress has been made?  I understand that
Ambassador Jacobson also went to Mexico and maybe to Guatemala as
well.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.  
   
Q    What kind of progress on addressing the root causes of mass
migration can you give us?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think this was their first trip.  We just announced
an envoy, as well, to the region which shows our focus and emphasis on
addressing the root causes.  And, of course, the Vice President of the
United States will be helping lead that effort — specifically, the root
causes, not the border.  There is some confusion over that.    
   
They — I don’t have — I know we did a readout after the meetings and the
trips last week.  I don’t have additional — an additional readout for
you other than to convey that we know this will be a diplomatic
process.  Our view isn’t — it’s not “if,” but “when” we work through
with these countries — the best ways we can work together to address
root causes.   
   
And the President has also proposed an immigration bill that includes
$400 billion in funding to help address the root causes, as well, and
help ensure that families and individuals who are making this trip are
incentivized to stay in their countries.  
   
Q    Just one more here.  I’ve heard some talk about the sponsor
families for the children who are in the care of HHS.  Any idea of how
that’s going to be set up?  And the vetting process for some of these
sponsor families — some of them may be family members, as we’ve heard,
but it’s been the question as to: Who are the sponsors that would take
them in, and how will that work?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  So, one of the issues we’ve been trying to address is that
they shouldn’t all be treated exactly the same.  And obviously if it’s a
mother or a father or a biological family member, that’s different. 
There are a number of steps — vetting steps that are taken.  Is that
what you’re asking about?  
   
Q    Yeah.  Who are these people that are going to be taking in the
children?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it really differs.  Sometimes there are community
groups, there are religious organizations, there are individuals who
have been sponsor families in the past.  Again, it doesn’t mean that
these children stay in the country; this is a safe place for them to be
while their cases are being adjudicated.   
   
But vetting is an important part of this process because in the past
there have been scenarios where there has been trafficking.  We want to,
of course, avoid that. Sometimes that’s why it takes a little bit longer
and why we’re working to expedite the processing wherever we can.  
   
Q    Continuing to follow up, if someone wants to sponsor a child, any
place to go for that if, say, they’re interested?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m sure we can get you the information for the Department
of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and the program that
they are running.  And a lot of it is through local organizations and
community groups as well.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  On Georgia’s new laws restricting voting, President
Biden called them, last week, the — I think the “most pernicious
thing.”  Does the White House believe, now that the laws have been
signed, that companies or individual consumers should boycott Georgia or
Georgia businesses?  And what should people do who don’t have a voting
Congress to vote on these voting laws?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The people of Georgia?  
   
Q    The people of Georgia, people across the country.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They should elect new leaders.  They can take steps like any
— any individual can take as an American citizen to have their voice
heard and exercise their — their democratic right.  
   
Q    But does he believe that’ll — that people should boycott?  There
are increasing calls for them.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s not a call we’re making from here.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  The Vice President has said before that the exodus
of women leaving the workforce during the pandemic is a “national
emergency.”  The President has said that we’re dealing with an “acute,
immediate childcare crisis in America.”  I know that childcare is a part
of his infrastructure initiative, and Wednesday we will hear more about
his physical —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  In April, you’ll hear more.  
   
Q    Well, I guess that’s my question.  Why aren’t we hearing more about
this first before the physical infrastructure needs, given that it’s
such an emergency and given that we’re in a situation right now where
women are in desp- — or families are in desperate need of childcare
assistance?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President and the Vice President agree.  That’s
why they pushed so hard to get the American Rescue Plan passed that
ensured that millions of families could get funding through the Child
Tax Credit; could get $1,400 checks out to a large number of families
across the country, 100 million which have already gone out; why the
earned income tax credit was something he fought to have in there as
well.   
   
But he believes that that’s not enough and we need to do more.  And so
he’s looking forward to, in a couple of weeks, laying out more specifics
of his plan to do exactly that.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  So the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
announced this formation of a task force to investigate past tampering
with science decisions in the White House.  And I’m wondering: What was
sort of the thinking behind forming that taskforce, and what do you guys
hope to find or accomplish with it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President issued a memorandum on Scientific
Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking, directing agencies “to make
evidence-based decisions guided by the best available science and
data.”  And so, this task force will be taking the whole-of-government
approach to reinstate science across federal agencies and ensure that it
is part of how decision making is made.  They’re going to examine
policies that were antithetical to that mission over the last four
years, and also look ahead and ensure it’s integrated as we move
forward.  
   
We’re just starting — we’re just inaugurating that process.  And it’s
just as — evidence that the President believes that scientific integrity
matters and it should be central to how we approach governing.   
   
Q    Is there a punitive aspect to it?  Like are you trying to find
wrongdo- — wrongdoers and punish them in some way or —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think the focus is on ensuring that our policies, moving
forward — that policies that are not meeting that bar, that are still in
place, are changed, and that we institute this as central to how we
approach policymaking in our agencies across government, moving
forward.  
   
Q    Okay.  And one more: Do you have an update on whether the Vice
President plans to travel to Central America or to the border as part of
her looking into the root causes of the immigration problem?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update on her travel.  But since you gave me
the opportunity, it’s important to understand and know that she is
focused on addressing root causes in the region.  And so, travel, I
would expect, would be there.  The border and expediting processing at
the border, opening shelters, ensuring we’re moving kids out of Border
Patrol facilities — that is really under the purview of the Department
of Homeland Security and HHS.  And they will all work together, but the
Vice President’s focus is on the region, root causes, and engaging with
governments directly.  
   
Q    So if she were to travel, it would be to Central America or
something like that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That would be my expectation, but I don’t have any travel to
preview at this point in time.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    To bloodshed in Myanmar: What is China’s role in the crisis of
Myanmar?  And what do you expect Peking, or Beijing, to do?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What do we expect Beijing to do?  Well, certainly, when we
engage with partners in the region, China is one of those — one of those
countries, of course, in the region.  I don’t think I have anything more
in terms of calls for action, other than we have worked through the
National Security Counc- — or through the U.N. Security Council, I
should say — through several global entities to ensure we are sending a
clear message as a global community about the actions in Burma, and that
we are taking sanction steps as a coordinated global community as
well.  
   
Go ahead, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Two foreign policy questions —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    — and a third one for a colleague.  On Yemen, U.S. Envoy Lenderking
is currently in Oman and having discussions in order to promote a
lasting peace and ceasefire in Yemen.  How are these discussions have
been going?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I know that he’s spent a fair amount of time on these
discussions and working on addressing and stemming the humanitarian
crisis, but also working toward some element of a ceasefire, of course,
in the region.  I would point you to the State Department where he works
directly for any update on the discussions.  We’re, of course, receiving
updates here as well.  
   
Q    And the second one is on Iran.  Now that they’ve signed this
long-term agreement with China, does the administration still have the
same policy towards Iran, especially in terms of returning to the
nuclear deal?  And is the President willing to partially lift some
sanctions on Iran in exchange of its return to the nuclear deal?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s not under consideration.  We remain hopeful and
focused on returning to a diplomatic approach in partnership with
members of the P5+1.  China is, of course, a member of that.  And we, of
course, will take a look at and ensure that any sanctions that need to
be implemented would be, as it relates to this package.  But we haven’t
looked at the specific agreement yet at this point in time, so our
approach remains the same and nothing has changed about our approach.  
   
Q    The President said that he’s been concerned about it for years. 
What did he mean by that, and how concerning is this for the
administration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Concerned about — I know he was asked a question
yesterday.  
   
Q    Between China.  The 25 — apparently 25 years long-term agreement
between China and Iran.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, China has been a member of the P5+1, an important
partner as it related to getting the deal passed to begin with. 
Certainly it would be an important partner as we look ahead to a
diplomatic approach.  At this point in time, we’re still working through
those steps and don’t have an update on the engagement.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  And my colleague’s question is on North Korea. 
Now that the President said that he’s, quote, “prepared for some form of
diplomacy” with North Korea, does this include sitting with President
Kim Jong Un?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think his approach would be quite different, and that is
not his intention.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.  Okay.
