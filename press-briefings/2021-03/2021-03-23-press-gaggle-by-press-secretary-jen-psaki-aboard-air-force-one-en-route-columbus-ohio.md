title: "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Jen\_Psaki Aboard Air Force One en route Columbus,\_\
  Ohio"

1:59 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  Welcome to our trip to Ohio.  Today, on the
anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law by
President Obama, we’re traveling to Columbus as part of the “Help Is
Here” tour to highlight how the American Rescue Plan will lower
healthcare costs for many families — a big deal, as my boss might put
it.  
   
In Ohio, the President — he added another word, but for the children. 
(Laughter.)  In Ohio, the President will talk about how the Affordable
Care Act has changed the lives of millions of Americans, enabling
millions of families to have the peace of mind that comes with access to
quality, affordable healthcare.  He’s always thought that this was — the
Affordable Care Act was something that would be built upon.  And the
American Rescue Plan is an opportunity to do exactly that.  
   
In Ohio alone, the ACA has cut the state’s uninsured rate by half,
dropping from 12 percent to 6 percent.  This also provided protections
for millions of Ohioans with pre-existing conditions.  
   
And the American Rescue Plan makes coverage under the ACA even more
affordable for Ohio families.  Over 90,000 currently uninsured Ohioans
can get a better deal on health insurance because of the Rescue Plan,
and premiums for people who have coverage under the ACA will fall by an
average of $50 per person per month.  
   
He will also remind Americans to sign up for insurance at HealthCare.gov
during the special enrollment period, and he’ll have an update on that,
as well, today.   
   
I also just wanted to note that our Health and Human Services Secretary,
Xavier Becerra, is also traveling to Carson City, Nevada, to visit a
health center today.  
   
Update from the governors call — the weekly governors call that Jeff
Zients did this morning: Today, in our weekly governors call, he
announced that we will have 27 million doses allocated across all
channels this week.  Of those 27 million doses, 4 million will be
Johnson & Johnson.  Two-thirds of the 27 million doses will be going to
states and jurisdictions, and the rest will go to other channels,
primarily the pharmacy program, which has been very successful and we’ve
been increasing supply to.  
   
This means that in 62 days since taking office, we’ve more than tripled
vaccine output from 8.6 million doses to 27 million doses.  
   
And then, the last update is: The President spoke with the governor —
Governor Polis of California — sorry, of Colorado, this morning to, of
course, offer his condolences and support as the state and Boulder deals
with the tragedy of last evening.  
   
With that, who wants to kick it off?  
   
Q    A couple of questions.  First, with respect to the Colorado
shooting, what can you tell us about the shooter’s motive?  There’s been
some speculation that there were ISIS ties.  Can you confirm or deny
that?   
   
And then, the President talked today about the need for new gun control
measures.  Has there been talk about attaching any of those to a future
infrastructure bill?  And if not, has this incident changed his thinking
about the filibuster?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  On the first question, we’d obviously defer to law
enforcement authorities who gave — or provided an update this morning. 
But they will be in the lead on any determination about motive,
reasoning, et cetera.  So we’ll look for updates from them.  The
President will get updated as there is additional information to be
provided, and if there’s more to provide to all of you, we will
certainly do that.  
   
As it relates to gun safety measures, let me first say that putting in
place commonsense gun safety measures has been a passion of the
President’s since he was in the Senate.  He helped lead the fight to get
the Brady Bill passed.  He helped pass the assault weapons ban.  He was
in the lead in the Obama-Biden administration, putting in place more
than a dozen executive actions on gun safety.  And this will continue to
be an issue that he’s focused on day in and day out in this
administration.  
   
He talked this morning about two bills that have passed the House that
would increase background checks, improve background checks — something
that’s supported by the vast majority of the American public.  That’s
something he’ll continue to advocate for.  Also putting in place an
assault weapons ban — there is legislation that’s been introduced by
Senator Feinstein, Congressman Cicilline.  So there are different
mechanisms for that to move forward, and it is certainly something he
will continue to advocate for.  
   
In terms of the filibuster, his position remains; it has not changed. 
He is — of course, believes that we should work with Democrats and
Republicans to get work done for the American people, including
commonsense gun safety measures.  He’s also open to hearing ideas.  He
does — is not going to allow for obstruction to get work done for the
American people, but his preference and priority is working with members
of both parties.  
   
Q    I have a question about —  
   
Q    (Inaudible) on executive action.  Jen, sorry.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, sure.  
   
Q    Will there be new executive action on gun violence?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  We are certainly considering a range of levers, including
working through legislation, including executive actions to address,
obviously, you know, not just gun safety measures but violence in
communities.  So that is — has been under discussion and will continue
to be under discussion.  
   
Q    I have a question about Iraq.  We’re reporting that Iraq has asked
for the start of talks about withdrawing the remaining U.S. troops.  Can
you confirm that you’ve received that request?  And do you know when
those talks will be starting?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to check with our national security team on an
update on that, and DOD as well.  I can venture to do that when I — when
we finish our gaggle.  
   
Q    When the President was departing his remarks earlier, he answered a
quick question, saying, “I’ll have more for you later,” when he was
asked about new legislation.  So can you talk about any new legislative
proposals that may be in the works?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think he was — he was referring to his commitment to
continuing to work on gun safety measures.  There’s, again, a range of
levers, right?  There is legislation he advocated for that is currently
moving through Congress.  There is legislation that Dianne — Senator
Feinstein and Congressman Cicilline have proposed on the assault weapons
ban.  
   
There’s, of course, as I referenced earlier, executive actions that are
under discussion and in our administration.  As we know, this tragedy
just happened last night, so I would not expect a new proposal put
forward under 24 hours.  But we are going to continue to work with
Congress and work on what executive actions and levers he can take as
President.  
   
Q    And during the presidential campaign, he said on day one that he
would send legislation repealing the liability protection for gun
manufacturers.  Is that still part of his legislative agenda for guns
since he hasn’t done that yet?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  There remain a range of options under consideration.  And
obviously, tragedies like last night and the shootings in Atlanta are
just reminders of how vital it is to move forward on gun safety measures
in a range of formats.  But I don’t have an update on when those
executive actions or what steps might be next at this point.  
   
Q    Did he give consideration to not doing this Ohio trip given the
scale of the loss of life in Colorado?  And does he feel that there is
anything different in the political landscape now that would be more
amenable to these ideas that have stymied lots of administrations?  Is
he — is there anything different now that would make this a bigger
priority for the President?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, it’s always been a priority for the  
President.  He is personally committed to continuing to push for gun
safety measures — something that he has been committed to since he was
in the Senate — and was a big advocate for the Brady Bill, for the
assault weapons ban, for executive actions and legislation that, as you
— as you, kind of, alluded to, we tried to move through the Obama-Biden
administration.  
   
He’s also a believer that just because you can’t get something through
the first time, it doesn’t mean you keep try- — you don’t keep trying,
and that he is somebody who is committed to pushing through, working
with people from both parties, you know, continuing to advocate to move
policy forward.  
   
So I don’t think he has an assessment on the political landscape less
than 24 hours after these tragic events happened, but it is an issue
that is on his mind and has long been throughout the course of his time
in public life.  
   
Q    Did he consider not doing this trip?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, I’m sorry.  I did — I did — I meant to answer that
question, too.   
   
You know, we always look at making adjustments as needed.  We felt it
was still important to have the President travel to Ohio and to speak to
the importance of healthcare, and access, and affordability, and
improving that access — something that is impacting millions of
Americans across the country.   
   
Obviously, he addressed the tragedy of last night and felt that it was
important — he felt, personally, it was important to do that.  And he
also received an update, I think, as all of you know, during the PDB
this morning from his team as well.  
   
Q    And, Jen, there has been — there have been several Democrats who
have now urged him to appoint a national director for gun violence
prevention.  I know you’re saying that there are several steps under
consideration.  Is that something that you’re, you know, actively
considering?  Is that being seriously looked at?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would just say that, ultimately, it’s a priority to the
President of the United States and, as you saw earlier today, the Vice
President of the United States and senior members of our policy team who
have been considering and discussing a range of actions — executive
actions on addressing gun violence and community violence.  And I think
that speaks to his commitment to the issue.  
   
Q    And I did have a question on the Postmaster General.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  
   
Q    As you know, yesterday, he kind of came out with his 10-year plan,
and he’s planning the largest rollback in consumer mail services in a
generation.  Obviously, you know, several Democrats, again, have asked
the President to fire the board with cause and let new Biden nominees,
kind of, judge if the Postmaster General is fit for office.  Have you
been, kind of, discussing that?  I know there has been some action, but
is there anything new that you can tell us?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It doesn’t work exactly that way.  He has nominated a number
of members of the board.  The board — the board is responsible for
determining who the future leadership is.  Obviously, he has expressed
concerns about the decision making in the past and the performance, at
times, of the Postal Service — not to speak to the men and women who are
serving, but the leadership at the top.  And those concerns remain.  
   
Q    Are you contemplating travel to Boulder?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to report on that at this point.  As
you know, obviously, the families are grieving; the community is
grieving.  We saw that from the press conference this morning.  And
certainly, you know, he will — we will, and he will, you know, discuss
that at the appropriate time.  But it’s less than 24 hours.  
   
Q    Jen, can you just quickly update — Zolan, from the Times.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, yeah.  I know who you (inaudible).  It’s good to see
you.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Can you provide an update on Ambassador Jacobson’s trip to Mexico
City, and then Juan Gonzalez also going to Guatemala?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    And is it possible that we could see an Asylum Cooperative
Agreement come out of that trip — something that diverts asylum seekers
at the border to Central America to seek protection?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, they’re only on, really, the first full day of their
trip right now, and they’re not returning for a couple of days.  I do
expect we’ll have a fulsome readout at the end of their trip.  
   
They did go down there because, as you know, it’s important and vital
that we work through diplomatic channels with governments in the region
to help figure out how to address root causes and improve cooperation
after years of it being not at the — at the status it should be.  So
that’s the purpose of their trip.  But I don’t want to get ahead of what
they may discuss or what they may conclude coming out of it.  
   
Q    And then, just a quick follow.  I know you said the President is
still committed to working with members of both parties —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — even after these events.  But two mass shootings in the last,
what, 10 days?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    I mean, does that increase the sense of urgency to move forward
with executive action before any kind of legislation makes its way to
the Senate?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The way he sees it is that there are a number of levers that
any President of the United States can use.  And he, as Vice President,
was leading the effort on determining executive actions that could be
taken on gun safety measures. It’s something that he has worked on, he’s
passionate about, he has feels personally connected to.  But there’s an
ongoing process, and I think we feel we have to work on multiple
channels at the same time.  
   
Q    Jen, NATO is making an effort for a virus-free summit for world
leaders in June.  What does the President think about that possibility
of him traveling and being there in that environment?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we certainly are aware of the timing of the upcoming
NATO Summit.  And certainly the President, I know, would love to go
overseas and travel overseas and have discussions about global issues
and how to work together on a range of issues, including the pandemic,
economic recovery, et cetera.  But we’re going to rely on the advice of
our health and medical experts, and I don’t have anything to preview on
the likelihood of the trip at this point in time.  
   
Q    Can you confirm that the President is attending the European
Council meeting on Thursday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    That’s virtual, obviously —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  
   
Q    — about the future of the U.S.-EU relationship or anything else you
can give us there?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yes.  I know he’s attending.  Let me venture to get you a
little bit more on the agenda, which I will do, hopefully, before the
end of the flight.  
   
Q    You said that’s Thursday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That is Thursday.  It’s a virtual meeting with the European
Council.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Exactly.  
   
Q    And then, one other one, on guns.  Why hasn’t the President
nominated someone to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and
Explosives?  And do you have any update for us on that nomination?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any update on the nomination. Obviously, it’s
an important position and role, but — and one that we are eager to have
nominated and confirmed.  But we are also focused on the steps we can
take — working with members of Congress, working with policy leads in
the administration — to move forward and see what progress can be made
on gun safety measures.  
   
Q    Is there any consideration to changing the policy related to
unaccompanied minors at the border — given the numbers that are now in
U.S. custody and how this situation has evolved — to try to change the
messaging about those children being received and kept in the United
States?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the messaging will continue to be that: It is
not the time to come; it is not a safe journey to make; that we are
turning away people at the border.  A majority of people are turned away
at the border.  And — but at the same time, we believe that it is the
humane and moral step to — to ensure we are treating these children —
that they are in safe places when they come across the border.  
   
So, I’m not sure if you’re asking about —  
   
Q    But do you acknowledge that — that by making that point about the
humane treatment of children, that there is, perhaps to the ears of a
desperate parent, a motivation?  Because the child would be received and
kept across the border.  
So does that require a change?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I think our view is that there are a number of factors here
that are pushing families to put their children on buses or to make the
journey, including the economic conditions, including crime and
corruption, including the two hurricanes that struck the region.  Those
are factors that our experts feel are the driving factors to children
making that journey.   
   
And the step we can take and that we can — we have the, you know,
control over taking, of course, is ensuring that we are expediting
processing at the border; we’re opening new facilities.  We just opened
another one in Texas — there will be additional facilities that are
opened in the coming days and weeks; and ensuring that we can get these
kids moved as quickly as possible from Border Patrol facilities.  
   
Q    Jen, the pandemic emergency rule is actually — is still in place
for single adults and families.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  Title 42.  
   
Q    Recent data has actually shown that, despite Title 42, there are —
there is an increase in families being accepted into the U.S.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yep.  
   
Q    Is that just due to, you know, a breakdown in coordination with
Mexican authorities who are supposed to receive those families?  Or is
the U.S. leaning towards accepting more families at this time?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is — it is largely an issue of Mexico not having the
capacity to accept some of these families.  These circumstances are
limited.  When they come, they are tested, they’re quarantined as
needed.  But it’s not a reflection or prediction of a change of
policy.  
   
Q    And then, the pandemic emergency rule is, in its essence,
temporary.  I mean, it’s rooted in the coronavirus pandemic.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    So what’s the plan for when the administration needs to lift that? 
And when is the administration going to lift it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect that decision will be made with our health team in
the lead and in coordination between the Department of Health and Human
Services and the Department of Homeland Security.   
   
Q    Gotcha.  Gotcha.  But is there — is there any consideration of
another restriction, another rule that could be implemented for when
Title 42 is lifted?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t think we’re at that point.  Obviously we’re still in
the middle of a pandemic; 1,400 people are still dying in our country
every day.  So I don’t think we’re at that point in the process.  
   
Q    Jen, is there a readout from last night’s meeting with the Senate
Democratic Caucus?  We didn’t see one.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can give you one.  You know, the purpose of the meeting
was to ha- — to thank them for their support and efforts in passing the
American Rescue Plan and to reiterate the bipartisan support across the
country and his commitment to communicating with the American people, as
he is doing today, about the benefits of the package.   
   
He also took some questions from members during that call, as a part of
the conversation, but that was the purpose of the call.  
   
Q    One more on cyber.  The Russian and Chinese media have been
building a narrative that the U.S. is threatening to disconnect them
from the international payment system as punishment for the recent
hacks.  Is that something the White House is at all considering
seriously?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any predictions to make in terms of costs that
will be paid for recent hacks.  Obviously, the review is ongoing as it
relates to Russia and certainly China, too, separately.  And I expect
we’ll have more on that soon.  
   
Q    No update on weeks, days?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I would say weeks, not months, but I don’t have an update on
the timeline.  
   
Q    There are concerns about delays in distributing some of the $1,400
checks to those who don’t have to file taxes.  Is the administration
aware of what the issue is?  And are you taking any steps to alleviate
those delays?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  You know, if somebody is a non-filer — which I think is what
you’re referring to — but they benefit from any U.S. tax program, then
they would be getting payments via direct payment.  So that shouldn’t be
an issue.   
   
But as any issues arise, the IRS and the Treasury Department certainly
look into them as they arise.  As I understand, it’s been limited, but I
can certainly check if there’s more specifics about it.   
   
Q    Any update on the border access for journalists that  
we talked about yesterday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect you’ll know — you’ll have more details soon.  But
our plan is to make access available, likely through a pool, and we’re
working to finalize those details.  
   
Q    And any details on the press conference Thursday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  What are you looking to know?  
   
Q    Well —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Do you want to tell me your questions?  I’ll take those
down.  (Laughter.)   
   
Q    No, are we still looking — is there an on-record time that we can
announce yet?  Or is it still FPPO?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I expect it to be in the afternoon, but we’re finalizing the
details based around some other specifics in his schedule.  
   
Q    How is the President preparing for the presser?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  How is he preparing for it?  Looking at your Twitters —
(laughter) — and seeing what’s on your mind.   
   
You know, I think he is, you know, thinking about it.  It’s an
opportunity for him to speak to the American people, obviously directly
through the coverage, directly through all of you.  And so I think he’s
thinking about what he wants to say, what he wants to convey, where he
can provide updates, and, you know, looking forward to the opportunity
to engage with a free press.  
   
Q    Can I ask one more on nominations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Just, if you have an update.  There’s no one in place that ICE and
CBP.  And obviously, with those situation at the border, do you expect
those nominations to be announced anytime soon?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I just — we are — our personnel team is obviously working on
all of these important and vital positions.  We want to find the right
individuals for a lot of these — for all of these roles, of course.  I
just don’t have an update on when we’ll have announcements on them.  
   
Q    And, Jen, do you have any update on the permanent nominee for OMB? 
I think Shalanda is going to get confirmed as we land.  But —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It looks like it — as we’re landing.  I don’t have an update
on that.  Obviously, she will be — serve in the acting role once she’s
confirmed, as we have anticipated.  
   
Q    A quick — a quick follow.  
   
Q    Okay.  And no update on Neera and where she’s (inaudible)?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not yet.  Not yet.  
   
Q    So, Secretary Mayorkas was the first, you know, immigrant to lead
DHS.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Do you think — does the President feel that an immigrant should be
leading ICE or CBP to rebuild trust with those communities?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s such a great question.  I haven’t had that discussion
with him.  I know that when he selected and asked Secretary Mayorkas to
serve, that his experience, his background, his personal — his personal
perspective he would bring to the role was — were all appealing to the
President, but I’d have to ask him that question.   
   
Q    Okay.  Appreciate a follow-up.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thanks, everyone.
