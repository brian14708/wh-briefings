James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:19 P.M. EDT

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Happy Monday.   
   
Q    Happy Monday.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have two things before we get to our guest this
morning — or this afternoon.  
   
Today, the President and the First Lady will honor the 2023 Teachers of
the Year from state and territories across the United States for their
excellence in teaching and commitment to students’ learning.   
   
This year’s National Teacher of the Year is Mrs. Rebecka Peterson, a
mathematics teacher from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  
   
As a classroom teacher for more than 30 years, the First Lady is proud
to continue this tradition of celebrating Teachers of the Year for their
excellence in teaching and commitment to students’ learning.  
   
From — from day one, the Biden-Harris administration has been committed
to celebrating and elevating the teaching pro- — the teaching profession
and taking comprehensive actions to increase teacher pay, improve
working conditions, and develop high-quality pathways into the teaching
profession.   
   
And given that commitment, it bears noting that, right now, Speaker
McCarthy is demanding we slash education from — funding by 22 percent. 
And if we don’t, he’s threatening he will throw the United States into
default and tank the economy.  That’s the equivalent of cutting up to
60,000 teaching jobs, affecting 25 million children.  And it would mean
as many as 7.5 million children with disabilities could face reduced
support.  
   
So today, while celebrating our nation’s educators, the President is
going to talk about why slashing funding for education is the last thing
our country needs and why this administration is focused on supporting
our teachers and schools.  
   
Also today, the President shared that Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador
Susan Rice will depart the White House late next month.

Susan has served at the highest levels of government for the last three
Democratic administrations: eight years in the Clinton administration,
eight years in the Obama administration, and since day one here with
President Biden.  It’s truly very impressive.  
   
She has served as National Security Advisor, U.N. Ambassador, and, for
the last two years, brought steady and capable leadership to the
Domestic Policy Council.  
   
Thanks to her tireless efforts, we expanded and strengthened the
Affordable Care Act, released a comprehensive national mental health
strategy, and finally enabled Medicare to negotiate lower prescription
drug prices for seniors and cap the cost of insulin at 35 bucks.  
   
We’ve — we’ve taken historic actions to reduce gun violence and advance
police reform.   
   
We are making college more affordable and accessible and fighting for
student debt relief.   
   
And we are increasing access to high-quality childcare and long-term
care.   
   
As the only person to serve as both National Security Advisor and
Domestic Policy Advisor, Susan’s record of public service makes
history.   
   
We are so grateful to Susan for her service over the last two-plus years
and to — and to throughout her career to our country.  
   
On a personal note, I have known Susan for many, many years.  She is a —
she has become a friend and a mentor to me.  And we are — I am very sad
to see her go but also very thankful for her service to this country.  
   
With that, our National Security Advisor is here today to — to talk a
little bit about the upcoming state visit with South Korea and also take
any other questions you may have on Sudan and other foreign policy
items.  
   
Go ahead.

MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Karine.  And good to be with you guys
today.   
   
And let me start by echoing what Karine just said: I’m also very sad to
see Susan go, although we still have a few more weeks with her.  And,
you know, really grateful for having had the opportunity to serve with
her in this administration, in this White House, as well as in the
previous administration as well.  
   
As Karine said, I’m going to make a few comments at the top.  And I hope
you’ll bear with me because I want to be able to talk through both the
situation in Sudan and the upcoming state visit by the President of the
Republic of Korea, and then a brief comment on what we saw unfold up in
New York today with Foreign Minister Lavrov’s visit.  And then I’ll be
happy to answer your questions.  
   
As you all know, on Saturday, on the President’s orders, the United
States military conducted a successful operation to extract all U.S.
government personnel from Khartoum.   
   
We are proud of the extraordinary commitment of our embassy staff, who
performed their duties with courage and professionalism.  And we are
grateful for the unmatched skill of our service members who successfully
brought them to safety.  We thank Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia,
each of which were critical to the success of our operation.  
   
At the President’s direction, we are actively facilitating the departure
of American citizens who want to leave Sudan, as the State Department
has been urging them to do for years.  
   
We have deployed U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
assets to support land evacuation routes, which Americans are using. 
And we’re moving naval assets within the region to provide support. 
American citizens have begun arriving in Port Sudan, and we are helping
facilitate their onward travel.  
   
We’re also supporting the efforts of our partners and allies, including
local partners, to evacuate or otherwise ensure the safety of their
people.  U.S. Africa Command has established a deconfliction cell for
this purpose.   
   
We’ve made clear to the highest levels of both the Sudanese Armed Forces
and the Rapid Support Forces that they are responsible for ensuring the
protection of civilians and noncombatants, including people from third
countries and humanitarian staff who are still to this day working to
save lives.  
   
We continue to condemn in the strongest possible terms the violence
between the SAF and the RSF, and we have now deployed a USAID Disaster
Assistance Response Team — a DART Team — to the region to help
coordinate our humanitarian response. 

This tragic violence has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent
civilians.  It is unconscionable.  It must stop.  The belligerent
parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, adhere
to international law, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect
the will of the people of Sudan to return to a path of civilian rule.  
   
I want to stress that we have only temporarily suspended operations at
the U.S. Embassy in Sudan.  We fully intend to resume those operations
as soon as it is safe to do so.  We remain deeply committed to the
Sudanese people and to their future.  
   
Also, as you know, President Biden will welcome President Yoon to — for
the White House’s second official state visit this week, marking the
first state visit by an Indo-Pacific leader during the Biden-Harris
administration.   
   
This visit also marks 70 years of the U.S.-ROK alliance.  We’re
celebrating the last seven decades of this alliance, and we’re looking
forward to the next seven decades.  
   
Under the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S.-ROK alliance has grown
far beyond the Korean Peninsula and is now a force for good in the
Indo-Pacific and around the world.  The two leaders themselves have
developed a rapport over the course of the — less than one year since
President Yoon took office in Korea.  And they’ve had a total of four
engagements already just in that short time.  
   
Our economic and people-to-people ties will be front and center on this
visit.  During the Biden administration alone, just in the last two-plus
years, the Republic of Korea has invested over $100 billion in the
United States.  That is translating to jobs across this country.  This
includes the Samsung semiconductor fab in Texas, Hyundai’s work to build
an EV factory, significant new investments by SK in battery plants,
among others.  
   
The summit will also celebrate what we’ve been able to do under
President Yoon’s leadership since he took over.  
   
From unveiling its first-ever Indo-Pacific strategy to being the first
president of the ROK to ever attend a NATO summit to co-hosting the
second summit for democracy, the ROK is stepping up around the world.  
   
President Yoon has also shown determination and courage in his moves to
improve ties between the ROK and Japan, an issue that has long been of
deep interest to President Biden.  
   
Together, President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida are strengthening
the ROK-Japan relationship in ways that leave us all stronger and have
helped contribute to a stronger trilateral relationship among the United
States, the ROK, and Japan.  
   
This visit, of course, also comes at a critical moment as North Korea
continues to develop its nuclear and missile capabilities.  The two
leaders will have a chance to consult closely on that.  
   
President Biden will reinforce and enhance our extended deterrence
commitments to South Korea with respect to the threat the DPRK poses.  
   
The alliance remains committed to pursuing dialogue with the DPRK to
achieve a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to longstanding differences
and to achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  
   
We are ready to meet at any time, at any place to address serious
concerns, and we are open to the possibility of humanitarian assistance
with appropriate safeguards to help the people of the DPRK.  
   
While we’ve long been focused on the Korean Peninsula though, this
alliance is doing far more than ever around the region and around the
world.   
   
The ROK, for example, has stood fast in support of Ukraine since
Russia’s brutal invasion over a year ago.  The ROK has committed to
provide over $230 million in humanitarian assistance since Russia’s
invasion, which includes non-lethal military aid, medical supplies, and
generators.  And the ROK has also joined the international community by
implementing sanctions and export controls on Russia.  
   
On Wednesday, President Biden and President Yoon will announce major
deliverables on extended deterrence, on cyber cooperation, on climate
mitigation, on foreign assistance, on investment, and on strengthening
our people-to-people ties.   
   
And we’ll have more to share on the specific deliverables tomorrow and
going into Wednesday.  
   
Lastly, I just want to take a moment to recognize and lift up the words
of Elizabeth Whelan at the U.N. Security Council today.  
   
As you all know, Elizabeth is the — is the sister of Paul Whelan, who
has been wrongfully detained in Russia for far too long now, despite our
quite extraordinary efforts to bring him home, which the Russian
government has repeatedly spurned.  
   
I’ve met Elizabeth, and I’ve felt firsthand what the U.N. Security
Council saw up close today.  She is an incredible voice for all of us
who are outraged by the practice of wrongful detention.  
   
We’ll keep working until we’ve brought Paul home, and we will keep
working until we’ve brought Evan home and all Americans globally who are
wrongfully detained or being held hostage.  
   
Thank you again for your patience and hearing me out.  And I’d be happy
to take your questions.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  Starting on the — facilitating the departure of
Americans from Sudan.  What — is that American boots on the ground? 
What are — what — how many of the estimated Americans who are there do
you intend to get out or can you plausibly get out of the country?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, we have not put American boots on the ground
in Sudan, other than for the brief period that we brought the military
in to evacuate our personnel.  We have placed ISR assets — intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance assets — over the land evacuation route
to help facilitate safe travel by land from Khartoum to the Port of
Sudan.  And we have started to see a more regular pattern of convoys
begin to arrive, including convoys that have Americans in them.   
   
Once at the Port then, we are using diplomatic facilities in neighboring
countries to help those Americans with their onward travel so that they
can get safely out of the country.  
   
We anticipate that this route will continue to be available for
Americans who are looking to leave.  And convoys continue to get
organized, depart Khartoum, and arrive at the Port of Sudan.  
   
As I mentioned, we have also begun to move naval assets for any
potential contingencies off the coast of the Port of Sudan.   
   
Those are the major ways in which right now we are providing the kind of
support and facilitation to help Americans who want to leave be able to
leave, and Americans are in the process of availing — availing
themselves of that.  And as I said before, we have seen Americans begin
to show up in the Port of Suda- — in the Port of Sudan.   
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  Just following up on that.  And maybe this is what
some of the naval assets are for in terms of contingency planning.  Are
there U.S. emergency assets outside of or beyond the intelligence
capability and assets that can be called on should one of the convoys
that has U.S. citizens inside of it come under attack?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So I don’t want to speculate about a particular
contingency, but I will say this: The President, immediately after the
outbreak of violence several days ago, did order the deployment of
capabilities to the region to be able to deal with any number of
contingencies.  
   
Some of those capabilities were used to be able to get the personnel
from our embassy, and the military has walked through the specifics of
that.  Capabilities in countries near Sudan remain available at the
President’s disposal should they become necessary.  
   
We don’t at the moment have any plans to put those to use, but we are
prepared for a range of contingencies.  And the naval assets will add to
that.  But that is not the sum total of what we have available in the
region should it be necessary.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Jake, thank you, after I know what was a busy weekend for you.  You
say the U.S. has temporarily pulled out of Sudan and will return when
it’s safe to do so.  Who is responsible for the safety or the security
the U.S. embassy right now?  I’m curious if you’d respond to the charges
over the weekend that, in essence, the Biden administration now has lost
two U.S. embassies during the President’s term.   
   
And I’ve got another on Lavrov, if you don’t mind.  Go ahead.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, so, first, what I would say about the — the
question of security at the embassy compound outside Khartoum is that I
don’t want to get into specifics on how it is that we are taking steps
to ensure its continued security, only to say that we had a contingency
plan in place.  We are now executing that contingency plan.  That can’t
guarantee, obviously, the security of the embassy, but we believe that
we have put steps in place to be able to protect that compound in the
days and weeks ahead and that we do intend to resume operations as soon
as we are capable of doing so.  
   
I’m not sure what you mean by a charge about quote, unquote, “losing
embassies.”  The broader diplomatic community, including the entire
United Nations community in Khartoum, has closed down in Sudan. 
Diplomatic personnel from allies and partners around the world are being
evacuated.  And of course, the United States has evacuated its
personnel.  
   
This happens from time to time.  And if you look back over the course of
months and years, you see military-assisted departures from embassies. 
You see, in some cases, noncombatant evacuation operations.  That’s in
the nature of having 270 total diplomatic posts around the world.   
   
There will be times when the conditions are not conducive to sustaining
operations in all 270 at the same time.  But our goal, as I said before,
is to be able to resume operations in Khartoum as soon as we are capable
of doing so.  
   
Q    The Russian Foreign Minister, when he came to New York, is
apparently upset that visas were not issued to Russian journalists to
accompany him.  Was that done in response to the detention of Evan
Gershkovich?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I — as you know, when it comes to visa matters, that is a
matter for the State Department, who is statutorily charged with the
responsibility of taking visa applications and responding to them.  So
it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment on that.  I’d refer you
over to the State Department.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  Just — as you’re talking about contingencies for
Sudan, will the U.S. at any point be willing to send peacekeeping troops
to the country?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t have any plans or announcements to make about the
United States deploying peacekeepers to Sudan, to putting American boots
on the ground to try to keep the peace in Sudan.  That is not presently
in contemplation.  I don’t expect it will be.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Is there — sorry, quick follow-up there.  Can you lay out any of
the contingencies beyond the deployment of naval assets?  Just anything
you can talk about?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  What do you mean by —  
   
Q    Sorry, can you — can you talk about any of the contingencies that
you just were referring to?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, look, I’m not going to speculate about things that
had- — haven’t happened.  All I’m saying is that when it comes to being
able to respond in extremis should we feel we need to do so to protect
the security of our people who may be coming under threat, the United
States has the kinds of assets and capabilities necessary to be able to
do that.  
   
But from our perspective right now, we believe that the current course
that we are on, which is to continue to try to facilitate and support
this land evacuation route, is the best way for us to proceed.  Again,
that involves a set of ISR assets.  It does not currently involve U.S.
forces on the ground.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Jake, you just mentioned that you are seeing more Americans
arriving at the Port of Sudan, but it seems that last night and over the
weekend the State Department was warning Americans to be cautious of
private convoys because they were too dangerous headed in that
direction.  So, did something shift there because of the assets that
have been put in place?  And is the message now it would be safe to
travel to the port?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we were very clear-eyed about this.  There are risks
with any potential option.  There were risks when we flew helicopters in
to get our people out.  
   
So, we’re not saying anything is an ironclad safe option, and it would
be wrong of us to tell Americans, “Oh, you’ve got nothing at all to be
concerned about.”  There’s obviously fighting happening in this
country.  And whether it’s trying to leave by air or by ground or
shelter in place, all of them bring risks with them.  
   
So, we are communicating risks quite clearly and quite directly to
people, as we have communicated risks over more than a decade to tell
Americans not to travel to Sudan in the first place and to leave Sudan
if they were there. 

But what we are also saying is that, for those Americans who are
interested in joining a convoy, we have been providing information about
how they can do that.  And then, as I mentioned before, we are now
providing some degree of overwatch to try and ensure that these convoys
can arrive safely.  We have seen a number of them now arrive safely; we
have seen Americans among those convoys.   
   
And so, we are going to be very clear with Americans both about the
risks and about the available options to them.  And we will continue to
stay in close communication with those Americans who we have contact
information from.  And the State Department is doing that on a
day-to-day basis — in some cases, on an hour-to-hour basis.  We remain
available to any American in Sudan who is looking for support and
guidance from the U.S.

Q    And —

MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.

Q    — can you provide any update just on even the hope or possibility
of a ceasefire, where negotiations stand?  I know the U.S. is still in
touch with generals on both of the warring sides.  Is there any role the
White House and the President has played in those talks, anything you
can share on that front?

MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we have had, from the White House, a number of
conversations with key people in Sudan as well as from the State
Department and from our ambassador on the ground, who was in daily
contact until he was pulled out but will remain working the phones from
his position now outside of the country. 

I don’t want to speculate about what will or won’t happen, because it’s
a very dynamic situation.  But we have not given up on the notion that
there could be a ceasefire that comes into effect and is durable. 

There was a ceasefire in place during a portion of the Eid holiday. 
There is, as we speak now, efforts by both sides to have a diminution in
violence.  There is a goal to continue extending that beyond the end of
the Eid period.  And we will keep working with close partners in pushing
the two sides to try to deepen and extend the diminution in violence
that we have seen and to try to get a permanent and durable ceasefire in
place.

I can’t give you a prediction as to whether that is likely to be
successful or unsuccessful.  We see the risk of protracted conflict
here.  But we also see a possibility, one that we are going to exercise
every tool we have available to us that we could get to a ceasefire, and
we want to drive to that if at all possible.

Yeah.

Q    Jake, what more can you tell us about the contours of the nuclear
deterrence package that you’re going to announce this week?  Is it —
should we view in the context of the desire on the part of the majority
of people in South Korea that they should have their own nuclear
deterrence?

MR. SULLIVAN:  We will have the presidents — the two presidents —
actually release a statement that deals with the question of extended
deterrence, particularly in the context of the threat and the evolving
threat posed by the DPRK. 

I’m going to wait until we roll out that statement.  I won’t preview it
in great detail from this podium.   
   
But what I will say is that we believe that that statement will send a
very clear and demonstrable signal of the United States’ credibility
when it comes to its extended deterrence commitments to the Republic of
Korea and to the people of Korea.  And we also believe that the ROK has
been a good steward of its non-proliferation obligations under the NPT
and will continue to do so. 

Yeah. 

Q    Thanks, Jake.  One of the early, kind of, themes of the — messages
of the administration was foreign policy for the middle class.  I was
just — wanted to ask: Is that still a driving theme?  And is it now
harder to achieve, considering these increasing challenges around the
world — what’s going on now in Sudan — (clears throat) — pardon me — as
well as Ukraine?

MR. SULLIVAN:  So, you know, I’ve heard some voices saying, for example,
we shouldn’t support Ukraine because we have to be focused at home.  And
my answer to that is the same answer that Democratic and Republican
Presidents have given over the course of decades, which is: We’re the
United States of America.  We can and must do both. 

We can look after our people at home and make far-reaching investments
in the middle class here for good-paying jobs for years and decades to
come while also standing up for the values that we hold dear around the
world, including the value of freedom and freedom for the people of
Ukraine.

We are capable of doing both.  And that’s not an abstract proposition. 
That is the last year, since the war broke out.   
   
In that time, we have not only mobilized an international coalition to
resist Russian aggression and to protect Ukraine as a sovereign and
independent country, we have also made historic investments in clean
energy, in infrastructure, in technology, in the United States —
investing in this country in ways that are going to make the middle
class stronger, more vibrant, and bigger than it was when President
Biden took office. 

So, from my perspective, the United States has significant obligations
around the world, obligations that relate directly to our national
security and to the wellbeing of working people here in this country. 
We will discharge those obligations.  We will do that while at the same
time putting in place the most significant set of investments in more
than a generation in working people, middle-class people in the United
States. 

And so, I think the results speak for themselves.

Q    Another on Ukraine —

MR. SULLIVAN:  And the answer is yes, we still are committed to a
foreign policy for the middle class. 

Yes. 

Q    Thanks, Jake.  You said from podium that the U.S. government has
been telling Americans not to go to Sudan for more than a decade, it’s
not sa- — and if they’re there, to leave. 

Obviously, that message has had limited impact, because there are
thousands of Americans who were living in Sudan when this fighting broke
out.  Is there more that needs to be done for Americans in countries
where you think they should not be to drive home that message in a more
direct way so that they’re not in harm’s way when danger erupts?

MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, Americans are free people.  We cannot dictate where
they travel, tell them they must go or not go to a particular place.  We
can only give them the best, clearest, most sustained, most consistent
advice.  And we have been as clear, as consistent, and as sustained as
we possibly can over the course not just of this administration but
previous administrations to tell people about the dangers of living in
Sudan.   
   
I would also point out that the American people do need to understand —
as I’ve stood at this podium and said in other contexts, like in
Ukraine: It is not standard practice for the United States to send in
the U.S. military into warzones to extract all American citizens.  We
didn’t do it in Libya.  We didn’t do it in Syria.  We didn’t do it in
Yemen.  And, no, we didn’t do it in Ukraine.   
   
Afghanistan was a unique case involving the end of a 20-year war that
the United States was centrally involved in.   
   
But Americans should understand that we will do — go to great lengths to
support and facilitate their departure from difficult circumstances,
that we will try to protect them from harm as best as we possibly can,
but that there should not be a broad expectation of a massive military
operation to seize an airport or otherwise evacuate people from a
country.   
   
And that has been the pattern over the course of many years.  It is the
exception, not the rule, for us to do something like that.  
   
Q    So when it comes to those great lengths you just mentioned, Kirby
this morning said that right now, you noted, it’s not very safe to try
and run some larger evacuation.  But should we take that to mean that
there is a willingness to conduct a larger-scale evacuation if and when
conditions improve, or no?

MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, there’s certainly a willingness to take steps to
help Americans be able to get out of the country.  And if those steps,
in a risk analysis, included, you know, potentially facilitating
civilian flights or anything else along those lines, the President has
asked for every conceivable option to be able to help Americans.  We
would like to help as many Americans go as possible.   
   
But we want to be able to do so in a way that is fundamentally reducing
overall risk, not increasing overall risk.  That’s the calculus that
we’re making on a day-to-day basis.   
   
And right now, we believe that the best way for us to help facilitate
people’s departure is, in fact, to support this land evacuation route,
as well as work with allies and partners who are — who are working on
their own evacuation plans as well.   
   
Q    And could you just — could you just take us a little bit behind the
scenes of the President’s decision to evacuate the embassy on Friday
night?  What — you know, what was it that tipped the scale for him to
realize, you know, “This is go time”?

MR. SULLIVAN:  I think it was a combination of three things.   
   
One, the opportunity presented itself because it became clear to us that
this was a viable operation; that we could run it, we could do it.  And
so he thought, “Okay, you’ve given me a successful — an option that will
be successful.”   
   
Second, it became clear also that there was a decent likelihood that we
would see some form of protracted conflict, even if punctuated by
moments of ceasefire.  And so, we couldn’t just wait for the end of this
all.   
   
And then third and finally, there were considerations — which I won’t go
into great detail here — involving how long you can sustain a platform
with the full complement of U.S. personnel living at an embassy
indefinitely while fighting is raging and supplies are difficult to
obtain.   
   
So, you put all of those things together.  The President felt this was
the right moment, it was the right opportunity.  He directed his
military to seize that opportunity, and they successfully carried out
the mission.   
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    On Ukraine.  Thank you — thank you, Jake.  On Ukraine, I wanted to
give you the opportunity to respond to a former White House stenographer
who this month outed you as a anonymous senior administration official
who briefed reporters on Air Force Two en route to Ukraine in 2014.   
   
He says that you spoke about giving aid to the Ukrainian national gas
industry just days after the first — or the second son had secretly
joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company.   
   
He says he considers you part of a corrupt influence-peddl- — -peddling
conspiracy.  He wants to testify to a Delaware grand jury about it.   
   
Do you have a response to that?  And were you part of a corrupt
influence-peddling operation involving Biden family in Ukraine or any
other country?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  No.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Thank you so much, Jake.  Two questions.  One about the
conversation you had with your counterpart from Brazil about the
comments — Lula comments on the war in Ukraine.  Do you believe that
conversation put the episode behind and smoothed the situation?  
   
And today, Brazil condemned the violation of Ukraine’s territorial
integrity at the U.N. Security Council.  So, right now, do you have
confidence you can count on Brazil on the matter?  
   
And then I have another question about the delegation with Colombia.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I had a good conversation with my Brazilian counterpart,
Ambassador Amorim.  We covered a wide range of issues, including Ukraine
and including some of the public comments that we had seen.  It was
constructive.  It was detailed.   
   
We agreed we were going to follow up and have a further, longer
strategic conversation about the full range of issues that the U.S. and
Brazil both face around the world.  And I’ll leave it at that for
now.   
   
But I do have confidence in the fundamental underlying strength of the
U.S.-Brazil relationship.  It is a relationship of two great
democracies, two peoples who are dynamic and innovative.  And there’s a
lot of good work we can do together, including, for example, in
protecting the Amazon.  And President Biden just made a significant
announcement of U.S. support for a Brazilian initiative to be able to
protect the Amazon.   
   
That’s the kind of thing that we should build on even as we take on
these difficult geopolitical challenges together.  
   
Yeah.   
   
Q    (Inaudible) Colombia one?  The delegation with Colombia.  
   
Q    Quick ques- — sorry, was that — we’re both on the same line.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah, go for it and then —  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Okay.  Okay.  I’ll get it.  Thanks.  I’ll go first?  Okay, thank
you.  
   
Going to the state visit, is — is the question of South Korea
contributing to Ukrainian ammunition supplies going to be part of the —
something they’ll discuss, whether that’s via the U.S. or directly to
Ukraine?  Thank you.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I will disappoint you by saying that I’m not going
to get into the private conversations that they will have about
Ukraine.  Obviously, Ukraine is going to be an important topic of
conversation.   
   
The President will thank President Yoon for the $230 million in
non-lethal assistance they have given, the support on sanctions and
export controls.  And then they will have a chance to talk about the
military situation on the ground there.   
   
But I’m not going to go further and get ahead of the President in terms
of that conversation that will take place when President Yoon and he
meet here at the White House on Wednesday.   
   
Yeah, I’ll take the — and then I’ll call it a day.  So —  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Jake.  I appreciate the coverage into — on
the 70th anniversary of U- — the U.S. and South Korea alliance.  And the
South Korean people are excited about what gift President Yoon will
bring from this summit.  So what, you know, would be the surprising
agreement between President Yoon and President Biden?  What kind of —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, if I told you about the surprising agreement, then
it wouldn’t be a surprise anymore.  (Laughter.)  
   
So, no, I don’t — look, actually, I don’t — we’re not going to spring
something on the world or on the American people or on the Korean
people.   
   
I think the Korean and the American people are expecting to see a summit
in which there are tangible deliverables in the security space — and we
will have deliverables related to extended deterrence; in the economic
space; and there will be announcements of significant investments in the
people-to-people space, and you will see announcements in that regard as
well.   
   
And then they expect the two presidents to cover issues related to the
big topics of the day, from the war in Ukraine to the climate crisis.   
   
And so, I think this summit is going to meet the very high expectations
that both publics have from it.  And they’re right to have high
expectations because we are reaching a new level in strength of the
U.S.-ROK Alliance.  I think that will be on full display when President
Yoon is here on Wednesday.   
   
And we are very much looking forward to laying out the full suite of
achievements and outcomes from this summit on Wednesday.  And I will not
further steal the thunder from the President, either this President or
the ROK President, before doing that on Wednesday.  
   
Q    One more — one more thing on Russia.  Russia mentioned the
possibility of sending more than 10,000 North Korean troops to the
Donbas.  How can you say about this?  
   
North Korea’s troops — special forces — to Donbas in Ukraine.  So how
are you going to say about this?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I mean, our position is that there should not be Russian
forces on sovereign Ukrainian territory.  And there shouldn’t be forces
of any other hostile country on sovereign Ukrainian territory either.   
   
And that position is clear and unequivocal — shared between the U.S.,
the ROK, and every country that has voted to condemn this brutal illegal
war of aggression being perpetrated by Russia against Ukraine.  
   
Thank you, guys.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think the pool has to gather?  
   
MS. DALTON:  It’s everybody.  It’s open —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, every- —  
   
MS. DALTON:  It’s open press.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, it’s open press.   
   
MS. DALTON:  Yes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I guess you guys can go
gather, if you choose to do.   
   
Q    Karine, can we just ask you real quick — the President has been
under some calls to now sit down with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy now
that he has released his — the outlines of his plan on the debt limit. 
Why is — is now the time for the President to actually speak to the
Speaker and begin substantive negotiations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So here’s the thing, Zeke — (laughs) — I tried to —  
   
Look, we’ve been very clear.  We’re not going to negotiate over — over
avoiding default.  We’ve been very clear about that.   
   
We — the ad- — the administration is going to have a conversation with
leaders over the budget, over the spending cuts.  We’ve been very clear
about that.  And we’ve been — we’ve said that from the beginning — from
the beginning of this process that, look, we’ll have that
conversation.   
   
But when it comes to default, when it comes to their constitutional
duty, that is something that they can do today.  They can actually deal
with something that would be devastating if they didn’t take action,
right?  
   
Now, when it comes to what we have seen them put forward — 22 percent
cut on education, on veterans, on Meals on Wheels, on food safety, on
law enforcement — all of those things are devastating to workers,
seniors, to our children, to working families.  And clearly, they showed
us what their value were.   
   
But what they have done is they have put those two things together — the
de- — the debt ceiling and spending cuts.  And we have always been very
clear, Zeke — we have been very, very clear — we are not going to
negotiate when it comes to the full faith and credit of this nation. 
And they are holding that hostage currently.  They’re holding the
economy hostage.   
   
And so, look, they have to — they have to — we’re not negotiating over —
over that.  And they have to avoid default.  
   
Q    So what do they need to do — what does the Speaker need to do?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s very clear.  They — it’s very clear.  They need
to — they need to make sure that we’re not put in a situation where our
economy could put — be put at risk.  And, again, been very clear about
that.   
   
I’m going to — I know we have to — I think we have to —  
   
MS. DALTON:  Anyone who wants to cover has to leave now.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, you have to leave now if you want to cover — if
you want to cover.  And I’ll go for another — I think once he starts
speaking, we have to end.  So I’ll go for a couple more minutes.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank — thank you, Karine.  Just, we saw the mifepristone
decision.  And so, I wanted to — we saw the statement from the
President, of course, over the weekend as well.  Just going forward as
that case makes its way through the courts, what more can we expect to
see from the White House and from the President and, of course, the
VP?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — so the one thing that really want to make
sure that we are — that the American people understand that mifepristone
is very much — remains available while we continue the fight in courts. 
And that’s what we are committed to do.   
   
We’ve said this over and over again.  This administration — the
Biden-Harris administration is going to continue to fight for women’s
rights.   
   
We’re going to continue to fight for the FDA to have the right to — to
make these medical decisions, to make these evidence-based decisions.   
   
And so, that’s what we saw.  That’s what the judgment really putting —
putting — preventing the lower court decision from going into effect,
which is incredibly important.  But we are going to continue to fight,
and we’re going to continue to call on Congress to codify Roe.  And that
is something that you heard — that you saw in the President’s statement
that you — something that you’ve heard from the President, many times.  
   
Again, the fight continues.  We’re going to continue to fight for
millions of women who are across the country.  And that will not stop.  
   
Q    So just a specific question on that.  A lot of retail pharmacies,
the pharmacy chains around the country, are going through this
certification process to keep the pill available or even, in some
situations, make the pill available for the first time.  Can you give us
an update on where things stand?  Is the White House working with HHS? 
Because that regulatory change was proposed in January.  Is there — is
there any update on that?  Because that’s likely to obviously —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t — I don’t have an update.  That is something
that HHS can speak to much more directly.  What I can say from here is
that we believe that we will prevail in the courts.  We believe that the
law is on our side.  And we’re going to continue to fight for millions
of women across the country.  
   
Go ahead, Joey.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks, Karine.  I want to follow up on what Zeke asked
here.  Senator Klobuchar on CNN yesterday said that President Biden
should sit down and negotiate with the Speaker on the budget, but also
made clear that the spending cuts, you know, should not be tied to the
debt ceiling.  And so, would President Biden sit down with McCarthy to
debate, to negotiate their — their different budget proposals?  Or where
do — what is the position on meeting with him?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we — I want to be very clear here.  The House
Republicans’ position is: Unless the President and the Senate agree to
their entire agenda, that they’re going to default and crash the
economy.  And — and that is dangerous.  That is something that we’re
going to continue to call out.  And it is unreasonable to do.  
   
We have been very clear: There will not be any negotiation around de- —
around the debt ceiling.  Right?  
   
This is something that is their constitutional duty to do.  They’ve done
it three times.  You’ve heard me say it over and over again.  They did
it three times in the last administration, and they should do it now.  
   
And, look, you know, every — every Republican that votes for this bill
that Speaker McCarthy and MAGA Republicans have put forth, they’re
voting for cutting — cutting costs on veterans.  They’re voting for
cutting costs on education.  I just laid out at the top of the briefing
what that would mean: 60,000 — I mentioned 60,000 teachers.  I mentioned
how many — how many kids it would affect.  
   
And so, that’s what they would be voting for: against those things that
American families need.  And we’re talking about programs that they need
to meet ends meet.  
   
And so, we’ve been very, very clear: It is unreasonable to put forth
what they did last week.  It is cruel.  That piece of legislation is
cruel.  
   
And so, they need to really make sure that they — that we don’t go into
default.  And that’s what they’re asking to do.  They’re asking to hold
our — hold our economy hostage and go into default.  And that’s
something that we’re going to continue to call out.  
   
Q    Now, last week you didn’t seem to rule out the possibility, though,
of President Biden sitting down with McCarthy at some point.  Is that
something you’re open to?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, again, House Republicans must avo- — avoid
default.  Been very clear.  And that is within their power to do at any
moment.  That is within their power to do at any moment.  And so, that’s
what we’re expecting them to see.  
   
I think I have to wrap it up super quick, guys.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    In the — so, in the Ralph Yarl shooting, again, city local leaders
are calling on the DOJ to step in and pursue hate crime charges.  Is
that something that the White House would support?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — I’m not going to get ahead of DOJ.  That’s
something that they need to decide.   
   
We’ve been very clear about Ralph Yarl.  As you know, the President
spoke to him and his family last week to wish him a speedy recovery. 
And we’ve been very clear on what — how we see moving forward when it
comes to gun violence and Congress to do more, Republicans in Congress
to do more.  
   
Q    Governor Parson said Biden was —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I —  
   
MS. DALTON:  (Inaudible).  Sorry.  
   
Q    — the President was politicizing the situation.  Do you believe
that the President was politicizing the situation?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t — I didn’t — I’m sorry.  I didn’t hear the
first part.  
   
Q    The governor of Missouri said the President was politicizing the
situation (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What the President is doing is trying to protect
families and communities across the country.  That’s the action that
this President has taken the last two years, doing more — almost two
dozen actions and executive orders to make sure that we are stopping or
trying — taking steps to stop an epidemic that we’re seeing with gun
violence.  And that’s what he should do as President.  
   
Now we ask the House Republicans — House Republicans to do the same, to
have some courage so we can protect our families and protect our kids.  
   
Thanks, everybody.  I’ll see you tomorrow.
