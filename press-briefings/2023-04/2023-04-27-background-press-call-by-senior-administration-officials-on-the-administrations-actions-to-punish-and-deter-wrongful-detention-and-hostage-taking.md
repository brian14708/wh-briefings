10:04 A.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us on this
call.   
   
Just ground rules real quick: The call is going to be on background,
attributable to a “senior administration…” — well, to “senior
administration officials,” plural.  
   
The call is going to be embargoed until 1:00 p.m. this afternoon.  
   
Just so folks are aware, the subject matter of the call is going to be
new sanctions that the Biden-Harris administration is issuing today to
hold accountable those that are engaged in hostage-taking and the
wrongful detention of Americans.  
   
Not for attribution but for the awareness of those on the call, our
speakers this afternoon include \[senior administration official\] and
\[senior administration official\].   
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to \[senior administration official\]. 
He’s going to give you a preview of the sanctions and how that supports
the Biden administration’s efforts.  
   
Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you very much, \[moderator\]. 
And good morning to everyone.  
   
Thanks for making the time this morning and especially for talking with
us to hear about how the Biden-Harris administration is using the
authorities and tools at our disposal to hold accountable those who’ve
engaged in the wrongful detention and hostage-taking of Americans.  
   
To offer some context: From day one of this administration, we have
prioritized the safe return of Americans wrongfully held overseas.  
   
And there’s a very dedicated, very skilled group of experts across the
government who work day in and day out to identify and pursue all
available options in this area.  
   
And I would break the area, in some ways, into four categories.  One is
resolving current cases, many of which we inherited from the prior
administration.  And we’ve had some remarkable successes in that area
that we can talk about.  
   
Second is warning our people.  And the State Department has improved its
travel advisories to be even crisper and clearer about the risks of
wrongful detention specifically in certain countries.  
   
Third is strengthening the global norm against wrongful detention.  And
this is something Secretary Blinken has personally taken on from his
early days in the role.  
   
And fourth is punishing — and, by punishing, deterring — those who
engage in this sort of appalling behavior.  And it’s in that fourth
category that I want to spend some time today.  
   
Last summer, President Biden augmented the U.S. government’s toolkit in
that area with new and expanded tools to impose costs on the culprits of
wrongful detention and hostage-taking when he signed and issued
Executive Order 14078, which is called “Bolstering Efforts to Bring
Hostages and Wrongfully Detained U.S. Nationals Home.”  
   
This executive order itself drew on the 2020 Robert Levinson Hostage
Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act.  And that law, I should
emphasize, is a credit to the perseverance of the Levinson family and
others who have turned tragedy and hardship into constructive and
meaningful action.  And they really do inspire us by that work.  
   
The executive order in particular builds on those who worked hard to
bring to fruition the Levinson Act and to enhance the capacity of the
U.S. government to tackle this important set of challenges.  
   
Today, we are announcing the first set of sanctions under this executive
order against actors in Russia and in Iran that have previously or are
currently holding hostage or wrongfully detaining Americans.   
   
These actors in Russia and in Iran have tried to use Americans for
political leverage or to seek concessions from the United States.   
   
These actions threaten the stability and integrity of the international
political system.  They also threaten the safety of U.S. nationals and
other persons abroad.  
   
To be a little more specific, we will be announcing sanctions today
against Russia’s Federal Security Service — often known as the “FSB” —
for being responsible for or complicit in, directly or indirectly
engaged in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise
directing the wrongful detention of a U.S. national abroad.   
   
The FSB has repeatedly been involved in the arrest, investigation, and
detention of U.S. nationals wrongfully detained in Russia.   
   
Indeed, Russia’s state-owned media outlets have publicly acknowledged
the FSB’s involvement in the arrest and investigation of wrongfully
detained U.S. nationals.   
   
In addition, we will be announcing sanctions against Iran’s Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps Intelligence Organization — better known as
“IRGC-IO” — for being responsible for or complicit in, directly or
indirectly engaged in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or
otherwise directing the wrongful detention of a U.S. national abroad.  
   
That’s the exact language of the EO you hear me repeating both times.  
   
The IRGC-IO frequently holds and interrogates detainees, including at
least one wrongfully detained U.S. national, in Evin Prison.  And Evin
Prison has a long and sordid history of human rights abuses, including
extensive reports of torture.  
   
In addition, four IRGC-IO leaders will also be designated today for
their support to or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the IRGC-IO’s
conduct in this area.  
   
Today’s sanctions are one of a series of efforts — some public like
this, some private — to secure the release of U.S. nationals wrongfully
held overseas, to promote accountability for the culprits, and, by doing
so, to prevent and deter the next set of cases from arising in the first
place.  
   
We as an administration, as a White House, as a State Department, as a
government remain committed to reuniting Americans held hostage or
wrongfully detained with their families.   
   
Let me turn things over to our next speaker, my colleague and friend
\[senior administration official\], for more about today’s actions.  And
then, \[senior administration official\] and I will do our best to
answer a few questions.  
   
Over to you, \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  
   
Hey.  Just to reiterate, to emphasize what \[senior administration
official\] said: In July of 2022, the President signed Executive Order
14078 to provide the U.S. government with expanded tools to deter and
disrupt hostage-taking and wrongful detentions, including imposing
financial sanctions and visa restrictions.   
   
Today we are using this authority, as \[senior administration official\]
said, to promote accountability for those responsible for wrongfully
detaining U.S. nationals abroad.   
   
Our action is a warning to those around the world who would wrongfully
detain U.S. nationals of the potential consequences of their actions.   
   
As Secretary Blinken said, and I quote, “The United States will continue
our relentless efforts to secure the release of U.S. nationals who are
held hostage or wrongfully detained and reunite them with their loved
ones.  Today’s actions are one tool in that cause.  And we will continue
to use all authorities at our disposal to bring U.S. nationals home.” 
Unquote.    
   
I would be remiss if I didn’t also reemphasize the importance of this
day, not only for the actions we are taking, but where the authorities
to do so came from, as \[senior administration official\] said.  And
that is the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking
Accountability Act.  
   
In 2007, as you all know, Iran abducted former FBI agent Bob Levinson,
and Iranian authorities have yet to account for Bob’s fate.  In the
years since, his family has suffered unspeakable grief and pain.   
   
Bob’s family has inspired the United States to partner with the families
of every U.S. hostage and wrongful detainee held captive abroad.   
   
Bob’s legacy lives on in the Levinson Act and the actions taken here
today.  He will never be forgotten.  Bob will never be forgotten.  
   
Thanks.  I’ll turn it back over to you, Josh.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much.  \[Moderator\], should
we open up for some questions?  
   
MODERATOR:  Yes, let’s get it open for some questions.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks so much, guys.  This is Jennifer and Kylie here.  We
were wondering what the practical implications of these sanctions on
these two organizations are and how effectively you see this deterring
any future hostage-taking.  
   
And then, why now?  And are you concerned that this could impact
negatively any negotiations to get out the Americans who are detained
there?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks for the good questions. 
I’ll take a first stab and see if \[senior administration official\]
wants to layer on.  
   
So, look, this is — sanctions have their role as part of comprehensive
toolboxes to deal with hard challenges.  And among today’s targets, some
— because they are bad actors in the world in multiple ways — are
already sanctioned under other authorities; some are not.  
   
But we think — as with sanctions in the human rights context, in the
corruption context, in the contributing to war and instability context —
that sanctions are a piece of holding accountable bad actors for their
role in perpetrating appalling activity in the world.  To have one’s
assets frozen, to be essentially denied the ability to move such assets
through the global financial system, or at least the key parts of it
that enforce sanctions like this, that is a real detriment to actors in
the world.  
   
And we think it’s important to issue sanctions like this.  And, of
course, as in those other areas I mentioned, there will be tranches yet
to come; this is just a first tranche under a new authority.   
   
We think it is important to show that there is accountability; that in
addition to resolving particular individual cases as best we can, as
fast as we can, we are also showing that one cannot engage in this sort
of awful behavior of using human beings as pawns, as bargaining chips,
without paying consequences.  And these are some of the consequences.  
   
In terms of timing, you saw the executive order was just issued last
summer.  It takes time to build sanctions packages under a new authority
to make sure that the evidentiary predicate has been established, that
the right legal review has occurred, the right coordination has
occurred.  
   
We’re proud to get this first tranche out.  But as I say, there are
other sanctions targets under this authority in development even right
now.  And that’s — it will be like other contexts in which, over time,
there will be periodic new announcements of sanctions.  
   
I will also say that we consulted across the U.S. government with key
experts and made sure that the ongoing efforts to resolve these sets of
cases, we don’t think will be set back by the accountability that these
actors deserve for the wrongdoing.   
   
If anything, one thing that sanctions can offer — and you see the
Treasury and State Departments talk about this in their public releases
about new sanctions — is that sanctions are meant to change behavior and
to incentivize better behavior.  And we hope that these can contribute
to doing that now and into the future.  
   
\[Senior administration official\], you should please jump in as well.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  I agree with everything you said.  
   
I would just say that as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage
Affairs Office, our job is to engage in diplomacy.  More often than not,
diplomacy involves incentives, and incentives are preferred.  
   
But from time to time, diplomacy requires that some consequences be
introduced — negative consequences be introduced for bad actors,
particularly in this area of detaining — wrongfully detaining, taking
hostage Americans.  
   
And so, as \[senior administration official\] pointed out, this
executive order was issued last summer.  And over the past several
months, the bad actors in question here have demonstrated they need some
consequences.  And that’s what today’s actions are intended to take.  
   
Q    Hi, guys.  Thank you so much for talking to us.  I’m sorry if this
sounds exactly like Jenny’s question, but I really want to push you on
it.   
   
There are sanctions on both of these organizations under different
authorities.  And so, realistically speaking, I mean, are we going to
see any changes?  How do you anticipate that this punishment will
manifest itself realistically when you already have several other
sanctions on these groups and individuals connected to them?  And that’s
it.  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  Thanks, Vivian, for the
question.  Look, this is a question that arises in the sanctions context
long before this EO or this tranche of sanctions, which is that,
regrettably perhaps, actors in the world who are bad in one way are bad
in other ways.   
   
And you often find that actors are — whether they’re entities, whether
they’re individuals or both — they are sanctioned for human rights
abuses, they are sanctioned for corruption, they are sanctioned for
other behavior that qualifies them for sanctions.  
   
We don’t think being sanctioned under one authority should make you
immune from being sanctioned under another.  If you engage in wrongful
detentions of U.S. nationals, you should be sanctioned for engaging in
wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.  You shouldn’t get an out just
because you engaged in other bad behavior as well — as, for example,
IRGC-IO and the FSB have.  
   
We do think it sends a broader message that the first tranche of
sanctions are being announced specifically for this type of behavior. 
Because we’re very concerned about this type of behavior.   
   
You saw, this week, our Ambassador to the United Nations stand
side-by-side with Elizabeth Whelan to make the case to the international
community in New York, but really to the watching world, that the use of
human beings as political pawns, as bargaining chips, detained by
governments but on false pretenses, is a practice that seems to be
trending in the wrong direction and that we, as a global community, need
to point back in the right direction, which is the direction of
extinction.  
   
And so, we think showing that there’s a penalty to be paid, in addition
to other steps that might be taken — there’s a penalty of this
particular type to be paid for engaging in this behavior — is in and of
itself an important step.  
   
Q    Thanks for doing this.  A couple questions.  I was wondering if you
could clarify: These individuals are — you said these sanctions are on
the organizations.  Why are you not sanctioning any individuals who are
responsible for the wrongful detention of Americans?   
   
And then, can you provide a list of or mention any specific wrongfully
detained Americans that formed the underpinning for these specific
sanctions?  Is it ongoing detainees or previous ones?  If you could can
you name some specific cases.  
   
And then lastly, you mentioned that sanctions are not just — can
sometimes be incentives.  Is the thinking here that you could lift these
sanctions as part of negotiations, as part of a trade to bring Americans
home?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much, Zeke.  And again, I’ll
— I’ll take the first swing, and then \[senior administration official\]
will back me up.  
   
So, okay, in terms of entities and individuals: So, in addition to the
two entities, the FSB and the IRGC-IO, that are being sanctioned today,
there are four individuals associated with the IRGC-IO also being
sanctioned under these authorities.   
   
I’ll give you a quick rundown on the four.  Mohammad Kazemi became the
commander of the IRGC-IO back in June 2022.  He has been responsible for
suppressing civil society, arresting Iranian dissidents, and has
overseen the brutal crackdown against protests, and obviously, as with
all of these folks, we think is tied to wrongful detention of
Americans.  So that’s one — Mohammad Kazemi.   
   
The second, Mohamad Sayyar, is the deputy — co-deputy chief, I should
say — of the IRGC-IO.  And in addition to wrongful detention activities,
we believe Sayyari has been directly involved in arranging logistics for
those held prisoner in Iran.   
   
The third individual target is Mohammad Mohagheghi, the co-deputy chief,
brigadier general of IRGC-IO.  And, in addition to wrongful detention
activities, has been involved in counter espionage operations in Syria
among other activities.   
   
And finally, the fourth individual target is Ruhollah Bazghandi, the — a
IRGC-IO counterintelligence official we think has been, of course,
involved in wrongful detention of U.S. and other foreign prisoners, but
has also been involved in assassination plots and other activities.   
   
So you have those four individuals as well.  Again, this does not mean
this is the end of the universe of sanction targets under this authority
— certainly globally, but with respect to Russia or Iran, as well.  But
we think it’s a really important start.  So that’s one.  
   
You asked about, kind of, the victim side.  And, look, these sanctions
are premised on engaging in a pattern of activity of wrongful detention
or hostage-taking by these entities and actors.  That said, of course,
it is quite public that there have been cases in Russia that we have
been proud to resolve as an administration.  And there are cases that we
are working very, very hard yet to resolve.   
   
And similarly, in Iran, there are cases resolved and cases unresolved. 
And I think those speak to the pattern of activity that has justly
earned these actors and individuals their sanction status as of
today.   
   
And then finally, you asked kind of whether these might be “leverage to
resolve” cases.  Look, here’s what you’ll see in the Treasury
announcement today, and I think it’s helpful language: “The power and
integrity of OFAC sanctions” — I’m quoting here — “drives not only from
the ability to designate but also from a willingness to remove persons
consistent with the law.  The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to
punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior.”  
   
So all I’ll say is we take an all-tools approach to bringing Americans
home.  And as this administration has brought hostages and wrongful
detainees home from Afghanistan and Burma and Haiti and Iran and Russia
and Venezuela, we have brought to bear different tools and different
contexts.  And I don’t think we rule things out if they could be the
difference between an American being in detention, where they never
should have been, versus home with their families where they belong.   
   
\[Senior administration official\], over to you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[senior administration
official\].  Absolutely right.   
   
The truth is, as I said, this get — today’s action, pursuant to last
summer’s executive order, gave us a whole new set of tools for our
toolkit in returning Americans who were wrongfully detained and held
hostage abroad.  
   
The bad actors involved here, of course, have a long pattern of many,
many years of doing this to Americans, and we’ve had this tool at our
disposal since last summer.  In the months since, we’ve made the
calculation that it’s time to impose consequences.   
   
But as \[senior administration official\] said, that doesn’t mean we
can’t impose more consequences.  Or if the bad actors involved, or the
governments for which they work, have a change of course — specifically
on American citizens, U.S. nationals that we are trying to liberate and
to bring home — we have some flexibility thanks to the executive order
and to the Levinson Act given to us by the Congress.   
   
Thanks.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you for taking my call.  So I believe when you announced
the sanctions authorization last year, you reached out to the families
of Americans held abroad.  Did you do the same before announcing these
sanctions?  
   
And just kind of related to that, I’m curious: How do you determine
which families of Americans held abroad gets a meeting with the
President?  Obviously, he’s met with families of Trevor Reed, Paul
Whelan, and Brittney Griner.  But there are many other families of
Americans held abroad who are — who want to meet with the President but
haven’t had the opportunity.  Thanks.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks so much.  So, on the first
question, yes, we’ve previewed this for a number of relevant families
ahead of today’s announcement.   
   
And then, on the second: Look, the President meets with families in —
going through these horrific sorts of circumstances much as the
President engages in other sorts of meetings, which is he can’t do
everything, but he does want a firsthand sense of what things are like
in the areas that he works so hard to address.   
   
And in this case, having direct contact with some families allows them
to have direct conversations, just as he does when he visits places
where infrastructure is being built but not other places, or just as he
does when he is able to meet with some foreign leaders and not others. 
You can’t do it all when you’re the President, but you do want as much
as possible that visceral firsthand sense of where there are still
challenges as well as the impact that your work can have.   
   
I would emphasize also that there are families who have met with this
President whose loved ones have come home, and there are families who’ve
met with this President whose loved ones we are still working to bring
home.  There are families who haven’t met with this President whose
loved ones have come home.  And, of course, there are families who
haven’t met with this President for whom we’re still working to bring
their loved ones home.   
   
It is not a determinant of effort.  It is certainly not a determinant of
result.   
   
And indeed, the reason that the Obama-Biden administration created
dedicated structures in our government — like the office of the Special
Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, like the
Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell based at the FBI — is to ensure that there
are experts, including quite senior officials, who work to resolve these
cases day in and day out.  And that work continues regardless of any
presidential meeting.  
   
Q    Hello, there.  Thank you for doing the call.  I have a couple of
questions.   
   
First of all, how far along is the process on Mark Fogel?  And why is he
not considered wrongfully detained?  We’ve never had a good answer to
that.  And are you in touch with his family?  
   
Also we know that the President’s time is really valuable,  
but there’s still complaints from families that some hostages get more
attention than others, as you know.  And I don’t think your previous
answer really responded to their needs, especially some of those still
being held in Iran, if you care to address that.  
   
And, you know, finally, has he had contact with Evan Gershkovich’s
family?  And, if so, can you describe it?  Is it a phone call?  Or it
could be anything at the presidential level regarding the Gershkovichs. 
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks — thanks for the
questions.  I’ll work backwards.   
   
The President did speak by phone with the Gershkovich family, I believe,
as he was taking off for his Ireland trip.  And I think we’ve indicated
that we were grateful to the Gershkovich parents for taking the time to
speak with the President, who of course conveyed how awful these
circumstances are and how hard we will work to try to resolve a very
challenging case that’s now before all of us.  
   
And look, we — we understand that — that what families want is to be
advocates for their loved ones.  They want to be heard.  They want to
know that their government is prioritizing the work here.  And I can
assure on all fronts that the answer is they are heard and they are
impressive and, frankly, quite moving as advocates for their loved ones
and that the priority is absolutely there.  
   
So when there isn’t a presidential meeting, we work very hard to
communicate that in other ways, including with what are often quite
frequent meetings with senior folks here at the White House, myself
included; with senior folks over at the State Department, including
\[senior administration official\]; and with others to try to keep
families informed.  
   
I’m not going to get into the details of any wrongful detention
designation review — which is, by law, entrusted to the State Department
— other than to say that that designation is not the gatekeeper to
whether a family whose loved one is held abroad gets senior
attention.   
   
And indeed, the Fogel family has been here at the White House with
senior officials; has been in touch even more frequently with the State
Department, including at a leadership level; and, moreover, that we have
formally sought the Embassy Moscow for Fogel’s release on humanitarian
grounds.  
   
\[Senior administration official\], you may not have anything to add,
but I’ll — I’ll give you the chance in case you want to.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:   Hey, \[senior administration
official\].  Thanks so much.   
   
Ditto what you said about Mark Fogel.  Ambassador Tracy has pressed for
his humanitarian release.  And, obviously, that’s an ongoing process
within the building, constantly evaluating the circumstances of the
case.   
   
I should say, more generally, about — to the earlier point about family
engagement that, on Gershkovich, SPEHA Carstens has visit with the
Gershkovich family up at their home.  
   
And, of course, we’re in constant contact — SPEHA Carstens and also the
Secretary — in constant contact with the families of hostages and
wrongful detainees.  He sits with them — the Secretary, my boss, myself,
our team here sit with the families every week, talk with them, cry with
them, update them, and try to communicate our support as best as
possible until we can free their loved ones and bring them home.  
   
Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks.  On — on the question of timing, you know,
obviously, you guys have had the authority to begin to do this for some
months.  Did this begin — did the planning for this begin before Evan
Gershkovich was taken?   Or did his detention by the Russians — and
maybe the question is: and did his detention by the Russians accelerate
or motivate or prompt the decision to announce the sanctions and to do
the sanctions now?  How connected are those cases?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  Thanks, Mike.  
   
The work to develop the sanctions package was well underway before the
appalling detention of Evan a month ago.  But I would emphasize that, as
I indicated before, these sorts of sanctions are about patterns of
activity.  
   
And so I do think when one sees another detention deemed wrongful by the
State Department like that, it reinforces the just unacceptable behavior
that we see happening with respect to the — the sanctioned entities and
individuals today.  
   
And of course, you know, part of what we do is try to make sure our
warnings to Americans reflect that — that the travel advisories that now
have, since last summer, the “D” for wrongful detention indicator and
have, especially in the case of Iran and Russia, just extremely stark
language warning about the risks of wrongful detention.   
   
Part of what we do, of course, is try to resolve cases, and that
includes new ones when those regrettably arise.  And now, as today’s
announcement instantiates, part of what we do is punish those who engage
in this sort of behavior.  
   
MODERATOR:  That concludes our call today.  Thank you all for your
time.   
   
And just, again, a reminder that this is all held under embargo until
1:00 p.m.  Thanks so much.
