James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:11 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Happy Tuesday.  
   
Okay, I have a few things at the top for all of you, so please be
patient.  (Laughter.)  
   
As you all just saw, this afternoon the President was out in the Rose
Garden alongside with family caregivers, people with disabilities,
long-term care workers, people — long-term care workers, early
educators, veterans, and aging advocates.  Signed an executive order to
expand access to affordable, high-quality care and provide support for
care workers and family caregivers.  
    
The — this executive order, which includes more than 50 directives for
agencies across the government, is the most comprehensive set of
executive actions by — by — any President has ever taken to make care
more affordable and accessible for hardworking families and further
support care workers and family caregivers.   
   
The reality is that too many families are struggling to access the
affordable, high-quality care they need and too many care workers lack
the support they need to do their critical work and are leaving the
workforce.  
    
The results have hurt our economy and American workers, particularly
women.  President Biden wants to change our trajectory and transform
care in this country.  And that is reflected in his fiscal year 2024
budget.   
   
President Biden has also — also wants to ensure taxpayers get the best
value for investments we’re already made by making — by helping to make
American families access care, all while supporting care workers and
family caregivers and growing our economy as well.   
   
And that is exactly what this executive order will do.  
   
Now, this next topper here that I have — it’s just one — it feels like
every week, as least once a week, I come to the podium and I talk about
this gun violence epidemic that we’re seeing across the country and how
our communities and families across America yet again have been
devastated by tragic acts of gun violence.   
   
And it is not just devasting for me.  I’m sure it’s devastating for all
of you and your families, it’s devasting for this President, it’s
devastating for our administration, and — to have to continue to do that
over and over again.   
   
And — and so, let me just lay out, sadly, what we have seen these last
couple of days:  
   
Four young people killed at a sweet 16 party in Dadeville, Alabama.  
   
Two killed and four others injured on Saturday night in a crowded public
park in Louisville.  
   
A bright, young, loving 16-year-old kid, Ralph Yarl, shot in the head in
Missouri after ringing the wrong doorbell.   
   
And we just learned a few hours ago — about 12 hours ago — about a young
woman — 20 year — 20-year-old woman in Upstate New York who was killed
for turning down the wrong driveway.   
   
And these are just some of the tragedies that actually have made the
headlines.   
   
As you saw from the President, he and the First Lady are grieving for
those killed and the many others injured and fighting — fighting for
their lives in the wake of this gun violence that we’re seeing across
the country.  
   
The President had the chance to speak on the phone with Ralph last
night.  In addition to talking about Ralph’s success in high school — in
high school, his hopes for the future, and wishing him a speedy
recovery, the President committed to Ralph and his mom, as he has
committed to so many other survivors, that he will continue to fight for
gun safety reforms.   
   
That’s because action on gun safety is what we owe — it is what we owe
to those who have had their lives stolen from them, and it is what the
American people want to see.  A majority of the American people want to
see us take action.   
   
Despite that, last week we saw many national Republican elected
officials stand alongside NRA in a race to the bottom on dangerous —
dangerous laws that further erode gun safety.  Tho- — the proposals
they’re pushing take us in the wrong direction at a time when we’re
seeing gun violence surging, particularly gun deaths of our children.   
   
Now, this stat, as you’ve heard me say many times — the President put it
in his statement recently — guns is the leading cause of death in our
children.  Guns is the leading cause of death in our children.   
   
So, as the President has said, he wants to work across the aisle in good
faith on federal legislation that will save lives. It is within
Congress’s power to require safe storage of firearms, require background
checks for all guns — gun sales, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity
from liability, and ban assault weapons and also high-capacity
magazines.   
   
And he continues to believe this should happen without delay.  This is
something that they can do today if they chose.   
    
Okay.  On to the next topic.  As you saw on Friday, the Supreme Court
temporarily paused the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision that —
just like the Texas district court’s decision — attempts to disregard
FDA’s scientific judgment regarding mifepristone.  This administration
continues to stand by FDA’s evidence-based approval of mifepristone and
the agency’s independent, expert authority to review, approve, and
regulate a wide range of prescription drugs.  
    
In recent weeks, we’ve seen hundreds of pharmaceutical companies and
executives, attorney generals from across the country, and members of
Congress all speak out against the dangerous precedent this court
decision could set if it does stand.  
    
We’ve even seen conservative legal scholars, commentators, and ed boards
like the Wall Street Journal all point out the flaws in the court’s
reasoning.  
    
I have said this many times: If the district court’s decision or the
Fifth Circuit’s decision is upheld, it would put women’s health at risk
and undermine FDA’s ability to keep safe and effective medications
available for people who need them.  And it could open the floodgates of
attacks against any FDA-approved medication that Americans rely on for
care.  
   
So, today you’ll hear from the Vice President — Vice President Harris —
who will host a conversation in Reno to talk about the administration’s
work to protect reproductive rights, including new actions she announced
last week to safeguard patient privacy.  
    
The stakes of this could not be higher.  It could not be higher.  And
we’re going to remain focused on prevailing in the courts so that women
can access the care they need without — without government
interference.   
   
All right, next up, as you know, it’s Tax Day.  Happy Tax Day.  And we
have some good news for taxpayers.  I know people are always excited
about this day.   
   
Yesterday, we learned that thanks to new funding from the President’s
Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS has significantly improved customer
service.  You see this to my left here.  (References displayed data on
television screen.)  
   
This tax season, the IRS answered 2.4 million more calls than last year;
cut phone waits time from 27 minutes to 4 minutes — that’s what you see
here in this graphic behind me; served 87 percent of customers who
called, up from just — just 15 percent — served 87 percent of customers
who called, up from 17 — 15 percent last year — pardon me; and helped
100,000 more taxpayers in person.  
   
So now, MAGA congressional Republicans want to repeal this progress,
making customer services worse for hardworking taxpayers and making it
easier for wealthy tax cheats and big corporations to get away with
cheating on their taxes.  So it’s literally the first bill that the
House Republicans have passed.  That’s how they want to move forward
here.   
   
President Biden and congressional Democrats have a different agenda:
more help for taxpayers while ensuring the super-rich pay what they
owe.  That’s what we’re seeing today.  
   
Finally — and finally, a word on the discussion today of the debt limit
and the budget.  
   
So you’ve heard the President share his father’s saying, “Don’t tell me
what you value.  Show me your budget and I will…” and it — I will — and
that will show us — you, the American people, what you value.”  And you
hear the President say that over and over again.  You’ve heard me say
that, repeating the President, from time to time here at the podium.  
   
And here’s the thing: We still haven’t seen a budget from House
Republicans.  What we have seen from them are trickle-down proposals
that would sell out hardworking Americans.  
   
Speaker McCarthy — McCarthy doubled down on many of these proposals
yesterday, and the Republican conference has advanced others that would
kill jobs by sending manufacturing plants we’re delivering overseas, end
Medicare’s new power we gave it to negotiate lower drug costs, increase
energy costs while increasing the deficit, take food assistance and
healthcare away from millions, make devastating cuts to veterans’
benefit and education, defund law enforcement and border security.   
   
They’re even talking about adding $3 trillion to our debt in wasteful
tax giveaways to the richest Americans and big corporations.  
   
Compare that to what we’re trying to do.  Compare that to what this
President is fighting for.   
   
Today, he’s taking unprecedented actions on behalf of hardworking
families to make childcare more affordable, improve home care for
veterans, and improve care for older Americans.  
   
He’s laid out how to shrink the deficit by $3 trillion, by ending
wasteful subsidies for rich spec- — rich special interests and having
them pay their fair share.  That’s all we’re asking — for them to pay
their fair share.   
   
Also by expanding the power he gave Medicare to reduce lower drug
costs.  
   
He’s fighting to pick up the pace of the reshoring trend he’s leading
right now.  
   
He wants to support law enforcement with funding for community policing
and to ban assault weapons so that we can reduce gun crime and save
lives.  
   
And he wants to preserve our most basic rights, like the right of women
to make their own healthcare decisions.  
   
So, again, we’d like to see a Republican budget — we have not seen one
yet — so that the American people can see for themselves, in a
transparent way, what is it that House Republicans want to do.   
   
But one thing that we know that is clear is that this President —
President Biden’s budget shows his priority is delivering for
hardworking Americans.  
   
And one last thing before I go.  I promise I will be taking questions
momentarily.  (Laughter.)  It’s been a while since I’ve been in here, so
—  
   
So I want to make sure that I introduce you to a fresh face in our
briefing room today.  Kelly Scully has joined our team as Assistant
Press Secretary from her former role as Communications Director at
ONDCP.  
   
She’s a veteran of the Biden campaign and the Senate, and we are excited
to have her on the team.  And she’ll be covering healthcare and adjacent
issues to healthcare.   
   
So, you know, please come back and say hello to Kelly.  We’re really
excited to have her.  But I wanted to make sure that I introduced her
while I have that — while I had a second with a very long topper for all
of you.  
   
With that, Seung Min, you want to kick off the first question?  
   
Q    Sure.  Two topics.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.  
   
Q    On your last one.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes.  
   
Q    On the limit package, I know the President did a pretty thorough
rebuttal in the Rose Garden of the various proposals that have been
brought up there.  But there is an emerging thought today among House
Republicans that repealing the Inflation Reduction Act has to be part of
this debt limit package.  So I wanted to get the White House’s
impression of that offer.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let’s be clear what MAGA attacks on the Inflation
Reduction Act would mean for American families.  I’m going to lay this
out for you.  And I kind of talked about it a little bit, but this has a
little bit of fuller — a fuller layout.   
   
So, offshore tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, including in
districts many of these members actually represent.  So they’re doing
their job there I see.  Send investments and supply chains back to
China; raise costs for prescription drugs, insulin, and home utility
bills.  Remember, that’s kind of the core of what the Inflation
Reduction Act and what you’ve heard us say over and over.  It will hurt
American energy independence, protect wealthy tax cheats, and make it
harder to get refunds from the IRS.  Increase the deficit in the name of
special interests like Big Pharma and billionaires — because, as we
know, the Inflation Reduction Act actually helps in reducing the
deficit.   
   
And so, this is what they would be doing if MAGA Republicans get their
way.  This is what the attacks lay out and what they would be repealing
as well — these really ke- — key, critical, important issues that matter
to the American people.   
   
And guess what?  This is an unpo- — unpopular agenda that the Americans
do not support.  They don’t support this.  So why would they go against
what a majority of the Americans want to do?  And this is going to hurt
their own district in that — hurt them and the Americans and their
constituents in their own district.  
   
Q    And a quick one on Sudan.  Are there plans to evacuate U.S. embassy
personnel from there?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, just a couple things at the — a couple things I
want to say about that.  And do you mean Americans more broadly? 
President are you talking about —  
   
Q    Both.  Both.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So, look, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum’s
security alert on April 16th stated that due to uncertainty se- —
uncertain security situation in Khartoum and closures of the airport,
Americans should have no expectations of a U.S. government-coordinated
evacuation at this time.  We expect that will remain the case.  
   
We have been urging American citizens not to travel to Sudan since at
least back in October of last year, when the State Department Travel
Advisory was set at Level 4, which means “do not travel.”   That’s what
a Level 4 means.   
   
It is imperative that U.S. citizens in Sudan make their own arrangements
to safe — to stay safe in these difficult circumstances.   
   
We advise U.S. citizens to remain sheltered in place and to contact the
U.S. embassy if they need assistance.  And that is currently where we
are at this time.  
   
Q    And what about the embassy personnel?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we have no higher priority to make sure that
our government — to keep — to make sure that the safety of our U.S.
government personnel and their families overseas.  That is clearly a
priority for this administration.  
   
The State Department plans for all contingencies to ensure their safety,
depending on local conditions.  But we have nothing imminent at this
time to announce.  
   
We have made clear to both sides that any attacks, threats, or da- — or
dangers — or dangers posed to our diplomats are totally unacceptable.   
   
And you’ve heard from Secretary Blinken directly yesterday on this
particular issue.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    We saw Evan Gershkovich today for the first time since he was
detained.  Obviously, Russia is denying his appeal.  I wanted to get
your reaction to that but also ask you about — well, actually, let me
get your reaction to that first.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Yeah, we do — we do have something at the
top.  
   
Look, we are — we are deeply concerned by the news that Russia will
continue to wrongfully detain Evan following a sham judicial proceeding
today.  And that’s what we saw earlier today.   
   
The Biden-Harris administration is engaging with Russia through every
available channel to bring Evan and fellow American Paul Whelan home,
who is also a priority for us.  And you have — you’ve heard us talk —
speak to that for the past several months.   
   
And as we have said before, the charges against Evan are baseless and we
call on Russia Fed- — Russian Federation to immediately release him.  
   
We also call for the immediate release of Paul, who has been wrongfully
detained on sham espionage charges for more than four years.   
   
We remain in touch with their families and admire their courage in the
face of these unimaginable circumstances.  
   
I know you had a follow-up to that, Mary.  
   
Q    You mentioned Paul Whelan.  Both he and Evan Gershkovich are being
charged with espionage.  You just called them “sham espionage charges.” 
Does the U.S. believe that — that freeing Evan is going to be just as
difficult as it has been to bring Paul Whelan home, given the similarity
of charges?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m not going to — look, these are always
challenging circumstances — right? — as we have known, and we’ve seen
this play out under this administration these past two years.  Not going
to get into hypotheticals.  Not going to get into negotiations in public
or from the podium.    
   
As you can understand, these are sensitive — sensitive matters, so I
just want to be incredibly careful from here but don’t want to get ahead
of that.  Just know that we are committed to bringing them both home.  
   
Q    Whelan’s family is concerned, though, and has been vocal about
their concern the administration might leave Paul behind.  In fact, his
sister, Elizabeth, is now pausing her interactions with the
administration because she says she won’t reengage until you, quote,
“stop wasting her time and come up with something more than thoughts and
prayers.”  
   
What do you say to her?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I don’t want to discuss private
conversations or meetings or interactions between the Natur- — National
Security Council and families who are wrongfully detained.  What I can
say is this is a President who’s committed to — to getting U.S. citizens
who are wrongfully detained and being held hostage home.  And so, that
is a commitment that you have seen — that you’ve seen from this
President the last two years.   
   
But definitely don’t want to go in a back-and-forth in public.  
   
We are — we remain in touch with their families and certainly admire
their courage and — in the face — in — in the — in the current
challenges that we are — they are currently facing.  And it’s certainly
unimaginable.  
   
And so — but don’t want to get into private interactions or — or go back
and forth with the family.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Julie Su’s confirmation hearing is set for this
Thursday.  Given how some Democrats have been talking about their
reservations when it comes to her and her record, is the White House
confident that she will have the votes needed to get her through?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So look, here’s what we’re — we’re confident and —
because of her proven track record, as you have just laid out in your
question about talk — speaking about her track record.  And her track
record, you see it across — working across the aisle, sitting down with
business community as well as organized labor, and delivering strong
results for the American economy.  
   
And that’s why Julie was unanimously con- — confirmed as a Deputy
Secretary of Labor.  Let’s not forget: She actually went through this
process before.  It was done by all Senate Democrats at that time.  
   
And so, that’s why Julie’s nomination has been endorsed by a range of
business groups.  I’ll list them out for you right now — from business —
from Small Business Major- — Majority of — to labor — to LA Chamber of
Commerce and labor Leaders, from United Mineworkers to NABTU and to Luna
to IBEW.  
   
As you know, she served under Marty Walsh’s — or served as his right
hand — Marty Walsh’s right hand for the last two years as they helped
produce historic job growth, as we’ve seen.  You’ve heard us talk about
the 12.5 million jobs that has been created under this administration,
800,000 manufacturing jobs.  
   
This is something that — you know, that certainly Department of Labor —
and as herself and Marty Walsh were very directly involved in.   
   
So, we’re looking forward to the hearing coming up on Thursday and feel
confident — to your question, we do feel confident about Julie’s
confirmation process.  
   
Again, she has a proven track record that she can stand on proudly, and
we are proud to have nom- — the President is proud to have nominated
her.  
   
Q    So, as you’re canvassing for support, I mean, have you heard from
Senator Tester?  Or — of course, Senator Manchin has privately expressed
reservations.  What’s the — what’s the, you know, the feedback that
you’re getting?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:\` So, again, I — I’m not going to speak for any
senators.  I will let the senators that you just named speak for
themselves.    
   
But again, she went through this process as deputy and got all Democrats
in the Senate.  And so, she has been through this process before.  And
so, again, we’re confident to — to her getting through, and we look
forward to the hearing that’s coming on Thursday.  
   
Q    And on a different topic, I have a question on the secret police
station in New York on behalf of the Chinese government.  And two men
were arrested yesterday on charges that they helped establish this on
behalf of the Chinese government.  Have ye- — has the White House and
the administration spoken to China?  Can you give us an update on
that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things: The U.S. government has been
clear that we will use all available tools to protect American citizens
and other U.S. persons from transnational repression and other forms of
foreign malign influence.  
   
We will not tolerate the PRC government or any foreign government
harassing or threatening U.S. persons.  Any other specific questions on
this particular arrest — I would refer you to Department of Justice.    
   
Go ahead.  And then I’ll come around.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I know the President spoke by phone with Ralph
Yarl and his family.  I’m just curious, from a broader perspective —
from the President’s viewpoint, what does it say about the country that
a Black teenager could ring the doorbell at the wrong house and get shot
in the head?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, it’s devastating.  I think the gun violence
epidemic, more broadly, is devastating.  
   
And, as you know — as you just mentioned in your question, he spoke to
Ralph — spoke to Ralph and his mom.  And, look, I don’t want to get too
far into it.  As you know, there is going to be an investigation, so I
want to be very careful from here.   
   
And they spoke at length.  As I mentioned, they — they discussed his
success in classrooms.   
   
But, look, this is an epidemic that we need to deal with.  I’m tired. 
I’m sure you all are tired having to report on these types of shooting
almost every week.   
   
And we can fix this.  Congress can fix this.  They can take action today
and deal with some real issues that we’re seeing to make — to really
deal with gun reform.  And we’re not seeing that.    
   
You know, the press — we get asked often why is it that the President
keeps asking for Congress to take action.  Because he’s using the
platform that he has to speak directly to Congress and to make it clear
that we need to take action.  
   
This is unacceptable.  What we’re seeing is unacceptable.   You heard
the President say this.  It is outrageous and unacceptable.  It is
unacceptable that guns are leading killer in our children.  And those
numbers are just rising; they’re not declining, when you think about our
children dying by guns.    
   
And so — look, I’m not going to get, again, too far into the weeds on
this case.  But what I can say is that, you know, like the President
said to him, we hope for his speedy recovery.  And we’re going to
continue to do everything that we can to really deal with this
epidemic.   
   
This is a President that has put forward almost a dozen executive
actions to deal with this issue.  And he’s going to continue to use — to
use the bully pulpit to call on Congress to act.    
   
Q    I think I asked —  
   
Q    Before you go on, the — the audio back here is — we can’t — we
can’t hear.  No one can hear back here.  Is that right, folks?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m sorry.  Maybe someone — maybe — can  somebody —
somebody on the team get that fixed?  I apologize, guys.  
   
Q    Sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no.  It’s good know.   Maybe — maybe they’ll
get to it.  Sorry about that.  I’ll try to speak louder.  
   
Q    I ask the question from a broader lens, because I’m not sure what
in the President’s proposal related to gun reform would have addressed,
you know, the weapon used in this case or the specific scenario here. 
That’s why I’m asking, kind of, more broadly: What does it say about the
country that this is — that this can happen?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, look, there’s an investigation —   
   
(The audio malfunction is resolved in the press briefing room.)  I think
it just went up.  (Laughter.)  It just woke up a second — for a second
there.   
   
There’s an investigation going on, and we’ll learn more as the
investigation goes by.  
   
What I — we can say is — continue to lay out what we’re seeing.  Our
children, our schools, our churches, our grocery stores, they’ve all
become targets.  And that is devastating to hear.   
   
When I started out talking about the gun violence that we have seen over
the last couple days, I said — and I just said this to you in answering
this question, almost — it feels like almost every week, at least once a
week, we are having discussion.   
   
There was one week where the President talked about gun reform and gun
violence three times.  And that’s when we saw that horrific shooting in
Nashville, where three nine-year-olds and three administrators were
murdered at school.  
   
And so, what I can speak to is that there’s clearly an epidemic. 
There’s clearly actions that need to be taken.  We are asking Congress
to take actions, and — and this is something that they can do today.    
   
This is a President that is taking this very, very seriously, not just
as President — as Vice President, as senator.  His record shows that.  
   
But now, we need legislation.  We need courage on the other side of 16 —
on the other side of Pennsylvania.  And we just haven’t seen that yet
from Republicans.  Republicans need to act here.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks, Karine.  What is the White House’s reaction to Mitch
McConnell saying that Republicans would block attempts by Democrats to
temporary — temporarily replace Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary
Committee?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I want to be very clear here.  Let me first say
that — and the President and the First Lady has offered up, you know —
you know, a speedy recovery.  As you have heard me say many times, that
— Senator Feinstein is not just a former colleague of the President but
a friend.  And so was her late husband, Richard.  And so, certainly we
wish her a speedy recovery.  
   
And, look, this is a decision for her to make.  When it comes to the
future — her future — that is something that she gets to make and should
be allowed to do that.  
   
And what we know and what the President has said is she’s had a — a
impressive career.  He’s worked alongside her with — dealing with the
assault ban weapons.  That’s something that they worked on together. 
And the work that she’s done as a senator has certainly lifted up this
country.  
   
As it relates to — I’m not going to — I’m not going to speak to every
senator or every elected official that makes a comment.  But, look, what
we believe — when you think about what Democrats are doing or what their
request is, this is a request that is — we think that is reasonable. 
This is something that Senator Feins- — Feinstein asked for.  This is
her request.   
   
And it is flat wrong to ask partisan — to take — to seek partisan
advantage from — from health issues of a colleague.  Right?  The
American people reject that kind of scorched-earth type of behavior or
approach to governing.   
   
Again, this is — this is something that she put forward, and this was
her request.  So, I’ll leave it there.  
   
Q    If her seat on the committee is not filled while she’s away with
her illness, I mean, is it going to hurt the White House’s ability to
get judges appointed in the Senate?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, what — we appreciate the efforts that we
have seen in confirming judges.  And what we believe — look, confirming
those judges who will uphold the rule of law is a top priority for the
President.  Senators should not needlessly deny community judges who can
ensure accountability for criminal acts.  And so, that’s what we
believe, and I’ll just leave it there.  
   
Go ahead.  Nancy.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Back on Evan Gershkovich, you mentioned that the
administration is using every possible avenue to try to talk to the
Russians.  Have there been any substantive negotiations or even
conversations about Evan between U.S. officials and Russian officials
yet?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you can imagine, I can’t get into details from
here.  These are sensitive conversations.  I don’t want to get into
negotiating in public or negotiating from the podium.  
   
What I can say is that we are — we are committed to getting Evan home
and we are committed to getting Paul Whelan home.  
   
And, you know, that is what you heard from the Secretary yesterday, and
that was — is what you’re going to continue to hear from this
President.  
   
Q    I know that the U.S. ambassador was able to meet with Evan for the
first time yesterday.  Has any message been delivered from President
Biden to Evan?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, don’t have any direct message to — to report out. 
They — they report that he was appreciative of the support that he is
receiving from — from people at home and that he feels good and is
holding strong.  And I think that’s important to get a — you know, a
state of how Evan is doing.  And so, that’s what we heard from Embassy
Moscow.  
   
And so, again, I think that’s important, but I don’t have any direct
communication that was provided to Evan from this President.  
   
Q    How of- — sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, go ahead.  
   
Q    How often is Evan going to be able to meet with the U.S. ambassador
going forward?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I don’t have any specific timelines on how
often that’s going to occur.  Clearly, Evan’s health is very important
to us, which is why we wanted Embassy Moscow to see him and to — to get
to see him for their own — with their own eyes.   
   
Just don’t have a regular cadence of what that’s going to look like, and
so I will leave that to the State Department to speak to directly.  
   
Raquel, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you so much, Karine.  Yesterday, John Kirby said that the
Brazilian President was repeating Russia and China’s propaganda when he
says the United States is somehow responsible for the war in Ukraine. 
Some officials are saying behind the scenes that Brazil wants — is
trying to help Russia in this conflict.  
   
So, two questions: Does the White House believe Lula’s comments
undermines these efforts to mediate peace?  He was trying to create a
group of neutral countries.   
   
And also, another question.  Could there be any diplomatic implications
against Brazil?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  From the U.S.?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say this.  A couple of things that I do want
to say about this is that the U.S. — and you’ve heard us say this many
times — has no objection to any country that seeks to try to bring an
end to Russia’s war against Ukraine, against — against — against
Ukraine.  A war that they started, a war of their choice.  This is
Russia that I’m speaking about, clearly.  
   
But we are — we were struck by — to your question about the comments —
we were struck by those tone of the press conference of the foreign
minister yesterday, which was not a tone of neutrality, suggesting that
the United States and Europe are not interested in peace or that we
share responsibility for their — for the war.  
   
We believe — and it is true — that it is plainly wrong.  Of course, we
want this war to end.  Of course, we do.  And we support President
Zelenskyy’s call for a just end to Russia’s war of choice.   
   
In fact, the United States and EU actively engaged Putin to prevent the
war, dating back to at least mid- — mid-2021.  And efforts have
continued since the start of this war.  
   
Unfortunately, Russia has shown no interest in ending its unprovoked
invasion.  We will continue to work with our allies, as you’ve seen this
President do over and over again this past year — and also our allies
and our partners — to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia —
Russian aggren- — aggression while supporting Ukraine’s proposal for
just and durable peace that respects the U.N. Char- — Charter and the
principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Because remember,
this is Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and territorial integrity that
Russia invaded.  
   
And to say — and, again, what we heard — the tone was not neutral.  And
it is not true.  And so, we’ll — you know, we’ll continue to speak out
against that just like you heard from — from Admiral Kirby yesterday.  
   
Q    So, just a follow-up.  Do you think — is President Biden aware of
those comments?  And going back to the implications, do you see any
implications against Brazil (inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I — I have not spoken to the President.  I’m
assuming that he is aware of this.  
   
And, look, again, Brazil is a sovereign country and they get to make its
own decision, and so I will leave it there.  
   
And — you know, and — again, I’ll just say that.  
   
You know, we’re — I’ll say this: We are confident in the strength of the
U.S.-Brazil relationship.  Even if we disagree with some of the things
that the president — President Lula said, we are still confident in that
— in that engagement, in that relationship.  
   
Q    And can I just ask very quickly one about Mexico? Because the
President of Mexico just accused the Pentagon of espionage against his
country.  Do you have any reaction to that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have not seen those — those comments. That just
happened, just now?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I haven’t seen those comments, so I can’t speak to
this at this time.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hey, Karine.  I have a question about judiciary, but first I wanted
to follow up on Ralph Yarl.  I wonder if you can talk about how the
President learned about and ingested the news.  And a presidential phone
call is a significant and rare thing.  You know, why did he decide to
make this phone call and then to tell the nation that he did it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I think also, the Pres- — the parents spoke to the
phone call as well.  I think you guys heard directly from the parents,
who spoke to the call that the President had with Ralph.  And I think
you also heard from others who are — who are supporting Ralph in this
moment.  
   
Look, you guys heard the news.  It was a devastating — a 16-year-old, a
sweet kid, as he’s being — is being reported, was shot in the head
twice.   
   
This is a President, as we know, understands loss, understands the
importance of — of making sure that he’s a President that’s there when a
— when a family is suffering and dealing with a hard time.  And that’s
what you saw.  
   
This is a President having to deal with another shooting, talking to
another family about what they’re going through with their kid being
shot for ringing the wrong doorbell.   
   
Again, I want to be very careful; there is still an investigation going
on, so I don’t want to get ahead of it.  But that’s what we know thus
far.   
   
And so, the President wanted to reach out to the family and to Ralph and
— to say that, you know, we wish him a speedy recovery, have a
conversation, let them know that he and the First Lady are with them. 
And I don’t think that’s unusual or uncommon for this President to do.  
   
Q    And turning to judiciary, I wonder if the President or the White
House is concerned that committee assignments, which usually have been
pro forma before now, or the stalling of judicial nominees is going to
just become par for the course in the Senate and kind of stall you guys’
ability to get judicial nominees through.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I mean, I just spoke to this about how important
it is to confirm judges and what it means for our rule of law and, you
know, to ensure there’s accountability.  So we — we believe that is — it
is a top priority and will continue to be a top priority for this
President.   
   
I can’t speak to what Congress is going to do or not do or what the
Senate is going to do or not do.  I can’t speak to hypotheticals from
here.  What I can tell you is what the President’s priority are.  And
this is — continues to be a priority for this President.  
   
Go ahead, Sebastian.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks, Karine.  Is the President following the — all this
drip-drip of questionable financial stuff happening from Justice
Thomas’s private life?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have not spoken to the President about this, so I
can’t speak to that.   
   
What I can say is: We’re going to be very careful from here and not
comment on that.  
   
Q    Okay.  And how about — can you give a little preview of the bilat
with the Colombian President?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, I can.   
   
Q    What are the main topics they’re going to discuss?  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, I can give you a little preview of what that
might be.  On April 20th, as you all know, President Joe Biden will host
President Gustavo Petro of Colombia for a bilateral meeting at the White
House.   
   
Colombia is a key partner of the United States.  And during the meeting,
the two leaders will discuss how the United States and Colombia can
continue to deepen our strong bilateral relationship by making progress
on areas of mutual national interest, including promoting further
economic and security cooperation.   
   
The two leaders will also discuss joint efforts to combat climate
change, counter narcotics trafficking, address our regional migration
challenge, and promote democratic values and human and labor rights in
the region and around the world.   
   
And we certainly will have more to share.  As you know, we tend to have
these background calls — these preview calls.  We’ll have one tomorrow. 
And certainly, we’ll have more to share tomorrow for all of you.   
   
I’m going to try and take one in the — in the back.  Go ahead,
Courtney.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask you about immigration.  We’re preparing
for — next month, for Title 42 to lift and for more people to be
eligible to apply for asylum.   
   
We saw that new border numbers are out for March and that there’s been —
the vast majority of migrant encounters are from Mexico and Central
America.   
   
I know you’ve got a program separately for a couple other nations where
you saw a lot of people coming from there.  But can you talk about how
you’re preparing for next month and particularly with people coming from
these particular nationalities?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So two things — you kind of asked a couple of things. 
Let me just touched on the March numbers for a second, as you just
stated.   
   
Look, what we believe is: Our border enforce- — enforcement measures and
what we have seen continued to limit unlawful immigration.  So that is
important to note.  
   
We typic- — we typically see an increase in border encounters this time
of the year as weather — as you — I’m sure you’ve reported — as weather
gets warmer.   
   
And we — you know, but what we want to note and what’s notable is that
the seasonal increase this time around was the lowest in two years.  And
the number of people attempting to cross unlawfully last month was down
about 23 percent from this time last year.  And we’ll continue to do
what we can to build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system.   
   
But as you’ve heard me say many times, Congress needs to act and to also
show that they truly show — have real concern and not do political
stunts when it comes to the border.   
   
As we — as you’ve heard from the Secretary of Homeland Security, they
put out a plan back in January on what the process would look like.  And
— and we’re continuing to implement that plan once Title 42 is
lifted.   
   
And as you know — and we’ve talked about this — we’re expanding legal
pathways like parole — parolee — parolee program immi- — for migrants
from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Cuba.  And we have actually seen
the numbers come down by more than 90 percent.   
   
We’re working with our partners across the Western Hemisphere to jointly
manage migration patterns.  We’re surging additional — additional
resources, including personnel and technology to the border.  And we’re
ramping up ex- — expedited removals under Title 8.   
   
So, again, we — the Department of Homeland Security put out their —
their plan back in January, and they’re going to be implementing that
plan.  And I just laid out some of the things that they announced that
they’re going to be doing, and we’re going to be really focused on
making sure that we have a humane, orderly process when it comes to the
border.  
   
Q    Another question for you.  The Supreme Court Justice Alito put a
hold — or not a hold, I should say, but — we’re expecting as soon as
tomorrow we could get a decision on mifepristone.  Can you talk about
how you’re preparing for that, both from a — not necessarily a political
perspective but practical one, when so many patients rely on this
medication?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  And so, I spoke to — about that a little bit at
the top.  As you know, the Vice President is going to be in — is — is
currently traveling right now in Nevada, and she’s talking — and she’s
been — she’s been leading on this for the past week.  She’s going to be
talking to — at a roundtable to talk about how we’re moving forward.   
   
We — we announced some actions last week.  The privacy on HIPAA — what
we’re doing to strengthen that.  And I think that’s, of course, very
important.   
   
For now, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and
effective use.  I’m certainly not going to get ahead of the courts.   
   
But this is certainly an administration — the President and the Vice
President — who have taken this very seriously and will continue to
fight for fundamental freedoms.  We’re talking about fundamental
freedoms for women.  And this is something that the President or this
Vice President is not a — going to back away from.   
   
And, again, I laid out some actions that we’ve taken in the past week,
but not going to get ahead of the courts.  As you just said, they’re
going to be deciding at some point tomorrow.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead, Anita.   
   
Q    I have a question on migrant issues and on Afghanistan.  Starting
with Afghanistan, the U.N. says they’re prepared to make the
heartbreaking decision to pull out U.N. staff if the Taliban won’t allow
women to work for the U.N.  You know, what — what is the White House’s
reaction to this possibility?  And how could this affect assistance to
Afghanistan?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’ve been very — I’ve talked about this
many times about, you know, the Taliban and — and if they want to be
taken seriously.  If they want us to have a — a real conversation with
them, they have to — they have to behave in a way, for example, where
the — where women are treated in a respectful way.   
   
I’m not going to — I’m going to let the U.N. speak to — speak to their —
to their decisions.   
   
You know — and, you know, again, we’re assessing the situation closely
and — with the U.N. and our other partners.   
   
And, look, when it comes to, you know, women not being able to work at
the U.N., that is something that we’ve talked about, and we’ve said that
we were extremely concerned with — with yet another horrific Taliban
action.   
   
You know, women are central to humanitarian and civil society operations
around the world.  In Afghanistan in particular, only women are able to
reach some of the most vulnerable, in part because many of the most —
most vulnerable are women-headed households that male aid workers cannot
enter.   
   
And so women must be able to work for the U.N., as I’ve talked about, so
that millions of Afghans can receive food and medicine and other basic
needs for their survival.  They are essential to the delivery of this
assistance and essential to ensuring women, children, and other members
of vulnerable groups receive the necessary types of assistance such as
protection and gender-based violence services without risk of
exploitation.   
   
So, again, I’m going to let the U.N. speak to their decision on — on how
they’re going to move forward.   
   
But we’ve been very explicit about this.  We’ve been very clear about
our concerns with — you know, with the Taliban’s tragic decision and
horrific decision on how they treat women in Afghanistan.  
   
Q    And then on migrant issues — these disturbing reports of migrant
children being forced to work — how does the White House respond to
reports that the administration repeatedly ignored warnings about this? 
And what are you going to do next?  
   
And then if I can just follow up on Sudan real quickly. What’s the
consequence if these two warring parties don’t reach any sort of peace
agreement?  What — what’s the stick?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the first part is — look, it’s unacceptable that
these companies are using child labor.  You’ve heard us say this when
the first — when the New York Times story first was reported earlier
this year, and we’ll continue to say that.  
   
What I can say — a couple of things that I can say since New York Times
shined a light on — on these abuses in February.  
   
This administration moved swiftly to crack down on violators and more
rig- — rigorously vet sma- — more vigorously vet sponsors of
unaccompanied minors.  DOL and HHS launched a new task force to heighten
cooperation and better share information.  
   
We also called on Congress to provide the resources this administration
has long requested to help us crack down on companies that exploit
children for labor.  
   
The actions we’ve taken since February make clear that we will continue
to investigate and hold companies accountable, but we also need Congress
to provide the resources we need to enforce.  And we’ve been very
clear.  
   
Again, DOL, HHS have taken actions.  But we need Congress to also — to
also give the — give DOL and HHS the resources that they need to — to
broaden these actions that they’ve put forward.  
   
Q    And the consequence for the warring parties in Sudan?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, you know, we’ve been very clear about the
importance of de-escalating.  And you’ve heard Secretary Blinken speak
to this.  You heard my colleague from NSC speak to this as well.  And
so, I’m just not going to go beyond to what they have said.   
   
I’m going to take a couple more questions.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, on the leaked classified documents, the President, when he
was traveling abroad last week, said he wasn’t that worried because they
weren’t contemporaneous.   
   
But in the days since, we’ve learned that several close allies are
furious, and there have been some difficult conversations with
high-level U.S. officials about how to prevent this from happening
again.   
   
So, can you just speak to what role the President is playing in managing
the fallout?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, yeah.  Look, the President has taken this — this
matter very seriously, to the point where he asked the military to do a
couple of things — the military and intelligence community to do a
couple of things: to run a high-priority, senior-level interagency
process focused on understanding what happened; take steps to further
secure and limit distribution of sensitive information; and reach out
directly to allies and partners to reassure — reassure them about our
commitment to safeguarding intelligence.  
   
And so, those are the things that the President has asked, again, them —
his — the military and also the intelligence community to do.  He
expressed his concern that the leak happened.  And — and we are — and he
is taking this incredibly seriously.  
   
I have to move around because —  
   
Q    Follow-up —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just going to move around — make sure I take one
or two.  
   
Q    Follow-up on Afghanistan, please?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have to take one or two questions before we go.  Go
ahead.  
   
Q    Yesterday, the Japanese Prime Minister Kishida’s wife was here. 
Could you let us know a little bit how that went?  And then the upcoming
G7 next month is going to be in Japan.  What are some expectations from
the upcoming summit?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, on the second question, we’ll have more to
share.  I don’t have anything to share or confirm at this time or what
the expectations would be or what the goals are from here.  So
certainly, we’ll — as we normally do, as we get closer to the date,
we’ll have more to share.  
   
I believe we have a — we have a readout of — of the meeting that the
First Lady had, and we’ll — I’m happy to share that.  
   
But I’m going to continue to move around.  Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Two questions, if I could, related to electric
vehicles.   
   
The first: Senator Manchin has a statement today in which he indicates
he would support a resolution disapproval of the EPA’s emission
standards that were announced last week when we were in Ireland.  He
says that they would increase reliance on Chinese-made batteries, make a
more energy-secure and powerful China.  Do you have a response to
that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the measures the EPA propose will, if
implemented, do the following:  
   
Save American drivers and truck companies an average of $12,000 over the
lifetime of their vehicle, which is incredibly important.  
   
They — they’ll cut nearly 10 billion dol- — 10 billion tons of CO2
emissions.  That’s nearly twice annual U.S. emissions.   
   
They’ll strengthen American energy security by reducing reliance on 20
million barrels of oil and — together with the historic investment that
the President has already made — has secured — to build more electric
cars here in America.   
   
And they’ll put the United States on a path to outcompete China — you
hear us talk about that often — for jobs and investments, building the
future of transportation.  
   
And so, that’s how we see the President’s electric vehicle program being
— his focus on that.  And this is what we think it’s going to deliver
for the American people, as well as really fighting climate change.  
   
Q    And the second question related to electric vehicles:  This has
been a controversy that’s been bubbling up for months now, but I wanted
to raise it to you.  The seven last FEMA administrators have objected to
and were — raised a serious safety concern about the idea that electric
vehicles are not able to receive the stations that have been licensed by
the federal government to operate on the — on the AM band.   
   
In addition to news and information, this involved stations that
uniquely serve Black communities, Hispanic communities, Asian
communities, and other underserved communities.  
   
Last week, Sean Hannity suggested that this had something to do with
trying to snuff out conservative voices.  And Democrats Ed Markey and
Josh Gottheimer have suggested that the administration ought to be doing
more to encourage automakers to have some sort of engineering fix, to
see to it that EVs can receive these stations licensed by the government
to operate on the AM band.  What’s your response?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, totally hear the questions.  Look, while AM
stations have — is a critical tool to get information to the American
people, there — it’s not the only tool, and there are other — there are
other ways of doing that.  
   
FEMA works with dozens of wireless service providers and commercial and
public radio and TV stations to get key alerts out.  That is something
that they have been working on and — again, with dozens of wireless
service providers.  
   
What’s important is that any car manufacturer planning to remove AM
radio should make sure it is paired with a — a suitable, proven, and
free alternative to receive critical information.  
   
Again, this is something that FEMA takes very seriously: working with
providers.  But it’s not — again, it’s not the only tool to providing
critical information to the American people.  
   
Q    Because there are parts of this country where there’s still no cell
service.  So how do you — how does that work if you don’t — if you try
to use an app?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I totally understand.  This is why FEMA is taking
this very seriously, having those conversations with providers, making
sure that that critical information that is needed to be provided to the
American people occurs and happens.  
   
But again, it is not the only way — AM stations is not the only way to
provide that information.  We’ve proven that by working with other
providers.  
   
And so, we’re going to continue to address this issue.  We understand it
is important for communities that you just listed to get that
information.  And this is something that FEMA certainly is taking very
seriously.  
   
I’m going to take one more question before I — I got to go.  Go ahead,
Earl.  
   
Q    Hello, Karine.  How are you doing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hey! Long time — long time, no speak.  
   
Q    Long time, yeah.  
   
Listen, just to close the book on Ireland, since we just got back.  It
was a highly personal trip.  There were a lot of cousins there.  Did
Valerie and Hunter — (laughter) — and Hunter Biden — they flew on Air
Force One.  Did they contribute?  Did they pay for airfare,
accommodations, ground transportation?  What — I think — did they?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we took — we’ve — this is not the first time. 
Let’s be very, very clear.  It is consistent with other presidents when
they’ve had family travel with them abroad.  This is nothing new.  So I
just want to make sure that we make that very clear to the American
people.  
   
Q    Point taken.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And, of course, we followed every protocol that any
other president or every other president has taken when they — when
their family has traveled.  And so, yes.   
   
All right.  I’m going to go.  I’m —  
   
Q    “Yes” what?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we — we took every protocol that is necessary and
needed when a family traveled.  We did nothing different than past
presidents.  And so, yes, they paid — they paid for their way.  
   
Q    They paid for their share.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Like every other — this is — this is not
unusual.  This is not the first time that families have traveled with
presidents.   
   
So, there’s — there’s — there’s nothing — there’s no “there there,” as
they would say.  
   
All right.  Thank you.  
   
4:03 P.M. EDT
