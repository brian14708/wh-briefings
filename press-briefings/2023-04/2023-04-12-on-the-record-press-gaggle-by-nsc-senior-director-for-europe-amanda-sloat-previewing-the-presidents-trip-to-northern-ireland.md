  \ Previewing the President\u2019s Trip to Northern\_Ireland"

Via Teleconference  
Ten Square Hotel  
Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom

9:21 A.M. BST  
   
MR. SAVETT:  So, thank you everyone for your — your patience.  We’ll go
ahead and get started.   
   
For those who don’t know me, I’m Sean Savett from the National Security
Council.  This is Amanda Sloat, our senior director for Europe.   
   
As a brief reminder of the ground rules, we’ll do this on the record
with no embargo.   
   
We appreciate everyone joining today.   
   
I will try to alternate questions between the room and then get a couple
in from the Zoom as well, since we have a good crowd on Zoom.  And so,
I’ll kind of go back and forth.  
   
With that, Amanda, they’re over to you.   
   
MS. SLOAT:  Hi, great.  Thanks.  Good morning, everybody.  It’s great to
be back in Belfast, and nice to see sunshine this morning as opposed to
the cold and rainy weather we had on arrival last night.   
   
As everybody knows, the President has been very excited about this trip
for quite some time and is glad to be here to mark the 25th anniversary
of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, which has brought peace and
stability in Northern Ireland after decades of violence.   
   
President Biden cares deeply about Northern Ireland and has for many
decades dating back to his time in the Senate, and has long been an
advocate for how the U.S. could play a constructive role supporting
peace and prosperity.   
   
I have to say, as a personal note, I lived in Northern Ireland for three
years — moving here in 1998 — or, sorry, moving here in 2001, three
years after the Good Friday was signed and a week before 9/11.  So, it’s
a particular honor for me to be back in a place I care deeply about and
also with a President who cares very deeply about the place as well.  
   
As I said, as a U.S. senator, Joe Biden visited Northern Ireland, met
with leaders of its political parties as well as with British and Irish
leaders.  He advocated for the U.S. to provide economic assistance in
support of the peace process and alleviate the high economic cost of the
Troubles.   
   
He vocally supported the adoption of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. 
In 2000, he nominated Senator George Mitchell to receive the Nobel Prize
for his work to bring together Northern Ireland’s leaders.  
   
President Biden, as I think you’re all tracking, will be meeting with
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak later this morning.  So it’ll be an
opportunity for the two of them to discuss the tremendous progress
that’s been made here in Northern Ireland, as well as to how the United
States can continue working with the UK government as well as the Irish
government, the European Union, and Northern Ireland’s leaders to
continue to be a partner for peace and to support continued economic
development in Northern Ireland.  
   
I expect the leaders will also have the opportunity to touch base on the
latest developments in Ukraine, including our continued joint efforts to
support the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves from Russia’s
continued aggression.   
   
For those of you that are counting, this will be the third in-person
meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak.  They met for
the first time at the G20 meeting in Bali at the end of last year.  They
saw each other last month with the AUKUS announcement in San Diego, at
which time the President invited Prime Minister Sunak to visit him in
Washington in June.  And of course, they’ll have the opportunity to see
each other next month at the G7 meeting in Hiroshima as well.  
   
So, following that meeting, the President will head to Ulster
University, which is going to be the main event that the President is
doing here in Northern Ireland.  Ulster University is the largest
university here in Northern Ireland, and the President will have the
opportunity to deliver remarks that will focus on underscoring the
readiness of the United States to support the gains of the last 25 years
and to support Northern Ireland’s vast economic potential to the benefit
of all communities.   
   
The audience will include a mix of young entrepreneurs, young leaders,
business leaders, civil society, representatives of the UK government,
as well as members of Northern Ireland’s government.   
   
I expect the President will talk about how the last 25 years were
focused on peace but the next 25 years should be marked by economic
growth and prosperity.   
   
At Ulster University, the President will have the opportunity to engage
with the leaders of the five main political parties of Northern Ireland,
who he also saw when they were in Washington for the St. Patrick’s Day
reception and other events last month.   
   
After his speech, the President will be heading down to the Republic of
Ireland.  He will be starting in County Louth will have — where he will
have the opportunity to dig a little deeper into his family’s Irish
roots and the story of how they immigrated to the United States.  His
ancestors from Louth are the Finnegans, who are on his mother’s side.   
   
So the President will have the opportunity to take a guided tour of
Carlingford Castle.  And from a viewpoint at the castle, the President
will be able to see Warrenpoint, Northern Ireland, which is where Owen
Finnegan departed the Port of Newry for New York.  
   
President Biden will end the day with a walking tour of Dundalk, where
he may even encounter some distant cousins.   
   
On Thursday, President Biden will do a number of political engagements
in Dublin.  He will start by meeting with President Higgins of Ireland,
who he also met with on his visits in 2016 as Vice President and in 2017
when he came in a personal capacity.  There he will participate in a
tree planting ceremony and the ringing of the Peace Bell.   
   
Following that ceremony, he’ll meet with the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar,
who he of course hosted last month in Washington for St. Patrick’s
Day.   
   
In both meetings, the President will have the opportunity to discuss the
close bilateral cooperation between our two countries, as well as our
cooperation on a shared — a range of shared global challenges.   
   
The President will then address a joint session of the Irish Parliament,
where I assume he will talk about, again, the strong bilateral ties
between the United States and Europe and our close cooperation to
advance peace, security, and prosperity, as well as the deep and
enduring historical, cultural, political, and economic ties between our
countries.   
   
On Thursday night, the President will attend a banquet dinner hosted by
the Taoiseach at Dublin Castle.  
   
On Friday, President Biden will travel to County Mayo, which will
include stops at the world-renowned Knock Shrine and the North Mayo
Heritage Center.  At the latter site, the President is expected to meet
with experts who will share further research about the ancestry of the
Blewitt side of President Biden’s family.  
   
The trip will then culminate with the speech in front of St. Muredach’s
Cathedral in Ballina, which is the very cathedral where, in 1828,
President Biden’s great-great-great-grandfather Edward Blewitt’s bricks
were used to conduct — to construct 12 pillars that support the nave.  
   
One thing you will hear and to have long heard the President talk about
in Ireland is how much his Irish heritage means to him and how closely
linked the United States and Ireland are.  Today, 1 in 10 Americans have
Irish ancestry.  Irish Americans are proudly represented in every facet
of American life.   
   
And beyond those close personal ties, Ireland, of course, is a key
economic partner of the United States, and our two countries are working
closely together to make the global economy fairer.   
   
It’s worth noting that the Irish government has been a very strong
supporter of Ukraine, providing vital non-lethal assistance, including
medical supplies, body armor, and non-lethal assistance, as well as
support for Ukraine’s electric grid and agricultural sector.  They’ve
supported sanctions within the EU on Russia.  And notably, the people of
Ireland have welcomed approximately 80,000 Ukrainians, offering refuge
to those who were forced to flee the violence.   
   
And I expect the President to recognize all of this and more in his
address to the Houses of Parliament and as well as when he speaks in in
County Mayo on the last evening of the trip.  
   
So hopefully that gives you a good broad overview of what we have
planned today and in the next couple of days.  And happy to take
questions.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Great.  And we’ll start with a couple here in the room,
then we’ll go to Zoom.  And for those of us here — those of you who
joined a couple minutes late on Zoom, you will have a transcript of
Amanda’s opening at the top.   
   
We’ll start with Darlene from the Associated Press.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Two quick questions not related to Ireland.  On the
leak of classified documents, can you share a little bit about how the
disclosures have been coming up in conversations that you’re having with
your counterparts in Europe, and how that may be complicating the work
that you and your colleagues are doing?  
   
And then the second question is on the comments by the French President
after he visited China.  How wide would you say the gulf is between the
U.S. and the European approach to Beijing?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  So I think we’re going to take all of the non-trip questions
with Kirby and Karine later today, and just focus here for now on the
trip.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Over to Josh with Bloomberg.   
   
Q    Yeah, thank you.  Can you discuss whether the President will have a
response to Prime Minister Sunak’s calls to launch some measure of free
trade negotiations — not a full FTA, but he wants to move the ball
forward here somehow.  What will the President tell him?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  So I don’t anticipate that the two leaders are going to be
talking about a free trade agreement on this trip.  I think when they
meet later this morning, the purpose of their conversation is going to
focus primarily on the situation in Northern Ireland, given that that’s
where they’re meeting, as well as the chance to touch base on Ukraine
and some other issues.   
   
When the two leaders met in San Diego, they did have an opportunity to
touch briefly on economic issues.  And part of the reason that the
President invited Prime Minister Sunak to have a meeting with him in
Washington in June is to continue furthering and deepening that
conversation.   
   
So we’re continually looking for ways to engage with the UK on the full
range of economic issues, as we had read out of their conversation in
San Diego, but are not currently discussing a free trade agreement with
them.  
   
Q    Are there any sort of sectoral-specific trade arrangements that the
U.S. would be interested in — sort of bite-sized efforts that the PM has
been advocating for?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I think those are all the sorts of ongoing negotiations, and
I expect the two leaders will have the opportunity to talk in more
detail about economic issues when they have the opportunity for a longer
conversation in June.  
   
Q    And very briefly, given his meeting with political party leaders,
does the U.S. have a position on whether the Good Friday Agreement
should be revised to allow for non-sectarian parties to join any
power-sharing agreement?  Right now, that’s not the case.  Does he have
a position?  Does the U.S. have a position one way or another whether
that should —  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I know that’s the —  
   
Q    — be reviewed?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  — the subject of a lot of ongoing discussion here right
now.   
   
Q    Indeed.  
   
MS. SLOAT:  That’s — that is ultimately going to be a decision for the
people of Northern Ireland to make, in terms of how they structure their
governance.  
   
Q    And is he pressuring them to break the logjam in Stormont right
now?  Or is that not the purpose of the greeting today?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I — the purpose of the President’s visit today is to mark
the Good Friday Agreement, to continue to reaffirm the support of the
United States for peace and prosperity, to underscore the readiness of
the United States to engage in further economic investment here.   
   
Obviously, the President, like I think everybody in Northern Ireland —
the Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, and the rest — would like to see the
devolved institutions back up and running.  The President made that
point in his remarks on St. Patrick’s Day.   
   
But really, the main purpose of his visit here today is to mark the
anniversary.   
   
Q    All right.  Thank you.   
   
MR. SAVETT:  Okay, we’ll go back to NPR.   
   
Q    Thanks, Amanda.  Appreciate it.   
   
In terms of talking to the DUP today, what is the President’s strategy
to encourage them to reopen Stormont, given it’s widely seen here that
they’re holding it up because they don’t want Sinn Féin to have the
First Minister and sort of break this huge tradition?  Just curious to
know what leverage he might have in his conversations with the DUP.  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I think — like I said in response to the previous question,
I think the main message of the President to all parties, to all people
of Northern Ireland is to reaffirm support for the Good Friday
Agreement.   
   
And obviously, pillar one and the devolved institutions here in Northern
Ireland are a fundamental part — Strand 1 — of the Good Friday
Agreement.   
   
And so, I think the President’s message, as he said in St. Patrick’s
Day, as I expect he will reaffirm today, is the United States’ strong
support for that: the belief that the people of Northern Ireland deserve
to have democratically elected, power-sharing, representative
governance.   
   
So I think the President comes here very much as a friend, as a
supporter of Northern Ireland, as a supporter of peace in Northern
Ireland, to convey the message of support from the United States for
those institutions and for the process here.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Great.  We’ll take one from the Zoom here.  We’ll go to
Brendan Hughes.  
   
Q    Thank you very much for this briefing.  (Inaudible) interested in
the logistics of things, I’m wondering if you could tell us: In relation
to meetings or engagements that the President will be having with the
Stormont parties, how is that engagement going to look?  Is it going to
be a proper sit-down meeting or is it simply going to be a shaking of
hands while they’re at Ulster University?  
   
I’m wondering if you could give a bit more detail as to the timings of
when he will actually be leaving Northern Ireland, how he’ll be leaving
Northern Ireland.  You know, because we’re interested in just how short
this visit north of the border will be.   
   
MS. SLOAT:  Do you want to address any of the logistics?  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Sure.  On the logistics, the President — after his event at
Ulster University, he’ll head to the airport to fly to Dublin.  And from
there, he’ll head over to County Louth.  
   
For the meeting — or his engagements at Ulster University, he will be —
he will be engaging with the party leaders in advance of the speech.   
   
MS. SLOAT:  I can — yeah.  I mean on — as — yes, I think Sean is
tracking better the timing and the broad logistics side.   
   
But I think as Sean said, the President will arrive at Ulster University
and will have the opportunity, I think, to engage with some of the
dignitaries who will be attending his speech, and it will be in that
context that he’ll have the opportunity to engage with the leaders of
Northern Ireland’s five main political parties in advance of delivering
his remarks at the university.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Great.  We’ll come back to the Zoom in just a moment.  But
let’s got to Catherine Lucey from The Wall Street Journal.   
   
Q    Thanks.  I just want to be clear.  You keep saying “engagement with
the party leaders.”  Is this — is this just a hello or will there
actually be time for them to have a conversation?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I expect there will be time to have a conversation.   
   
Q    And —  
   
MS. SLOAT:  It is — I mean, it is not going to be a formal sit-down
group meeting, but there will be an opportunity for him to speak with
each of the leaders of the five main political parties.   
   
Q    And I know you’ve been asked versions of this before.  But with the
DUP, does the President going — is he going to have a direct ask for
them?  Is he going to ask them to do anything?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I don’t — I’m not going to speak to what the President is
going to say in these meetings.  I think, as a broad matter and as I
indicated, the President obviously is supportive of the institutions.   
   
The President — like everybody in in Northern Ireland, the leader of the
UK — would like to see the institutions up and running.  That’s been
very much the President’s broad and consistent message from St.
Patrick’s Day.  I think you will hear that message publicly from the
President today.  And I think he will have the opportunity to convey
that directly to the party leaders as well.  
   
Q    I understand you want to leave other topics to your colleagues. 
But can you say if the President himself plans to bring up these leaked
documents when he meets with the Prime Minister later this morning,
given that the administration has been making great efforts to try and
reassure our allies?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I think we’ve been having engagements across the
administration with a broad number of allies and partners, but can’t
speak to specifically what the President intends to raise with the Prime
Minister this morning.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Great.  We’ll go back to Zoom for Amy Gibbons.  
   
Q    Hi, there.  Can you hear me?   
   
MR. SAVETT:  Yes, we can.   
   
Q    Hi.  Great.  Great.  Thanks very much for this briefing.  Just
wanted to ask: Unionists believe the President is in favor of Irish
reunification.  So is he?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I think as — as I said, the President is a strong supporter
of the Good Friday Agreement, and the Good Friday Agreement includes
mechanisms by which the people of Northern Ireland can make that
decision for themselves.

MR. SAVETT:  Great.  We’ll go to —

Q    But in terms of —

MR. SAVETT:  Go for it.

Q    Sorry, in terms of Irish reunification — so specifically, you know,
a united Ireland.

MS. SLOAT:  I — like I said, the Good Friday Agreement is very clear on
what the process is.  And the President very much recognizes that that
is ultimately a decision that the people of Northern Ireland need to
make according to the provisions laid out in the Good Friday Agreement.

Q    Thank you.

MR. SAVETT:  Thank you.  We’ll do one more from the Zoom, and we’ll come
back to the room.

Let’s go to Antonello Guerrera.

Q    Hi.  Sorry, I couldn’t unmute.  Thanks very much for this.

Still on the DUP and unionists, I mean, can I ask how generally
concerned is the President about the potential consequences of this
political backlog in Belfast?   
   
And does the President feel any hostility from the unionists and the DUP
side, who might see him as maybe too Irish?  Thank you.

MS. SLOAT:  I think that the President, as I said, has long tracked,
supported, and engaged in the peace process here in Northern Ireland. 
And I think if you look back to his record, dating back to when he was a
senator, in here, the President has a track record of engaging with
leaders from all communities, engaging with the leaders of both the UK
and Ireland. 

The President had the opportunity to interact with the leaders of all of
the political parties when they were in Washington for St. Patrick’s
Day. 

The President, today, will have the opportunity to engage with the
leaders from the five main political parties here as well, and certainly
recognizes that the Good Friday Agreement is structured in a way to
reflect the current situation in Northern Ireland, and that very much
involves a power-sharing government that respects the views of both
communities.

MR. SAVETT:  Great.  Ed O’Keefe, CBS.

Q    Thank you, again, for doing this.  After today’s pretty meaty and
sensitive interactions with political leaders here, I think there’s a
perception that the rest of this week is essentially, you know, tree
planting, bell ringing, and a taxpayer-funded family reunion.  What
would the White House say to that charge, that this is essentially the
President coming to rediscover his roots and that there may not be much
substance beyond that?

MS. SLOAT:  I would, not surprisingly, dispute that characterization. 
Like I said, the President today is going to have the opportunity to
meet with the Prime Minister of the UK. 

I think the President feels very strongly that there is benefit, both
here as well as in the United States, to mark the anniversary of the
Good Friday Agreement.  He is here two days after the 25th anniversary
of that and, I think, feels it’s important to send a powerful signal of
support by the United States for the progress that’s been made, the
sustained support going ahead.

And then, on Thursday, the President will spend the day doing very
active diplomacy with the leaders of Ireland.  He’ll be meeting the
President.  He’ll be meeting the Taoiseach.  I think there’s going to be
a lot of conversations in both of those about Ukraine, in particular —
which, as I said, has been a strong and effective partner with the
European Union in the efforts in Ukraine, as well as the large number of
other areas we’re working together around the world; peacekeeping; USAID
and Irish Aid are working very tog- — closely together on food security,
which is particularly relevant in the context of Ukraine.  And I think
the issue of immigration, not only is a personal one for the President,
but, I think, is also one that speaks much more broadly to the shared
experience of a large number of Americans. 

And I think the President also finds it a useful opportunity to engage
more broadly on these questions of immigration, to engage on the close
economic ties between our two countries, as well as to have the
opportunity to talk again in person with these Irish leaders about the
shared foreign policy goals that we’re working on, including Ukraine, as
well as to Ireland, which, of course, is a co-guarantor of the Good
Friday Agreement and clearly has a vested interest in political
developments here in Northern Ireland as well.

Q    And on Ukraine, there’s an ongoing debate now in Ireland about
whether to revisit military neutrality.  Does the President, does the
administration take a position on that?  Is that likely something he
would nudge them towards if asked or if prompted with in those
conversations?

MS. SLOAT:  You know, I mean, again, I think that’s a decision for the
Irish people.  I think the President has respected the fact that even
though Ireland is neutral militarily, they — and I think the Taoiseach
and the leadership of Ireland themselves have said that they are not
neutral when it comes to standing up for the U.N. principles in the
conflict.

I think the President has been appreciative of everything that Ireland
has done, especially through the EU, including through the Peace
Facility that’s been used in Ukraine, the non-lethal assistance that
they have provided, and then in particular, the really significant
number of refugees that they have taken in. 

But I think for questions on broader military assistance and neutrality
obviously is going to be a decision for the Irish government.

MR. SAVETT:  Kelly O’Donnell, NBC News.

Q    Could you describe some of the sensitivities that you’re trying to
be mindful of here?  So, the UK Prime Minister is not attending the
President’s speech.  There is some concern about how much time the
President is spending in Belfast and even a certain sense of how much
the President should talk about his Irish roots with the way some
interpret that and some of the questions you’ve already received about
whether or not the President is interested in reunification. 

So, in this particular moment, coming to Ireland, where there is an
anniversary to celebrate but there are also current tensions and
questions, how is the President trying to be careful about some of those
sensitivities?

MS. SLOAT:  I — sure.  I mean, the President, I think, is coming here
very much as a friend of Northern Ireland, a strong supporter of the
Good Friday Agreement, a strong supporter of the peace process, and I
think with messages of support and encouragement — one, obviously
marking the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, the tremendous
progress that’s been made.

Second, I think the President recognizes the challenges that the UK’s
departure from the European Union have created for Northern Ireland in
particular.  And I think that’s why you’ve seen the President be so
vocal in welcoming the Windsor Framework, which is a recognition of the
fact that the UK, the EU — in particular Prime Minister Sunak, President
von der Leyen — worked very closely together over a number of months to
try and find a way forward that address the needs of the — of the EU’s
economic situation in a way that was in the best interest of Northern
Ireland and that responded to a lot of what they were hearing from the
business community in Northern Ireland, the UK, and Ireland as well. 
So, a second message is recognizing the work that has been done already
on that.

Third is to remind, reiterate, underscore the continued support of the
United States, both for the peace process and especially on the economic
side.

The President appointed, a couple of months ago, Joe Kennedy as the
Special Envoy for Northern Ireland economic affairs.  Joe Kennedy will
be with the President today at the speech, and Joe Kennedy will be
remaining in Northern Ireland in the days ahead to continue following up
on the President’s pledge to continue investing in the economic
development of Northern Ireland.

And then, finally, as we have been talking about, obviously, the
President has an interest in the governance of Northern Ireland and the
Strand One, the devolved institutions of Northern Ireland are a critical
part of that.  And I think the President will reiterate what he said in
his St. Patrick’s Day remarks, which is that he, the United States, the
people of Northern Ireland, want to see a strong and functioning
representative government here in Northern Ireland.

MR. SAVETT:  And I know I’m kind of blocked by the TV, so I’ve wasn’t
able to see this side of the room.  So, yes —

Q    Amanda, thank you very much for doing this briefing.  Martin Wall
is my name, from the Irish Times.  Can I ask you: When the President
goes to Dublin today and tomorrow, will he have any specific asks of the
Irish government?  For example, in Ukraine, will he be asking them to do
anything more than they have done up to now?

MS. SLOAT:  I think, like I said, the President has been very happy with
everything that Ireland has been doing.  I know when he spoke with the
Taoiseach when they were in Washington together on St. Patrick’s Day, it
really is staggering when you look per capita at the number of Ukrainian
refugees that Ireland has taken in.  So that was something that very
much struck the President when they met in Washington, and I expect they
will discuss again when they see each other in person.

I think there’s also a recognition that Ireland has given a significant
amount of support, particularly in terms of non-lethal, has contributed
to what the EU has done on the lethal side through the peace facility,
and then obviously been a strong supporter of sanctions within the EU to
continue imposing costs on Russia as well.

MR. SAVETT:  Aurelia with the AFP.

Q    Thank you so much.  Following up on the — on the meeting with
Northern Ireland political leaders, some DUP leaders had pretty harsh
words for the President.  One of them describing him as “anti-British”
in the press just this morning.  So is the President trying to change
that perception?  And what’s his message going to be for those leaders?

MS. SLOAT:  You know, I think the track record of the President shows
that he’s not anti-British.  The President has been very actively
engaged throughout his career, dating back to when he was a senator in
the peace process in Northern Ireland.  And that has involved meetings
with leaders of all of Northern Ireland’s political parties from both of
the two main communities, the British and Irish leaders here.  
   
The UK remains one of our strongest and closest allies.  And it’s
difficult, frankly, to think of an issue in the world that we are not
closely cooperating with the British on.  And it’s why the President
wanted to have the opportunity to engage with Prime Minister Sunak this
morning to start his day here in in Belfast.  
   
And I think his message to the DUP and to all of the political leaders
is going to be what I have been laying out, which is the continued
strong support for seeing the peace process move forward here; the
strong desire by this President to increase U.S. investment in Northern
Ireland, to take advantage of the vast economic potential that he sees
here; and to reiterate broad support for the return of devolved
government to Northern Ireland.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Okay.  We only have time for a couple more.  Let me take
two final ones from the Zoom, and then I’ll come back to the room.  
   
So, Ben Lowry.  
   
Q    Hello.  Can you hear me?  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Yes, we can.  
   
Q    Okay.  Hi.  Thanks.  Thanks for having me.  Dame Arlene Foster, who
is a former First Minister of Northern Ireland and DUP leader, said on a
television channel yesterday that President Biden hates the United
Kingdom.  And I just wondered what the reaction was to that.  
   
MR. SLOAT:  I guess I can answer the same question a second time.  It’s
simply untrue.  The fact that the President is going to be engaging for
the third time in three months and then again next month, and then again
in June with the Prime Minister of the UK shows how close our
cooperation is with the UK.  
   
And before that, the President had numerous calls and meetings with
Prime Minister Johnson and Prime Minister Truss as well.  
   
President Biden obviously is a very proud Irish American.  He is proud
of those Irish roots.  But he is also a strong supporter of our
bilateral partnership with the UK, not only on a bilateral basis, within
NATO, within the G7, on the U.N. Security Council.   
   
And like I said, we truly are working in lockstep with the British
government on all of the pressing global challenges that our countries
are facing.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Let’s do one final question from the Zoom, and then we’ll
come back to the room to finish out.  
   
Let’s do Lisa O’Carroll.  
   
Q    Hi there.  Yeah, you covered in those recent questions what I was
originally going to ask.  However, is there something (inaudible) that
you can add on what America, what Joe Biden envisages as economic
support?  What form will that take?  Will it be some sort of summit? 
And what exactly can (inaudible)?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  It’s a good question, and I think that’s going to be a large
part of the remit of Joe Kennedy.  Like I said, he is here with the
President.  He will be at his remarks today.  I believe he will be
spending the next week here in Northern Ireland.  He had the opportunity
to engage with a lot of U.S. companies, as well as Northern Ireland
companies, other British and Irish firms in Washington around St.
Patrick’s Day.  
   
He’ll be taking the opportunity of being here this week to continue
those conversations.  I think he wants to get a sense of what specific
needs are in Northern Ireland and then to start thinking through ways in
which the United States can best support that through increased
investment, trade links, and other ways in which the U.S. can
meaningfully contribute to unlocking the truly vast potential here in
Northern Ireland.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Thank you.  We have time for two final questions.  The
BBC.  
   
Q    Hi there.  Does the President believe it is necessary for the
devolved government (inaudible) to be up and running in order to access
that economic investment that you’re talking about?  Is it a
prerequisite that there’s a functioning government before there can be
economic assistance?  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I don’t think we’re putting conditions on it.  I mean, there
is a need for additional economic support and development here. 
Certainly, if you talk to business leaders, they have made clear that
they are looking for stability and certainty.   
   
But I think our commitment to Northern Ireland has been clear and
sustained and is going to continue. But that, obviously, is a question
for business leaders.  
   
It is, just to go back to something I said earlier, why the President
has been so supportive of the Windsor Framework, because there is a
clear view that that responded to the needs that were identified by
businesses and that that is a step in giving businesses the confidence
and the stability that they need.  
   
So I think it’s fair to say that having the devolved institutions up and
running would further provide that stability and certainty to
businesses.  But the U.S. commitment to support Northern Ireland’s
economic development stands on its own.  
   
MR. SAVETT:  Great.  We have time for one final question if anyone has
any more.   
   
Great.  Always — always love it when we exhaust questions.  
   
MS. SLOAT:  I know.  The last ones are always the hardest too, so.   
   
MR. SAVETT:  Well, thank you, everyone, for taking the time to do this. 
We were very glad we were able to make it work.  
   
As Amanda said at the beginning, we’re working on getting more gaggles
for you all throughout the trip, including with Kirby and Karine.  So
we’ll keep you all posted as soon as something gets finalized.
