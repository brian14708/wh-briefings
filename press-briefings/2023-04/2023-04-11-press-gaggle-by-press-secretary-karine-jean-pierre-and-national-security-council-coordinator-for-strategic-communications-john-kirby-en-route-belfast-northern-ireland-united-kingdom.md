Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom

12:47 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  So, good afternoon, everybody.   
   
President Biden has just completed a call with the family of Evan
Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was wrongfully
detained by Russia nearly two weeks ago.   
   
The President made it clear that his national security team has been and
will remain focused on securing Evan’s release as well as that of Paul
Whelan, both of whom are wrongfully detained in Russia.  
   
The charges against Evan are completely baseless.  He should be released
immediately.  The State Department continues to seek consular access to
him.   
   
I have two other pieces of — of news before I — I hand it over to my
colleague at the NSC.  
   
This morning, the Biden administration unveiled a stronger approach to
disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl into Amer- — into America
— American communities.  
   
The news we’re announcing today will build on the progress we’ve made to
reduce overdoses, seize historic amounts of il- — illicit fentanyl, and
target traffickers.  
   
We are building on ongoing efforts by focusing and coordinating all of
our ava- — available tools to disrupt global illicit synthetic drug
production and trafficking.  
    
Specifically, we will coordinate federal actions across the following
key areas: leading a coordinated global effort with international
partners to disrupt the illicit synthetic drug trade, strengthening
coordination and information-sharing between U.S. intelligence and
domestic law enforcement, working with the private sector globally,
protecting the U.S. financial system from use and abuse by drug
traffickers, and calling on Congress to close legal loopholes for
illicit synthetic drugs.   
   
The administration is also accelerating an evidenced-based public health
approach to save lives by expanding access to opioid overdose reversal
products and launching a national campaign to educate young people on
the dangers of fentanyl.   
   
Also today, President Biden released a statement commemorating the 55th
anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, a landmark law that guarantees that
all people in America have the right to obtain the housing of their
choice, free from discrimination.  
   
The importance of this law cannot be overstated, but we have far to go
to meet its full promise.  Many neighbors — neighborhoods across the
country remain as segregated today as they were 55 years ago. 
Disparities in homeownership rates by race and ethnicity persist.  And
the racial wealth gap is wider now than it was when the Fair Housing Act
was passed.    
   
President Biden believes that a fair housing market is critical to the
fulfillment of the American Dream.  As a U.S. senator, he co-sponsored
the 1988 Fair Housing Act amendments that extended the law’s protections
to Americans with disabilities and families with children.  
   
And in the final week of his administration — sorry, in the first week —
whoops — (laughter) — in the first week of his administration — not
making an announcement from here — but in the first week of the
administration, he directed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development to fully implement the Fair Housing Act’s requirement to
“affirmatively furthering fair housing,” which was weakened during the
previous administration.  
    
As we celebrate the ways in which the Fair Housing Act has empowered
millions of Americans with a fair shot at accessing housing
opportunities over the last 55 years, we continue to work to ensure
everyone has free and fair housing choice.  
   
So, one update before I turn it over to the Admiral.  I have a — I have
an update on specifically who will be greeting the President when we
land in Belfast.  
   
So, in addition to Prime Minister Sunak, who we mentioned yesterday, the
President will also be greeted by the Lord-Lieutenant of County Antrim,
His Majesty’s Ambassador to the United States, the U.S. Ambassador to
the United Kingdom, U.S. Consul General of Belfast, the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland, and the Commander 38 Irish Brigade and
Northern Ireland Garrison.   
   
And with that — thank you for your patience.  Where is the Admiral? 
Oh.  (Laughter.)  Admiral Kirby, go for it.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have any — anything at the top.  Karine covered it
all.  But I’m happy to take a couple questions if you have them.  
   
Q    I think there’s been new leaks even since we’ve been in the air. 
So I guess I wondered what kind of action is the White House taking to
protect intelligence products in light of these, sort of, consistent
leaks?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  There’s a couple of things going on.  I’m not aware of these
reports.  But as you know, the Department of Defense acted very swiftly
to try to get their arms around whatever national security implications
are at risk here with these — with these leaks.  They’ve also taken
immediate action to look at the distribution of the material on a
regular basis.   
   
And then, very, very quickly, one of the very first things that
Secretary Austin did was refer this to the Justice Department for a
criminal investigation.  So, they’re looking at that.  And I think
that’s really where things stand right now.   
   
Q    Are the leaks damaging to relationships with allies and partners?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re reaching out, as I said yesterday, at very high levels
with relevant allies and partners and communicating with them.  And I’ll
certainly let them speak to — to the context of those conversations, and
we’ll continue to do that as — as appropriate.   
   
Q    On the — on the Gershkovich case, the — when the United States was
in negotiation — discussions with Russia over Brittney Griner, there was
some discussion of the Russians wanting one of their people who was
being held in Germany.   
   
Have — now that he’s been designated as — as officially wrongfully
detained, have those discussions begun internally among the United
States about, you know, trying to find somebody to swap for him and for
Whelan that might be acceptable to the Russians?  
   
And obviously, it’s just a couple of weeks old, but, like, at what point
do those discussions begin with the Russians in ad- — as well?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  So, I just want to make a couple of things clear that
his — the determination of wrongful detention doesn’t start the clock
necessarily on communicating with the Russians about getting him
released.  We’re very early in this process here.   
   
And I certainly — I think you can understand why I wouldn’t talk about
any discussions we might be having with the Russians about his release
or Paul’s release.  We certainly wouldn’t do that.   
   
But this is all — I mean, his detention is pretty fresh.  So there
hasn’t — well, we’re just — we want to make sure we get consular access
to him, which we haven’t had.  And we want to get — we want to see him
released immediately.   
   
But I’m just not at liberty to talk about the context of any specific
conversations that we — we might or might not be having with the
Russians about him.  Again —  
   
Q    What about just internally inside the Biden administration?  Do you
— do you now begin the discussions — again, besides not communicating
with the Russians but just internally — about what you all — who you all
might have and who allies might have to trade?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Internally, we’re — we’re certainly having discussions about
what we can do to get him released.  Again, I don’t want to go into
details about these internal deliberations.  Having things out in the
public sphere this early might actually make it harder to get — to get
Evan and Paul home.  And that’s what we’re focused on.  So I — I think I
need to just leave it right there.  
   
Q    Okay, that’s fine.   
   
Q    Why has it been so hard to get consular access?  Is it just the
nature of being detained?  I mean, it’s — it’s been however long since
he has been detained now and still there’s nothing —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s a great question for — that’s a great question for
Russian officials.  It’s not for a lack of trying, I can assure you
that.  The State Department has been trying to get consular access to
him ev- — since the moment we found out that he was detained.    
   
Q    Can you tell us anything about the conversation with his family?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m sorry?  
   
Q    Can you tell us anything about the conversation with his family —
what they said?  (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I — I think I’m going to protect their privacy.  The
President was very grateful that they were willing to take the call and
grateful for the time that they — that they gave him, but I’m going to
respect their privacy.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, JJ.  I know.  Go ahead, JJ.  
   
Q    Can you — what is the status of the U.S. relationship with Egypt
right now?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Egypt is a significant security partner and remains so in
the region.  And, as you know, the United States military has a
longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many
years.   
   
And Egypt has helped play a useful role in terms of some of the
negotiations that have been going on in the region, particularly with —
with the — with these meetings that — that happened between Israel and —
and Saudi Arabia.  So — and Egypt played a role in that.  And we’re
grateful for that.  
   
Q    Has the U.S. confronted Egypt about this report about Egypt
planning to supply 40,000 rockets to Russia?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, look, I’m not going to — I am not going to talk at all
about the details of diplomatic conversations that we’re having.  We are
reaching out and speaking appropriately to relevant allies and
partners.  I’m not going to detail who and I’m not going to detail the
details of — of those conversations.  
   
What I can tell you is — and I’m not going to — also I don’t want to
speak to the validity of these leaked documents.    But we have — what I
will tell you is we’ve seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal
weaponry capabilities to Russia.  
   
Q    How long do you think it’s going to take to track down where these
documents came from?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Difficult to know, Steve.  I mean, obviously, we’re all
working at this very, very hard.  We’d like to get answers as quickly as
we can so we can find out, you know, where this breach occurred.  But I
don’t know.  And I think it would be foolish for anybody to try to guess
how long that’s going to take.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi.  I had a — I had a question on some other documents today.  We
found out that the “Gang of Eight” on Capitol Hill has — now have access
to those today.  What’s your level of cooperation with that?  Has
anybody —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Access to what?  
   
Q    Access to the documents obtained at the President’s home as well as
former President Trump and former \[Vice\] President Pence.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s — that’s all under investigation by the Justice
Department.  I’m not going to speak to that.    
   
Q    What — what’s the President going to do to try to get — break the
impasse in Northern Ireland?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, you mean — talk- — talking about the assembly?    
   
Q    Yeah.  Yeah.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, look, the President’s message — he’s going to have a
chance to engage tomorrow with the political party leaders.   
   
And really, the message is twofold.  It’s congratulations on 25 years of
the Good Friday Agreement, which has brought unprecedented peace and
prosperity.  And — and that kind of goes to the second goal, which is to
talk about the importance of trying to work on trade and economic
policies that benefit all communities, as well as the United States. 
That’s really what he’s focused on.  
   
Q    What’s he going to say at Ulster University?  What’s his message
there?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think his message, again, is going to be sort of
threefold.  I don’t want to get too far ahead of the President’s speech,
but one is, again, putting the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement into some
sort of historical context, talk about the importance of that.  
   
And that kind of leads to a message about the youth generation in
Northern Ireland and how they are literally just changing the — the face
of high-tech innovations in Northern Ireland and the impact that they’re
having economically and domestically, politically inside their own
country.  
   
And then the third thing kind of gets back to what I said before: He’s
going to talk about trade and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland
and all the opportunities that opens up between our — you know, between
the United States and the UK.  
   
That’s really sort of the — the three pillars of his remarks.  
   
Q    Will he meet with the DUP leaders?  Will he ask them to return to
governing?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, he’s going to meet with the political party leaders of
all the parties, all together in an engagement.  And, again, the message
is really: congratulations on this anniversary, and a focus on trade and
economics and improving that across the board.  
   
But, look, you’ve all heard him say — in fact, he said it on St.
Patrick’s Day: We’d like to see the National Assembly returned,
clearly.  
   
Q    Karine, if I can ask you, the President — are we — is everybody
done with him?  Sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Is everybody done?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Done with me?  All right.  See ya.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Kirby doesn’t have to stand around and — and do
this part.  What’s up?  
   
Q    If I can ask you, the President signed legislation ending the COVID
emergency.  What does that functionally, practically mean?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, a couple of things there.  As you just
stated, that — so the national — the national emergency will not impact
the planned winddown of the public health emergency on May 11th, as
you’ve heard us talk about many times.   
   
But since Congress moved to undo the national emergency earlier than
exp- — intended, we’ve been working with agencies to address the impacts
of ending the declaration early.   
   
So I have a couple of examples — because I know folks have asked — of
what that — those impacts might look like.  
   
So, one of them — if you look at HUD, mortgage forbearance was made
available to people during the national emergency.  So HUD has now
issued guidance to make COVID-19 forbearance available through May 31st,
2023, for people who may be impacted.   
   
And another example is that the Department of Veterans Affairs has ro- —
has relaxed its requirements for in-person home visits to assess
eligibility for caregiving — caregiver assistance.  And that flexibility
— that will end.  They have worked to notify people who may be
impacted.   
   
So, that’s kind of two examples of what that might look like.  Again, we
had to act swiftly because Congress moved quickly on this — or moved
before — early, I should say, on this.  And — and so, we’ve been kind of
taking actions and making — and alerting people in the —  
   
Q    Will the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — way that it needs to be.  
   
Q    Will the White House change its testing cadence or policy for
people coming in and out of the White House as a result?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I know that question has been asked in different
variations.  I don’t have anything to share at this time.   
   
And so, once we — once we have more information on the testing or how it
looks like in either — you know, in different — I guess in different
variations, not just at the White House or more broadly, I will — I will
certainly let you guys know.  
   
Q    Does this —  
   
Q    I’m sorry.  
   
Q    Sorry.   
   
Q    Yeah, if you’re (inaudible).  
   
Q    Yeah.  Does it impact the May 11th deadline for Title 42 or
anything like that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it doesn’t.  It doesn’t at all.   
   
And as you know, the Department of Homeland Security announced in
January how they were going to move forward on Title 42, so that hasn’t
changed at all.  And two — two kind of — two separate — two separate
things there.  
   
Q    Axios had a story about the White House possibly creating a new
briefing room for social media influencers.  And I am curious whether
that is real and —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I wonder why you would be curious, Tam.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    I might have a vested interest in protecting the rights of the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no —  
   
Q    — press corps.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — I get it.  I totally get it.    
   
Q    The interests of the press corps, I will say.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, don’t — don’t have anything to announce on
that or anything to share on that or confirm or anything like that.   
   
As you know, we — here at the White House, we met — very often use
influencers to try — to try to meet Americans where they are.   
   
We’ve seen those reportings.  I just don’t have anything to share on
that.   
   
Q    So, does that mean you’re not denying it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just don’t — I mean, I just — there’s — I can’t
confirm those stories.  I just can’t confirm or say — all I can tell you
is something that we do all the time, from the President on down, is
talk to influencers and try to meet the American people where they are
to reach them in a different way.  But —  
   
Q    But that could be anything.  But that —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah?  
   
Q    — talking to them is different than —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Right.  And that’s why I’m saying —  
   
Q    — giving them a briefing room.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Right.  We’re not — look, that is not — that is not in
the works.  Okay?   
   
Look, what I’m saying is we do talk to them — you know, different
influencers, as you know, as you’ve seen over the last two years and
also during the campaign, just trying to meet Americans where they
are.   
   
That’s it.  
   
Q    Karine, any — any chance you guys have reconsidered the decision
not to have a press conference while you’re in Ireland?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I know and — and I appreciate the question. 
I know you guys asked —  
   
Q    I’m thinking “no.”  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  So a couple of things.  Look, as you know,
the President regularly — and takes questions from the press informally
— informally as well at different locations and different formats.   
   
Right before he got on Air Force One, he took about five very newsy
questions for all of you, which I think was very important for all of
you.  And it’s also for the American people to — you know, to — to hear
from him directly on.   
   
So, the informal and informative Q&A that the President Biden engages in
the — in with the press corps is more than — more than the last three
Presidents.  If you think about the informal questions and the formal
questions.  
   
And I told — I mentioned to all of you yesterday that we actually had
some — some data to share.  It’s more than Presidents Trump; it’s more
than Obama — Obama — combined —  
   
Q    What measurement?  
   
Q    How — yeah.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re happy to share that.  I’m just letting you
know.  
   
Q    Well, I would just ask — I mean, just — like, is it minutes spoken
or —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s questions.  I just said: questions.  
   
Q    Number of questions?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Number of questions.  Yeah —  
   
Q    So — so, that’s what I’m asking is what the metric is.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  No problem.  That’s what I — but I said —  
   
Q    Number of questions.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — number of questions.  Just number of questions.   
   
Let me — let me finish, and then we can continue —  
   
Q    Oh, yeah, sure.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So it’s more than President Trump and Obama combined,
or President Obama and George W. Bush.   
   
And here you go.  To your question, he has answered over 320 questions,
and that’s not even including more — more formal press conference and
interviews.  
   
So look, we’re going to try and — we’re going to keep — be consistent in
his engagement with reporters.   
   
And to — as we know, the job that you all do is very important as you
inform the American people.  That will not stop.   
   
I just don’t have anything else to share with you on that.  
   
Q    So that’s — so that’s a no on a press conference?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  There will not be a press conference on this trip.   
   
But, again —  
   
Q    Do you have an update on the — anything new on the abortion
ruling?  Are you urging companies who produce mifepristone to —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, nothing — nothing more than what I shared —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  Nothing more than what I shared.  
   
Look, I’m not going to get — as I said yesterday, I’m not going to get
ahead of the courts.   
   
As of Friday, the Texas decision has stayed for seven days, as you all
know.  This is — the status quo is still in place as it relates to
mifepristone, and providers and women being able to access that drug. 
And so, that remains.  
   
DOJ has already appealed — has requested a stay, as we just said, and we
will continue to fight in the courts to maintain that they stay — that
they stay so that women can continue to access mifepristone.  
   
So, again, we are prevail — we are ready to prevail in the courts. 
There’s a process that we’re going through that we’re going to make sure
that — that, you know, we win this — we win this on behalf of women
across the country.  
   
Q    Any updates on what the President is doing at the front of the
plane — phone calls he’s making with foreign leaders or domestic?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, as you know, he felt it was really important to
connect with Evan’s family, his parents.  You guys heard him.  I think —
I think you asked the question, and he had said —  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — he had tried.  And as I just mentioned at the top,
he actually connected with Evan’s parents.  So, clearly, that was
something that was — been top of mind for the President and thought it
was incredibly important to do.  So, I’ll say that.   
   
And secondly, you know, the President is very much looking forward to
this trip for personal reasons, but also work reasons, as — as we just
laid out moments ago.   
   
So, per usual, he’s meeting with his team, his staff; going through his
speech; talking about the different steps at different events that he’ll
be — that he’ll be doing throughout the next four or five days.  And so,
it’s the normal cadence that he does when we’re on a flight heading —
heading overseas.   
   
Q    Who is traveling with him?  Is it just — from his family — is it
just Val and Hunter?  Or are there other family members?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I can confirm — I can confirm that his sister, Valerie
Biden Owens, is traveling.  I can confirm that Hunter Biden is traveling
as well.  
   
Q    On the Supreme Court, do you think that Chief Justice Roberts
should order an investigation into the luxury trips taken by Clarence
Thomas?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, this is not — we’re just not going to
comment on that.  That’s going to be up to the Supreme Court to look
into or do whatever it is — whatever process that they put in place. 
We’re just not going to comment on it.   
   
Q    I just wonder would the White House — you know, with our government
as a system of checks and balances, how does the White House — I mean,
sort of, staying removed from it — like, what does it gain when we’re
trying to — you know what I mean?  Like, with — each sort of government
is trying to sort of check and balance one another.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I understand the question.  It is the Supreme Court. 
And so, we’re just not going to comment on — on this.  And I’m just
going to leave it there.  I’m just going to leave it there.  
   
Q    Just before we took off, the DNC announced that it had chosen
Chicago for the — for the convention.  Do you guys have any thoughts on
— and in what role the President played in pushing that decision?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I know there’s a lot of excitement about this.  As
you just mentioned, Michael, it was just announced this morn- — this
morning.  Right?  Either right — we were on the plane or right before we
got on this flight.  This is something that the DNC is running and is —
and is kind of operating.  So I would just have to refer you to the
DNC.   
   
All right?  
   
Q    Al Roker yesterday — or the interview with Al Roker said that the
President plans to run for re-election.  Was that anything different
than what he’s been telling us?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you for the question, Steve.  There — there’s
nothing different there.  I always say this at the top: going to really
careful.  We follow the Hatch Act here.   
   
But the President has many times said he intends to run, plans to run. 
Nothing has changed.  That — he clearly — he continued and said he had
not made a decision yet.  It’s up to the President to decide.   
   
But we’ve used those two words interchangeably the last — I don’t know —
year and a half or so.  So nothing has changed.   
   
Q    When’s he going to announce it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    He said he’s not ready — he’s not ready just yet, but he seems like
he’s got a plan.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, he intends to run, so I’m just going to leave
it there and let the President make his decision.  
   
Q    Are any other members of his family meeting him in Ireland?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The only two that I can confirm at this time is Hunter
