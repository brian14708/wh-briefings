James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:30 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I heard a “knock ‘em dead.”  
   
All right, everybody.  Happy Thursday.  Good afternoon.  I have a few
things at the top before I turn it over to the Admiral.  
   
As I was walking out here today, we saw news that Republican legislators
in Tennessee were preparing to vote on the expulsion of three Democratic
officials who stood in solidarity with children and families peacefully
protesting for action on gun safety.   
   
The fact that this vote is happening is shocking, undemocratic, and
without precedent.  Across Tennessee and across America, our kids are
paying the price for the actions of Republican lawmakers who continue to
refuse to take action on stronger gun laws.   
   
The President will continue to call on Congress to take action to ban
assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of
firearms, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability, and
require background checks for all gun sales.  And state officials must
do the same.  
   
This has been one of the worst weeks for — of 2023 so far in terms of
anti-LGBTQ bills becoming law in states across America.  
    
Three anti-LGBTQ laws have been enacted so far this week in Kansas,
Indiana, and Idaho.  Just yesterday, the North Dakota Senate passed 10
anti-LGBTQ bills in just one day, a single-day record.  
    
In Kansas, the state legislation overrode Governor Kelly’s veto to make
Kansas the 20th state that has banned transgender kids from
participating in schools’ sports.  
   
With the enactment of a new law in Indiana, 14 states have now banned
gender-affirming healthcare, while some of these laws are currently
blocked by courts.  This is a dangerous — a dangerous attack on the
rights of parents to make the best healthcare decisions for their own
kids.   
   
According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 50 percent of
transgender youth in the U.S., which is estimated to be more than
150,000 kids, live in states in which transgender youth have lost access
to or at risk of losing access to gender-affirming care.   
    
 Look, this is awful news.  Let’s be very clear about that. LGBTQI+ kids
are resilient.  They are fierce.  They fight back.  They’re not going
anywhere.  And we have their back.  This administration has their
back.  
   
We are so proud of the kids across this country who have organized
protests and school walkouts to tell the politicians in their states to
stop this legislative bullying.   
    
I know that these political attacks can really take toll on people’s
mental health, so I want to say directly to LGBTQI+ kids: You are loved
just as you are, just the way you are.  And if you’re feeling
overwhelmed, you call 988, the national crisis hotline, and dial the
number “3” to talk to a counselor who has been specifically trained to
support LGBTQI+ kids.  This is a new service that the Biden
administration is proud to offer during these incredibly hard times for
these trans kids.   
   
Now, one last thing before we move on to — to the briefing.  
   
On Sunday — oh.  
   
AIDE:  I’m so sorry, but they have to gather.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So, the in-town pool has to gather for the
President’s departure.  And we’ll just continue.  
   
So, if you all want to go ahead and do that, feel free.  And then, we’ll
cont- — we’ll still continue with the briefing.  
   
So, just — so, we can go quickly here.  I want to give you guys a week
ahead, as we normally do on Fridays.  
   
On Sunday, the President and the First Lady —  
   
(Members of the press depart Press Briefing Room.)  Let’s do this
quietly, friends.  Thank you.  
   
On Sunday, the President and the First Lady will return to the White
House from Camp David.  
    
On Monday, the President and the First Lady will host the 2023 White
House Easter Egg Roll, a tradition dating back to 1878.  A teacher for
more than 30 years, First Lady Jill Biden is continuing her theme of
“Egg-” — “EGGucation” for the event, transforming the South Lawn and the
Ellipse into a school community full of fun educational activities for
children of all ages to enjoy.   
    
In addition, the time-honored traditions of rolling and hunting eggs,
this year’s White House Easter Egg “EGGucation” Roll will also feature a
Schoolhouse Activity Area, Reading Nook, Talent Show, Field Trip to the
Farm, Picture Day, a Physical “EGGucation” Zone, a Snack Time Tent, and
more.   
    
On Tuesday through Friday, the President will travel to the United
Kingdom and Ireland.  The President will first travel to Belfast,
Northern Ireland, from April 11th through April 12th to mark the
tremendous progress since the signing of the Belfast/Good Friday
Agreement 25 years ago and to underscore the readiness of the United
States to support Northern Ireland’s vast economic potential to the
benefit of all communities.  
   
The President will then travel to Ireland from April 12th through April
14th.  He will discuss our close cooperation on the full range of shared
global challenges.  He will also hold various engagements, including in
Dublin, County Louth, and County Mayo, where he will deliver an address
to celebrate the deep, historic ties that link our countries and
people.    
   
On Monday, we’ll have some more to share about the details of the
trip.  
   
Now, finally, as you — as many of you know, over the past many months,
departments and agencies key to the Afghanistan withdrawal have been
conducting thorough, internal after-action reviews examining their
decision-making processes and execution.  Those reviews fed into a
process looking across the administration.   
   
And today, the NSC will also be releasing a document that provides our
perspectives, outlines in broad strokes some of what we learned and how
we have already implemented those lessons in other global challenges.  
   
My colleague, Admiral John Kirby, is here today to discuss that
document, and we — with all of you today and answer your questions.  
   
And with that, Admiral, the floor is yours.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Good afternoon, everybody.  
   
So, I want to start today by again updating you, as Karine said, on the
administration’s work to assess the withdrawal from Afghanistan.  
   
As you all know, over these many months, departments and agencies key to
the withdrawal conducted thorough, internal after-action reviews, each
of them examining their decision-making processes, as well as how those
decisions were executed.  
   
Today, they are making those reviews available to relevant committees in
the Senate and in the House, as previewed by Secretaries Blinken and
Austin in testimony last month.  
   
Those reviews, as Karine said rightly, fed into a process looking across
the administration.  
   
So, today, we are also making available to all of you and to the public
a document that provides our perspectives on the withdrawal and outlines
in broad strokes some of what we learned, as well as how we are already
implementing some of those lessons.  That document will be posted to the
White House website at the conclusion of my briefing.  
   
But I’d like to take some time, if you’ll allow me, to provide you an
overview.  
   
First and most critically, the President’s decision to end the war in
Afghanistan was the right one.  The United States had long ago
accomplished its mission to remove from the battlefield the terrorists
who attacked us on 9/11 and to degrade the terrorist threat to the
United States from Afghanistan.  
   
And now, with that war over, we can more squarely address the most
pressing challenges of our day.  America is on a stronger strategic
footing, more capable to support Ukraine and to meet our security
commitments around the world, as well as the competition with China,
because it is not fighting a ground war in Afghanistan.  
   
Of course, we continue to address terrorist threats — which, as the
President accurately assessed, would have migrated to other parts of the
world — through effective over-the-horizon operations, including those
that took out the leaders of al Qaeda and ISIS — al-Zawahiri and Haji
Abdullah, respectfully — respectively.  
   
But while it was always the President’s intent to end that war, it is
also undeniable that decisions made and the lack of planning done by the
previous administration significantly limited options available to
him.   
   
President Biden inherited a force presence in Afghanistan of some 2,500
troops.  That was the lowest since 2001.  He inherited a Special
Immigrant Visa program that had been starved of resources.  And he
inherited a deal struck between the previous administration and the
Taliban that called for the complete removal of all U.S. troops by May
of 2021 — or else the Taliban, which had stopped its attacks while the
deal was in place, would go back to war against the United States.  
   
The President’s transition team asked to see plans for that removal. 
They asked to see plans for a security transition to the Afghan
government.  And they asked to see plans to increase the processing of
Special Immigrant Visas.  None were forthcoming.   
   
Transitions matter.  That’s the first lesson learned here.  And the
incoming administration wasn’t afforded much of one.  
   
Thus, President Biden’s choice was stark: either withdraw all our forces
or resume fighting the Taliban.  He chose the former but, even in so
doing, secured extra time to conduct that withdrawal, stretching it out
to August.   
   
And that’s the second point worth making.  Despite having his options
curtailed, President Biden led a deliberate, rigorous, and inclusive
decision-making process that was responsive to facts on the ground.  He
focused keenly on the need for proper planning.  In fact, President
Biden directed his top national security leaders to begin planning for a
withdrawal even before he had made the final decision to leave
Afghanistan.  
   
He ordered troop reduction plans; plans to turn over bases and equipment
to the Afghan government, as the previous administration had negotiated;
plans to draw down our diplomatic presence; and plans to evacuate both
American citizens and Afghan allies alike.  
   
Indeed, evacuation planning started in spring of 2021, and the President
ordered additional military forces pre-positioned in the region by
mid-summer in case they were ever needed.  
   
Throughout, President Biden insisted that his team plan for worst-case
scenarios, such as the fall of Kabul, even though the intelligence
community’s assessment, when he was making the decision in early 2021,
was that Taliban advances would accelerate only after the withdrawal of
U.S. forces.  
   
The President repeatedly requested assessments of the trajectory of the
conflict from his military and his intelligence professionals.   
   
No agency predicted a Taliban takeover in nine days.  No agency
predicted the rapid fleeing of President Ghani, who had indicated to us
his intent to remain in Afghanistan up until he departed on the 15th of
August.  And no agency predicted that more than — that the more than
300,000 trained and equipped Afghan National Security and Defense Forces
would fail to fight for their country, especially after 20 years of
American support.  
   
In fact, the assessment was that the promotion of Acting Defense
Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi would actually strengthen their
resolve to stay and fight.  
   
And so, another lesson learned was the need to plan early and
extensively for low-probability, high-risk scenarios. 

I should note here that our experiences in Afghanistan informed our
decision to set up a small group of experts for worst-case scenario
planning on Ukraine, which included simulation exercises and our ability
to forcefully and plainly speak publicly about the risks we saw of
impending invasion. 

Now, look, there’s always going to be tension between highlighting
warning signs that a country may collapse and undermining that same
government.  And that’s a difficult balance to strike.   
   
But in Ukraine — and, before that, in Ethiopia, for that matter — we
prioritized earlier drawdowns of our personnel when each of those
capitals were under threat.  In fact, months before Russia’s invasion,
we released intelligence with trusted partners and our warnings about
the invasion grew louder and more public.  This aggressive approach
allowed us to organize with our allies and help enable Americans in
Ukraine to depart safely. 

And just to remind: We continue to facilitate the safe departures of
Americans from Afghanistan when they tell us they are ready to leave. 
And we have proudly welcomed nearly 100,000 of our Afghan partners and
their family members to the United States.  Many of these families left
Afghanistan after the withdrawal, and they continue to arrive on a
regular basis. 

Now, I’d be remiss here if I did not also express our gratitude to the
many private and nonprofit groups, including those comprising veterans
of the war who helped us identify, contact, and arrange for the safe
transport of thousands of these brave Afghans. 

Without their help or the incredible assistance we received from
countries in Europe and the Middle East that allowed us to use their
facilities as waystations, we could not have moved as many people as
quickly as we did.  And that’s yet another lesson that we learned — this
one about the power of allies, partners, and friends. 

Now, we know we need more help, which is why we urge Congress to assist
us in improving the Special Immigrant Visa Program and by passing the
Afghan Adjustment Act, both of which will make it easier for us to keep
meeting our commitments to our Afghan allies. 

No comments — none — about this withdrawal would be complete without
mention of the deadly attack on the Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai
International Airport on the 26th of August. 

The President, at the time, made it clear to operational commanders that
force protection remained his highest priority. 

In those tense days when the threat was particularly high, he accepted
the recommendation of his national security team to extend the timeline
for evacuations only after his senior military officials confirmed that
they had sufficient resources and authorities to mitigate threats,
including those threats posed by ISIS-K.  He trusted the best judgment
of his leaders on the ground to make all operational decisions,
including with regard to Abbey Gate.

The President and the First Lady will always honor the sacrifices of the
13 service members who were killed in that attack.  And we will never
forget their families.  We will mourn with them, remember with them, and
support those Gold Star families.

We mourn, as well, the loss of those Afghans killed by that suicide
bomber on that day, and others who lost their lives during the
withdrawal.   
   
And we will always honor the bravery and selflessness of every member of
the military, the foreign service, the intelligence community, and our
civil service, who made possible the largest airlift evacuation in
military history and all under the constant threat of attack. 

The effort was certainly not without days of pain, hardship, or
bloodshed.  But neither was it without courage or poise or
professionalism.

For all the lessons that we take away, we should remember that over 20
years of war and in its final days, these men and women saw things and
did things and carry things with them that you and I will never fathom. 

We must make sure that they and their families know that their service
mattered.  We must make sure they get the help and the support that they
need.  We must make sure that their legacy is never forgotten.  They
ended our nation’s longest war.  That was never going to be an easy
thing to do. 

And as the President himself has said, it was never going to be low
grade or low risk or low cost.  We should be humble enough to let that
also be a key lesson learned from Afghanistan. 

Thank you.  I’ll take some questions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Ed.

Q    So, John, thank you for doing this.  But I think I speak on behalf
of my colleagues in this room when we want the record to reflect that
this was sent to us about 10 minutes before the briefing began with
little notice, and it’s the very definition of a modern major holiday
news dump.   
   
You’re releasing this at the beginning of the High Holidays and after
months of requests from Republicans and the broader public. 

So, why today?  And is this all we get?  And is this a response to the
studies that were done by the agencies?  Or is this considered a summary
of them?

MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, there’s a lot there. 

This is the result of months and months of work by individual agencies
who were participating in the withdrawal to voluntarily review that
withdrawal, which they did.  And they worked through that.  These are —
these documents are classified.   
   
And we felt it was the responsible thing to do, after those reviews were
done, to then run a process across the administration to take a look at
those reviews ourselves across the interagency, work our way through it,
and then provide them to the relevant committees and leaders on the
Hill, which we did today.  We think that was the responsible thing to
do.   
   
And what you’re seeing today is the result and the culmination of an
awful lot of work, Ed.  No effort here to try to obfuscate or try to
bury something.  It’s an effort to try to be as open, as transparent as
we can be.   
   
And what you’ve got in that document there is a pretty fair summary of
our perspectives of the work over those many months, and pulling and
collating a lot of those lessons learned together.  And we’re trying to
present certainly the key lessons learned — the ones that we’re — we’re
able to share more openly and more publicly with you.   
   
And I’ll tell you this: You got questions after the briefing today —
I’ll stay here as long as you want.  But you got questions after the
briefing today?  You know how to get ahold of me.  We’ll answer whatever
you have.   
   
Q    I got two specific ones about what’s in this document after a speed
read here.   
   
On page eight: “The President received and accepted the unanimous advice
of his top national security officials to end the evacuation on August
31st.”   
   
What is the definition of a “top national security official”?  Because
we know, for example, that General McKenzie, who was then head of
CENTCOM, has said he objected to aspects of this.  So what’s the
definition of a top national security official?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I am loath to get into the individual advice that individual
members of the President’s team give him.  That would not be appropriate
for me.   
   
But I can tell you, having lived through this as well at the Pentagon,
that the President specifically asked his team: Should we extend past
the 31st?  He specifically asked them to go back and look and see what
that would look like.  Because we had secured this additional time from
the Taliban to the 31st of August.   
   
And the team did that.  The team did that, Ed, not just at the highest
levels of the Pentagon, from the Secretary to the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs to General McKenzie, but even the operational commanders on the
ground.   
   
And there were numerous flag and general officers on the ground at the
airport.  All of them took a fair look at the President’s request and
came back to him —  
   
Q    But are they all top national security officials?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — and said that it would not be advisable given the high
threat environment.   
   
Remember what also happened — on the 26th, that attack at Abbey Gate. 
And then we had very high temp between the 26th and the 30th, in which,
of course, there was a kinetic strike taken in downtown Kabul.  There
was — there was high temp.  
   
And so, the advice of his senior national security team all the way up
to the senior levels of the Pentagon advised him that the 31st was the
appropriate date to end that evacuation.   
   
Q    There’s four pages here of blame on the previous administration or
this White House explanation of what the last White House did regarding
Afghanistan.  Nowhere in here does there appear to be any expression of
accountability or mistake by either the President himself or others.  Is
there any for what happened?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would argue that the very fact that we voluntarily — the
agencies voluntarily decided to go conduct after-action reviews — nobody
told them to do that.  That wasn’t legislated by Congress.  They did
that on their own.   
   
And the fact that they did that and that we’re now placing it in — in —
on the Hill for Congress to look at; the fact that we digested and
distilled some of the key points of that and gave it out in a public
document; the fact that I’m up here talking to you about it, I think,
shows you how seriously the President felt about learning lessons from
this withdrawal.   
   
I would also point out to you that the work isn’t over.   
   
So, number one, even before you got that document, some of those lessons
were applied.  I had talked about Ethiopia.  I talked about Ukraine.   
   
And number two, it’s not like — it’s not like the work is all over.  The
President signed the legislation enabling the — the Afghan War
Commission to be formed.  And we’re going to continue to work and
cooperate with that.  That’s going to look at the whole 20 years.   
   
And America’s longest war deserves a lengthy review and lengthy study,
and the President is committed to that.  Thank you.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Mary.  
   
Q    Thank you.  In reading this, you seem to be conceding that
evacuation should have happened sooner and faster, saying we now
prioritize earlier evacuations, noting that today you would message
evacuations more aggressively.   
   
I understand you’ve made clear the President does not have any regrets
about his decision to withdraw.  But in hindsight, in reading this, does
the President have any regrets about how this withdrawal was carried
out?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President is very proud of the manner in which the men
and women of the military, the Foreign Service, the intelligence
community — I went on and on and on — conducted this — conducted this
withdrawal.   
   
But, look, I’ve been around operations my entire life, and there’s not a
single one that — that ever goes perfectly according to plan.  Things
happen.  Sometimes enemies get a vote.  And — and you always want to
learn from that.   
   
And one of the things that we learned — and I’ve talked about it here in
my opening statement as well — is that you got to — that balance of
striking, when do you — when do you pull out when a government is under
threat, particularly a friendly government, and do so in a way that
doesn’t undermine the very government you’re trying to support.  That’s
a tough balance to strike.  And it’s different in every single case.   
   
And as I said, we learned from Afghanistan and we applied that lesson in
Ukraine and Ethiopia — that being aggressive in the information space
and being willing to move a little sooner may be the best thing.   
   
Q    But does he wish he had done things differently?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President — I think everything is laid out here in this
document about the main — the main takeaways, the main lessons that we
learned.  And again, the President is enormously proud of the men and
women who conducted this withdrawal.   
   
Q    And just one last thing.  On the last page here, you note that “The
speed and ease with which the Taliban took control of Afghanistan
suggests that there was no scenario — except a permanent and
significantly expanded U.S. military presence — that would have changed
the trajectory.”   
   
I wonder what is your message to the veterans, to the families of the
fallen who may read that and wonder, “What was the point?”  
   
The President said many times that the mission that we originally were
sent into Afghanistan for was accomplished a long, long time ago. 
Remember, they were ordered in under President Bush to avenge the 9/11
attacks and to go specifically after Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.   
   
And decimating and degrading al Qaeda’s capability in Afghanistan was a
mission that we accomplished a long, long time ago.  And over time — the
President has talked about this — the mission in Afghanistan morphed
into something it wasn’t intended to originally be.  
   
That doesn’t — just because the mission changed over time under previous
administrations and leadership and scenarios doesn’t mean that anybody
who served in Afghanistan doesn’t have something to be proud of, doesn’t
have — sorry — doesn’t have  
service to this country that they can take with them the rest of their
lives and feel honorable about it.   
   
They didn’t — they didn’t make those decisions.  They signed up.  They
raised their right hand — all volunteers at a time of war — to say,
“Yeah, put me in.  I’m going to go fight.”  And some of them didn’t make
it back.   
   
And everybody that made it back made it back a little bit different than
when they left, and the President and the First Lady understand that and
respect that.  And they should know that they will always have the
commitment of the Commander-in-Chief and the respect of the country for
doing that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nandita, and then I’ll come — we’re going to get
around, everybody (inaudible).  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The report says the Trump administration’s four
years of neglect, including deliberate degradation, left Afghanistan
operations in despair.  Could you be specific about “deliberate
degradation”?  What are you specifically referring to?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  There are many aspects if you look at the Doha Agreement and
what led up into that.  
   
When President Trump took office, there was more than 10,000 American
troops in Afghanistan.  He took it down to 2,500.  He negotiated the
release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners that were being held by the Ghani
government without consultation with the Ghani government.  He
negotiated the Doha Agreement with the Taliban without the Ghani
government in the room.  And he all but froze the Special Immigrant Visa
program, which had been providing opportunities for some of our Afghan
allies to get out of the country and to come — and to come back.  
   
So, it was a general sense of degradation and neglect there that that
the President inherited.  
   
And do not underestimate the effect that the Doha Agreement had on the
morale and the willingness to fight on the Afghan national security and
defense forces.  It — it had — it had a very corrosive effect on their
willingness to continue to fight for their country.   
   
Now, we didn’t see that.  We didn’t see that.  And part of the reason we
didn’t see that is because we couldn’t see the plans the previous
administration allegedly worked on during the transition.  No — as I
said in my opening statement, none of those plans were forthcoming.  
   
Q    So would you say that the points that you just listed especially
were the ones that made this transition so much harder?  
   
MR KIRBY:  Those were some of the key ones.  
   
Q    Okay.  And a quick follow-up on what the report says about the
administration not broadcasting loudly about any potential worst-case
scenarios out of concern it would signal a lack of confidence in the
Afghan government’s position.   
   
We obviously ended up seeing Ghani flee the country.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    And so, was that a well-thought-out decision?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  What was — was what a well-thought-out decision?  His
decision to flee?  
   
Q    Not broadcasting — not broadcasting loudly any concerns about the
lack of confidence in the Afghan government.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I think — look, as I said, it’s a different — it’s a
difficult balance to strike.  And we were having internal
conversations.  In fact, we had conversations with the Ghani government
about our concerns over what was happening in the countryside throughout
Afghanistan there in early August.  
   
And — and where we came down on was not calling for an evacuation sooner
because we didn’t want the Ghani government to collapse.  And we had
every assurance made by President Ghani that he wasn’t going anywhere,
that he was still in charge, that he still had a viable
administration.  
   
And so, you know, when do you — when do you make that call?  And it’s
difficult, it’s tough to do it in the moment, and nobody can predict the
future.  Again, as I said, we learned from that experience, and we
applied a more aggressive approach, if you will, in Ethiopia and in
Ukraine.   
   
But every instance is different.  Every capital is — that’s under threat
is under a different kind of threat, and you have to evaluate it.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Phil, in the back.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I promise I’ll come up.  I just got to go to the
back.  
   
Q    That summer before the withdrawal, there was a dissent channel —
cable that was written by 23 State Department officials there at the
Kabul Embassy, warning that the administration, in their view, was not
prepared at that moment for the withdrawal.  
   
I’m curious: Did this review take that dissent cable into account?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  You’ll have to talk to the State Department.  The State
Department conducted an after-action review.  That — and so did the DOD
— and that’s a question better put to them.  
   
Q    And then one specifically then for the President and this
administration.  I’m curious if there was a moment during the
Afghanistan withdrawal that the President lost confidence in the
assessments that were given to him by the intelligence community and
lost confidence in the intelligence community itself, given that they
failed to foresee how quickly the Taliban would advance and Kabul would
fall.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President knows how hard people work across the
administration to try to give him the best information that they can. 
But it didn’t stop him from asking.  Throughout the entire withdrawal,
he was constantly pulsing the national security team about this or that
assessment and constantly challenging the thinking, constantly looking
for — for ways to better understand what was going on on the ground.  
   
Some of the assessments that was produced, as I put in my opening
statement, were — proved out to be not correct.  But — but, you know, he
— again, this was, you know, an honest effort by everybody to try to get
at the right outcome.  
   
Q    No one doubts that they weren’t working hard.  But their assessment
was flawed, and they failed in that assessment.  Has anyone been held
accountable for giving the President a wrong view —

MR. KIRBY:  I don’t —

Q    — about how things were turning out on the ground?

MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know how much intelligence you read or you get to
look at it every day, but let me tell you something: It’s a mosaic. 
It’s really hard.  And I’ve yet to see an intelligence assessment that —
that ever was 110 percent certain about something. 

They — they get paid to do the best they can, weaving in multiple
sources of information, sometimes in real time without even a lot of
time to process.  And do — and they do the best they can.  Do they
always get it right?  They’ll be the first ones, if they were up here,
to tell you they don’t always get it right. 

And clearly, we didn’t get things right here with Afghanistan about how
fast the Taliban were moving across the country.  I don’t think we fully
anticipated the degree to which they were constructing these deals in
the hinterlands that kind of fell like dominoes.  We didn’t anticipate
how fast the Afghan National Security Forces were going to fold, were
not going to fight for their country — particularly after we had, as I
said, dedicated 20 years, trained and equipped them.  I don’t think we
fully appreciated the degree of corruption that was in the officer ranks
in the military. 

I could go on and on and on. 

But it doesn’t mean that people weren’t trying and doing their best
effort to understand that.  But intelligence, getting it right every
single time — man, that’s — that’s a tough — that’s a tough hill to
climb.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Kristen.

MR. KIRBY:  Doesn’t mean that they don’t try.

Q    Karine, thank you.  And, John, thank you for being here.  It seems
like page after page, this places the blame on the previous
administration, starting with page one.  “President Biden’s choices for
how to execute a withdraw from Afghanistan were severely constrained by
conditions created by his predecessor.”

MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.

Q    Let me just follow up with you on something that Ed was asking,
which is: Does the President take responsibility for the withdrawal and
everything that happened thereafter?

MR. KIRBY:  He’s the Commander-in-Chief.  And he absolutely has
responsibility for the operations that our men and women conduct and the
orders that he gives.  And he continues to believe that the order to
withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one.   
   
And if you just look, Kristen, at what’s happened since we pulled out of
Afghanistan and see what the United States military has been better able
to do on behalf of the American people, I think there’s only one
conclusion you can come to and that it was the right decision. 

Q    And as you list these things that —

MR. KIRBY:  But — but wait — before I answer — but that do- — but you
need to remember — and I get the question about, you know, the previous
administration — you got to look at when he came into office what he was
walking into.

He didn’t negotiate with the Taliban.  He didn’t invite the Taliban to
Camp David.  He didn’t release 5,000 prisoners.  He didn’t reduce force
levels in Afghanistan to 2,500.  And he didn’t have an arrangement with
the Taliban that they wouldn’t attack our troops. 

He came in with a certain set of circumstances he had no ability to
change.  He had to deal with it based on what he inherited.

Q    And yet, he had eight months to plan.  Did he not?

MR. KIRBY:  He had to take eight months to plan because we — whatever
plans there might have been done by the previous administration, we
didn’t see.  And — and it was not apparent that there was a lot of
planning done. 

So, yes, he took some time to — to work through that.  I don’t think he
can be blamed for that.  In fact, he enabled and was able to secure from
the Taliban extra time on the clock.  Because by May 1st, you might
remember, they were going to come in guns blazing.

Hang on a second.  I’ll get to you.  
They were going to come in guns blazing on May 1st.  He got us until the
end of August so that we could do — I mentioned that in my opening
statement — proper planning, proper planning that — that accounted for
high-risk scenarios and — and probabilities that we — we hadn’t thought
of before so that he could get military forces pre-positioned in the
region so that if we had to go in and conduct an evacuation, they could
do that. 

And you know how fast they got there?  Forty-eight hours.  When we
ordered a NEO — a noncombatant evacuation — because he put them there. 
And he had to have time to do that.

Q    What does the President believe — what mistakes does the President
believe he made?

MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to speak for the President on — on that
score.  What I can tell you is that, again, we’ve done a good-faith
effort here to work through the lessons learned of this withdrawal.  And
we’ve already started to apply those lessons. 

The President ran a very inclusive, very rigorous, very flexible process
that was responsive, as I said, to — to the views of operational
commanders on the ground.  He repeatedly asked for and received
assessments almost every day about what was going on, and — and acted in
accordance with the best judgment of his advisors, particularly military
advisors, as things were unfolding. 

Q    John, just finally, given the enormity of this report, given the
American lives that were lost, why are we not hearing directly from the
President?

MR. KIRBY:  We are putting this forth for you and for Congress to- —
today.  And I think you’ve heard from the President.  He has talked many
times —

Q    But not about this report.

MR. KIRBY:  — about — he has talked many times about his decision to
withdraw from Afghanistan, his belief that it was the right decision. 
He has talked publicly about the withdrawal before and about the courage
and sacrifice and the professionalism.   
   
And he has been — he and the First Lady have been very open and honest
and transparent about — about the sorro- — sorrow that they feel for —
for those that lost their lives.  
MR. KIRBY:  Peter.  And then I’ll go to the back after Peter.

Q    Thanks.  John, who’s going to get fired over this?

MR. KIRBY:  Peter, the purpose of the document that we’re putting out
today is to sort of collate the chief reviews and findings of the
agencies that did after-action reviews.  
The — it’s not — the purpose of it is not accountability.  It’s — the
purpose of it is —

Q    Military leaders were giving advice.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — purpose of it is —  
   
Q    It doesn’t sound like it was good.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — to study lessons learned.   
   
Q    Do you admit that the intel was bad?  So how can President Biden
ever trust, when they come into the Oval Office with the PDB, that
anything in there is legit?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  What I said was —  
   
Q    “That intelligence is a mosaic.”  What if the mosaic — all the
pieces are incorrect?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  What I said was intelligence is hard business, and they get
it right a lot too.  There were some pieces here that weren’t accurate. 
And we’re being nothing but honest with you and the American people
about what those inaccuracies were and how they shaped some of the
decision-making that was laid before the President and his ques- — and
the questions that he — that he asked.   
   
This document and this effort isn’t about accountability today.  It’s
about understanding.  
   
And I would also add that the re- — as I said to Ed — the review process
isn’t over.  This is — this is the next muscle movement in what will be
a long process to better understand and comprehend and adjust to what we
learned and what we did in Afghanistan.  
   
Q    But it doesn’t seem like after the country has had a couple months
to review this, and as the government has, people don’t have an issue
with the decision to order troops out of Afghanistan.  It is with the
way that this President ordered it done.   
   
There were children being killed.  There were people hanging off of Air
Force jets that were leaving.  And you’re saying that you guys are proud
of the way that this mission was conducted?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It doesn’t mean —  
   
Q    You’re proud of that?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Proud of the fact that we got more than 124,000 people
safely out of Afghanistan?  You bet.  
   
Proud of the fact that American troops were able to seize control of a
defunct airport and get it operational in 48 hours?  You bet.  
   
Proud of the fact that we now have about 100,000 Afghans, our former
allies and partners, living in this country and working towards
citizenship?  You bet.  
   
But does that mean that everything went perfect in that evacuation?  Of
course not.  
   
I’ve talked about it from a dif- — a different podium.  The after-action
reviews are now being reviewed by members of Congress, which will lay
out things that could have gone better.  Nobody is saying that
everything was perfect, but there was a lot that went right.  And a lot
of Afghans are now living better lives in this country and other
countries around the world because of the sacrifices and the work of so
many American government officials.   
   
So, yeah, there’s a lot to be proud of, Peter.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Patsy.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thanks, John.  Just to follow up and my
colleague’s questioning about the blame assigned to the previous
administration.  Specifically, how does the — how is the Trump
administration responsible for the disorganized and chaotic process of
evacuation and determining who gets to board these evacuation flights? 
I mean, you mentioned that there’s a review in terms of the lessons
learned.  Can you share some of those lessons learned, just specifically
in terms of who gets to board evacuation flights?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to go beyond the review — the document that
you have today or my comments today.   
   
But I’m actually glad for the question, because I remember going through
all that.  And those first few days were very, very tough, they were
very hectic, because we didn’t have a force presence at Karzai
International Airport.   
   
Now, we were still in the process of taking those pre-positioned forces
and getting them onto the field.  And we got them there within 48
hours.  And about 72 hours after that, that airport was basically, for
all intents and purposes, American property, surrounded by the Taliban
and ISIS-K.   
   
So they not only had to run an airport, get the radars up and going, do
air traffic control, get planes coming in and getting them loaded, have
medical screening, have security vetting, have diplomatic presence on
the ground to make sure that we’re putting the right people on planes,
but also defend that airport from external threats.  That’s pretty
remarkable.   
   
And so, for all this talk of chaos, I just didn’t see it, not from my
perch.   
   
At one point during the evacuation, there was an aircraft taking off
full of people, Americans and Afghans alike, every 48 minutes.  And not
one single mission was missed.  So, I’m sorry, I just won’t buy the
whole argument of chaos.   
   
It was tough in the first few hours.  You would expect it to be.  There
was nobody at the airport and certainly no Americans.  It took time to
get in there.   
   
Q    Correct.  But is there anything in the review that addresses the
problem of who was in charge at that time?  I think there was a lot of
analysis that questions whether it should have been the military who’s
in charge of the evacuation versus the State Department, and that is
partly the problem of the confusion.   
   
And I understand your point about planes leaving full of people, but
there were also —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I actually don’t —  
   
Q    — planes who left empty —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I —  
   
Q    — and people falling off planes.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t — I actually don’t accept the premise of your
question that there was some sort of confusion over who runs it.  It was
a noncombatant evacuation operation, once it was called, and the
military leads those.  It’s pretty clear.  
   
Now, we needed the support of the State Department because you had to
have diplomatic officers, consular officers, people trained in the — in
the vetting of individuals coming in.  And we needed that help for
sure.  There was a lot of interagency coordination, and some of it had
to be developed in the moment, because we’d never done something like
this before.   
   
But it was very clearly what we call a “NEO,” a noncombatant evacuation
operation, which was led by the military.   
   
And let me tell you something else: Noncombatant evacuation operations
are the — are probably some of the most difficult — not “probably” —
they are some of the most difficult operations for any military to
conduct.  
   
Q    And can I just follow up on the women’s rights issue, John, since
you were there?  Since the withdrawal, Afghan women have suffered
massively under the Taliban, and they have recently banned Afghan women
from working as U.N. staff.  Some believe that this is a tactic — a
pressure tactic by the Taliban to secure a seat at the U.N. —
Afghanistan seat at the U.N.  Do you believe that this is a tactic that
will work?  Under what circumstances would the U.S. even consider
allowing the Taliban to have the Afghanistan seat at the U.N.?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I think we’ve talked about this.  I mean, we
certainly condemn this approach by the Taliban.  It is — and we’re
certainly not going to be compliant with it.   
   
If the Taliban wants international legitimacy, in whatever form, then
they should answer up to the commitments they made in the Doha Agreement
and in other agreements and, in this case, to be respectful of the
rights of women and girls.  And they haven’t.   
   
And so, until they do, they’re going to be continuing to struggle to
gain some sort of sense of legitimacy or assistance from the rest of the
world.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, James.  
   
Q    Karine, thank you very much.  Admiral, thank you.  I have two
questions about this report.  First question is about the intelligence
angle.  I think we can safely agree that any time the assets of the
intelligence community are harnessed to an assessment of a
life-and-death matter and the community gets that wrong and death
ensues, that that qualifies as an intelligence failure.   
   
First question here is whether — since you have acknowledged
essentially, without calling it as such, an intelligence failure in this
case, do we know why the intelligence community got it wrong?  What —
was it cultural?  Was it specific?  Was it analytical?  What was the
problem with the intelligence community here?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The intelligence community also conducted after-action
reviews, and I’d let them speak to that.  I’m not going to do that from
here.  
   
Q    Second question.  We in this room hear you saying, and the American
people hear you saying, that President Biden inherited bad policies from
President Trump.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No.  No, no, no.  Bad outcomes, bad conditions on the
ground.  That’s what I said.  
   
Q    Well, you said he reduced the force to 2,500.  You’re
characterizing that as a bad policy, yes?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m characterizing that as a fact.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
What we hear you saying — let me finish my question, please — and what
the American people hear you saying is: President Biden inherited flawed
policies from his predecessor, President Biden was deprived of the
requisite transition papers he should have received from his
predecessor, and President Biden was deprived of accurate information
from President Ghani about his intentions, and President Biden was
deprived of accurate assessments from the intelligence community.   
   
The depiction of the Commander-in-Chief that you present — or this
Commander-in-Chief — is of a figure almost helpless and shaped and
buffeted by individuals and forces and entities that are beyond his
control when he had every option to increase the troop size there during
his eight months in office, he had every option to intensify attacks on
the 5,000 Taliban fighters, and so on.   
   
So what — I just don’t understand why you’re willing to depict your
boss, the Commander-in-Chief, as so helpless in this instance.  
   
Mr. KIRBY:  The President was anything but helpless.  He drove a very —
as I said, a deliberate and inclusive decision-making process.  He was
able to secure some extra time for us to be able to conduct a withdrawal
and do so effectively.   
   
He repeatedly, as I said in my opening statement, throughout the entire
withdrawal, pulsed his national security team and senior military
leaders about the conditions on the ground, asking tough questions, and
getting answers and getting responses.  And he acted on the best
military judgment and the best assessments from the intelligence
community as he could, as he made these decisions going forward.   
   
And some of those assessments turned out to be wrong, but it wasn’t for
a lack of alacrity and energy and interest by the President in pulsing
and questioning and analyzing all the way through.  And this was — this
was difficult.  
   
As I said at the very end of my opening statement, ending a war — any
war — is not an easy endeavor, certainly not after 20 years.   
   
And the President said himself there was no way in that process that it
was going to be low grade, low cost, low risk.  There was going to be
risks.  There were going to be costs.  He knew that.  The team knew
that.  And everybody tried the best they could to develop the best
answers, the best responses, the best assessments that they could.  The
President relied on that judgment, but he kept challenging it.  All the
way through, he kept challenging it, he kept asking questions.  
   
Q    So given the conditions, your position is everything went about as
well as it possibly could have?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  My — it’s not my position, James.  I would encourage you to
take some time and look through the document, and you’ll see that some
of the key lessons learned that we took away are that you got to — you
got to really work hard at planning; you got to really work at interne-
— inter-agency coordination; you got to — you got to be willing to — to
revisit the idea of communications — crisis communications — with
respect to evacuations, and maybe be willing to move sooner than what
some of your instincts might be.   
   
I mean, there’s a lot in there.  So I encourage you to take a look at
that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Seung Min.  
   
Q    Two questions.  Why did the administration choose not to make this
an independent review?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  These were independent reviews.  The after-action re- —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No — no, no.  The after-action reviews that were done by the
Defense Department and at the State Department — they’re the two prime
ones that we’re talking about here — they were done completely
independently.  You — you will — you’ll see that.   
   
Q    Well, they’re still fundamentally his Cabinet agencies, his Cabinet
leaders conducting the agency — or conducting the reviews of his
actions.  Why not an outside commission — outside, independent person to
review what the administration did?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Each of these agencies voluntarily conducted these reviews. 
The President didn’t dictate to them how they were going to conduct
those reviews.  They each did it independently, differently — in a
different way.  But both State and State — State and DOD, sorry —
(laughter) — did their reviews using independent entities.   
   
And then that was pushed up to that inside the lifelines at the State
Department and the Defense Department, and both Secretary Blinken and
Secretary Austin had a chance to digest it, look at them, review them,
analyze those reviews.   
   
And then, of course, we — once — once — once we did that, those reviews
entered an interagency process where it was looked at — they were looked
at in conjunction here at the National Security Council and across the
interagency by multiple agencies to take a look at the work that the
State Department and the Defense Department did, and fashion together
some even broader lessons learned, some of which we shared in that
document that we gave you.   
   
Q    And I know you were asked earlier about releasing more beyond the —
beyond the 12-page report.  And you talked about information just being
very highly classified, but the President can obviously declassify
anything that he wants.  So would he do so in the interest of
transparency, in the interest of the public knowing more about what
happened with the withdrawal beyond the 12-page perspective of the
NSC?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, again, a couple of things to remember: This is an
ongoing process here.  We also look forward to cooperating with the
Afghan War Commission, which will take a look at the 20 years of war. 
These documents are sensitive and classified.  We are taking an
extraordinary step here to share them with members of Congress, the
relevant committees and leaders.   
   
Usually with after-actions, there’s no requirement to do that.  You
don’t have to do that.  But the President has taken that extraordinary
step to share these classified AARs — these after-action reviews — with
members of Congress.   
   
And we believe that the real value in them lies in the fact that we can
be sensitive — we can be sensitive to the information in them.  And so
that’s why — that’s why we’re doing it this way.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Katie.  
   
Q    Thanks.  You had said earlier this was about understanding and not
accountability.  I just don’t — how is this process and document not
about accountability?  You assign so much accountability to the Trump
administration and very little, comparatively, to your own.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  After-action reviews are done to — and it’s very common
practice that they are not investigations.  They’re not — they’re not
criminal proceedings.  They are —  
   
Q    No one is saying they’re criminal proceedings, but —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  They are studying — they are studying the — the conduct and
the execution of operations or policy.  And in this case, both State and
DOD have now conducted these in a classified way.  The idea is to learn
from them, to — to apply those lessons learned as needed.   
   
And as I’ve said, we didn’t wait for these reviews to be complete before
we started using some of the lessons in Ethiopia, in Ukraine.  That’s
the purpose here.  The work is about understanding what happened, what —
what went well, what could have gone better, and then learning from that
so that we don’t make some of those same mistakes in the future.  That’s
what it is.  It’s not — it’s not hunting for heads.   
   
Q    Well, and — just a second one, if I could.  You said the President
— earlier, somebody asked if the President takes responsibility for this
withdrawal and what happened after.  You answered and said he has
responsibility.  Does he take responsibility?  And have you heard him
say that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President is the Commander-in-Chief.  And just by dint
of being the Commander-in-Chief, he assumes responsibility for the
orders he gives, the men and women who execute those operations — in
this case, it’s not just the military.  And — and he stands by that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Way in the back.   
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you, John.  Since the withdrawal, China
has increased its economic ties with the Taliban — first, signing oil
deal in January and now eyeing mineral contracts.  Is the White House
concerned about these growing economic ties between China and Taliban?  
   
And can you share some comments about our economic (inaudible)?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We — we — look, our view — every country has got to take
their own view here of how they’re going to relate to the Taliban.  We
don’t — we don’t recognize them as an official government in
Afghanistan.  
   
And as I’ve said before, if they want to be so recognized — at least by
the United States — if they want to be seen as legitimate, then they
need to own up to the promises they made about how they were going to
govern that country and how they were going to treat their own people,
including women and girls.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Steven.     
   
Q    Follow?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Steven.   
   
Q    Yeah, thanks, John.  Just sort of distilling some of the questions
you’ve been asked about accountability — I appreciate the fact that
lessons have been learned, and I assume that the President still has
full confidence in his national security team that gave him the advice,
which is pointed out in this summary.   
   
Why should the American people have confidence in all of those national
security advisors, given what this report lays out?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President does have trust and confidence in his national
security team, and he did ask a lot of questions.  And there was some
assessments passed to him that — that proved faulty, that proved to be
wrong, that proved to not shake out the way he had been given to
understand that they would.  
   
But in the aggregate, as he looks across all the work that the national
security team continues to do, before and since the withdrawal from
Afghanistan, he has — continues to conclude that this is an
extraordinary — extraordinarily talented group of leaders.   
   
And as — as — you know, as I said in my opening statement, as painful at
times as the withdrawal was, it wasn’t without its moments of courage
and poise.  And it doesn’t mean that it wasn’t worth doing — ending that
war in Afghanistan.  
   
Because if you just take a look at — at what we’ve been able to do for
Ukraine and how we’ve been able to really step up in a competition
against China and deal with some of the tensions in the Indo-Pacific,
it’s difficult to say that we would have been able to do all that we did
over the last year or so without — if we were still dragged down on the
ground in Afghanistan.  
   
In fact, Putin and Xi probably would like nothing better than for us to
still be bogged down in a ground war in Afghanistan.   
   
Q    Can I just —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Andrew.  
   
Q    Sorry, if I could just follow up.  Kristen asked a question
earlier.  This report — this summary of your perspectives came out as
the President was on his way to the Camp David retreat for the Easter
weekend.  When should we anticipate an opportunity for the President to
stand for our questions about the findings in this document?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything on his schedule to speak to.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Andrew.  
   
Q    Thank you, John.  I have two questions.  One would be on a
different topic.  I’ll start with that one.  The President is leaving
for Northern Ireland fairly soon. 

MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.

Q    Are there any plans for him to meet with representatives of  Sinn
Féin and the DUP to try and resolve the impasse that’s kept a
functioning devolved government from being in place?

MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I tell you, we’re going to have — as Karine said at
the top, we’ll — we’ll have more to talk about in terms of the specific
agenda items on Monday before we leave. 

Q    Okay.  And on — on Afghanistan.  This document says there were —
there was no such plans for withdrawal in place when President Biden
came into office, no plans were shared during the transition.  Were
there any attempts to speak with former Trump officials about whether
there were plans?   
   
And does the lack of — of plans in place indicate that they deliberately
— they deliberately sabotaged the incoming administration by not
continuing to plan, dropping plans that were in place or they might have
been working on?  Or did — is there a possibility that they didn’t
intend on following through with the agreement that the former President
made to be out by May?

MR. KIRBY:  I can’t speak for leaders in the previous administration. 
And I — I certainly can’t speak for whatever plans they did or did not
draw up.   
   
I can tell you with confidence that the transition team of the incoming
administration asked repeatedly to see plans for withdrawal — for
retrograde, as we say it in the military — for the Special Immigrant
Visa Program; for the turnover of equipment and — and bases to the
Afghan National Security Defense Forces.  And as I said, in my opening
statement, none were forthcoming.  It wasn’t for lack of trying.  They
weren’t — they weren’t sharing. 

And so, one of the reasons why, to Kristen’s earlier question about the
length of time that it took to conduct a review, was because we were
almost starting from scratch.  There was no — there was no visibility
into what they had done. 

In fact, we spent quite a bit of time after coming into office — and I
remember this quite clearly — trying to get our hands around the Doha
Agreement and really understanding all its articles and what it meant
and how it was being interpreted by the Taliban. 

There’s just wasn’t any of that fingertip feel or gran- — or granular
awareness that we had.

Q    Can the administration —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead —  
   
Q    — the sitting administration can access documents from the prior
administration.  Was there any attempt to find out if — if they even
started to plan?  What — was there ever a plan?

MR. KIRBY:  There were multiple attempts to try to gain insight as to —
into what the previous — (a reporter sneezes) — bless you — what the
previous team had been doing.  And as I said earlier and as is indicated
in that document, none of those plans were forthcoming.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  It’s been about an hour, guys.  We’re
going to try to take a couple more.   
   
Go ahead, Janne.

Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Karine.  And thank you, John.  I have two
questions on South Korea and China.  At the summit meeting between
President Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol this month,
what agenda are you going to be discuss this meeting?

MR. KIRBY:  (Laughs.)  You’re way ahead of me today, Janne.  I — I don’t
have any agenda items to talk about today.  But certainly, in due
course, we will.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    I have a follow-up.  I have a China — please.  The U.S. — the U.S.
integrated country’s strategy includes a new policy towards China.  What
tools can the United States use for China to have — deter North Korea’s
missile and nuclear provocation?

MR. KIRBY:  We — we know that China has influence in Pyongyang, and we
have long urged them to use that influence to get Mr. — to get Mr. Kim
to do the right thing and to be willing to sit down with us, as we have
said we are, without preconditions to — to diplomatically try to deal
with a denuclearization of the Peninsula.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you, John, for spending a lot of time
answering our questions.  I have a question.  What message do you have
for the people around the world who don’t know which administration made
mistakes or failed but lost some confidence in the United States’
ability to deal with such difficult situations as in Afghanistan?

MR. KIRBY:  I would encourage them to look at what we have been able to
achieve in the two-plus years of this administration across the board.

And as I said, even in Afghanistan, because ending that war was the
right thing to do for this country and our national security interests. 
We are on a stronger strategic footing.  We are better able to deal with
the most pressing challenges of the day — which are not quite, by the
way, emanating out of Afghanistan — certainly not anymore — because we
are no longer in Afghanistan.

And take a look at the incredible leadership of the United States in
support for Ukraine.  Take a look at the NATO Alliance, which now just
got a new member.  Take a look at the strengthening of alliances and
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, the new AUKUS deal with Australia and
the UK and the ability for them to — Australians now to get a
nuclear-powered submarine.

I could go on and on and on. 

The President has prioritized alliances and partnerships, many of whom
were left — left in the wake of the previous administration and
denigrated.  We’re revitalizing them.  We’re bringing them back.  We’re
reinforcing them.  And America’s footing on the global stage is a lot
stronger now.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Ed, and then S.V.

Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Karine.  Thank you, John.  So, one on this
and one on China, if I could.  In looking through this, it doesn’t seem
to address the $7 billion in military hardware and technology that was
left in Afghanistan for the Taliban. 

You know, the President took office in January; the withdrawal happened
in August.  Does the President take responsibility for — for leaving all
or some of that?

MR. KIRBY:  You know who’s responsible for that equipment?  The
Afghans.  Because you know why?  It was their equipment.

First of all, I don’t believe the number is accurate, but let’s put the
number aside — the $7 million — $7 billion.  There was very little — and
I mean very little — U.S.-owned equipment or U.S.-operated equipment
that we left when we left Afghanistan. 

I’m talking, like, some forklifts at the airport and some ladder
vehicles, some fire trucks that we were using at the airport.  But — and
the helicopters that we left there — all disabled so the Taliban
couldn’t get them flying again.  Whatever ground vehicles, like MRAPs or
Humvees, they were all disabled at the airport. 

Everything else outside of that airport — the stuff that’s at Bagram —
or you pick the base in Afghanistan — was all turned over and according
with a very elaborate, deliberate retrograde plan that the U.S. military
put in place to turn over all that stuff to the Afghan military.   
   
And the Afghan military, as I said in my opening statement, decided they
weren’t going to fight for their country, that they were just going to
leave it behind. 

So, it is the Afghans who were responsible for the turnover of all that
equipment.  
Q    And on China, quickly.  So, you can run down the list of how China
is helping Russia.  Russia became China’s largest importer of oil at the
beginning of this year.  China has moved its credit card in to help
Russia transactions.  You know, China’s made a deal now with Saudi
Arabia for oil transactions.  They’re making a deal — they’re working
with Brazil to move off the U.S. dollar. 

You know, at what point does the President stand up and more loudly tell
China to, A, cut it out, or, B, counter some of China’s anti-U.S.
actions?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We know we’re in a strategic competition with China.  And we
have made it clear to Chinese officials that we don’t think this is a
time for anybody to be supporting — in one of the cases you had — Mr.
Putin’s ability to profit off of — off of oil on the market so that he
can continue to kill more Ukrainians.   
   
One of the reasons why the President sat down with President Xi in Bali
was to deliver some of those messages.  We — we believe it is a
competition, and we believe the United States is well poised to win that
competition.  We don’t see conflict with China, but we are not at all
unabashed — or we are — we are unabashed and unafraid to make it clear
to the Chinese that we’re going to do what we have to do to protect our
national security interests.  And again, this is no time to be in
partnership with Vladimir Putin.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, S.V.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks, Admiral.  Just wanted to clarify what David was
asking about.  After January 20th, 2021, there was no ability to find
plans for withdrawal — an orderly withdrawal.  Is that what I’m
inferring with what you said about the previous administration’s
plans?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, once you come in, you do the best you can to — because
now you own things, you can — you can look and see what — what was
done.  And you can study it.  
   
Q    Was there anything done after — not talking about the transition —
but after you came into office?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, look, one example I can give you for sure is that one
of the early trips of 2021 that Secretary Austin made was to Kabul, and
he sat down there with the ISAF Commander, General Miller.  And General
Miller walked him through some of the retrograde plans that he had
already formed up.  And — you know, and that — and that acted as a basis
for what we eventually executed on.  But it doesn’t mean that we didn’t
order or look for amendments and changes and that kind of thing.  That’s
one example.  I can’t speak about every agency and what plans they may
or may not have fallen in on.   
   
The problem is there was no visibility on that in the transition.  You
have a very brief period of time between election night and
inauguration.  And Afghanistan was one of the chief foreign policy
concerns the President had coming in.  And the team desperately wanted
to understand the Doha Agreement, wanted to talk to experts, wanted to
talk to planners, wanted to see what had been done, because the
President had already made a commitment that he wanted to end that war,
but he wanted to do it responsibly.   
   
We couldn’t find out exactly what the previous administration had done
on paper.  And that’s difficult.   
   
So you say, “Okay, well, on January 20th, it’s all available to you.” 
But he shouldn’t have had to wait until January 20th to get access to
that.  It would have been better — wouldn’t it? — I think for everybody
if we could come in, you know, with deck running there right on the —
right on the 20th.  
   
Q    On the — the former President has now been saying several times
that, number one, China is actually running Bagram now, and it was $85
billion in brand-new equipment — equipment better than we actually
have.  Can you address that please?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t get the last claim.  What?  
   
Q    I don’t get it either.  I’m just asking you —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t — I can’t — I can’t address — I don’t understand
it.  I don’t — look, I go — I’m going to go back to the answer before. 
It’s important because this is getting well misunderstood out there.   
   
There was a retrograde plan, working towards withdrawal, where bases
that we were operating out of and equipment that we had, that we believe
the Afghans could and should keep, were turned over to them in a very
thoughtful, orderly way — all the way from spring, well into summer.   
   
Once you turn it over — it’s just like what we’re doing in Ukraine.  We
give Ukraine artillery ammunition, Stinger anti-air missiles, Javelin
anti-tank.  It’s their stuff at that point, not the Americans’.  It’s
their stuff.  That stuff belonged to the Afghans.  And so this idea,
this argument is just ludicrous that we left millions of dollars of
stuff in Afghanistan.  We didn’t.  We turned it over, as the previous
administration would have done too, because part of their thinking was
they were going to have to turn this material over.  It was turned over
appropriately and carefully and deliberately with the Afghan National
Security Defense Forces.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Sabrina.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Just a couple quick questions on the Wall Street
Journal’s Evan Gershkovich.  Do you have any insight into why the
Russians are refusing him consular access?  And do you have any updates
on the efforts by the administration?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I wish we did.  I wish we did, Sabrina.  We still haven’t
been able to get consular access.  And that’s a — that’s an issue that
we continually bring up through our — our embassy in Moscow with the
Russians.   
   
I wish I had a good answer for that, because it’s inexcusable.  We need
to get consular access to Evan.  
   
Q    At what point with the administration explore a potential prisoner
swap with Russia?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t get ahead of where we are.  And I think you can
understand why we would certainly not want to talk about potential
negotiations here from the podium.  We’re at a very early stage here.   
   
Main goal is to get consular access to him so we can have that contact
and that connectivity — we’re — and doing what we can to keep him his
employer and the family informed.  Our focus is squarely on that right
now.  
   
Q    I have two, really quickly, on Afghanistan and then Israel.  When
did President Biden get the after-action report?  And has he read
through it in its entirety?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President has been fully briefed on both after-action
reports.  And he certainly has been briefed and — and had input on the
document that that you see before you today.   
   
So — and then, on the “when,” I would tell you that, to Ed’s question,
this is a process, and he has stayed in touch with the State Department
and the Defense Department as they have worked through their
after-action reviews.  
   
Q    And then, are their plans to release each of the department’s
reports to their respective workforces?  I mean, there’s people who
worked on this withdrawal who want to learn the findings.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  These are classified reports.  I do not anticipate any — any
release of them publicly or on a more broad fashion.  But that’s a
better question put to the agencies.  
   
Q    And then, on the situation in Israel, how concerned is the White
House that this could escalate into —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Very concerned.   
   
Q    — a greater situation and conflict?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, we’re very concerned about the violence there.  We see
now it increased; more attacks in the last 24 hours.  We’re deeply
concerned about that.  We call on all sides to de-escalate, reduce the
violence.  
   
Q    Thanks.  In February of 2022, the Pentagon — about the Pentagon —
pardon me, Abbey Gate bombing — gave a very detailed, minute-by-minute
account — very graphic nature of what happened.  Why not do something
more like that about this?  That was very public.  Why not give more
details about what had happened leading up to Afghanistan, as well as
the withdrawal, as well as all the chaos that happened?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  You’re talking about an event on a single day that the
military investigated and reviewed the investigation of.  And, yes, they
made — they made public not everything about that investigation but as
much as they possibly could.  That’s different than taking a look at a
withdrawal that took place over two weeks and involved multiple
agencies.   
   
And again, I remind you that these agencies voluntarily decided on their
own to do these after-action reviews with the President’s, of course,
full support, because he wanted to know as well.  And the result coming
back are sensitive classified documents.  And there’s no obligation to
even share those with members of Congress, but we’re doing that.  
   
Q    Jake Sullivan promised a “hotwash” — I think is the word he used to
describe what would come out of that.  That certainly sounded like a
very detailed accounting.  And you say this is not about
“accountability,” but how does the American people trust that the United
States has learned from the mistakes that were made if they do not see
those mistakes and see the administration acknowledging them, being
public with them, and how they’re going to address them?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think that’s what I’m doing today.  And I think that’s the
document you got in front of you.  I think it’s also — hang on a second
— it’s also the fact that those after-action reviews are on Capitol Hill
voluntarily so that relevant committees and relevant senior members of
Congress can look at them.  They are sensitive, and they are
classified.   
   
And we also have a responsibility to the American people to protect some
information so that it doesn’t get out there, so that we can continue to
apply some of those lessons in future operations.   
   
The last thing I’ll say to your question is: There’s an Afghan War
Commission that’s been legislated.  The President signed that
legislation.  It will look at the whole war, and that will have a very
public dimension to it.  And this administration and every agency in it
will actively and — and with — with appropriate energy participate in
that.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I know you said you’ll have more on the trip, but I had a
quick question.  We have a story out today that the UK is seeking to
restart trade talks with the U.S. — the Prime Minister, Sunak.  Does the
U.S. have any interest in restarting trade talks with the UK?  And will
President Biden meet with the Prime Minister when he’s in Northern
Ireland?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I haven’t seen that report, so I’d rather not comment on
that right now.   
   
But — and as for the agenda, I think you just got to give us until
Monday.  We’ll have much more detail on the agenda — who he’s meeting
with and under what context.  
   
Q    And the free trade —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  On Monday.  
   
Q    The free trade — the free trade question has been hanging in the
air for quite some time, including —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I understand.   
   
Q    — the previous premier.  Has the administration’s position
changed?  You all seem pretty cool to the idea.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  I understand.  I have nothing for you on that.  
   
Q    Great, thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Just a couple more.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Two questions on Ukraine.  Thank you, John.  According to the
Financial Times, a high-ranking advisor of President Zelenskyy signaled
that it might not be longer a precondition to get Crimea back to start
negotiations.  Is that a development the White House would applaud?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  First of all, I don’t know that the Zelenskyy administration
has spoken to that.  And we certainly wouldn’t get ahead of them.   
   
What I would tell you is — and we’ve said this from the very beginning —
that President Zelenskyy can determine if and when he’s ready to
negotiate and in what context and over what.

We believe that nothing should be negotiated about Ukraine without
Ukraine.  Nothing should be done or said or moved on without President
Zelenskyy’s full approval.  That’s where we are.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Aurelia.

Q    Thank you so much.  One on China, where tensions are firming up
again, especially around Taiwan, with warships being deployed, et
cetera.  Can you update us of what channels of communication are
currently open between the administration and China?  Is there a
functional military channel in case of tensions arising?  What’s the
state of communication between China and —

MR. KIRBY:  The lines of communication with China remain open.  We have
communicated to China privately — we’ve certainly done it publicly here
with you all — that there’s no reason for them to overreact to this
transit.  It’s not uncommon for these transits to happen.  They’re
private.  They’re unofficial.  We would urge China not to overreact.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Just two more.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, yeah.

Q    So, for — Biden ended the humanitarian parole for Afghans starting
in — after October 1st, and benefits end later this summer.  What’s
going to happen to them?

MR. KIRBY:  I think I’d have to — let me take that question and — but
I’ll also — while I do that, I’m going to refer you to the State
Department.  They’ll have more details on that.

Q    And a second question.  There were — there was reporting about
secret annexes to the agreement — the peace agreement that contributed
to the Afghan offenses in 2021.  Did the Biden administration review
those annexes?  What did they contain?

MR. KIRBY:  Well, once we — I’m not going to talk about what they con- —
contain, but —

Q    Will — will the administration release them?

MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to talk about things that are classified.  But
we had an opportunity, after coming into office, to review in more
detail the Doha Agreement and all the associated articles and pieces of
it. 

And I would just go back to what I said before, that I think it would be
difficult to overstate the impact of that Doha Agreement on the Afghans’
willingness to trust us, on their willingness to stay and fight for
their country, and on the general morale of the Afghan people once the
deal, you know, became publicly known.  It was a clear sign that America
was heading for the exits and doing so in a hurry, and it had a dramatic
effect on the Afghan National Security Forces.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    Thanks.  Thank you.  You said that this was just — on the
withdrawal, you said that this was just one step — this report — in
better understanding, better comprehending the withdrawal and the
adjustments made accordingly afterwards.  Are there any additional steps
that you guys are taking?  Is this the absolute final report?

MR. KIRBY:  No, there’s an Afghan War Commission.

Q    But in — in addition, or any additional final report aside from
this that — that we can expect to see?

MR. KIRBY:  These are the after-action reports of the agencies that were
most heavily involved in the withdrawal.  I know of no additional
after-action reviews that are being done or — or planned to being done. 

Again, they were fed into a larger administration process that the
National Security Council worked to sort of coalesce these lessons
learned, and the result of that extra work by the — by the interagency
is what you see before you today.

Q    And if I could ask just one more, on a separate matter.  State
Department Secretary Blinken said that he has “no doubt” that Evan
Gershkovich was wrongfully detained.  Related to that, Marc Fogel’s
sister told NewsHour last night that her family is angered by what they
consider, quote, “favoritism” by the administration.  Fogle’s sister
told us that the family has not heard from President Biden or Secretary
Blinken.  So, when will Fogel be designated as wrongfully detained?  And
are there any ongoing conversations (inaudible) —

MR. KIRBY:  I can’t speak to that from — the — from here.  The State
Department would have to deal with that.  They’re the ones that make
determinations about wrongful detention.  I would remind that each
determination is done on an individual case-by- — case-by-case basis.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  We got to wrap this up.  You, and then you
have a last question.

Go ahead.

Q    Thank you.  About the document.  Just to clarify, it says, and I
quote, “National security leaders met on August 9th and concluded
conditions on the ground did not — did not support triggering \[the
evacuation operation\].”  Then it says that on August 14th, President
Biden formally initiated this operation.  Can you explain to us what
happened between — between those two dates, in between those two
assessments?

MR. KIRBY:  Many things happen in that — you know, in that five days.  I
don’t have all my notes in front of me from then, but we continued to
see — particularly over that week — the Taliban achieving more and more
success in the hinterlands, particularly out west and to the north,
taking over district by district, province by province. 

And so, there was this sort of rolling momentum that they had.  And the
danger to Kabul got more acute over the course of that four or five
days. 

And — and, again, you know, as I said earlier, first of all,
noncombatant evacuations are some of the most difficult operations, and
choosing when you’re going to go there — and that’s — the State
Department gets to call that, but the military executes and leads it.   
   
And finding that exact moment to do it is — it can be difficult,
particularly when you’re dealing with a government who you obviously —
we wanted to see succeed, wanted to see stay in power.  And so, you got
to be careful about when you go ahead and call for a NEO so that you’re
not undermining the very outcome you’re trying to keep in persistence.  
Q    And one about China, if I may.  Recently, in a congressional
hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a congresswoman from
Florida said that countries in Latin America, such as Venezuela and
Bolivia, are allowing China to gain a foothold in the region.  So, how
would you characterize the Chinese presence in Latin America?  And how
big is it a security challenge for the United States?

MR. KIRBY:  Just in general, we see the Chinese continue to try to gain
influence in Latin America, but also in Africa.  And they do this in a
pretty ham-fisted way with — with high-interest loans that — that some
countries then end up can’t — you know, not being able to pay back and
then suffer the consequences to their own economic growth and
development for that. 

You know, we’re not asking countries to choose between the United States
and China, or the West and China.  But we do think it’s important for
them to understand that — in accepting Chinese help, that they are
potentially putting their own economic livelihoods at greater risk.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Last question.

Q    Yeah, John, the attack Al-Aqsa Mosque.  I mean, this is a holy time
for all Abrahamic faiths right now.  You say you’re concerned.  Is that
it?  I mean, this is — some of these people were worshiping, and some of
them were even sleeping when they were attacked.  Isn’t this time to
condemn?

MR. KIRBY:  We ha- —

Q    I mean, wh- —

MR. KIRBY:  We — we have —

Q    You said you were concerned, just now.

MR. KIRBY:  Well, yes, I said, we’re concerned.  But we have, in the
previous few days, condemned — used that verb, we have — condemned that
violence.  Of course we have. 

And you’re right, people should be able to — to worship freely and
safely, and we still stand by the status quo on the Temple Mount.  That
— that has not changed.  Our policies have not changed.  We urgently
urge bo- — all sides to reduce this violence —

Q    But is this an all-sides situation?  I mean, right now, this was
Israeli forces attacking Muslim worshippers during Ramadan.

MR. KIRBY:  We urge all sides to deescalate and to reduce the violence.

Q    But does that mean, then, that this is the White House taking sides
— the fact that you’re not willing to single out the Israeli forces —

MR. KIRBY:  The side we’re taking on —

Q    — attacking Muslim worshippers?

MR. KIRBY:  The side we’re taking on is — is safety and security.  The
side we’re taking on is the status quo.  The side that we’re taking is
one of peaceful worship.  That’s the side we’re taking.

Thanks, everybody.

Q    Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you so
much, Admiral.  It’s over an hour. 

Okay.  I guess if you guys still want to stick around, I’ll take a
couple more questions.  (Laughter.)  Or if not — if not, we can — we can
wrap this up right here, and I’ll see you guys on Monday.

Q    Okay.  We can take a couple from domestic issues.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Okay, go — Seung Min, just kick us off.

Q    I just have one.  There was a report —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Seung Min is like, “Yes, I have a question, so we can
take a couple questions.”  (Laughter.)

Q    Well, there’s a report in ProPublica this morning that talked about
Justice Clarence Thomas taking all of these luxury trips from a
Republican megadonor, appearing not to disclose those gifts as required
by law.  So, does the White House believe that this is a violation of
ethical standards that a Justice should be held to?  And does the
President want a more rigorous code of conduct for Supreme Court
Justices?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to comment from here.  There are other
bodies of government that should be dealing with this.  I’m just not
going to comment from here.

Q    Okay.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.   
   
All right, Peter.

Q    You got this Ireland trip next week.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  Oh boy.  (Laughter.)

Q    How does a Bi- —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The dramatics.  (Laughs.)

Q    How does a Biden trip to Ireland help counter China or end the war
in Ukraine?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just say a couple of things.   The
President is certainly looking forward to taking this trip to Northern
Ireland and also the UK, where he’ll be heading out on Tuesday.  We
certainly will have more to share on this trip coming — in the upcoming
days, as my colleague just said, on Monday.

But I — I also want to lay out here the important — kind of the
important history between U.S. and Ireland.  Right?  When you think
about the waves of Irish immigrants who helped — who helped shape
America’s spirit of freedom.  That’s incredibly important as well.  
   
And I think telling that story, the President going there and being able
to touch on his own — his own family story and the stories of many of
Americans here, Irish Americans here, as you think about how this
country was created and built and put together by immigrants — I think
that’s important.  I think that’s something that’s important to
highlight.  And the Pres- — the President is looking forward to that.  
   
Go ahead, Kristen.  
   
Q    Karine, any update on the debt limit talks?  Is there — are there
any plans underway — and I know we ask you this —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, I know.  
   
Q    — for President Biden to meet with or speak with Speaker
McCarthy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Honestly, when it comes to — to asking me about what
are the plans, I would ask Republicans in the House. It is — it is
their, you know, constitutional duty, as we have said over and over
again.   
   
In the last three times, in the last administration, Democrats met with
and joined Republicans to get this done, to get something that is so
critical to the American people, to taxpayers, to veterans, to
seniors.  
   
And so, that’s actually a question for House Republicans to answer.  
   
Q    But given that it’s so critical, Karine, why are you letting the
clock tick down and inch closer to this deadline?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait.  I want to be very clear: I — I definitely
disagree with — with the question, Kristen, here.   Because it is not
us; it is them.  The onus is on Congress to get this done.  This is
their responsibility, their constitutional responsibility to get this
done.  
   
Republicans in the House cannot and should not be holding, you know, our
nation’s debt hostage.  They should not be doing that.  We’ve been very,
very clear.  They did it three times — three times in the last
administration.  
   
Q   Can you guarantee that the U.S. won’t default?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — that is for House Republicans to answer.  That
truly is for them to — to deal with the situation that we have said —
again, it is their responsibility, their constitutional responsibility. 
I can’t say that enough.  
   
They — this should be done without negotiations.  This should be done
without conditions.  And it has been done many times before.  And — and
they should just take this seriously.  
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Karine, I know we all have to write stories, but I just want to ask
you — so many people in the country have been talking about it.  This
came up in yesterday’s briefing: LSU says that the team certainly will
come, but wanted to give you an opportunity to address some of the
emotions that have been aired by some of the players, in particular
Angel Reese.  And what she said this week is that if the shoe were on
the other foot, if Iowa had won, the First Lady wouldn’t have said,
“LSU, come.”  Can you respond to that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, first of all, as you know, the President put out
— put out a statement days ago saying how he and the First Lady are
welcome and looking forward to celebrating — to celebrating LSU Tigers
and the University of Connecticut — clearly, the men’s team, the
Huskies.  And that is something that is tradition here, continuing that
tradition from here in celebrating the champions.  And that is something
that both of them are looking forward to.  
   
Look, the First Lady was honored to attend the championship game.  As we
know, it was a historic game; 9.9 million people watched that game.  It
was the LSU Tigers — that win was historic.  It set a record.  And we
could not be more proud of them.  Again, a great game and a wonderful
moment for women’s sports in history, something both the First Lady and,
as you know, the President have talked about.  They feel very passionate
about that.  And it was truly a remarkable and important moment.  And,
again, the First Lady was honored to be part of that.  
   
And so, I will say, as I’ve said yesterday and I’ll say again, she and
the President are truly looking forward to welcoming LSU — LSU Tigers
here to celebrate them, to celebrate them as champion- — champions, to
celebrate their history victory.  And — and we’re looking forward to
welcoming them.  And so I’ll just leave it there.  
   
Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    Just on the debt ceiling issue, there’s a plan reportedly coming
together with the Problem Solvers Caucus on some sort of strategy to
raise the debt ceiling.  Is White House involved in those talks at all? 
And are you open to those sorts of plans?  Or do you need a budget from
McCarthy’s office and Republicans (inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we haven’t — so, I’ll touch on — on both. 
Look, we haven’t spoken to the Problem Solvers about that.  We’ve made
our position very clear.  You heard me go back and forth with Kristen
here.  The debt ceiling and our economy should not be held hostage. 
We’ve been very clear about that.  Republican threats of chaos and
catastrophic potential outcome — that’s not going to work.  That is not
what should — that is not what they should be doing as their
constitutional duty.  So, we’ve been very clear on that.  
   
As far as the budget, the President put out his budget on March 9th.  We
have been very clear about that.  If he — they want to have a
conversation about the budget, if they want to show the American people
what they value, what they think their fiscal responsibility is, we’re
happy to have that conversation.  We’re happy to have — to sit down —
the President would love to sit down and negotiate and talk through
that.  But we haven’t — they haven’t been able to do that.  All they do
is present, you know, excuses.  That’s what we been seeing.  
   
So, the budget: We’ll have a negotiation on that if they present
something.  They haven’t done that yet.   
   
The debt ceiling: It should be done without negotiation.  It should be
done without conditions.  
   
Q    And very quickly, on our favorite topic, the Fed vice chair
(inaudible).  Very interested.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Bloomberg caring about the vice chair — the Fed and
the vice chair.  I just — surprising to me.  
   
Q    Today is six weeks since you said it would be announced in the near
future.  What changed?  Or what’s the status?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It — it is definitely a priority for the President.  I
— I know — I — we understand how important this is, clearly.  And so,
once we have a decision that is made by the President, certainly we will
be sharing that.  I just don’t have anything to share at this time.  
   
Q    Do you have any message to Senator Menendez, who’s called for a
Latino candidate to be nominated?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have — I don’t have a message.  We are going
to follow the process that we always do when we — when we nominate
critical candidates, important candidates.  We do this in a way that —
clearly looking at qualified, diverse candidates.  But I’m just not
going to get into specifics on — on his particular question or — or ask,
I should say.  
   
All right, Nandita.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I — I know you don’t want to comment on the
Clarence Thomas report specifically.  But broadly, do you think the
White House — broadly, do you think the Supreme Court, my bad, needs to
impose ethics rules that lower federal courts are subjected to?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s something for the Supreme Court to speak to. 
I’m just not going to comment on this at this time.  
   
Q    Do you think Congress needs to act?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That — that is something for Congress to — to
discuss.  I’m just not going to comment on this at this time.  
   
All right, I’ll take — I’ll take one more, then I’m calling it.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you so much.   So, we’ve just seen the accession of
Sweden and Finland to NATO.  We’re three months away from the NATO
Leaders Summit in July.  President Zelenskyy and some Eastern member
states — Eastern member states are — would like to see Ukraine presented
with a path to citizenship to NATO membership.  Is the U.S. — is
President Biden opposed to that idea?  And what causes the
administration’s hesitation?   Is it — if there — if that exists, is it
a fear of provoking Russia?  Or is it apprehension that U.S. troops
would have to deploy if Ukraine joins — joins NATO before Russia
leaves?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’ve — we’ve spoken to this a couple of times. 
Look, the — our position is pretty clear when it — when it comes to a
NATO accession.  And, you know, for decades, we support an open-door
policy for NATO.  Any decision on membership is between NATO Allies and
countries aspiring to join NATO.   
   
And, right now, we’re — we’re focused on supporting Ukraine’s efforts
and we’re focusing on making sure that the Ukrainian people have what
they need to fight for their freedom.  
   
And so, you’ve seen us do that.  You’ve seen us announce security
assistance for Ukraine this past year.  We have been leading in that
effort.  We have been also really holding NATO together — holding the
West, making sure that they are aligned. And you’ve seen that throughout
— throughout this year.   
   
And so, we’re going to continue to make sure that they have the economic
and security assistance needed to fight a very — to fight — continue to
fight bravely this — this aggression from Russia that we have seen for
over a year now.  
   
But again, this is something for — between NATO Allies and NATO
countries to decide.  
   
Q    But the U.S. is a NATO Ally and has been the leader in those
efforts for Ukraine and uniting the world.  They have a lot of say over
whether Ukraine will be presented with this path to possible
membership.  What is the U.S.’s position on it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, been very clear for decades.  For decades, we
have been pretty consistent on this.  We support an open-door policy for
NATO.  And I’m just going leave it there.  It’s been — it’s been like
this for decades now.  
   
All right.  Okay, I’m getting — I’m getting the — the pull here.  All
right.  I’ll see you guys on Monday.  Have a great weekend and happy
Easter.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.
