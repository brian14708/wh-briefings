Aboard Air Force One  
En Route El Paso, Texas

1:29 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Okay.  So, as you know, today we’re headed to El
Paso, Texas.  I’ve got Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas
right here next to me, and I’ll turn it over to him shortly to provide
more detail about the trip and take your questions.   
   
But let me give you a little bit at the top.  So, I can walk you through
the President’s schedule today.  While in El Paso, the President will
assess enforcement operations at the Bridge of the Americas Port of
Entry, which is the busiest port in El Paso.  
   
The port recently received $600 million through the President’s
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to harden and expand the port to better
facilitate trade, increase trade, increase security, and improve
processing.   
   
Following the port visit, President Biden will visit a federal —
federally funded migrant services center.  He will meet with local
officials, faith leaders, and NGOs who have been critical to supporting
migrants fleeing political oppression and economic collapse in their
home countries.   
   
The President will also hear from local business leaders about the
critical economic impact immigrants have on this region to address the
workforce shortages.  
   
One last piece here, if I could get to it: So, throughout the day, the
President will be joined by federal, state, and local officials and
community leaders, including Customs and Bor- — and Border Protection
officers, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, Congressman Henry Cuellar,
Congressman Vicente González, and El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to Secretary Mayorkas to talk a bit — a bit
more about the El Paso community and how it’s served as a model of
federal and loc- — a model of federal and local officials working
together to solve tough challenges, and the resources his team has been
surging into the region.  
   
Go ahead, Secretary.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Thanks so much.  So, the President is stopping at
El Paso on the way to Mexico City for the North American Leader’s
Summit.  And El Paso is a place where, of course, we’ve seen an acute
challenge — most significantly in December.  And he’ll also have a
chance to see the work of the Border Patrol agents and field — the
Office of Field Operations in Customs and Border Protection.  
   
We have surged resources in response to the challenge in El Paso.  We
surged 100 Border Patrol agents.  We are, I believe on Tuesday, going to
be opening up a new soft-sided facility that will be able to process up
to 1,000 migrants a day.  The central processing center that we have
there has a capacity of 1,700.   
   
We have worked very closely — (the Secretary accidentally bumps into a
microphone) — my apology.  We’ve worked very closely with Mayor Leeser
of the city as well as Judge Samaniego of the county.   
   
We have surged emergency food and shelter program funding to them.  We
have also given them an extension on the expenditure — the funding
already provided — given the challenges they have faced.   
   
We’ve worked with the Red Cross — for the Red Cross to surge resources
for individuals who have been on the street.  The Red Cross has been
very responsive.   
   
So, it’s a model not only of the public-private partnership, but also
the federal government with the local officials.   
   
So, I really want to open it up to your questions, whatever you might
have.   
   
Q    Secretary — thanks, Karine.  Secretary, can I ask about the asylum
procedures?  If the idea is that migrants are going to have to ask for
asylum in the country where they first arrive ahead of the U.S., are
there, you know, talks right now to help most bolster Mexico’s asylum —
asylum systems or even possibly Guatemala’s asylum systems?  How is it
going to work?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, let me take a step back.  I think you’re
referring to the announcement that we made on Thursday — and,
specifically, the use of the CBP One application, which is to identify a
pre-designated date and time at which an individual can arrive at a port
of entry to make the claim of asylum.   
   
So — and, yes, we are working with our regional partners to ensure that
they’re building up their humanitarian relief capabilities as well.   
   
Q    So, the idea is not that they’ll have to ask for asylum in Mexico,
but rather they’ll have to use the app to ask for asylum in the U.S. and
then stay until they’re —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  What we’re trying to do is — and more broadly —
incentivize a safe and orderly way and cut out the smuggling
organizations.   
   
So, what we’re trying to have them do is incentivize them to come to the
ports of entry, instead of in between the ports of entry.   
   
The CBP One application was first really developed in response to the
squalid conditions in which migrants found themselves at the beginning
of the administration in Camp Matamoros.   
   
So, what we did there is we worked with the nonprofit organizations, the
international organizations.  So, once they had their appointment, we
brought them safely to a port of entry, and we’re working with our
regional partners to develop that same capability.  
   
Q    But, Ali, the — Mr. Secretary, the —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  (Inaudible.)  
   
Q    — the proposed rule that you guys say you want to pursue would, in
fact, largely — I mean, according to the advocacy community — would deny
migrants the opportunity to — the serious opportunity to apply for
asylum and be considered on its merits in the United States if they have
crossed through Mexico and not applied for asylum in Mexico first.   
   
And they say that is a real reduction in what is international human
rights law around the world that you guys want to take away.  That’s
what they say.   
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, Michel, understood.  So, and I — and I’ve seen
the criticism of “It is a ban.”  But it is not a ban at all, and it is
markedly different than what the Trump administration proposed.  What we
are trying to do is draw people in a safe and orderly way, which is not
the case now.   
   
I get it.  I’ve seen firsthand what trauma is inflicted on migrants who
actually use the smuggling organizations, so — trauma or tragedy.   
   
So, what we’re trying to do is incentivize individuals through the CBP
One application to make an appointment and to come at the port of entry
to cut out the smuggling organizations.  
   
If they do not — and by the way, the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will
have humanitarians exception — humanitarian exceptions — hypothetically,
because we’re still working out the details.   
   
But it’s — if someone is in imminent threat of harm; if someone doesn’t
have the capacity, for example, to use CBP One app — although I think
you know that most migrants do indeed have cellphones, but there may be
literacy challenges; or whatever — whatever the humanitarian reasons
might be.   
   
But that — what we’re trying to do is have them use this app, come to a
port of entry in a safe and orderly way, and make their claim.   
   
If they do not use that application, then they will need to have applied
for humanitarian relief in one of the countries through which they have
traveled.  If they don’t use the application to — they will have had to
apply for humanitarian relief in one of the countries through which they
have traveled.  And if they were denied, then — then they are not
subject to — not a ban, but a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility. 
And there’s a marked difference between the two.  
   
Q    Can I ask about the visit today?  How closely will President Biden
actually see some of the crowding that’s taking place in El Paso?  Will
he see any people on the streets in the downtown area?  And will he be
able to actually speak to any of the migrants who have crossed?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, I’m — forgive me, I’m not that close to what
exactly the — the details of the trip are.  I know he’s going to see, as
Karine mentioned, the port of entry, which I think is the second-busiest
port along the border both with respect to commercial traffic and
passenger traffic.  But I don’t know the details of the itinerary.   
   
I should say that the number of individuals encountered at the border
has dropped precipitously.  
   
Q    Since the new rules?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  No, no, no, that — because I wouldn’t want to
create a misimpression that the results are realized that quickly.  But
since the peak in December of 2,000 a day, it’s now — I believe the most
recent figure was 700.  
   
Q    Can you speak to — Republicans seem hellbent on perhaps impeaching
you.  How is your office preparing for a Republican Congress
oversight?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  (Inaudible) doing the work that we need to get
done.  
   
Q    I have a question about the parole program that was announced on
Thursday.  Some of the advocates have looked at this program that
requires people to be in their home country, have a U.S. sponsor, and
fly themselves to the United States as a wealth test.  What’s your
response to that?  Is this a wealth test —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  No.  It’s a —  
   
Q    — so that only people with means would be able to apply for this
program?   
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, Brian, the migrants who reach the border in
between the ports of entry on — the vast majority, if not more than
that, are using smuggling organizations to get there.  And the average
cost is $6,000.   
   
And so, it is not a wealth test.  What we’re trying to do is spare
individuals of placing their life savings in the hands of smuggling
organizations, as well as their lives.  So, we do not find it to be a
barrier.   
   
And quite frankly, with respect to the Venezuela program, the level of
applications was rocket speed throughout the duration of it, which is
why we’re lifting the 24,000 limit.  And we’ve already had hundreds of
applications since we opened up the process for the Cubans, Nicaraguans,
Haitians, and now for the Venezuelans as well.   
   
Q    Mr. Secretary, why is the — why is the President going now, two
years into this administration and on the eve of a — of a summit with
two other nations where this could threaten to overshadow it?  And how
does the Mexican government feel about these changes?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, the President is on his way to Mexico City for
the North American Leader’s Summit.  He made a decision to see what the
challenges are and how we’ve responded to those challenges in El Paso.  
   
I have been down to the border now, certainly, more than a dozen times. 
I don’t know if it’s 15, 17, or what have you, and, certainly, have
reported back to him with respect to what I have seen and what — how we
are responding to what I have seen.   
   
Q    What do you think the President will learn by going to the border? 
And how do you think that will influence his — his conversations with
the Mexican leader?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  I will tell you one thing that I think he’s going
to see firsthand is the incredible work of U.S. Customs and Border
Protection — both the Border Patrol agents, the Field Office personnel,
as well as the support that others provide to them.  I really am very
eager for him to see the extraordinary work that they perform every
day.  
   
Q    This country has a labor shortage right now.  I wonder what impact
at all, if any, did it have on the announcement last Thursday?  In other
words, are these numbers higher than they would have been if you take
into account the fact that this country needs workers?   
   
And what is the overlay?  What is your message to the American public
about the impact of a labor shortage in America on the immigration
policy at the southwest border?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, the — the labor shortage in the United States
is one powerful example of how desperately we need to fix our broken
immigration system.   
   
You know, we look to the north.  And Canada — and Canada realized that
it has a 1-million-person labor shortage there, and they are bringing in
approximately 1.4 million migrants this year to address that labor
shortage.   
   
Our programs — our H-2A, our H-2B, our skilled worker programs are far
outdated to re- — to really meet the economic needs as well as the
economic opportunities that immigration can provide.   
   
Q    You can’t really fix them without Congress.  Is that fair?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  That is correct.  We — on the very first day in
office, the President sent over a bill to Congress to fix the system. 
And, of course, Congress has yet to act.   
   
Q    You mentioned the Canadians, sir.  Very briefly, Prime Minister
Trudeau has raised the issue over the NEXUS programming.  He wants to
discuss that with President Biden.  Is there any response you have to
the Canadians on that?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, I’ve been working very closely with my
counterpart, Minister Mendicino of Canada.  I’m hopeful that we’ll have
a readout to provide with respect to the success that we’ve achieved on
the development of the NEXUS program.   
   
And just for everybody’s visibility, the NEXUS program is one of the
facilitators of — of travel between our two countries.  
   
Q    Is it possible — so the four nationalities that were chosen, that
were decided with the asylum — or the border policy rules that — this
past week — are the four nationalities where you are seeing, like, a
large increase in border crossings?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, it’s a — it’s a combination of things.  Number
one, it’s responsive to the demographics that we’ve seen at the border. 
The three top nationalities, other than Mexico —  
   
Q    Right.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  — single adults from Mexico — have been, in fact,
Cubans, Venezuelans, and Nicaraguans.   
   
It’s been responsive to the demographics, as well as to the conditions
in those countries, the authoritarian regimes.  And I don’t need to
speak too much about the conditions in Haiti; I think you’re all aware
of them.  So, it’s a combination of factors.   
   
Q    And is it possible that those nationalities could change or —
depending on what it looks like in the future?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, we don’t have anything new to announce now, but
we’re hopeful these — this policy works, as it has tremendously with
respect to Venezuelans.  We went from over 1,100 encounters per day of
Venezuelans to below 100.   
   
Q    Can you talk about the security situation in Mexico and how some of
the Mexican government’s actions, like the arrest of El Chapo’s son, is
affecting migration and how you feel about those developments?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  I’m not in a position to speak to a correlation
between migration from Mexico and the action with respect to the son.  I
think it’s a little too early to draw conclusions there.  
   
Q    Mr. Secretary, can I ask you about the issue of where — how
satisfied you are with Mexico’s willingness to take migrants back?  The
30,000 that you announced as part of the expanded Title 42 return
program is dwarfed by the number of people that are actually coming.  I
think in November alone, there were like 90,000 people from those four
countries alone.  
   
Mexico said they’re putting a cap of 30,000 a month.  Is that enough? 
Are you satisfied that they’re willing to — to do what needs to be
done?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  So, Michael, you know, Mexico made its independent
decision with respect to the number of individuals it would accept on a
monthly — on a monthly basis.   
   
We’ve been very pleased and very grateful for the partnership that we’ve
had on addressing the migration challenge that, as I’ve said publicly a
number of times, is not unique to the southern border of the United
States, nor unique to the southern border of Mexico.  It’s something
that is gripping the entire (inaudible).   
   
You know, we’re — we’re seeing seven- — well, between 5- and 700
Ecuadorians a day at our border.  I was in — Colombia is housing 2.4
million Venezuelans.  I was in Costa Rica, and I believe the population
of Costa Rica now might have just exceeded 5 percent — composed of
Nicaraguans.  It’s really remarkable the number of — the level of
displacement throughout the hemisphere, which is reflective of the level
of displacement around the world.   
   
Q    For the sake of argument, would your preference be, if the funding
system was in place, to welcome more migrants than you are now?  Is it
just a resources issue?  Or do you think that the very notion of people
being able to cross unfettered is objectionable?  
   
In other words, what — why not throw the doors open?  Is it a resource
issue or is it a policy issue?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Let me — let me break this down.  First of all,
there’s legal immigration, right?  There’s — the three goals of our
immigration system are economic prosperity, and there we need to fix our
system; humanitarian relief, and there we need to fix our system; and
the third is family reunification, and we have very limited avenues for
that.  
   
We’re just dealing with a broken system.  We are, in each of those
areas, doing whatever we can.   
   
To give an example, we’ve maximized our use of the H-2B visa program,
and we actually accelerated its openness with unprecedented speed.  
   
In the area of humanitarian relief, one of the announcements on Thursday
was to process 20,000 refugees in the Western Hemisphere in Fiscal Year
‘23 and Fiscal Year ‘24.  That is an unprecedented number.   
   
With respect to family reunification, we’re rebuilding the Haitian
Family Reunification Program.  We’ve recommenced the Cuban Family
Reunification Program.  We’re working with the migration accords that
are restarting.   
   
So, we’re working in all different avenues.  But fundamentally, we have
to fix the system.  
   
Q    But, philosophically, if there was ample funding and if there was
immigration reform — I realize neither of that is the case — does this
administration think that there should be caps consistent with what they
are now on these — on those three buckets you mentioned?  Or if you had
money and a better system, would you think that America should be
bringing in more people?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  One of our proudest traditions is to provide
humanitarian relief for people (inaudible) persecution by reason of
their membership in a particular social group.  That is one of our
proudest traditions, and there is not a cap on the claim of asylum in
the United States.  And this President has increased the number of
individuals eligible for refugee.  
   
In the area of economic migration, our system is not calibrated, as I
mentioned earlier, to meet our needs, nor meet the opportunities that
migrants can bring to the United States.   
   
Q    How does the President think about striking the balance between
establishing a deterrence and humanitarian relief?   
   
Was Thursday’s announcement, where you announced a (inaudible) for
30,000 people as well as turning 30,000 people back into Mexico each
month — is that an example of the President trying to strike a balance
between humanitarian assistance and deterrence?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  The President agreed to a 30,000-per-month parole
program as a very important step in bringing people in a safe and
orderly way.   
   
Mexico made an independent decision with respect to its capability and
its policy approach to how many people it would receive back.  Those two
are actually independent of one another.   
   
Q    Is it coincidence that the numbers are the same: 30,000?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  What’s that?   
   
Q    Was it coincidence?

SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  (Inaudible) how, you know, the decision was
sequenced between the two countries.   
   
Q    Was the President’s number — was that a suggestion of staff, or did
he raise the number or lower the number?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We discussed it in a deliberative approach, but,
you know, these decisions were made in a cohesive way as a team.  This
administration works as a team.   
   
Thanks.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.   
   
I just want to say a couple of things, as the Secretary was saying. 
Look, the President is going to visit the busiest port in El Paso.  And
so, just wanted to make that clear.   
   
And — and, you know, he’ll also be visiting the migrant center, as I
said at the top.  But also want to say about — the El Paso community has
long welcomed migrants seeking asylum under Republican and Democrats’
administration alike.   
   
And so, what the President is going to do — as I said at the top and as
the Secretary was going — was saying as well — he’s going to assess
border enforcement operations there firsthand.  He’ll meet with elected
officials as well and local officials who have been critical partners in
this.   
   
And so, just want to reiterate that because I know a question was asked
about what — what he’s going to do.  
   
Q    Is he going to speak with some migrants at the — at the at the
migrant center?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, he’s going to visit the migrant center.  You
all will — you all are going to be — be there throughout the day, and so
you’ll see for himself — for yourselves.  
   
But he is going to go to a migrant center.  He is going to talk to the
Customs and Border Patrol officials and other local officials, who have
been great partners in this.   
   
And so, again, you all are going to be joining us, and you all will see
for yourselves.  
   
Q    Just a logistics question for us.  In Abdullah’s note last night,
he said the President will be once again calling on Republicans to — you
know, whatever he — he said a bunch of things that the President was
going to do.   
   
There’s no- — on the schedule, there’s nothing that suggests any
remarks.  So, are we — are we — he’s not going to be doing those things
that Abdullah said in the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.  No.  
   
Q    Okay.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, he won’t be giving remarks.  I mean, but, look,
I’ve said it, the President has said it — he said it most recently on
Thursday: asking Congress to take action.  And, you know —  
   
Q    But it wasn’t a substantive thing.  It was just a, I mean —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, I — it’s a logistical.  Totally got it.  
   
Q    Logistical, like should we be anticipating some sort of —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, that’s right.   
   
And then, just one thing, because you — he was talking — the Secretary
was talking about the stats in El Paso, so just want to give you a
little bit of an update there.   
   
The number of people attempting to cross the border unlawfully in El
Paso is now down by over 70 percent, and that has been since
mid-December, while our unprecedented effort operations continue to
result in record fentanyl seizures.   
   
But since the President launched the Venezuela parole process, the
average daily number of Venezuelan nationals encountered at the border
in El Paso alone is now a quarter of what it was prior to the launch.   
   
So, again, the President’s border enforcement measures are working.  But
again, this — these are steps that he — the President is able to take. 
He’s taking this, clearly, very seriously.   
   
But again, we’re going to continue to ask for Congress to act.  That’s
the way that we’re going to fix this broken system.   
   
Just wanted to touch on those two things.   
   
Q    The President spoke to the — this — the new Speaker yesterday.  Can
you put some context there?  How long did the conversation take place? 
What was the tone of that conversation?  And what was the President’s
message?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I — I’m not going to go into details of a
private conversation.  As you know, the President publicly and the First
Lady publicly congratulated Speaker McCarthy as soon as he was elected
yesterday.  As we — as you saw from our note, the President spoke to
Speaker McCarthy on the phone to congratulate him directly.   
   
But, look, there’s nothing new.  The President has been very consistent
and very precise about how he sees us moving forward in 20- — in 2023
and beyond.  He wants us to work — you know, to work with — he wants to
work with Republicans in good faith to continue to deliver for the
American people.  And he is out — he’s going to outreach his hand to do
just that.   
   
And let’s be very clear here.  Let’s not forget: In November, that’s
what they said.  That’s what the American public said.  They want to see
us working together to continue to deliver and build upon the
President’s economic policy.  
   
Go ahead, Colleen.  
   
Q    Is the President concerned at all about McCarthy’s latest
concessions with — to the conservatives on the budget and debt limit?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll start with the first.  Look, again, the
American people were very clear: They want us to — they want us to
govern.  They want to see us continue to deliver for the American
people.  And that’s what the — that’s what the President is calling
for.  That’s not going to change.  And we’re going to continue to do
that and call for that.  
   
As it relates to the debt limit — the debt ceiling, look, we want to be
very clear.  I’ve been very clear on this.  Congress is going to need to
raise the debt limit without — without conditions.  And it’s that — it’s
just that simple.   
   
Attempts to exploit the debt ceiling — ceiling as leverage will not
work.  There will be no hostage-taking.  The full faith and credit of
our country is too im- — is too important to allow any of that, because
to default would be to force extraordinary costs on the American economy
and American families.   
   
Let me just give you one stat that we saw from — from a study that we
saw from Moody’s that found a default would wipe out nearly 6 million
jobs and spike unemployment.   
   
So, this is Congress’s basic responsibility.  And again, they should be
doing this without conditions.   
   
Q    Would the President consider any extraordinary executive action —
minting the coin, for instance — were it to be, you know — were Congress
not to raise the limit?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we are not considering I can tell you, Josh —
we’re not considering any measures that would go around Congress. 
That’s not what we’re doing.   
   
This is a fundamental congressional responsibility, and Congress must
act.  Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have repeatedly raised
the debt ceiling, including three times under the last President, as
you’ve heard me say many times before.  And we see — and we believe they
need to do that again.  
   
Q    Did you — did it come up in the call on Saturday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any — I don’t have any specifics to read
out on the call.   
   
Again, the President reached out directly to Speaker McCarthy to
congratulate him on his win.  Again, he is looking forward to working
with him in good faith to deliver for the American people.  That’s —
that’s the message that we have.  
   
Q    Did the President or the White House invite Governor Abbott to
participate in any of today’s events?  And if not, why aren’t there any
Republicans on the plane today if this is an issue that will have to be
resolved in a bipartisan way?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, to your first question, Governor Abbott was
invited to meet with President when he arrived, and our understanding is
that he will be there.   
   
And so, look, we — what we do — and we talk about this all the time —
when the President goes to — goes to a state, we send out invites and we
reach out to the various offices to let them know that we’re coming and
to also invite them.  
   
Again, we understand that Governor Abbott will be there when we
arrive.  
   
Q    Will — you said “will be there”?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We understand that he will.  That’s what we
understand.  Right?   
   
And so, we — again, you saw the President with Governor Abbott when we
came down for Uvalde, and it was the same process in how we invited
people with — with the President and the First Lady for that horrific
day.   
   
And so, we’re — we did the same again.  It’s the same process that we
have in any state that the President visits.  There’s nothing different
here.   
   
Thank you, guys.  See you on the ground.   
   
Q    Hey Karine, are we going to hear from Jake today?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I don’t believe so.  I don’t believe so.  
   
Q    Can we make that happen?  He’s on the plane.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I can ask him.  He’s very busy.   
   
Q    Is there anything you want to say about — ahead of the bilat
tomorrow if we don’t talk to you before then?  What he — what he wants
to get from the meeting?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean, what I can say is that — all right, let me
give you a little bit of what we have.  
   
Q    Because the AMLO bilat is tomorrow.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, we’re — we are going to have a — the
President is going to have a bilat with both of — with both the
President of Mexico and also with Prime Minister Trudeau while he’s in
Mexico.  I don’t have — I don’t have the exact specifics on when that’s
going to happen.   
   
But, look, the — President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, and President
López Obrador — what we expect coming out of this — our deliverables
here is to promote a common vision for North America.   
   
And with this visit, President Biden will follow up on last year’s
robust announcements with new initiatives and announcements across a
broad range of issues.   
   
These include deepening and expanding our security cooperation to combat
arms, drug, and human trafficking; redoubling efforts to address climate
and environmental challenges; and taking additional steps to jointly
address irregular migration in the region, including through the
continued implementation of the principles outlined in the Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and Protection.   
   
So, we’ll have a full list of all of the announcements coming — that we
foresee coming out of this this trilateral summit as we’re headed to —
after Texas and Mexico City.   
   
But again, to your answer, he will have a bilat with both the Prime
Minister of Canada and also with the President of Mexico.  
   
Thanks, everybody.
