10:57 A.M. EST  
   
MS. DALTON:  All right.  So, as you know, we are on our way to New York
City, where President Biden will announce a major investment in one of
the largest infrastructure projects in the country.   
   
In New York, the President will be joined by New York Governor Kathy
Hochul, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Leader Schumer, Senator
Gillibrand, Senator Booker, Senator Menendez, Mayor Adams, and Secretary
of Transportation Buttigieg, as well as White House Senior Advisor and
Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu, who’s here
with me this morning.  
   
In addition to the Hudson Tunnel Project commitment, the President will
announce that the administration has awarded nearly $1.2 billion from
the Infrastructure Law’s new National Infrastructure Project Assistance
discretionary grant program for nine major projects across the
country.  
   
As evidenced by today’s trip to New York, yesterday’s visit to
Baltimore, and Friday’s travel to Philadelphia, the Biden-Harris
administration continues to focus on implementing the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and delivering real results for the American
people.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over you.  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  Thank you so much.  It’s great to be with you guys.  
   
As you know, $1.2 trillion to rebuild the country and build a better
America: roads, bridges, airports, ports, waterways, clean air, clean
water, high-speed Internet, and an entire clean energy economy.  We have
$185 billion out of the door.  
   
Last year, we had 7,000 projects that are in some level of formation. 
And this year, we expect to have 20,000 more by the end of the year.   
   
We started off this year with a bang.  As many of you know, y’all were
with us when we announced the big bridge program about four weeks ago,
where the President went to the Brent Spence Bridge with Leader
McConnell and talked about bipartisanship and trying to figure out how
to get it done.  
   
And this year is all about implementation and execution.   
   
On that day, you may recall that the Vice President was in Chicago, on
the South Side.  The Secretary was in Connecticut announcing a program. 
And, of course — not that day, but a few days later — both the Secretary
and I went to the Golden Gate Bridge to talk about a $400 million
investment to fortify that bridge in the event that they would suffer
from another earthquake — essentially, to put brake pads on it and to
make it more resilient to make sure that that bridge is in place.  
   
Today, actually, we’re making another major announcement of nine Mega
projects across the country that are in your briefing.  But the biggest
of which, of course, is the Hudson Tunnel Project that we’re talking
about today, for the casing on the end of it.

As you guys know, yesterday, the President was in Baltimore announcing
another portion of this, because this is also part of the Northeast
Corridor and high-speed rail, which is critically important to getting
people out of cars onto rail, actually making it more safe, making it
more climate friendly, and then, of course, providing thousands of jobs.

So this particular project today that we’re talking about — I want to
show you this.  This is Manhattan.  This is New Jersey.  This is the
Hudson Tunnel.

As you can see, this is part of a much larger — it’s the biggest
infrastructure investment program in the country.  This is part of the
Gateway Program.  And there are a bunch of different projects that are
part of that.

This particular portion today is right here at the Hudson Yards, which
is the entrance of the tunnel, which is the first critical step to
making sure that all of this is done.

Two of these other projects are (inaudible) funded in the Northeast
Corridor, and the President was, last year, in New Jersey at the North
Portal Bridge.

So, this is a really critical part.  It’s $293 million of a $600 million
program that’s just the first part of a much larger $16 billion program
for the Hudson Tunnel that the federal government is a major part of.

Today, also, we’re announcing that we have investments not only in the
Brent Spence Bridge — so they got a part of the big bridge program, and
they got part of the Mega program.  Because, as you guys said, we pushed
a lot of these programs together.

They’re also announcing funding for the I-10 Calcasieu River Bridge,
$150 million; the Metra UP-North line in Chicago, Illinois; the
Alligator River Bridge in North Carolina; the I-45 and U.S.-75 corridor
in Tulsa, Oklahoma; the Roosevelt Boulevard multimodal bridge in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; I-10 freight corridor — $60 million in
Mississippi; and the Watsonville-Cruz Multimodal Corridor in California.

This is $1.2 billion for nine projects.  So, when you put all of these
things together, you start to see now the country taking formation in
how this money is getting out, starting to get to the ground, coming out
of the ground, and providing jobs.

We expect that on the project today — the casing project and then the
entire tunnel project when it’s done — is going to create 70,000
high-paying jobs and actually get tons of folks off of — out of cars and
into the street and, of course, make life a whole lot easy.

You know, these tunnel — this particular tunnel, the Hudson Tunnel, was
really hurt by Sandy as well.  And there was some deterioration at it. 
So, we’re actually building an entirely new tunnel not far away from the
old one.  And when that new tunnel is built, we’ll start working on the
old tunnel.

This has been a partnership between the federal government and the state
government and, of course, two states, so it’s a really complicated
plan.  And we want to thank, clearly, Senator Schumer and — and all of
the senators who have worked on this, as well as the two governors, who
are all part of happen- — continuing to help make this happen.

Q    There was some confusion yesterday at the Frederick Douglass
Tunnel.  Ten years came up about — I think it was like 10 years to
complete the project.  Is that accurate?

MR. LANDRIEU:  I don’t know what the exact timeline is.  But all of
these projects are massive projects that take time.  The part is — the
point is, A, to get the money out of the door, which is, of course, what
the President has been able to do when he passed a once-in-a-generation
bill.

You know, people have been talking about this forever.  And so, now the
most important part was to get the money.  Now we have to get it out the
door.  Now we have to get it to the ground.  And that was what yesterday
was about.

So, I’ll get you the timeline on that.  But nobody should be surprised
that these things take time to do.  But we’re going as fast as we
possibly can.

Q    I have a question on your meeting with Elon Musk just a couple of
days ago.

MR. LANDRIEU:  Moving off of rail and on to Musk already?

Q    (Laughs.)  Specifically, you know, if you can talk a little bit
about what was discussed.  And also, did Tesla reach out to set up that
meeting?  Or was that something (inaudible)?

MR. LANDRIEU:  I won’t talk much about what was discussed except to say
that part of what we’re trying to do here — remember, I said roads,
bridges, airports, ports, waterways, clean air, clean water, and a clean
energy economy.  And as you can see, the private sector has come into
this space in a really dramatic way.

Every major auto manufacturer has decided to actually move into the
building of electric vehicles.  Tesla was there — they weren’t there
first; they were one of the first — and they’re — they have a big
footprint.  So, we’ve been talking to all of the folks in the private
sector to just try to listen to where they are, what their concerns are,
how we can work together.

You know that we have to — there’s a substantial amount of money in this
bill to help with the — with the creation of critical minerals.  You
know that there’s money in here to build battery plants, because we’ve
made a lot of announcements around that, in partnership with the private
sector.  You also know that we have to get the supply chains right.   
   
And then, finally, we have to create security so that people know that
that’s a place to charge.  And so, electrical vehicle charging stations
are a critical part of what we’re doing.  We have to lay down 500,000 of
them.  But that’s only a small portion of the total that’s needed.

So, Tesla is a big player in the market.  And that meeting was just one
of many meetings we have, having general discussions about where they
are, what are they thinking about, what are their pros, what are their
cons, and, you know, just having a general discussion about the
implementation of the bill.  
   
Q    On today —

Q    Sorry, just a quick follow-up.  You know, in terms of, sort of,
just the meeting, because it’s Musk and, you know, the relationship he
has had, at least online, with the President — I mean, does this sort of
signify sort of a shift?  Why did the — why did the White House decide
to finally meet him?

MR. LANDRIEU:  Well, again, just in the course of the day-to-day work
that I have to do and the team at the White House, so the National
Security Council — the National Economic Council and, of course, the
climate folks — we’re in constant touch with the folks that run all of
these companies.  So this is nothing, A, out of the ordinary or unusual,
and it is in the cour- — in the course and scope.

You may not have been paying attention to my whereabouts the day before,
but I was actually in San Francisco.  And what had happened was Tesla
was having an announcement the next day — a $3.6 billion investment to
build an entire new plant to build the next level of batteries.  And we
missed each other and just said we’ll catch up and — if we can see each
other in Washington, D.C.   
   
So it was run-of- — run-of-the-mill course of how we talk and make sure
that our doors are open to everybody.  
   
Q    What’s the thinking behind the timing of the intense focus on these
projects this week?  Like you just said, we’re talking about projects
that might be 10 years off because of their scope.  It’s a — it’s a
two-year-old bill at this point.  What’s the reason for such a focus on
these (inaudible)?  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  First of all, it’s a year and a half, not two.  It
happened on November 15th, almost — less than two years ago.  
   
Secondly, we have intense focus every day, all day.  It’s all about
“hurry the hell up and get it done,” from the President’s perspective. 
So that’s just the way we roll.  
   
And so we are continuing, as you know, the constant drumbeat of
announcing getting money out of the door quick.  Again, you guys are
aware of these; we do them every day.  They’re massive announcements all
over the country.  It’s too hard for you guys to keep up with,
actually.  
   
But right now, we will focus on, this year, about execution.  So my t- —
my team’s job, along with the President being our leader, is to — is to
build the team, get the money out of the door, and then tell the
story.  
   
And so as we’re doing that, we just want to make sure that everybody
continues to stay focused.  And because of the timing of the way the
programs work, the notices of funding opportunities that are going out,
people applying for the grants, us being able to award the grants and us
being able to announce them — these are coming in the current course and
scope of what we’re doing.  
   
So, this year, the first thing was a big bridge.  This is the Mega.  And
then you can expect a whole host of other announcements like this to
demonstrate to the American public that we’re doing the job the
President asked us to do.  
   
Q    From your perspective, doing this every day, have you seen a shift
in the public awareness or appreciation of these projects as it’s gotten
bigger, and as it’s gotten —  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  You know, it’s a myth that people don’t know about these
projects.  If nobody knew about it, people would quit taking credit for
all of them.  And, of course, Republicans and Democrats, especially
people that voted against the bill, talk about them all the time.  As
Nancy Pelosi said, even those people that voted no want the dough.  
   
So I think the public is acutely aware because they drive by or they
walk by them all the time.  And so whenever they — wherever there’s a
road project or a rail project going on, it is more likely than not it
got a substantial amount of federal funds in it because the President’s
commitment was to rebuild.   
   
Really simple: “I’m going to use the power of my presidency to bring
people together and get big things done.”  And this is bringing the
receipts over and over and over again.  And I think people pick it up
and understand it.  
   
Q    Mitch, House Republicans have talked about the need to cut spending
to raise the debt limit.  If spending cuts or budget caps went into
place, what risks could that pose for the infrastructure projects you’re
talking about?  
   
MR LANDRIEU:  Well, we’d build less.  That would be — that’s — I mean,
if you have less money, you build less.  And so, I haven’t — I haven’t
had, in my travels or conversations with one person of whatever stripe
who said, “I want…” — “I don’t want a road,” or “I don’t want you to
fill the pothole,” or “I don’t want a new bridge,” or “Please let me
keep dirty water,” or “By the way, I don’t really need high-speed
Internet because I don’t want to talk to anybody.”  Nobody’s — we
haven’t had that conversation.  
   
And so I just think — again, I’m not in the business of politics, but in
general policy, if there are folks on the Hill that want to take away
money from projects, they ought to, I think, identify which projects
they don’t want, and then maybe we can have that discussion with the
American people.  
   
Q    Have you identified those projects for them —  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  No.  
   
Q    — in any conversation?  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  No.  I’ve identified the ones that they say they wanted
built.  That’s what’s happening.  Everybody — as you know, when you look
at these things — and maybe you should — you know, we’ll get you some
information on this.  Every one of these programs is way
oversubscribed.  So $1.2 trillion is a huge amount of money.  It’s the
most that we’ve ever had.  But on every one of these application
processes — of course, which is available to you — you can look at how
many people applied.  And then, of course, only about 10 percent of the
— 10 percent of the projects are getting a “yes.”  
   
So we should have a fairly good scope of what all the asks in the
country are at this time.  And I assure you that I have not had one
person, whether they be Republican or Democrat or independent, say,
“Please stop funding projects in my district because we need to save
money.”  I haven’t heard that yet.  And if I do, we’ll — you know, we’ll
deal with it at that time.  
   
Q    Just as a follow-up —  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  You might ask them that.  
   
Q    How are you planning sort of proactively to sort of deal with
forced cuts to your budget?  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  Well, we’re full speed ahead.  I mean, we’re in the exe-
— by the way, there’s — the Congress has got an important job, which is
to pass the law.  This law is passed.  We’re in the business of
execution.  That’s — that’s our job.  And until we receive a direction
otherwise, we’re full speed ahead every damn day.  You know, as the
President said, “hurry the hell up” mode.  And that’s our mission from
him, that’s his directive, and that’s what we’re doing.  
   
Q    Hey, Olivia, can we get —  
   
MS. DALTON:  Yes.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Cool.  
   
MS. DALTON:  Thank you, Mayor.

MR. LANDRIEU:  You all done with me?  Y’all say, “Mitch, we’re finished
with you and you’re boring, so go.”  (Laughter.)   
   
All right, thank you.  
   
MS. DALTON:  Okay, I can see the waves below, so I’m going to try to
stay upright long enough to give you guys a couple of updates you’re
looking for.   
   
On Tyre Nichols: We haven’t had a briefing or gaggle since we all saw
the horrific footage of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols’s
death last week.  So I wanted to take a few minutes to address that
here.   
   
As you just — as you heard from the President last week, he was outraged
and deeply pained to see the video.  He spoke with Mr. Nichols’s mother
and stepfather to express his condolences and commend the family’s
courage and strength.  
   
Tomorrow, White House officials will also travel to Memphis, Tennessee,
to attend the funeral for Mr. Nichols.   
   
When President Biden spoke with Mr. Nichols’s family last week, he told
them that he was going to be making the case to Congress to pass the
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  To that end, President Biden
spoke yesterday with Representative Horsford and plans to host a small
group of Congressional Black Caucus members at the White House this
Thursday to discuss police reform legislation and other shared
priorities.  
   
President Biden is committed to doing everything in his power to adjust
— to ensure our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fra-
— fair and impartial justice, equal treatment, and dignity for all.  
   
When Senate Republicans blocked the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act
from reaching his desk last year, President Biden signed an executive
order that mandated stricter use of force standards and accountability
provisions for federal law enforcement, as well as measures to
strengthen accountability at the state and local level.  
   
But as the President has said, executive action can’t take the place of
federal legislation, and we need Congress to come together and take
action to ensure our justice system lives up to its name.  
   
Q    Does the White House have any reaction to Congressman Santos
recusing himself from his assignments?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I haven’t seen that news, but I’d be glad to follow up with
you.  
   
Q    Olivia, can I ask — on Title 42, we’ve gotten kind of conflicting
information on whether that’ll be shut down in May when you guys lift
the COVID emergencies.  So can you kind of walk through exactly —  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, here’s the deal on this: We proposed to lift Title 42
earlier and were blocked by court orders.  Extending the public health
emergency one month to May 11th doesn’t change that.  We do not know
when the Supreme Court will rule on this matter or what might lift its —
when it might lift its stay.  But what we do know is that unlike
congressional Republicans, we have a plan to lift Title 42 in a safe and
orderly way.  
   
Q    So just to be crystal clear on that: If May comes, the Supreme
Court has not acted yet, you expect Title 42 to remain in place even
though you’ve lifted the emergency?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, we — I don’t have anything additional to add.  We
don’t know when the Supreme Court will rule on this matter or what it
might say.  
   
Q    On the McCarthy meeting on Wednesday, House Republicans say they
want a path toward a balanced budget.  Does the White House think a
balanced budget is a good goal and something it should pursue for the
economy?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Well, look, let’s start by talking — let’s look at what
President Biden has done to reduce the deficit.  The President has cut
the deficit a record $1.7 trillion, the largest decline in American
history.  His Inflation Reduction Act reduces it by hundreds of billions
more, whereas the deficit increased every single year under Donald
Trump.  His four years in office are responsible for 25 percent of our
total national debt from the last 230 years.   
   
And the first bill that House Republicans passed this year would add
$114 billion extra to the deficit by helping billionaires cheat on their
taxes.  That’s on top of the $2 trillion in ta- — Trump tax cuts
favoring the wealthy that they propose extending.  
   
So when President Biden says he will work to reduce the deficit, he’s
not just said it, he’s acted on it.  And, you know, he wants to hear
Republicans’ plans to do the same.  
   
Q    Yeah, but is that a continued goal going forward for the
President?   
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, the President said he’s happy to talk with anyone
with ideas to responsibly lower the deficit.  And he’s put forward
several proposals to do so by making the rich and big corporations pay
their fair share.  
   
But what’s the Republican plan?  Is it to cut Social Security and
Medicare?  Is it to raise the retirement age?  
   
Speaker McCarthy claims he doesn’t want to do what he has previously
voted for in this regard.  He should share what his plan is.  
   
Q    Just a quick question on Ukraine, Olivia.  Yesterday, the President
said he is not giving Ukraine any F-16s.  This was during the gaggle. 
So we just wanted to understand, is he still willing to sell Ukraine
F-16s?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t have anything to add to the President’s
comments.   
   
But I think, as you all know, we’re sending a significant amount of
weapons and security assistance to Ukraine right now to help with their
ongoing battlefield needs in response to Russian aggression.  You know,
we’ve sent artillery, ammunition, armored vehicles, critical air defense
capabilities.  We’re in regular contact about their battlefield needs,
and I expect we’re going to have more security assistance to announce
soon.  
   
And with that, I think we are a few feet off the ground, so I’m going to
go take a seat.  Thanks, everybody.  
   
Q    Thank you.
