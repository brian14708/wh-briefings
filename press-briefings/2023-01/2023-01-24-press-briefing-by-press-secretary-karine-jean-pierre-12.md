1:44 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I always hear, like, comments when I walk in, and it’s
always so funny.  (Laughs.)  
   
All right.  Good afternoon, everyone.   
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  For the second time in recent days, a California
community has been devastated by a mass shooting and families are
mourning loved ones lost to a senseless act of gun violence.   
   
As some of the victims’ families have said, we are starting Lunar New
Year broken.  To read their stories is indeed heartbreaking.  Stories
like the 65-year-old who went to the dance studio in Monterey Park on
weekends because it’s what she loved to do.  And, tragically, her family
said that Saturday was her last dance.   
   
We’ve read moving tributes for the former dance student who helped
manage the studio from his fellow dancers and his teachers.   
   
A grandmother, whose family described how hard she worked to give back
to her community and care for her loved ones, died after being taken to
the hospital in critical condition.   
   
We have mourned lives lost in mass shootings after mass shootings.  The
flags at the White House were already at half-mast in honor of those
murdered in Monterey Park when we learned of the shooting in Half Moon
Bay.   
   
President Biden, like most Americans, believes that this is an urgent
issue; that too many of our neighbors, colleagues, kids are losing their
lives to gun violence.   
   
Over the last two decades, more school-aged children have died from guns
than on-duty police officer and active-duty military combined.  And we
know what the policy solutions are.  We know how we can address this.   
   
In fact, last night, Senator Feinstein, along- — alongside Senators
Murphy, Blumenthal, and others, reintroduced a federal assault weapons —
weapons and high-capacity magazine ban and legislation that would raise
the minimum purchase age for assault weapons to 21.   
   
The last time we had an assault weapons ban on the books, thanks to the
President and Senator Feinstein’s leadership, mass shootings actually
went down.  After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled. 
And that’s just a fact.   
   
As you all know, President Biden has taken historic executive action to
reduce gun violence.  And last summer, he signed the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act — the first significant piece of gun safety legislation
in nearly 30 years.   
   
But he — but he continues to believe, and these tragic events continue
to show us, there is more to be done to keep our homes, schools, and
communities safe.   
   
The President and the First Lady are thinking of those killed and
injured in these latest shootings across America.  But more importantly,
he’s urging both chambers of Congress to act quickly and deliver this
assault bans — assault weapons ban to his desk and take additional
action to keep American communities, schools, workplace, and homes
safe.   
   
I also wanted to share exciting news about the President’s economic plan
continuing to create results for Americans across the country.  Today we
learned 38 states are now at — are at or below 4 percent unemployment,
and states from Pennsylvania to South Dakota to Alaska have record-low
unemployment.   
   
We also know a record 10.7 million jobs were created in the last two
years.  Annual inflation has fallen over the last six months.  The
economic — the economy grew at 3.2 percent in the most recent GDP
report.  And a record 10.5 million small businesses’ applications were
filed since the President took office.   
   
And we’re continuing to lower healthcare costs for Americans.  A new
report shows that if Inflation Reduction Act’s insulin cap were
implemented in 2020, 1.5 million seniors across the country could have
saved an average of $500 per year on insulin.  
   
The Inflation Reduction Act’s health provisions, including permanent
Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicare negotiations down — Medicare
negotiating down certain prescription drugs mean more money in
Americans’ pockets and more breathing room for American families.   
   
As the President said in a statement this morning, and I quote,
“Americans are seeing a strong economy where they live.  They are seeing
their neighbors back to work with higher wages even accounting for
inflation.  They’re seeing prices down at their pharmacies.  They’re
seeing new businesses opening with” the most — “with most Americans
applying to start small businesses at any time on record.”  End quote.  
   
And finally, I wanted to say hello and welcome to the Park School of
Baltimore students — they are lined up to my left here — who are here
for — for their — their Career — Career Exploration Day.   
   
And welcome.  Welcome, students.  I had an opportunity to meet all of
you.  Very impressive.  And I know high school can be a lot of fun but
also very hard.  Just stay focused, keep your passion, and you’ll get
there.  So, good to see you all.   
   
With that, Aamer, good to see you.  
   
Q    Good to see you.  So, first, I just wanted to ask: Is there any
reaction to Vice President Pence’s announcement of finding classified
docs in his possession?  
   
And then, more broadly, most of the rules surrounding classification are
created and can be amended by executive order.  Does the President
believe the system must be reformed?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, first, on your first question, look, I’m not going
to comment on any ongoing criminal investigation or any investigation. 
As you all know, the Department of Justice is independent, and we will
not politically interfere.   
   
We’ve been very, very clear about that under this President.  The
President has been very clear since his campaign promises.  And so, I’m
just going to refer you to the Department of Justice.   
   
On your second question, I would refer you to the White House Counsel’s
Office.  
   
Q    Can I ask one on Ukraine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.  
   
Q    Is the administration ready to give Abrams to Ukraine in order — I
just — one — all right — is the administration ready to give the
Abrams?  
   
And two: If you are, is there — has it been connected with Germany also
giving Leopards?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m going to say we are in constant communications
with Ukraine and other allies and partners as it relates to what Ukraine
needs in the battlefield, but I don’t have any preview — anything to
preview here, any announcements to make at this time, or any new types
of security assistance to preview for you today.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Following up from yesterday, has the President
invited the Justice Department to search his Rehoboth Beach house?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I would refer you to the White House Counsel’s
Office, who have been regularly in touch with all of you answering these
questions, about — about this legal ongoing matter.  I just don’t have
anything to share.  
   
Q    And a couple follow-ups on the Pence issue.  Does the White House
believe that the Justice Department should appoint a Special Counsel to
investigate former Vice President Pence’s handling of classified
documents?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s for the Department of Justice to decide.   
   
Q    And now that we’re seeing the two most recent Vice Presidents
discover classified documents in their private homes, does this suggest
that there’s a larger problem within the government where classified
documents are not where they’re supposed to be?  Do a lot of people have
documents outside of where they’re properly supposed to be stored?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to comment from — from here on that.  I
would refer you to the White House Counsel on any- — anything related to
classified documents from here.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  On the issue of gun control, you spoke about the
President’s commitment to an assault weapons ban and his view that there
is more that can be done.  How does — how do, I should say, the
limitations in Congress — i.e. with the votes that you have or don’t
have in Congress — impact that view?  
   
And what — can you be more specific about what he thinks can be done,
given the votes that he has now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I just want to remind folks that this is a
President who has made gun violence and dealing with gun violence his —
his career.   
   
And he’s actually been very — very instrumental in pushing — pushing
forward these types of gun reforms that we have seen, whether it is what
we saw with the assault weapons ban 30 years ago that he — he helped get
done with Senator Feinstein, or signing the bipartisan piece of
legislation that he signed into law just months ago that was, again, the
most significant piece of — piece of legislation that dealt with gun
violence.   
   
And, let’s not forget, he has made this a priority for — for him in his
presidency since day one with historic executive action.   
   
So, I say all of this to say this is a priority for the President.  When
folks thought we wouldn’t be able to get a bipartisan deal done on
dealing with gun violence, that was able to — that was a — that was able
to get done with — because of the President’s leadership on this,
because of the President’s focus on this.   
   
Look, we’re always looking for — his team is always looking for ways to
— to do — to continue with gun — to do executive actions to deal with
reducing gun violence.  But what we believe is that Congress needs to
act.  They need to put forth legislation that can go into law and deal
with this issue.   
   
We cannot continue to see communities be devastated by this.  As a
parent, we should not be waking up every morning worried that our child
or our kids may have to deal with gun violence.  If you’re going to the
grocery store, you should not have to worry about going to the grocery
store and potentially having to deal with gun violence, or going to the
movies — watching a movie with your partner or with your kids and eating
popcorn and wa- — and potentially having to worry about gun violence.   
   
And so, the President has been very clear.  And this is not just the
last two years; this has been the — many decades of his career.   
   
So, we’re going to have — continue to have those conversations with
Congress.  We’re going to continue to call on Congress to take action.  
   
Q    On a separate topic, U.S. officials have determined that Chinese
companies have been sending non-lethal assistance to Russia for
Ukraine.  What is the United States saying to the Chinese government
about this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’re closely monitoring the situation, as we have
been since the war started.  We will continue to communicate to China
the implications of providing material support to Russia’s war against
Ukraine.  
   
We — we have talked about this — about this many times that we — we
will, you know, be very clear what it means to support Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine.  And as I’ve said many times, as my
colleagues from NSC have said many times, we’ll continue to support
Ukraine and the Ukrainian people as long as needed.   
   
Q    But what are those implications?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into diplomatic or private
conversations from here.  I’m just going to let you know that we’ve been
monitoring the situation.  And we’ve been very clear with — with the
Chinese government on this.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  When you talk about how gun violence has been a
priority for this administration, it’s been a priority for the President
over his entire career, how does he feel in moments like last night? 
Like, is it frustration?  Is it helplessness?  Personally, how does he
deal with this continuing to be a major problem in the country?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, Phil, I would say that you have seen him out
there, sadly, with many of these tragedies, mourning with the families,
offering his support to families.  And it is — it continues — you’ll —
you continue to — what you see from him is certainly how he feels when
he sees these types of travesties.   
   
You saw that in Uvalde, sadly, when we saw kids were gunned down, where
families had to identify — the way they were — identify their own
children was through DNA.  That’s how horrible that situation was.   
   
You saw him in Buffalo, New York, meeting with the 10 members — the 10
victims who were killed, and him meeting with those families and dealing
with their heartache.   
   
And so, this is a President that feels — right? — that is able to feel
what people are going through, because he knows what loss means to
families.   
   
So, yeah, you know, he wants to continue to fight.  He wants to continue
to speak out against this.  You’ve seen his statements over the last
several days, sadly, and what we have seen with gun violence across the
country.  And so, you’ll continue to see that.   
   
And he will continue to speak about this in a way that lifts up the
families who are — who are dealing with this loss — a very devastating
loss — and continue to call on Congress to take action.   
   
Q    And then, one more shot on the — on the Pence documents.  Is there
any sense inside the White House that this perhaps shifts the political
or public perception dynamics of what the President has been facing over
the course of the last several weeks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to comment from here.   
   
Go ahead, Joey.   
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  Sorry, I thought you were there yesterday,
Joey.  
   
Q    Yeah, I know.  I saw.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But it was Michael.  I apologized to Michael.  
   
Q    I forgive you.  (Laughter.)  
   
It — do you have any update on whether the President plans to visit
California?  I know you were asked yesterday.  But since then, there’s —
as we’ve noted, there was a second mass shooting there.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I — no plans at this time to preview about a
president — presidential travel to California.  You saw his statement. 
I just kind of read part of his statement.  His heart — his heart goes
out to the families, to the victims of the families.  And — and we will
continue to fight to make sure we deal with this issue, we deal with gun
violence.   
   
We started with the executive actions — the historic executive actions
that the President was able to do the first two years of his
administration.   
   
We were able to, again, as I mentioned, sign a bipartisan piece of
legislation to deal with gun violence.  But we need to do more.  We need
to do a lot more.   
   
And so, the President is going to continue to call for that.  I don’t
have anything to preview about a trip to California.  
   
Q    Yeah, and you kind of alluded this — or asked a little bit about
this.  But what is the strategy now to pass the weapon — the assault
weapons ban that Feinstein introduced?  I mean, you’re talking, of
course, about a Republican-led House now.  And so, how — I mean, you
know, what — what can the White House do to actually overcome those
numbers now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, and one thing I just want to go back to on
California: The President has been in touch with local and state
leaders, and his team continues to offer support to the local government
and, clearly, Governor Newsom’s team in any way that we can to be
helpful to what they’re dealing with today — this week, I should say.  
   
Look, it is — you know, it is a priority for the President.  It really
is.  That’s why he’s taken executive actions.  That’s why his team has
worked with Congress on this bipartisan legislation that was passed
several months ago.  And he’ll continue to do that.   
   
And, you know, I think, if you all remember — and many of you reported
this, that — how difficult it was going to be for the President to get
any bipartisanship the first two years of his administration, and he was
able to get historic pieces of legislation done.   
   
And so, the President says this all the time: He is an — he’s
optimistic.  And, you know — and I think optimism is very important to
this President.  
   
But at the same time, he’s going to continue to ask Congress to act. 
And — and he’s going to continue to see what other executive actions can
be taken from here.   
   
But at the end of the day, we need Congress act.  We need legislation
that can be signed into law to deal with a matter that is really tearing
apart communities.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Was the White House aware before this afternoon
that classified documents had been found at Vice President Pence’s
residence as well?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the White House Counsel’s
Office.  
   
Q    And does the White House believe that other former high office
holders should now go back and check their personal residences out of an
abundance of caution to make sure that they’re not holding on to
classified documents as well?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s not something I can comment from here.  I don’t
even — we don’t — I don’t even know the — you know, the reasoning of
what the news that we heard about Pence.  So, I’m just not going to
comment from here.   
   
I’m not going to comment on any other former elected official, current
elected official.   
   
With this particular case, I refer you to Department of Justice. 
Anything that relates to this White House, I would refer you to the
White House Counsel’s Office.   
   
Q    And then, on the Abrams tank, last week at the podium, John Kirby
said that the Abrams is expensive to maintain, to operate, to fuel, and
that it requires a lot of training.  Does this White House still have
those same concerns when it comes to providing tanks to the
Ukrainians?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as my DOD colleagues have said very recently, that
— again, nothing to preview from here.  Certainly, don’t have anything
to share.  But they never ruled out tanks.  I just want to make that
very clear.   
   
I think what my colleagues at the DOD have said in the past very
recently is that there’s — there were always challenges with tanks.  
   
But I’m not going to preview anything.  I think I would refer you to the
DOD comments on this.  Again, there have always been challenges.  It’s
never been taken off the table.  But as I just mentioned, I don’t have
anything to preview.   
   
Q    Those are the challenges.  What are the benefits to potential of
acquiring tanks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, we’ve already — we’ve always said — again,
nothing to preview.  Want to be very clear here.  We’ve always said that
we are in constant communication with Ukraine, as they’re — as they’re
trying to figure out what they need on the battlefield.  And — and we
are always looking for ways to offer security — security assistance for
them.   
   
And so, again, not going to get ahead of any — any potential
announcement.  I’m not — don’t have anything for you to preview for — to
preview, but we’re always in constant communication with Ukraine and
what it is that they need for their success, what it is that they need
to really battle the aggression that we have seen from — from Russia
this almost past year.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Germany’s ruling party just confirmed that they’ve
decided to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine.  Do you have any comment on
that?  And is that linked to, in any way, a reversal of this
consideration of U.S. government sending Abrams to Ukraine as well?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we have said this before: We believe it’s up to
each individual country.  It is their own sovereign — sovereign
decisions on what they provide for Ukraine.  We’ve been very clear about
that.  And we always appreciate what our allies or partners are doing to
make sure that Ukraine is able to defend itself.   
   
I’m not going to go beyond that.  Again, don’t have anything to preview
from here.  
   
Q    And then, switching topics.  On Ticketmaster, there was this
hearing in the Senate today.  Given the White House’s concern about
monopoly power, you know, does the White House believe the Live
Nation-Ticketmaster merger should be unwound, given what we’ve heard
today from senators expressing that concern as well?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Are you a “Swifty”?  Is that what it’s called?  I
don’t know.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    I’m asking on behalf of all the Swifties, Karine.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Things that you learn.   
   
So, look, President Biden is a strong proponent of increasing
competition in our economy.  As he said last year when he signed the
landmark executive order on competition, and I quote, “The heart of
American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition,” but
“Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism; it’s exploitation.”  
   
So, I’ll say one more thing about the executive order.  It establishes a
whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American
economy, because we know the lack of competition leads to higher prices
and worse service.   
   
So, again, you know, capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism;
it’s exploitation.  And that’s why he’s made — he’s really made an
effort with his executive actions to deal with something that truly
matters to the American people.  
   
Q    Does the same concern apply to —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And the Swifties, apparently.   (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Does the same concern apply to Google, which is facing a new DOJ
action today?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not going to get into DOJ action or what DOJ
is potentially — any legal matters that they potentially are taking. 
What I will say is — more broadly, is how the President is a proponent
for increasing competition in our economy, and he has shown that through
his actions.  
   
Q    On gun violence, you’ve mentioned the potential for further
executive action.  Is there an active review underway of other potential
executive actions?  Where is this being worked on within the
administration?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, don’t have anything to share on any active
review.   
   
What I can say is that the President has asked his team to do all they
can through executive action to reduce gun violence.  We’ve seen him
make his- — historic progress via executive action to deal with this
dangerous violence that we’re seeing — gun violence, specifically, that
we’re seeing across the country in dangerous hands.   
   
So, we’ll continue to pursue executive actions to reduce gun violence. 
I don’t have anything right now to share or preview or list out what is
it that we’re exactly looking at, but his team is always looking at ways
to improve — to deal with an issue, again, that is devastating
communities across the country.   
   
But I also want to be very, very clear here.  In order to deal with
this, we need Congress to act.  And that’s the way that we’re really
going to be able to deal with a matter that is, again, devastating
communities, devastating families across the country.  
   
Q    On documents, I realize you don’t want to comment on existing
issues, but there is clearly an ongoing issue across administrations
with handling of classified materials.  Perhaps this isn’t the right
time for this White House to lead a review of U.S. policy on classified
materials, but is that something that that the White House is
considering?  Is there someone who would be the right person to lead a
review of the current challenges that are obviously tripping up people
from all parties?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I understand the question, and I know it’s going to
come in many different ways, but I’m going to refer you to the White
House Counsel’s Office, who would be the best — they will be the best
folks to talk through about that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I want to follow up on Ukraine.  The
administration has been relatively successful in forming alliances not
just in Europe, but in Asia as well — Australia, New Zealand, and Japan
— against Russia, of course, and imposing economic sanction.  But is the
White House satisfied with the military assistance that these countries
are giving?   
   
I know you’re going to say it’s a sovereign state that they can decide
for themselves.  But, at this point, as we are approaching the one-year
anniversary, are you satisfied with what you asked from alliances to
give to Ukraine militarily?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, we’ve always been very appreciative of
our allies and partners in their efforts to help Ukraine and what they
have decided their security assistance is going to be for Ukraine.  And
so, we will continue to be appreciative.  We will continue to thank
them.   
   
Again, and you said it in your question to me, it is a sovereign
decision.  It is up to each individual country to decide how are they
going to do their part in helping Ukraine fight against Russia’s
aggression.  
   
But, you know, these are our allies.  These are our partners.  And we
will continue to work with them closely to make sure that Ukrainians are
able to fight this brutal war.  
   
Q    What do you think is holding these alliances?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say that last part.  
   
Q    The alliances — are they still holding?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, we believe that they are.   
   
I’m going to go — I’m going to come back down.  Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Thanks.  It being the White House’s position for the last several
weeks that the President’s legal team did the right thing, is it the
initial observation of the White House that the Pence legal team did the
right thing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s not for me to comment on from here.  I would
refer you to the Department of Justice.  
   
Q    One of the things that Pence team seems to have done in the last
week is make public disclosure of the circumstance.  They advised NARA
but also advised Congress and now the public.  Any reflections among the
communications and press staff here as to how the Pence team handled it
versus how  
you guys handled it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Steve, I understand your question, and I hear it. 
We’ve had — we’ve answered your question in many different variations. 
I’m just not — don’t have anything else to share from here.   
   
If you have any more specifics or details about this, about the ongoing
legal matter, I would refer you to Department of Justice.  Anything else
I would refer to the White House Counsel’s Office.  
   
Q    Why did you not talk about it for two months?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Did — does the White House have a response to Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu’s surprise trip to Jordan today and meeting
with King Abdullah?  And do you think it could help reduce tensions in
the region?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have not seen those reports.  I’ve not been able to
talk to our National Security Council about it.  But clearly, we are, as
you know, Jake — Jake Sullivan just recently went to Israel to meet with
his counterparts to continue the very important relationship we have
with Israel.  Just don’t have anything further.   
   
It — we normally don’t comment on — on individual countries meeting and
the agenda that they have with other countries.  But don’t have anything
specific to share on that.  
   
Q    Can you say anything more about what’s on the agenda today with —
for the meeting at three o’clock with Democratic leadership
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, the President is very much looking
forward to meeting with the new Democratic leadership.  And that is
happening pretty soon — less than — I don’t even know — less than an
hour.   
   
And so, he’s going to host them in the Roosevelt Room.  You’re going to
hear from him at the top.  He’ll have something to share about his
thoughts about the meeting.   
   
They’ll cover a wide range of issues, especially how we can make even
more economic progress on top of what our shared accomplishments have
led to: the creation of over 10.7 million new jobs and 10 million small
business — business starts, bringing down inflation, and a record number
of Americans enrolling in healthcare coverage.  
   
One of the main avenues for doing that is ramping up implementation of
the legislation they accomplished together over the past two years. 
When you think of inflation — the Inflation Reduction Act, when you
think about the continuing implementation of the bipartisan
infrastructure legislation, that’s what — one of the topics that
certainly — that will come up.  
   
And look, the President has said this — he said this after the midterm
elections, he said this many times, I’ve said this — he is — he is
looking forward to working with Republicans in good faith to continue
the work that he has been able to do the last two years, some in a
bipartisan way, to deliver for the American people.  
   
But, look, he’s also going to call out, as we have said this before,
continue to call out any — any dangerous, extreme MAGA Republicans.  He
can do both.  But — like proposals to raise taxes on the middle class or
cut Medicare; cut Social Security, as we’ve been hearing from — from
national Republicans; or also — I mean, let’s not forget the national
ban — national abortion ban; or worsen inflation.  
   
And so, those are the things that the President is very focused on.  And
I think the most important thing that I think you can take away from
this is: He wants to continue to deliver for the American people.  He’s
doing — he’s willing to do that in a bipartisan way, but it has to be in
good faith.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    That was one of my questions about the preview.  But one of the
things I wonder is — the President has received some Democratic
criticism about how he has handled some of the things that he has said
about the documents’ matter.  Do you expect that he might address that
with the Democratic leaders?  Because it’s obviously got political
implications for just how he’s perceived and perhaps some of his
political strength going forward?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I kind of talked about this, Kelly O, a little
bit yesterday and some — some of those same criticism from — from
Democrats.  They also said the President — they believe the President
did what he needed to do and handled — has handled it fully and in a
cooperative way.  
   
But, look, I — you know, as it relates to the politics of this, as it
relates to the American people — and, you know, we’ll continue to say
this: It’s up to the American people to decide.  They — you know,
they’re smart.  They know what’s going on.  They know what this
President has been doing and delivering on.  
   
You know, we’ve talked about the midterms and what it was supposed to be
and what was predicted to be, and it didn’t happen.  Right?  When you
think about the red — the red wave that we had heard over and over
again.  
   
And part of that — why we didn’t see that — is because the President led
with a message that resonated and connected with the American people. 
He led with what he has been able to do when it comes to the bipartisan
infrastructure legislation, when it comes to making sure that we’re —
he’s doing the work to lower costs at the gas pump, which he has been
able to do.  
   
And so, look, we will let the American people see for themselves what
the President has been able to deliver the last two years.  I’m just not
going to get into fur- — into any further discussion about policies from
here.  
   
Q    Specifically, do you know if he has been briefed on the Pence
matter?  And has he had any outreach with former President Obama, since
some of the documents would have been from their joint administration?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, those two questions, I would refer you to
the White House Counsel’s Office.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  After a Special Counsel was named but before the
FBI searched, President Biden went to his house in Wilmington.  What was
he doing in there?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the White House Counsel.   
   
Q    So, it was something relating to this case?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the White House Counsel’s
Office.   
   
Q    Okay.  Do you think that this story was leaked by someone trying to
bruise the President politically ahead of a reelection announcement?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the White House Counsel’s Office,
as they have been the ones who’ve been  
closely involved.  
   
Q    Okay.  More basically, we know the President did it.  Why did he do
it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the White House Counsel’s
Office.  
   
Q    In the President’s own words, he admits to having information that
wasn’t his.  Why did he smuggle it out?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I will let the statement of the President stand for
itself.  I’m just not going to go into a rabbit hole — down a rabbit
hole with you on this.  
   
Q    But, Karine, why did he not talk about it for months?  
   
Q    Karine, yes, thanks.  Slight shift of topic: Haiti.  The U.N. Envoy
to Haiti has just been saying today that it’s basically out of control. 
The gangs run — well, they don’t really run anything, but they’re in
charge.  Can we expect any shift from the — you know any, maybe,
up-tempo of the U.S. response to this, given not just the humanitarian
side, but maybe the national security aspect for the U.S.?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything new to share on any new
announcement or engagement.   
   
Look, this is something that we have been monitoring very closely.  And
we have done, you know, everything that we can to — you know, in this
time, to help the Haitian people, to help in a way that could really
make a difference in the humanitarian aid, as you — as you just laid
out.  And — and I just don’t have anything else to share beyond what you
laid out.  
   
But this is truly a — important to the President and — what’s going on
in Haiti.  And you’ve heard us talk about it in — you know, over the
past several months.  You heard the President talk about this at NALS
when he was in Mexico City.   
   
When he met with the Canadian Prime Minister, when he met with the
President of Mexico, it was clearly on the agenda and a conversation
that they had.  We had a readout on that specifically.  It was brought
up in the — in the press conference that they had.   
   
I just don’t have anything further to share.  
   
Q    Karine, since you don’t have any answer on the classified documents
—  
   
    MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    — are you still a great fit for this job?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, my friend.  
   
Q    Because we don’t seem to have any answer from you.  
   
Q    Is the press briefing a waste of time?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead, my friend.  
   
Q    Has any meeting been set between the President and the Speaker
yet?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a meeting to announce from here with
Speaker McCarthy.  I know that it is — we’ve commented on this.  This is
something that the President is certainly looking forward to.   
   
And, look, he’s willing and wants to work with the Speaker in good
faith, in delivering in a bipartisan way for the American people.  I
don’t have anything to preview at this time.  
   
Q    Would that be before or after the State of the Union?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This is something that he would —  
   
As you know, it’s tradition — right? — for the President to meet with
the new Congress before the State of the Union.  I just don’t have
anything to share at this time.  
   
Q    On the meeting that will happen, I know that when the President
spoke about it, it was in the context of the deficit and debt, having
those conversations.  Is that sort of what the engagement would be
limited to?  Or would the President want to expand out the — you know,
you’ve talked a lot about gun violence or the border.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, there’s going to be a range of issues that’s
going to be discussed.  As you mentioned, when he was talking about the
deficit, he was talking about wanting to work in a bipartisan way to
continue to lower the debt — right? — which he has been able to do by
$1.7 trillion in a historic record.  He’s always willing to have
good-faith conversation to deliver for the American people in that
way.  
   
But when it comes to — look, when it comes to the debt limit, the debt
ceiling, the President has been very clear, I have been very clear,
you’ve heard from our economics team about that — how this should be
done without conditions.  That still stands.  
   
And we can’t forget that — and I talked about this a little bit
yesterday — the debt ceiling has been dealt with 78 times since 1960; 49
times under a President — Republican president; and 29 times with a
Democratic President.  
   
And let’s not also forget — I think this is something that people who —
need to understand — when you talk about  
the debt ceiling, you’re talking about not more — new spending.  You’re
talking about what Congress — what — the bill that Congress has racked
up.  Right?  This is — this is their basic duty to — you know, to deal
with the debt ceiling.  
   
When the President walked in — well, if you look at the debt ceiling
right now, 90 percent of it was before the President walked into
office.  So, this is their duty.  This is their duty to do this in a
bipartisan way.  That’s what we’re talking about.  
   
And when you’re — when Republicans are saying they’re going to — they
want to cut Social Security, they want to cut Medicare, they want to cut
programs that Americans have paid into, that’s going to hurt senior
citizens, that’s going to hurt our veterans, that’s going to hurt
taxpayers.  
   
And so, that’s what we’re talking about.  And so, it is their basic duty
to deal with this.  
   
Go ahead, Steven.    
   
Q    Oh, thank you, Karine.  I have two questions.  The first: New York
Congressman Nick LaLota is skipping tonight’s presidential reception for
new members of Congress in protest of White House coronavirus rules that
require an attestation of vaccination and a negative test result. 
LaLota says the rules are arbitrary and unscientific and should be far
behind us.  Does the White House have a reaction to that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I haven’t seen those — that reporting or those
comments from the congressman.  But I’ll say this: We have protections
in place to protect staff and the President of the United States.  COVID
isn’t over.  We’ve been very clear about that.  Hundreds of Americans
are dying every day, and cases are increasing right now, today.  
   
That’s why we take commonsense measures, like COVID testing ahead of
large indoor gatherings at the White House.  And so, this is an
important — an important issue that’s been important, when we’re talking
about COVID and dealing with COVID and coming up with comprehensive ways
to make sure that people get vaccinated.  That’s something that the
President dealt with from day one of his administration.  
   
Q    And if I could just follow up very briefly on that.  I’m curious if
there was a reason that we still have the vaccine attestation rule,
especially considering the very highly transmissible Omicron mutations
that can elude most of the common vaccines.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, what I can tell you, Steven, is we listen to the
experts, and we look at the data, and we — you know, we pay very close
attention to science.  And I just don’t have anything to say beyond
that.  That is something that our experts — we take their advice when it
comes to things like that.  
   
Q    Karine, my second question is regarding a comment from Senator Ted
Cruz.  He’s calling for a search of President Biden’s Senate records at
the University of Delaware for potentially classified information. 
Those records reportedly include about 1,850 boxes of documents, as well
as 415 gigabytes of electronic files.  Does President Biden have any
objection to such a search?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  When it comes to the documents and this ongoing legal
matter, I refer you to the White House Counsel’s Office.  
   
Q    I would — I’d just like to read —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  You just —  
   
Q    I’m so sorry.  I’d just like to read —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You said you had two.  You’ve had four.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    I’d just like to read out the request of our colleagues in this
room for someone to answer these questions from the podium.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Absolutely.  Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, thanks.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll come to you.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, the Oversight Chair, he had — Mr. Comer — he wrote — he
wrote the head of the Secret Service, asking for the visitor information
from Wilmington.  Now, I know you said there’s no visitor logs, but do
you have any object- — or does the White House have an objection to the
Secret Service providing any documents or communication about who’s
going in and out?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I would refer you to the White House Counsel’s
Office on any — anything that’s related to the investigation, the
Oversight hearing that’s happening.  
   
Q    And then, just at the top, in response to the Pence question, you
said you weren’t going to comment on any ongoing criminal or other
investigations.  There’s — is there any reason to believe any of these
are criminal investigations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just saying I’m just not going to — I’m just not
going to comment on any type of investigation.  The Department of
Justice is independent, and we just don’t comment on any, any
investigations from here.  
   
Q    Yes, Karine, on gun violence, it’s very clear to everybody that gun
is a problem in this country.  I’m going to give you an example.  In
Africa, when we see news from the U.S., like a six-year-old boy bringing
gun to school, and we see people going to the movie theater and being
killed by gun, and also see people in this country that have not seen
war but are killed by gun, is extremely scared for us.  And we have seen
that this country is very developed.   
   
What do you think is preventing the Congress to act when it comes to gun
control?  And what can more President Biden do to move on and do
something to control the gun?   
   
And my question comes because I’m a mother.  I have two daughters.  And
when they go to school, sometimes I’m afraid that maybe his little
colleague from school will bring a gun or even in random place we get
shot.  This is very, very scared.  And this is a problem.  And we saw,
recently, people also dying by gun.   
   
What can President do more to move on and control the guns?  And,
please, why do you think that Congress is waiting to act?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, when it relates to the Congress, you have to ask
Congress.  You have to go over to Congress and meet with congressional
members and ask them that very question.  Lay it out just the way that
you laid it out to me.  I think it’s an important question for them to
answer.  
   
But also, we saw, last night, Senator Feinstein, along with Senators
Murphy and Blumenthal, reintroduce the assault weapons ban, which we
support and we encourage for Congress to act on that — on that piece of
legislation.  
   
Look, again, I would refer — I would suggest you go talk to them about
this.  Look, you just laid out what I just said, right?  You just laid
out about going to the movie theaters and being worried about gun
violence.  You just laid out about being a parent and worrying about
your child going to school or going to the grocery store and worry about
gun violence.  That is something that we should not have to deal
with.   
   
And this is something — again, if you look at the President’s record as
a senator, you look at his first two years as President, he’s dealt with
this issue.   
   
And — and he’s going to continue to do what he can from here, use the
tools of the federal government to take action.  He has taken historic
executive actions, as I just laid out moments ago.   
   
But when it comes to really, truly dealing with this issue, we need
legislation.  We need legislation.  We need Congress to act.   
   
So we are thankful and we are hopeful to see what occurred with this
legislation that was introduced, again, by Senators Feinstein,
Blumenthal, and Murphy.  And we’re going to continue to encourage
Congress to act.  
   
But I would — I would pose the question that you just asked me to
Congress.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, just to follow up quick, still on gun violence.  We have
spoke — like, between me and some friends — that in this country — and
this — I’m making this point because we need to remind people that
America is the only country on Earth that people die by gun without even
being in war.  Because — I’m giving this example because, in Africa,
there is countries in war, but people doesn’t even have access to gun. 
It’s very hard, because the government and everybody is very conscious
that the guns can cause a lot of destruction.   
   
But in this country, it’s very normal for everybody to have access to
gun, and this needs to be controlled.   
   
But what can people like me, common people, can also — what can we do to
help control gun in this country?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, look, what I can speak to: There are many ways
that people can get involved in — in dealing with the gun violence that
we’re seeing here.  I’m not going to make any suggestions, but there are
ways that folks can go out there and — and participate in a way that’s
healthy, in the way that actually helps deal with a real issue.   
   
What I can speak to is what the President has done.  What I can speak to
is what the President believes.  What I can speak to is the President’s
record on this, which is — you can see for yourself — as a senator, this
last two years as President and the executive actions that he’s taken. 
He signed a bipartisan piece of legislation, as I just mentioned moments
ago, to deal with — in taking one step to deal with gun violence.   
   
And so, look, that’s what I can speak to.  That’s what we can talk about
very clearly.  And we are going to continue to discuss and have a
conversation and call on Congress to act.   
   
All right, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  We heard you talk about the statements that
President Biden took out — put out, but why haven’t we heard the
President address the American people on camera about these recent
shootings?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s taken — which one?  
   
Q    About these — the shootings that have happened recently.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I mean, he has — he’s talked about it many
times, as you know.  And I’m sure you’ll hear from him in the upcoming
days to — to talk about what he has seen and how devastating the gun
violence, especially this week, has been.   
   
And, look, you’ve seen him, as I mentioned, in Uvalde, when he was
comforting the parents of the kids who were — who were murdered.   
   
You saw him in Buffalo, when he was, again, comforting families who saw
their family member murdered.   
   
And it’s been too many.  Too many.  And so you’ll continue to hear from
us.   
   
I think when the President puts out a statement, that is a very powerful
— a powerful action by the President.  You all take it; you all repeat
what the President has said.  So I wouldn’t — I would take that as a
serious — a serious communication for the President, as you all already
do.  And he’ll continue to speak out about it.   
   
Q    And have you spoken with the President about the most recent report
that more documents were found at his home, personally?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I have not.  
   
Q    Is that intentional?  
   
Q    Why didn’t Biden tell you (inaudible) about the documents?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Does the White House have a response to former Secretary —
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who, in his new book and in a tweet sent
this afternoon, has referred to Jamal Khashoggi as an “activist” and a
“part-time stringer for the Washington Post”?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m going to — I’m going to let Mr. Pompeo speak
for himself.  
   
Here’s what I will say and what we will say from the White House about
this — about this issue: From the earliest days of this administration,
we took the murder of Jamal Khashoggi very seriously.  That included
releasing intelligence community report on the murder, which was not
done in the last administration; sanctioning a number of Saudi officials
and entities; and instituting the so-called Khashoggi Ban.   
   
Again, I will let Mr. Pompeo speak for himself.   
   
Q    Do you think Jamal Khashoggi — would you consider him an
activist?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get — he’s — I’m not going to get
into describing Jamal Khashoggi.  
   
I can tell you how we acted and what we have done over the past two
years and — and be very clear on what the White House has take — the
actions that White House has taken.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  Another Africa question for you today.  With
news that the U.N. Ambassador is heading to the continent and Janet
Yellen is there right now, what messages are these two top Cabinet
officials trying to send to African countries broadly?  How do you
combat concerns and perceptions that the continent is yet again being
used as a battlefield for a proxy war between East and West?  And then
also, how do these visits lay the groundwork for the President’s
promised visit to the continent?  And any details on that would be
awesome.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, to your last question first: I don’t have
anything to preview about the President’s visit — potential visit to
South — to Africa.  We have said that he is going to make a visit; just
don’t have anything to share at this — at this time.   
   
So our partnership in Africa is not about — about other nations.  Our
partnership there, it’s — as demonstrated by our commitments at the
U.S.- Africa Leaders’ Summit, the United States sees African countries
as genuine partners and wants to build relationship based on mutual
respect.   
   
That’s what you saw at the summit.  And that’s what the President has
been consistent on, and that’s what we want to see.   
   
Our focus is on Africa and our efforts to strengthen these partnerships
across a wide range of sectors spanning from businesses to health to
peace and security.   
   
Building on those efforts, we’ve had Secretary Blinken and Secretary
Yellen travel to the region very recently.   
   
And as you noted, we have Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s upcoming
travel to Ghana, Mozambique, and Kenya.  And that’s going to be from
January 25th to the 29th.   
   
The Ambassador’s — this is going to be the Ambassador’s third trip to
the Sub-Saharan Africa.  And since she took up her position as the U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations, she’s gone three times under this
current tenure that she’s currently doing.   
   
And you will continue to see us following through the President’s
commitment and to step — and to step up our engagement across Africa
this year and beyond.   
   
And, look, this is a commitment.  We saw it when we put the summit
together with 49, 50 heads of states who were here, right here in D.C. 
And that was over three days.   
   
And the President participated in the summits, his team participated in
the summit, and we talked about issues that really mattered to the
continent and issues that really mattered to us as well.   
   
Q    Can you just share why those specific countries were chosen?  You
just mentioned Kenya, Mozambique, and Ghana.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I would refer you to — to the U.N., to the
Ambassador’s office.  As I said, it’s her third trip.  Right?  So she’s
gone two other times.   
   
And so I would refer you to their specific strategy on why these three
countries.   
   
Go ahead, Courtney.   
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask if you have any information at this
point about the release of the budget for next fiscal year.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, this — the President is looking
forward to releasing his budget to the American people.  Clearly, that’s
something that is important for this President to do.   
   
And the OMB — his team at the OMB is working very, very hard in — in
getting that done and timing, and obviously his budget for 2024.  And —
and don’t have any — don’t have a time for when this is going to
happen.  But again, this is something that he wants to make sure that he
— he wants to share with Congress and the American people, and it’s a
priority to him.   
   
Q    It used to be at the beginning of February.  And when you entered
the administration, I don’t think you all have met that deadline yet, or
that timeframe yet.  Does that have anything to do with when last year’s
appropriations were done?  I mean, what’s affecting why you wouldn’t
have a date yet?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the omni- — omnibus — the timing of the
omnibus late last year certainly has an impact on the budget’s timing,
but certainly we’ll be in touch with when we’re ready to share the
President’s 2024 budget.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll go around.  
   
Q    Thank you.  There was reporting from Japan that the U.S. decided it
will not deploy land-based medium- and intermediate-range missiles to
Japan.  Can you confirm this decision and say what is under
consideration in terms of where the missiles will be deployed?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, according to the Department of Defense, there are
no plans to deploy capabilities to Japan that range 500 — that range
beyond 500 kilometers.  So, I don’t have anything more to share.  I
would refer you to the Department of Defense.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    When the President speaks on the economy later this week, how much
of that will be talking about his own record and how much will be
warning about what Republicans in Congress want to do, such as the sales
tax?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, just a little bit of what he’s going to say — as I
announced last week, for those who may have missed it.   
   
On Thursday, President Biden will deliver remarks on the economic
progress we have made since he took office.  The President will contrast
his plan to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, and
to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare with the
congressional Republican plan to cut Social Security, Medicare, and
other vital programs and impose a 30 percent national sales tax that
will increase taxes on working families.   
   
His remarks, will — will be in Springfield, Virginia, with union workers
who are benefiting from his economic plan.  
   
And so, we’ll have more to share on that tomorrow.  But, again, as you —
as you just heard me lay out, it’s going to be a contrast with what
we’re trying to do and what the — with what the Republicans have laid
out.  
   
But again, the President has always been very clear: He’s willing to
work in good faith with — in a bipartisan way with Republicans to
continue to deliver on the economic successes that you’ve seen from this
administration in the last two years.  
   
Okay.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I want to ask about the — follow up on the story
of Chinese companies providing assistance for Russia.  Did you have a
clear sense whether the Chinese government is aware or approving this or
not?  
   
And my second question is on Turkey.  Can you please answer this —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m sorry.  Can you say your first question
again?  It’s just hard to hear because you’re —  
   
Q    Yes.  About that Chinese companies providing assistance for
Russia.  Do you have a clear sense whether the Chinese government is
aware of that or not?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I can’t speak to that: if the Chinese government
is aware of that or not.  We’re closely monitoring the situation, as I
just stated earlier, as we have been since the war started.  And we will
continue to communicate to China the implican- — implications of
providing material support to Russia’s war against Ukraine.  Don’t have
anything specific on what they know or not know, but we’re certainly
always communicating with them.  
   
Q    And on Turkey, yesterday, President Erdoğan said that Sweden should
not expect that Turkey would support Sweden to join NATO over Quran
burning.  How do you respond to his comment and al- — and also to that
incident?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I talked about this a little bit yesterday about
what — how we see this.  And we have said before — many times before —
that Finland and Sweden are ready to be NATO Allies.  That’s how we see
things.  Both are members of NATO’s Partnership for Peace and NATO’s
Enhanced Opportunities Partnership.  Their militaries work seamlessly
with Alliances’ forces.  
   
Finland and Sweden have already taken concrete steps to fulfill the
commitments they made under the trilateral memorandum of agreement with
Türkiye, signed on the margins of the NATO summit in Madrid, as you all
know.  And that includes substantially strengthening their bilateral
cooperation with Türkiye on key security concerns.  
   
We continue to expect that NATO will formally welcome Finland and Sweden
as members.  This will enhance their security, as well as that of the
Euro Alliance region.   
   
So, as their membership process continues, the United States is fully
committed to Finland’s and Sweden’s accession.  (A reporter sneezes.) 
The strength of that support — bless you — can be seen in our Senate’s
overwhelming bipartisan support for a vote for their membership.   
   
And that — and so, again, that’s — that’s where we stand on that
particular matter.  
   
Okay, go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  In the last several weeks, major IT companies — like
Google, Microsoft, Amazon — have fired thousands of IT professionals.  A
significant number of them are either Indian Americans or Indian IT
professionals.  So, two questions.  These companies are saying that a
recession is on the horizon; that’s why they’re firing these people. 
Does the President think that there is a recession coming up?  
   
And secondly, these Indian IT professionals who are on H-1B visa, they
have to leave the country in 60 days.  These people who have the
families and kids are studying here, their house and mortgage — they’re
asking for more time to stay here so that they can find an alternative
way to sustain them.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, more broadly — I’m just not going to speculate why
companies — individual companies have made specific personnel
decisions.  That is for them to speak to.  But, you know, you — you
don’t have to make — take my word for it.  Our economy is continuing to
grow in a steady and stable manner as we have — you’ve heard us from
here.  And you just have to look at the economic data, when you look at
the CPI data, you look at the PPI.   
   
And so, more broadly, again, when it comes to economy, layoffs remain
near record lows, according to job opening data.  
   
Again, I’m just not going to get into specifics on why this is
happening.  This is something for indivi- — individual companies to
speak to.  
   
And — and, look, the President has said this many times:  He’s going to
do everything that he can to make sure this is an economy that works for
everyone, that works from the — from the bottom up and middle out.  And
that’s what you’ve seen from his economic plans.  
   
But, you know, the President understands firsthand how the impact of
losing a job can have on a family.  He understands that very
personally.  But I’m just not going to get into individual specifics.  
   
Q    And the visa status of those who have been fired — how can they
stay here in this country?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any specifics on — on that, when it comes
to how they can stay here.   
   
What I can say is — speak more broadly about what we’re seeing through
the data.  What — don’t want to comment on individual companies.   
   
We can — I can speak to what the — how the economy has actually been
more of a stable and steady growth because of the President’s actions.  
   
Go ahead, Laura.  Go ahead, Laura.   
   
Q    Hi.  Heading into this meeting with the congressional Democratic
leaders, is there anything you can tell us about the relationship
between President Biden and Leader Jeffries?  Obviously, we know about
his relationship with Speaker Pelosi before, and he goes way back with
Schumer.  But what kind of relationship, if any, does he have with
Congressman Jeffries?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President sees Congressman Jeffries — Leader
Jeffries as a vital partner in this and is looking forward to continuing
to — to work with the congressman and also is proud to work with — with
the congressman closely as we — as we push forward on our shared agenda,
our shared priorities in the 118th Congress.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Thanks, everybody.  We’ll see you tomorrow. 
Thank you.
