James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

12:50 P.M. EST    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Hi, hi, hi. 
Happy Friday.  I think it’s Friday.  
   
All right.  So, today, the United States will demonstrate our continued
enduring commitment to Ukraine’s ability to defend itself with the
announcement of over $3 billion in new military assistance to Ukraine,
including $2.8 billion drawdown for Ukraine, the largest yet.  
   
My colleagues at the Department of Defense will brief on this in further
detail later this afternoon.  But the package is expected to include the
Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles we announced just yesterday,
self-propelled howitzers, MRAPs and other armed personnel carriers,
GMLRS rockets, surface-to-air missiles as well, anti-vehicle landmines,
ammunition, and other items from DOD inventories, as well as $225
million in foreign military financing for Ukraine to build the long-term
capacity and modernization of Ukraine’s military.   
   
Today’s assistance also includes $682 million for regional partners and
allies on NATO’s eastern flank to incentivize and backfill donations of
military equipment.  
   
As the President said yesterday, the war is at a critical point, and we
must do everything that we can to help the Ukrainians resist Russian
aggression.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to my colleague, John, to share more about
the President’s upcoming trip to Mexico City and take any questions that
you may all have on this new PDA announcement to Ukraine.  
   
Okay.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No problem.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Good afternoon, everybody.  The President is very much
looking forward to heading to Mexico City for the North America Leaders’
Summit next week.  Our partnership with Canada and with Mexico is
crucial to our economic security, prosperity, democratic stability, and,
of course, migration management.   
   
And this North American Leaders’ Summit will give us all an opportunity
to strengthen those partnerships and advance shared priorities for North
America.  
   
As part of the trip on Monday, January 9th, the President will meet
bilaterally with President López Obrador of Mexico.   
   
And then on Tuesday, January 10th, he’ll have a chance to meet
bilaterally with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada.   
   
And then later that day, later on Tuesday, all three leaders will gather
together for the formal agenda of the 10th North American Leaders’
Summit.  
   
Since taking office, President Biden has built and strengthened solid
institutional frameworks for cooperation in North America on issues
that, of course, span economic development, to security, to migration,
all in order to produce concrete results and in a way that will help
extend all that security and prosperity well into the future.  
   
As an example, quite frankly, of the strong cooperation that we have in
the region on migration, we’ve implemented innovative approaches, just
particularly with Mexico, to help address the challenge of irregular
migration, which have led to some significant progress.  And I think you
saw yesterday the President talked about this, as well as Secretary
Mayorkas, and I refer you back to their comments about some of the new
policies and initiatives that are in play to both expand legal migration
and pathways to legal immigration as well as to crack down on
enforcement.  
And we’re also making strides alongside our partners to address the
significant drug issues around the border, particularly with respect to
fentanyl and seizing record levels of that before it enters the
country.  In fact, since August of last year, Customs and Border Patrol
agents have seized more than 20,000 pounds of fentanyl.   
   
It’s an ongoing effort.  It’s not something you can ever take your foot
off the gas on.  And we’re going to continue to do that as well.  And
that will be certainly part of the discussion down in Mexico City.  
   
In fact, as you know, the North American Drug Dialogue, which includes
efforts to increase information sharing on precursor chemicals and
strengthening our public health approaches for prevention, harm
reduction, treatment, and recovery services has been very successful. 
And again, we’re going to continue to work on that.  
   
Redoubling our efforts to address climate and enviro- — climate and
environmental challenges by undertaking efforts to reduce methane
emissions in the waste sector and decarbonize public transportation also
will be on the agenda here at Mexico City, as will strengthening and
expanding North American supply chains for semiconductors, critical
minerals, and electrical — I’m sorry, electric vehicle batteries.  
   
All these investments in North America will benefit the United States. 
And by taking advantage of game-changing legislation under the Biden
administration, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and
Science Act, President Biden will use this North American Leaders’
Summit to keep driving North America’s economic competitiveness and help
promote inclusive growth and prosperity.  
   
So, a very, very exciting couple of days in Mexico City.  The President
is very much looking forward to that.   
   
And I’m happy to take some questions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, John.  Can you talk about any national security
implications of the fact that there are no members of the House who are
sworn in at this time?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We have vehicles to continue to communicate with both
chambers of Congress.  And that communication will continue throughout
the foreseeable future.  
   
So there’s no particular worry or concern that national security will be
put at — at, you know, significant risk here because we do have ability
to continue some level of communication.  
   
Q    But there are members who have said, for example, they can’t get a
security clearance right now so they can’t receive classified
briefings.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Sure.  
   
Q    They’ve sent requests to various agencies, like the IRS.  They’ve
been told they have to wait until they’re sworn in.  So what kind of
impact does that have on the government’s ability to function?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, there’s obviously going to be some impact here as new
members are waiting to get cleared and get committee assignments and all
that.  I don’t want to suggest that there’s not going to be any national
security impacts.   
   
But in terms of the American people worrying about whether the federal
government and this administration can continue to look after our
national security interests, that should not be an overriding concern. 
There are vehicles and ways in which we can continue to communicate key
priorities and developments, even such as the notification over this
presidential drawdown package that Karine just announced.  All that was
done appropriately.  So that work will continue.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Can we talk about why is now the right time to
send Bradleys to Ukraine?  Obviously, the Ukrainians have been asking
them — for them for some time.  Is there any kind of new security threat
that’s motivating this?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, the aid that we provide Ukraine from a security
perspective is very much in keeping with two things:  one, the needs
that they have in the moment and our ability to provide those
capabilities to them, but also taking a look at what the fight is likely
to be going forward.  
   
Now, you know, in recent weeks, we’ve all been very focused, rightly so,
on what was going on around Kherson, down in the south.  But the
fighting in the east, particularly in the Donbas region, has been
particularly vicious in recent weeks.  And we see every indication that
the Russians continue to want to propagate their efforts in the Donbas,
particularly around Bakhmut.  And we’ve talked about that, I think, at
some length.  
   
In that area of Ukraine, it’s a lot of farmland, a lot of open ground,
and it lends itself well to the kinds of capabilities that are in this
particular PDA package.  And the Bradley Fighting Vehicles are very
significant in terms of being able to do what we call “combined arms
maneuver warfare.”   
   
You might remember the Pentagon just recently said they’re going to
start training, at a battalion level, Ukrainian troops outside the
country on combined arms maneuver, because that’s really what they need
to help continue to improve their ability in that area of Ukraine.  
   
So it’s very much tied to the war that we’re seeing on the ground right
now and what we anticipate we’ll see throughout the winter months.   
   
We also talked about the fact that we didn’t think fighting was just
going to stop in the winter, that these two sides were going to continue
to slug it out, and that — and that has occurred.   
   
And I think, again, the Bradleys are just one capability.  Take a look
at the whole package when you see the Pentagon — they’ll lay it out more
in depth this afternoon.  But you’ll see that the whole package that
goes along with this is well suited to the needs that the Ukrainian
armed forces have right now.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I have two foreign policy questions, John.  First, on —
the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the administration easing
tension with Saudi Arabia, and they might not go ahead with the review. 
Can you comment if this is actually accurate?  And how far are we in the
review?  
   
And second, on Turkey: As you know, there’s this kind of rapprochement
between Turkey and the Assad regime, with the mediation of the
Russians.  Do you believe that this is the right step from the
administration’s point of view?  And will the Kurds pay the price for
this?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  To the second question, the answer — short answer is: No. 
We haven’t normalized relations with the Assad regime, and we — we
wouldn’t encourage any nation-state to normalize relations with the
Assad regime.  
   
But we’ll see where these talks go and what actually comes out of this. 
I don’t want to get ahead of where they are.  But we obviously don’t
support normalization with Assad.  
   
On — I’m sorry, your first question was?  
   
Q    On the Saudis.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Saudis.  Thank you.  The President has been consistent and
clear that he wants this bilateral relationship, like any bilateral
relationship we have, to be well suited to the interests of the American
people and to our national security.  And we’re going to continue to
take a look at that relationship.  
   
Look, Saudi Arabia is a strategic partner — 80-some-odd years.  And —
and it’s important that that strategic partnership continue, but it’s
also important that it continues in a way that is completely consistent
with our values and our interests.  And the President wants to continue
to take a look at it to make sure that that’s the case.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  John, two question.  One, you outlined a little
bit, but I wonder if you could say what specific actions the
administration would like to see Mexico take to stop fentanyl production
and smuggling.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I don’t want to get ahead of the actual summit. 
They’re going to talk about a lot of this.   
   
And Mexico already has taken significant steps.  You saw just — I think
it was yesterday, addressing — sorry, arresting Mr. Guzmán, a key
fentanyl trafficker.  That is not an insignificant accomplishment by
Mexican authorities.  And we’re certainly grateful for that.   
   
So we’re going to continue to work with them in lockstep to see what we
can do jointly to try to limit that flow.  But it’s significant.   
   
And, again, as I said, you know, we haven’t — it hasn’t — it’s not like
we haven’t been — had some success.  I mean, 20,000 pounds is a lot, but
it just keeps coming.  And so we’ve got to make sure that — that we are
doing what we have — what we have to do in our own authority and on our
own — obviously in sovereign U.S. territory, but that we’re continuing
to work with Mexico and partner with them.   
   
Q    Just one follow-up.  Was the U.S. involved in any way in Guzmán’s
arrest?  And is there a push for him to be extradited?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  This was a Mexican operation, so I’ll certainly let the
Mexican authorities speak to that.   
   
And I’ll refer you to DOJ on extradition issues.  That’s — that’s beyond
my scope.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jacqui.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  John, with the new parole program that you guys
announced yesterday, is there any risk that because now those who don’t
qualify for the program, they won’t have any incentive to turn
themselves in, as a lot of people have been doing when they illegally
cross the border, and that that could increase the number of
got-aways?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That — first, I would definitely refer you to DHS for more
detail on this.  What we’re trying to do with this new parole program —
because we watched how it worked with Venezuela — by putting in place a
process where a legal pathway was available, we were able to reduce by
90 percent Venezuelans who were trying to come into the country
illegally.  So we have some — we have some tangible results here that we
can — that we can apply now to these additional three countries that
Secretary Mayorkas talked about yesterday.  And so we — we feel there’s
great promise here.   
   
The idea, Jacqui — and I couldn’t speculate about your question.  But
the idea is to increase the legal pathways available to people and put
in place a nice, safe, orderly process that is humane and gives them the
hope that they — that they’re looking for, at the same time being able
to crack down on enforcement.  And cracking down on enforcement is not
an insignificant part of what the President announced yesterday,
including adding now another 300 agents to the border.   
   
And he looks forward to going down there this weekend and seeing that
enforcement and that process in place for himself.  
   
Q    I understand what the objective is, obviously.  But as the pilot
program with Venezuela was happening and did reduce the number of
crossings by 90 percent over those first few weeks that it was in place,
the number of got-aways did skyrocket too at the same time.  And so my
question is: Does the fact that if you cross illegally, it makes you
ineligible for this program — does that now disincentivize people to
turn themselves in and then make part of this problem harder?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s difficult for me to get in the mind of every individual
that may have — may have already crossed over illegally, though what
they ought to know is that we are going to be making sure that we’re
increasing our ability to enforce these policies and to crack down on
illegal entry and end —  
   
Q    With more agents?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m sorry?  
   
Q    With more agents or —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, I mean, obviously.  The President is going to order
another 300 to the border, and he’s working in lockstep with Secretary
Mayorkas on whatever other avenues might be appropriate in terms of
better enforcement.  
   
But, again, I can’t get in the mind of everybody who may already be in
the country.  They ought to know that, as Secretary Mayorkas I think
said very eloquently yesterday, “We’re not only a nation of immigrants. 
We’re a nation of laws.”  And we’re — we are going to scrupulously
follow the law.  And we expect them to as well if they want to become
legal citizens of the United States.  
   
Q    Can I follow up quickly on Ukraine, John?  When will those Bradleys
arrive?  And will they have tank-killing TOW missiles on them?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to get into the specific kitting out of each
Bradley vehicle.  They’re —  
   
Q    Is that a part of this package?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t — again, I won’t get — I’ll let the Pentagon speak
to the details of how each vehicle may be or may not be fitted out.   
   
It will be some time before they can actually get into country.  And I
couldn’t give you a date certain on the calendar.  What I can tell you
—  
   
Q    Yeah.  Is that days, weeks, months, do you know?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, what I can tell you is that we’re going to do it as
fast as we can.  And this is not a system that will require an
exorbitant amount of training for the Ukrainians.  I mean, it’s a
fighting vehicle.  And it’s, again, very well suited to combined arms
warfare, but it’s not so sophisticated that it’ll take them very long to
learn it, not only to operate it, but to maintain it.   
   
And as your question, I think, alludes, there are different ways you can
fit these things out for the — for the fight that you’re in.  And I
don’t know — and, again, I’d refer to my Pentagon colleagues — I don’t
know that they’ve made all that — all those decisions per each vehicle
just yet.   
   
Q    You just asked — you were just talking about training.  Just to
follow up on that.  On Patriot missiles, has that training begun in
earnest somewhere in Europe?  They wouldn’t identify the third country
in which it would occur, but has that training begun of the Ukrainians
who would use the Patriot battery?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware that the training has actually begun.  I
certainly would refer you to the Pentagon for specifics on that.   
   
What I can tell you is that the training will be held outside of
Ukraine.  
   
Q    Then, let me ask one separate question on the border then, to
follow up one she was asking about: There’s reporting that El Paso has
cleared the downtown of these expansive migrant camps that have grown
there, in advance of the President’s arrival.  Is the President going to
see a sanitized version of El Paso when he arrives at the border on
Sunday?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President is very much looking forward to seeing for
himself firsthand what the border security situation looks like,
particularly in El Paso.  He’s very much also looking forward to getting
a chance to talk to Customs and Border Patrol agents on the ground who
are actually involved in this mission to get their firsthand
perspectives of it.   
   
Q    Thank you, John.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Thank you.  John, so first of all, I would like to follow up on
Ukraine.  Was the decision to provide the biggest package to the date
connected or made in response to a possible new Russian offensive and
escalation?  And do you think Ukraine is much better prepared now to
counter this new offensive if Russia do that — if it comes from north,
for example?  
   
And a second one on Mexico.  Should we expect any agreement or
announcement of funds while the President is in Mexico?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t get ahead of the President’s trip to Mexico and any
announcements he might make.  I will reserve that for — for the
President.   
   
Again, very important agenda, three big topics: climate change,
migration, and drugs, particularly fentanyl.  And the President is
looking forward to addressing all three.  I’ll save the announcements
for the President.  
   
As for the timing, these drawdown packages, as you know, have been
occurring about every couple of weeks or so.  So this is the latest
iteration.  I think it would be incorrect for you to conclude that the
amount — specific amount was sort of driven by rumors or — or reports of
a Russian counteroffensive.  They are driven by an ongoing, iterative
conversation that we’re having with Ukrainians literally every day about
the fight that they’re in now and the fight that we expect them to be in
going forward.   
   
We said — as I said earlier, we said weeks ago we did not expect the
fighting to stop in the winter.  It hasn’t.  In fact, in some places,
it’s become even more vicious, Donbas particularly.  And so we want to
make sure that the Ukrainians are well kitted out and well suited for
the fighting that’s in — that they’re going to be facing in the next
couple of months.  
   
Q    Do you think Ukrainians are better prepared now to counter —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The Ukrainians have — have — I mean, better prepared?  They
are — they are and have been able to maintain a quite impressive level
of readiness for what they’re facing.  And what’s been really impressive
to see is the way that they have modified not only their needs, but
their abilities in the field to the fighting that they’re facing —
obviously, we were all talking — we’re talking about Bradleys today, but
recently we’ve been talking about air defense capabilities — and the
innovative way in which they’re using what is being provided to them.   
   
So I don’t — they never fail, I don’t think, to surprise or impress with
their ability to adapt in real time to the challenges that they’re
facing and to be quite candid and honest and forthright with all of
their partners, including the United States, about what they need to
continue to do that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, MJ.  
   
Q    John, I have two questions for you.  The first one is following up
on Nancy’s earlier question about the national security concerns or
potential concerns as there remains no Speaker of the House and not a
functioning House of Representatives.  Would you be giving the same
answer if this process were to drag on for a couple more days, say we
ask the same question a week from now?  In other words, can you continue
to, you know, contain the national security concerns for a while or
indefinitely?

MR. KIRBY:  I mean, clearly, we’d obviously love — and the President
talked about this — we’d — we’d prefer to see all of this resolved as
soon as possible.  It’s — it’s not — not just from a national security
perspective but from a democratic perspective.

I don’t want to speculate about how long things would go before there
would be, you know, some — a deeper concern about national security
implications.  I can just tell you that we’re confident that we can
continue to defend the United States of America while House Republicans
are working their way through this process.

We’re going to stay on top of that challenge every single day.  And we
have, again, vehicles in place to communicate as appropriate with both
chambers of comer- — Congress right now.

Q    And then, just on the President’s visit to the border, does he have
a desire to, does he have a plan to meet with asylum seekers while he is
there?

MR. KIRBY:  I — I won’t get ahead much more of the schedule than what
I’ve done.  He’s really going to focus on two things.  And that’s the
migration challenge, obviously, and having a chance to meet directly
with those who are in charge of it.

The other thing I failed to say when I was talking to Jacqui and Peter
was that he also wants to focus on the flow of fentanyl, too.  So I
think you’ll see him have opportunities to take a look at that and learn
a little bit more about what we’re doing on the fentanyl side.

Q    So he may meet with some asylum seekers, but you just can’t —

MR. KIRBY:  I — I don’t — I don’t have anything more on the schedule to
speak to with specifi- — with specificity.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    So, John, just following up on the — on the border.  I — I spent a
long time covering immigration stuff during the Trump years.  I — I
never saw more damning quotes from immigration advocacy groups and human
rights groups  
during the Trump years than — as I saw yesterday towards this
administration.

Just reading one to you, Eleanor Acer, who is one of the leading
advocacy people — heads up a refugee group, called what the President
did yesterday “a humanitarian disgrace.”  And that was echoed across the
board in literally scores of emails I got from every humanitarian group.

What do you all — what does the administration say to the overwhelming
consensus from people who advocate on behalf of asylum seekers and
refugees and migrants that what the President did yesterday was “a
humanitarian disgrace”?

MR. KIRBY:  Well, obviously, we take a different view.  What we would
say is that the — this is a President who understands that safe and
legal immigration into this country is a key cornerstone of our own
security and prosperity, and that he is advancing ways to improve those
legal pathways to entry.

I mean, he increased or — dramatically increased the number of refugees
that we’re willing to take in from nations in the hemisphere.  He also
improved the process by which people seeking asylum can do that in,
again, a legal, safe way.  And we’re also, obviously, have to make sure
that — that it’s legal migration we’re focused on and that the illegal
migration is curbed as best as we can through more — more stringent
enforcement mechanisms.

So it’s a balance, and the President is trying to strike that balance. 
But he is — and I think you saw it in the — in all the initiatives that
were announced yesterday.

I mean, there’s a — you know, striking that balance, you can’t forget
that you — we do, as a nation of immigrants, have an obligation to
provide better tools and pathways for them to come in.

I will say this: On his first day in office, he put before Congress an
immigration reform bill that he — that has yet to be acted on.  We are
dealing with immigration laws and processes that are decades old,
Michael.  Decades old.

So the answer to the critics is: First of all, we obviously take a
different view, in terms of the President’s priorities.  And if you take
a look at the package, you’ll see that it is very humane in its — in its
structure.  But we’ve got to have the help from members of Congress. 
And this is not something that he hasn’t focused on.  In fact, he has
been focused on it since the very first day.  
   
Q    Do you understand their points? 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Michael.  Go ahead.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  John, the parole program obviously was designed
to address nationals from Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela arriving at the
southwest border.  But, as you know, a lot of Cubans and Haitians —

MR. KIRBY:  And Haitians, yeah.

Q    — in particular are crossing the —

MR. KIRBY:  The Strait of Florida —

Q    — Florida Strait by sea.  Very dangerous journey.

MR. KIRBY:  Incredibly.

Q    How — how does this plan at all address those individuals?  What
should the individuals considering that path take from this?

MR. KIRBY:  Secretary Mayorkas talked about this, too, yesterday.  And
obviously, our message to them is: Don’t take that journey.

I myself have sailed those waters, and it can be treacherous,
particularly at this time of year.  And if you’re in a — an unsafe craft
or a craft that’s not made for — for those seas, it’s very, very
dangerous.

So the first message is: Don’t take that journey.  There are legal
pathways.  The President is opening up more for people from those
countries to — to get into the United States.  And we want them — we
want them to use those legal pathways, which we are now, again,
improving.

Q    But will those individuals — they’re not going to be removed to
Mexico, for example.  So are they more likely to get an interview based
on a credible fear claim if they make that journey?  That’s the question
that a lot of these individuals are asking.

MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’d refer you to DHS for more detail on this.  I’m
not an expert on that particular process.  We — the — we want people to
use — and, of course, Secretary Mayorkas talked about this yesterday —
now, you know, there’s a new app here in place for people to — to be
able to apply appropriately for asylum specifically.   
   
And if you choose not to try the legal path, then the United States
will, as Secretary Mayorkas said, use the tools at our disposal — tools
which are old, but tools that we have — to stop your entry into the
country.  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jeff.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  John, on Mexico, the U.S. energy industry feels
that the administration is dragging its feet on negotiations over
Mexico’s potential trade violations.  Has the administration considered
taking the step of calling for a panel to resolve that dispute?  And
should we expect any resolution on that from the leaders next week?

MR. KIRBY:  I — I don’t have any information about a panel that would be
stood up.  Again, I don’t want to get ahead the President.  But,
clearly, trade issues will be on the agenda next week.

Q    And one follow-up to my colleague’s question on  
another Russian offensive.  What is — switching topics.  What is the
U.S. assessment right now of the potential for another Russian
assessment as Ukrainians fear?

MR. KIRBY:  Our assessment of another Russian assessment?

Q    I’m sorry, I meant to say “offensive.”

MR. KIRBY:  Offensive.  Well, I —

Q    Your assessment of an offensive.  (Laughter.)

MR. KIRBY:  Very eloquently put.

Q    Not really.  (Laughter.)

MR. KIRBY:  I was trying to throw you a bone, buddy.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Thank you.  I appreciate it.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Let me put it this way, because I don’t want to ever get in
the business of — of being a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry
—

Q    Well, that’s eloquent.

MR. KIRBY:  (Laughs.)  They — they have been on the offensive now for 10
months.  We can’t forget that.  So when I hear all the talk about a
Russian counter offense or of a Russian offensive, you guys have seen
this the same as I do: They’ve been on the offense every single day for
the last 10 months trying to take away Ukrainian lives, Ukrainian
civilian infrastructure, and, certainly, Ukrainian territory.

And we’re seeing that play out right now, as you and I are talking,
Jeff, in Bakhmut and in the Donbas.  They have made incremental gains in
the last few days.

Now, we’ll see where it goes in — in Bakhmut, but in certain places
along that front, they aren’t — they remain on the offensive.

Now, whether they’re going to redouble their efforts and to what degree
that will be successful, I couldn’t possibly tell you, because I just
don’t know what their intentions day to day are.  That’s why it’s so
important that we continue to support Ukraine in the way that we have
been, the package that Karine just announced — biggest one ever. 

But I — I invite you to take a look at what’s in it.  And you’ll see
that we really are trying to tailor the support we’re giving to Ukraine
for the fight that they’re in and the fight that we expect them to be in
over the next couple of months. 

And we certainly expect over the next couple of months that the Russians
aren’t just going to throw up their hands and stop or just dig in.  Now,
there are per- — there are places along the line where they are.  Down
in the south, they’ve largely assumed what we would call a “defense in
depth.”  They’re not really on the move too much.  But that is not the
case in the northeast, up in the — in the Donbas region.

So, again, I won’t speak for their specific tactical plans.  They have
remained on the offense in places in Ukraine.  We think that that’s
going to continue, certainly for the next couple of months.  And that’s
why this package was so important today.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Mary, last question.

Q    To follow on Michael’s question about the pushback that the
President’s immigration plan is receiving, I guess, to put a finer point
on it, one of the central criticisms is that the administration is
expanding Title 42 while also claiming to — to be preparing for it to
end.  So when it comes to Title 42, are you trying to have it both ways?

MR. KIRBY:  No.  No.  I mean, right now, Title 4- — first of all, as you
pro- — Title 42 is a public health order.  It’s being used and was used
— I’m sorry — was used by the previous administration as an immigration
policy.  It’s not.  What we need is real immigration reform.  And for
that, we need legislation that we have sadly not seen.  
   
It is not designed to be and shouldn’t be used as an immigration
policy.  But we, in anticipation of it going away, and being able to
make sure, under Title 8, we can do the kinds of enforcement activities
and mechanisms we need, yes, we are looking at expanded enforcement
temporarily under 42, with the expectation fully that it will go away.  
   
And that expansion — again, I beg you to keep in mind — is in response
to literally a historic, unprecedented level of migration from south of
us in this hemisphere.  I mean, people that are escaping intolerable
circumstances in places like Nicaragua and Venezuela, Haiti.  
   
So, we do need to keep it in perspective.  The numbers and the scale of
the migration challenge is really not something we’ve seen any time in
the last hundred years or so.  
   
Q    And just one more on this.  Mexico has now agreed to take 30,000
migrants from these four countries who attempt to cross the border
illegally.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s right.  
   
Q    Did the U.S. provide — or are we providing any assistance, any aid
to Mexico to deal with that influx?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware of any specific infrastructure improvements or
that kind of thing.  But I’ll tell you what — I’ll take the question and
ask because I just don’t know.  I’d also refer you to DHS on that.  
   
Q    Thank you, John.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thanks, John.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thank you, guys.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Okay, guys.  
   
All right, just a couple of things.  And then, as you know, we have an
event that the President is doing, so I want to lay this out for all of
you.  
   
So, two years after the assault on the Capitol, the President will host
a ceremony at the White House where he will deliver remarks and award
the Presidential Citizens Medal to individuals who made exemplary
contributions to our democracy surrounding January 6th, 2021.  
   
These heroes demonstrated courage and selflessness during a moment of
peril of our nation.  They include Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police,
election workers, and officials at the state and local level from both
parties.   
   
Yesterday, we announced the names of 12 patriots who will be recognized
this afternoon, and now I have two additional posthumous recipients to
announce.   
   
The first one is Howard Liebengood.  Was a U.S. Capitol Police officer
who defended the Capitol on January 6th.  The son of a U.S. Senate
Sergeant at Arms, Officer Liebengood died after battling
insurrectionists at the Capitol and staying on to restore security in
the crucial days after January 6th.   
   
Officer Liebengood’s painful loss helped change the law to better honor
the unimaginable sacrifice that too many officers and their families
face.  
   
Second, Jeffrey L. Smith was a Metropolitan Police Department officer
who defended the Capitol on January 6th.  As he fought the violent mob,
Officer Smith sustained devastating head injuries from multiple assaults
inside and outside the Capitol.  He died after protecting Congress,
guarding the Capitol, and preserving our democracy.  
   
His passing sparked changes in the law that honor the silent injuries of
our fallen officers.  
   
All of these individuals reflect the best of America, our shared values,
and the President looks forward to celebrating them today.  
   
Now, turning to the President’s week ahead schedule, just a couple of
things.   
   
Later today, as you all know, the President will travel to Wilmington,
Delaware, and he will return back to D.C. tomorrow.  As you just heard —
just heard from my colleague — on Sunday, the President will travel to
El Paso, Texas, and to Mexico City for the North American Leaders’
Summit.  
   
The President will return to the White House on Tuesday evening.  
   
On Friday, the President looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister
Kishida of Japan to the White House to further deepen ties between our
governments, economies, and our people.  
   
Over the past year, the two leaders have worked closely together to
modernize the U.S.-Japan alliance; expand on cooperation on key issues
from climate change to critical technologies, including through the
Quad; and advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.  
   
President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida will build on those
efforts.  
   
Afterwards, the President will head to Wilmington, Delaware, later that
week.  
   
Seung Min, you want to take us — take us — take us out?  
   
Q    I just had a quick follow-up that I was going to ask John about. 
Does the White House believe the arrest of Guzmán was timed
intentionally at all ahead of next week’s summit?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m not going to get into speculation here,
or — from here.  I would have to refer you to the government of Mexico
for — to discuss that particular question.  That is from something for
them to address.  
   
Q    And following up on a version of what Nancy was asking earlier,
does the White House, the administration have any clarity on whether
members of Congress who haven’t yet been sworn in can actually do
services on behalf of their constituents?  Can they contact federal
agencies?  If they can’t interact, then how is the administration
stepping in to help people who need help from the IRS or USCIS or other
agencies?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, our — our administration is going to do everything
that we can, all that it can, to ensure that the House of
Representatives is kept informed as needed, right?  And including, of
course, of — including, of course, on matters of national security, we
are going to do everything that we can from here.  
   
Agencies can continue to help House offices with constituent services to
extent possible, consistent with the law and House rules and practices. 
For more specifics on the individual case works or programs, I would
refer you to those specific agencies.  I know the IRS has come up during
this briefing.  
   
But, look, here’s the thing.  You know, we hope that the House resolves
this soon.  It has been a couple of days now.  And we have important
work to do for the American people.  And so, we have to get back to work
here.  
   
But, of course, the administration is going to continue to do everything
that we can to ensure that the House of Representatives are kept
informed and have what they need on behalf of the American people.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just in terms of comprehensive immigration reform, which obviously
the President has called on Congress to enact over and over again, what
is his sort of theory of the case right now for getting that done?  Will
he be taking his own actions to do outreach to members?  Does he
basically consider that a top priority going into the new Congress?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, first of all, it is a top priority.  I mean, the
President put forth a comprehensive immigration reform on day one.  So,
him doing that that first day of office, the first day that he walked
into the administration and sat behind the Resolute Desk clearly states
that this is a priority for him and will continue to be so.  
   
And look, we will continue to call on Congress to act.  That will not
stop.   
   
And look, I also want to just put this in a broader context here.  The
President inherited a mess because of what the last administration did. 
They herited \[sic\] a — we inherited a mess.  And, you know,
Republicans in Congress made it worse by blocking comprehensive
immigration reform.   
   
And so what you’re seeing from this President is he’s acting — he’s
acting to protect — to continue to protect the border, secure the
border, and also deal with irregular migration.  That is what he’s going
to continue to do that.   
   
So the enforcement measures we announced yesterday will result in more,
not fewer, legal pathways for migration, while easing the pressures on
our broken immigration system, which has been broken for decades.  And
so the NGOs and the border communities that support those arriving at
our southwest border.  
   
But, honestly, yes, the President made an announcement.  He’s made this
a priority.  He’s made other announcement before today on what we’re
doing at the border by — especially with the historic funding that he’s
put forth.  But in order to fix what is happening currently is to make
sure that we have comprehensive immigration reform.  And that’s what
he’s going to continue to call on.   
   
He was very eloquent yesterday.  He talked about the history of this
country.  He talked about how we were a country of immigrants.  He
talked about our responsibility.  But at the same time, we have to make
sure it is done in a legal way and that we have pathways — additional
pathways for folks to do that.   
   
Q    I guess we have a pretty good sense of what it looks like,
typically, when the President sees something as being a top, urgent
legislative priority.  So, you know, will we be getting readouts of him
making phone calls to lawmakers?  Will we see members coming here?  Will
he sort of throw everything he has at this problem that he says he wants
to get fixed?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, there’s been many initiatives that we have
gotten done, especially historic pieces of legislation that the
President has done in the past two years, that we haven’t laid out
everything, right?  If we think about the Inflation Reduction Act, we
didn’t lay out every step of who he was talking to.  Matter of fact,
most of you all were surprised when that was announced — the Inflation
Reduction Act was announced.   
   
So, look, the President is going to continue to have conversations with
member of Congress.  His team will do that on a array of issues that
matter to this White House.  And it matters to this White House because
it matters to the American people.  And so that’s what we’re going to
continue to do.   
   
I do want to address something that was asked abo- — that you, Michael,
had asked about the lack of support that we have received.  Look, I have
— you know, we’ve heard from mayors across the country as well who have
supported, you know, the President’s announcement yesterday.   
   
And so, for example, Mayor — Mayor Todd Gloria, San Diego, California:
The President’s measures “will help expedite legal pathways for orderly
migration and increase funding to nonprofits doing lifesaving work in
our communities.”  That matters.   
   
Mayor — Mayor Ron — Mayor of San Antonio, Texas: “In lieu…” — and this
is Texas — “In lieu of much-needed congressional policy” — as I’ve
stated, which is so important; and he tweeted this — the President “new
action humanely addresses the influx of asylum seekers entering the
U.S.”  
   
Eric Adams — Mayor Adams had — who has been critical — right? — of us —
said: It’s “an important, positive step.”   
   
And so — and I have a few more.  Den- — the Denver mayor; the
Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser; and also Mayor Lightfoot — they all
have said — have said they support the President’s actions.  And I think
that’s important to note as well.   
   
Look — look, we know there’s more work to do.  We absolutely know that. 
And what the President is doing is he’s using the tools in front of him
right now to address a really critical and important issue.  
   
Q    I guess, if I could just — sorry, but —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.   
   
Q    Since you (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  I know, since I called you out, Michael. 
(Laughter.)  
   
Q    I mean, the advocacy folks in the community of people who are
lawyers and advocates and humanitarian experts, what they would say is
the President is using the tools, and he’s using them in a harsh and
unbalanced way.  I mean, I think John referenced the — you know, trying
to balance these — these issues.  And yes, that — that’s true.   
   
But they would argue that the impact, in terms of, you know, sort of the
long-term functioning of the asylum process in the country is
extraordinarily negative.  And they — you know, lawsuits are going to be
filed in the same way that lawsuits, you know, were filed against the
Trump administration over and over and over again about their
immigration policies.  But, you know —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — this time, it’ll be against you guys.  And I guess I just — I
guess I just — that puts this President, who spent so much time on the
campaign trail talking about how — you know, how he wanted to be
different than Donald Trump when it came to immigration issues — I mean,
it just puts you guys in a really awkward —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —  
   
Q    — awkward place.  Doesn’t it?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I have to say, Michael, I take — look, I
understand what you’re saying.  But I do take — you know, I do take
issue with comparing us to Donald Trump, who —  
   
Q    It’s not me.  I’m just — I’m —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no — no, I know you are the messenger, and you
are giving me the information.  I am responding to what you just said,
which is: You’re talking about an administration who had a policy —
right? — that tore babies away from their moms, from their parents, from
their families.  That was the President’s — President — the last
administration — that President’s philosophy or policies.  And that’s
what they did.  And this is not this President.  
   
And just want to list out a couple of things what this administration
has done.  It’s increased work visas, including H-2A and H-2B visas, for
Central America and Haiti.  It restarted the Central American Minors
Program.  It expanded parolee programs for Venezuelan, Nicaragua, Cuba,
and Haiti, as we’ve been talking about these past few minutes.  It
expanded refugee admissions in the Western Hemisphere.  Significantly
expanded TPS for Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua, and many more.  And
created renewed unification parolee programs for families from Haiti and
Cuba.   
   
These are the things that the President is trying to do to make sure we
are doing this in a humane way.   
   
Now, is there work to do?  Is this just one step?  Yes.  And we are
going to continue to work with Congress to make sure that we are truly
fixing this problem.   
   
I’m going to continue to go around.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    So I wanted to ask about how the White House is looking at what’s
happening in Congress right now, in terms of the prospects of
potentially raising the debt ceiling and then, even further, potentially
forgetting even government spending deal come next year.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as it relates to the debt limit, our
position has been very clear here.  We have said that we should not be
using the debt ceiling as a matter of political brinksmanship.   
   
We’ve been very clear: If you look at what Republicans in Congress did
three times — three times during the Trump administration — is that they
were able to — they were able to deal with it in a — in a — in a way
that was responsible, right?  They voted three times, again, to lift the
debt ceiling.   
   
And so Congress must, once again, be responsible.  They must address the
debt ceiling.  It is a shared responsibility to pay previous debts made
by presidents and Congress on both sides.  This is a — this is not a
partisan thing; this should be a bipartisan effort.   
   
And we’re talking about including that $8 trillion in debt from the last
administration. 

So, again — and let me add — and you’ve heard the President say this,
you’ve heard me say this — this is a President that has lowered the
deficit in the — in the largest one-year reduction in U.S. history.  So
he’s putting forth pieces of legislation that is lowering the deficit. 
So we are doing it in a responsible way, and we are asking Congress to
do the same.

Go ahead.

Q    Yes.  You announced, just a few minutes ago, that two additional
officers were going to be awarded medals posthumously.  Why were they
announced today and not yesterday?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No — no particular reason.  I — we just wanted to make
sure that we were able to have something to give to all of you in the
briefing room.  But there’s no — no particular reason. 

We’ve been talking to families, talking to, you know, individuals about
what we were trying to do tomorrow — right? — today, sorry; today is
Friday — on — on this really critical, important day, on lifting up and
honoring the heroes.

There’s no particular reason, but wanted to give you — you all the
opportunity to have a little bit of news in the briefing room.

Q    Did you guys forget them?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.  No, no, no.  No, we wanted to — look, we wanted
to make sure that we gave you guys a little bit of news ahead of the
event.   
   
But, also, we’ve had — we’ve been having conversations with families all
through this week.  And wanted to make sure we did this in a fulsome
way, in a real way, that we captured as many people as we can.  And
we’re not going to capture everyone, right?   
   
But our team has been having those conversations, again, with family
members, with individuals.  And these were two people that we wanted to
make sure that were recognized.  And so we decided to do this in the
briefing room today, ahead of the two o’clock.

Q    And regarding the Mexico trip, the Mexican government is very
excited that President Biden will be flying into the new airport that
Mexico’s president is very fond of —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Really?  (Laughter.)

Q    — and really, really trying to promote.  And I’m just wondering
what was involved in the decision and whether agreeing to fly into that
airport is diplomacy in action or something else.  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, you know, it’s always diplomacy in action. 
Right?  Our diplomacy, our relationship with Mexico, one of our — one of
our closest neighbors — is very important to this President.  We have
been working together with the government of Mexico, at least with this
administration, this past two years.

I don’t have any specifics to lay out how it happened and the magic
behind the decision.  But again, I think it shows how important that
relationship is and — and also, you know, how — how we’re looking to
strengthen that alliance as well.

Go ahead.

Q    Hi.  Thank you so much.

Q    To me?  Or —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, to — I’ve never — who —

Q    Camilo.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Camilo.  Okay, hi.

Q    Hi, Karine.  Yes.  So you’ve addressed some questions about the
border announcement yesterday.  I wanted to ask about a particular
component of it.   
   
We reported today that members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus
expressed serious concerns and frustrations to Secretary Mayorkas and
some administration officials during a briefing yesterday about the
announcement, particularly about this proposed regulation that would
disqualify migrants from asylum if they enter the country illegally and
did not ask for asylum in a country like Mexico. 

Is the administration open to changing that proposed regulation or even
scrapping it in response to this feedback?  And can you respond to the
accusations that this is very similar to what the Trump administration
tried to do back in 2019 to enact a similar asylum restriction?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I just want to say: This is just the
beginning of the rule- — rulemaking process, with the ample time for
comments, further conversations, and discu- — discussion.  New re- — no
new regulations have been issued, much less finalized.  So I just want
to be really clear.

Our Legislative Affairs team, as well as teams of the Department of
Homeland Security, have been in close touch with Congress.  And we’ll
definitely continue that to have those — those conversations.  But I
wouldn’t — you know, I’m just saying that this is just the beginning —
the beginning of that.

As far as a comparison to — again, to the last administration, look, you
know, I would remind you that the Department of Homeland Security and
the Department of Justice are still working, again, through their
proposed regulation.  And so — and so want to be very careful there. 

But I want to also reiterate what Secretary Mayorkas said yesterday:
We’re creating safe and orderly pathways for people who want to seek
asylum in the United States, to do so from where they are, without
putting their lives in the hands of smugglers.  And that is really
important.  That’s why we always try to make sure that the misinfor- —
there is no misinformation out there, because that misinformation
actually helps the smugglers and puts people’s lives at risk.

And, for instance, as the Secretary said, people will be able to apply
via a DHS app on their phone to make an appointment and arrive at a port
of entry to make their asylum claim, or they can seek to enter through
the newly expanded parole processes — parolee processes.

That’s not an — that’s not a — I know people have talked — been talking
about an asylum ban.  That is not an asylum ban.  It’s a safe, orderly,
and humane process for seeking asylum. 

Again, we are going to continue to have conversations with members of
Congress, with other — you know, with other, you know, organizations out
there to continue to have this conversation.  But again, our priority is
to do this in a safe and orderly and humane way.  And that’s the path
that we want to take.

Q    Just a quick question about the President’s trip to El Paso on
Sunday.  Is he open to meeting with frontline Border Patrol agents? 
Because Homeland Security officials have conceded that morale among
those agents is very low.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I think — I think my colleague said that that’s
one of the things that he is going to do, is meet with Border Patrol
agents while he’s down there.  I don’t want to get ahead of — of any
specifics of that trip.

We’ll — we’ll have more of that stop.  We’ll have more to share.  But
that is something that the President is going to do.

Go ahead, Steve.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  New York Mayor Adams, who you quoted earlier,
is requesting a billion dollars from the federal government to help deal
with the migration issue in the city.  New York has reportedly only been
approved for $8 million.  Does the Biden administration have plans to
increase funding for New York and other cities, especially in
conjunction with this new parole program?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as — as — as the Department of Homeland Security
announced yesterday, we are indeed increasing funding available to
border cities and those cities receiving an influx of migrants.

In addition to strengthening ongoing coordination and collaboration
across all levels of government, DHS is also expanding outreach efforts
with cities to provide coordination of resources and technical
assistance.

We have been, indeed, facilitating coordination between the state and
local — I think you’ve heard us say this before, state and local
officials and also — and other federal agencies.   
   
But for any specific on that funding to New York City, I would refer you
to DHS.   
   
But as I just stated, he — the Department of Homeland Security did
announce additional funding.  And so. we are going to make those border
cities definitely a priority as they’re dealing with increased
migration.  
   
Q    And just to follow up on something that Mr. Kirby said, he said
that the people from these four countries are escaping intolerable
circumstances.  I looked at the most recent month of data for people who
crossed the border and how they’re handled.  And it seems that under
this new program — and please correct me if the data is outdated — it
seems like you might have a better chance crossing the border and being
allowed to stay than applying for this program because there are only
30,000 slots per month.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I will go back to what I have said and what the
President has said, I think, very passionately yesterday and very
precisely, which is that, you know, we are doing everything that we can
to secure the border and to deal with irregular migration.  That is a
priority for this administration since day one.    
   
We understand this is one step.  We understand to actually fix what —
what is happening, this broken immigration system that we have seen for
decades now, is to actually get legislation done.   
   
And so, look, you know, what I have said and what many of us have said,
like, we are ready to work.  We are ready to put forth plans as we
have.  And, you know, again, Republicans in Congress and Republicans
official — across — across the country who have done political stunts
are not.   
   
And if they truly want to deal with this issue, they would come to the
table and they would work with us on immigration reform to — true
comprehensive immigration reform.  And that’s what we’re going to
continue to call for.  And that’s what you heard from this President.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Can you tell us why is now the right moment for
the President to visit the border?  And what was the thinking that went
into El Paso specifically?  Did you look at any other locations, or was
that always the place he wanted to go?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, he wanted to assess enforcement operations
and meet local — local officials who have been important partners in
managing the historical number of migrants fleeing political oppression,
as somebody just asked me about, and gang violence in Venezuela, in
Haiti, in Nicaragua, and in Cuba.  This is something that he wanted to
see for himself.   
   
He will also — as I said many times, just moments ago — as you heard him
say — he’ll call on Congress to fully fund his requests for record
resources for Department — for the Department of Homeland Security and
to advance the comprehensive, again, immigration reform and border
security measures that is going to be needed.   
   
I don’t want to get ahead.  You’ll hear definitely from the President,
clearly, in a couple of days, on what he has to say — or, you know, the
next couple of days.  But again, he wanted to see it for himself.  And —
and — and that’s what — that’s what you guys are going to witness.  
   
Q    And one more.  You said, earlier this week, the White House would
release the results of the President’s physical in the next couple of
months.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yep.   
   
Q    Has he completed his physical yet?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have any news to share about where he is
with the physical.  
   
Q    He had said he would do it by the end of the year.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And well, I think I had said, “in a couple of
months.”  I don’t think I’ve ever said end — “end of the year.”  
   
Q    But he — he — he said on Thanksgiving that he had completed part of
it.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Right.  And I was asked and I said, “It will happen in
a — the next couple of months.”  And I’ve also said that it will be
transparent and we will share all the information with all of you just
like we did in back in 2021.  So there will be no change in how we share
that information.  
   
Q    Is there any reason it’s a later timeframe than in 2021?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, if you were — if you watched the President in
November, you saw that he had — he traveled to Indonesia, Cambodia,
North — North Africa.  He traveled across the country.  And so, he had a
very hectic schedule.   
   
And I think that plays into what his doctors have said, right?  His
doctor has said — is that he’s in good health.  He’s in very good
health, and that he’s — leads an active life, as we saw in November and
in December.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks, Karine —     
   
Q    I think we have to gather.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, we have to gather?  Joey, you’re the last one.  
   
Q    Well, real quick.  Following up on that question, I just want to
clarify: Why make the trip now, not six months ago, not a year ago?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we’re clearly heading to Mexico City.   
   
Q    Okay, and —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, it made sense to —  
   
Q    And then, second —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — it made sense to go.  It made sense to make a stop
to see — to see what — what border enforcement operations were like and
meet those local officials who have been — who have been impacted.  
   
Q    And then specifically, what is the President looking for from
Mexico to help with the United States’ immigration and migration
challenges in addition to the — what was announced yesterday — Mexico
willing to accept 30,000 immigrant migrants from each of those four
countries — the return of them?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m not going to get ahead of the meetings that
will be occurring in the next — early next week.  We will have a readout
of those meetings and lay out the deliverables.  And so, we’ll certainly
have more to share.   
   
But look, when it comes to Mexico and Canada, they are our — as you know
— our closest neighbors.  They have been partners with us on this
issue.  Clearly, irregular migration is going to come up as one of the —
as part of the agenda — the next — early next week.  And so we’re going
to continue working with them in this partnership, but I don’t want to
get ahead of the President and the deliverables.   
   
All right, everybody, have a great weekend.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.
