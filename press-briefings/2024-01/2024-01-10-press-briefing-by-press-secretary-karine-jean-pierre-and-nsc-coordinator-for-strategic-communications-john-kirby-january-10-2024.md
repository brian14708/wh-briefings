1:06 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Good afternoon, everyone.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So, this morning, President Biden announced
that a record-breaking 20 million Americans have enrolled in healthcare
coverage through the Affordable Care Act.  This is yet another major
milestone in his work to lower costs for families across the country and
expand access to quality, affordable healthcare.  
   
In addition to record-breaking enrollment for healthcare coverage
through the ACA, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, which every
single Republican member of Congress voted against, we took on Big
Pharma, and we won.  And here are a couple of things that we were able
to do: cap the cost of insulin at 35 bucks for seniors, allow Medicare
to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for the first time ever, and
save millions of Americans an average of 800 bucks per year on their
health insurance.   
   
This collective work matters and it cha- — and it is changing lives. 
President Biden knows that access to care can mean the difference
between life and death and hope and fear — and it is exactly why he
continues to fight to ensure everyone can access the care they
deserve.   
   
I also want to say a word about a tragic anniversary and new actions by
the DOJ today.  One year ago today, President Biden joined many other
Americans in outrage over the brutal murder of Tyre Nichols.  
   
Vice President Harris traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to attend the
celebration of life for Tyre, where she mourned with his family and,
after being called to the pulpit, spoke about everyone’s right to public
safety and right to live free from violence.   
   
Mr. Nichols’s — Mr. Nichols’s death served as another painful reminder
of the profound fear and trauma that Black and brown Americans continue
to experience across many communities.   
   
As the President said, real and lasting change will only come if we can
take action to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again.   
   
Today, the Department of Justice is issuing a new guide for states and
localities to help ensure that specialized crime units like the one
involved in Tyre Nichols’s death are thoroughly accountable to the
communities they serve.   
   
This guide builds on the actions this administration has already taken
to advance effective and accountable policing, including requiring that
federal law enforcement agencies ban chok- — chokeholds; restrict
no-knock warrants; and contribute to a newly established data- —
database for federal law enforcement police misconduct.   
   
In addition to today’s DOJ guide, the President is continuing to urge
Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to advance
accountability, transparency, and public trust in law enforcement across
the nation.   
   
And with that, I will turn it over to the Admiral here, who is here to
discuss the latest development in the Middle East and, of course, in the
Red Sea.  
   
Admiral.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thank you, Karine.  Good afternoon.  As you saw from Central
Command yesterday, Iran-backed Houthis launched a complex attack of
one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, and an anti-ship
ballistic missile into the Red Sea.   
   
Yesterday afternoon, President Biden was briefed by his national
security team — and that included the National Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan and Secretary Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General
Brown, and Secretary Blinken — all on the latest developments in Israel
and in Gaza, but also, of course, these attacks by the Houthis in the
Red Sea.  
   
Thankfully, due to some exceptional work by naval personnel aboard the
aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the destroyers Gravely,
Laboon, and Mason, as well as a ship from the United Kingdom, the HMS
Diamond, there were no injuries, and there was no damage reported.   
   
But make no mistake: At the time, U.S. vessels, commercial and military,
and dozens of other merchant vessels were transiting in the area of this
attack.  Had they been hit, innocent lives very well could have been
lost.   
   
So, we’ll say it again.  These attacks against vessels in the Red Sea
pose a direct threat to the lives, to freedom of navigation, and to
global trade in one of the world’s most critical waterways.  And despite
what the Houthis may say, they are threatening and targeting commercial
vessels with ties to countries all over the world, many of which have no
connection to Israel whatsoever.   
   
These attacks are unlawful, they’re reckless, and they are escalatory. 
The United States has built an international naval coalition of more
than 20 countries that are countering these attacks and protecting
international commerce through what we now call Operation Prosperity
Guardan — Guardian.  And that’s what you saw happen yesterday.   
   
Unfortunately, that operation is required.  And you could see the
results yesterday — the need for those military capabilities.   
   
We’ve issued new sanctions on individuals and entities that are
facilitating the Houthi attacks, and we’re working closely with the —  
   
(A reporter sneezes.)  Bless you.   
   
We’re working closely with the U.N. Security Council members to pass a
resolution to show international solidarity on this critical issue.   
   
The text of that resolution, which will likely be voted on later today,
unequivocally demands that the Houthis cease these attacks.  It also
underscores the Security Council’s support for navigational rights and
stresses that the transit passage of merchant and commercial vessels
through the Red Sea must be able to continue unimpeded.   
   
And earlier this month, as you saw, 14 countries, including the United
States, delivered the clearest warning yet to the Houthis, making it
clear that they will, and I quote, “bear the responsibility for
consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy,
or the free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.”

The United States does not seek conflict.  We do — we do, however, seek
the safe and secure passage of international commerce through the Red
Sea.  And we’re going to continue to coordinate and consult closely with
our allies and partners about the appropriate next steps should these
attacks continue.   
   
Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, (inaudible).

Q    You had strikes against the Houthis under consideration for weeks,
but you’ve also taken pains to prevent this conflict from widening. 
Would strikes potentially escalate, widen the conflict? 

And also, given the nature of the Houthi operations, what do you expect
to achieve?  Could it be harder to strike back at the group because of
the distributed nature?

MR. KIRBY:  Well, let’s not get ahead of where we are.  I won’t — I
certainly won’t speculate about any potential future military operations
one way or the other. 

The best solution to this situation not escalating is for the Houthis to
stop these attacks.  In the interim, since they’ve shown no predilection
to do that, we’re going to do everything we have to do to protect
shipping in the Red Sea.  And I think I’ll just — going leave it there.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Gabe.

Q    Well, along those lines, Admiral, these warnings that you’ve given
clearly haven’t worked.  How do you expect to deter the Houthis?

MR. KIRBY:  The mission for Operation Prosperity Guardian is about
countering the attacks that have been occurring.  And they have been
successful to a fare-thee-well in — in knocking these things out of the
sky.

We call, again — as I said in my opening statement, we call again on the
Houthis to stop these attacks.  And I will repeat what I said in the st-
— when I quoted the statement: They will bear the consequences for any
failure to do so.  And I think I’m just going to leave it there.

Q    And, Admiral, a quick question, if I could, on Israel.  You
mentioned a couple of days ago that President Biden had spoken with
Prime Minister Netanyahu over the holidays.  By our count, that — he
last spoke with him on December 23rd.  If that’s correct, that would
make it 18 days since he spoke with the Prime Minister, and that will be
the longest time that they’ve gone without speaking since the beginning
of the war.

I understand Secretary Blinken is in the region and has been, but if
they haven’t spoken for 18 days, what does that say about their
relationship now as compared to several weeks ago?

MR. KIRBY:  The fact that they haven’t spoken in any period of days —
your count is 18; I’m not going to question your math — doesn’t say
anything about the relationship between the Prime Minister and the
President or between the — the United States and Israel.

These are two men that know each other, have known each other a long
time.  And they’ll — they’ll talk again.  And I have no doubt about it
that there’ll be future conversations.  But I wouldn’t read anything
into the dates on the calendar and what that says about the relationship
one way or another.

And you’re right.  I’m glad you pointed out Secretary Blinken is there
in the region today.  In fact, I think he’s either on his way to Bahrain
right now or he is in Bahrain after wrapping up meetings in Israel.

This is his fifth or sixth time since October 7th.  Believe me, the
connective tissue between the United States and Israel: very, very
tight.  Very strong.

Q    So, you would say his — the President’s relationship with Netanyahu
is as strong today as it was at the beginning of the (inaudible)?

MR. KIRBY:  What I’m saying is: You can’t judge the — the strength of a
relationship based on how many times they talk on the phone.  These are
two leaders that have known each other a long time. 

I’m not going to pull punches; of course, they don’t agree on every
single issue.  And we’re working, you know, through issues right now
with respect to the fighting in Gaza.  But that doesn’t mean that — that
they don’t still have an open mind to one another.  And when either of
them feel like they need to pick up the phone and call, then that will
happen.  I have no doubt in my mind they’re going to talk again.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Chris.

Q    But given the attacks have increased in the Red Sea, have the steps
that have been taken so far not working to deter future attacks?

MR. KIRBY:  I think I just answered that —

Q    I know.  But like —

MR. KIRBY:  — exact question.

Q    But can you say a little more about — I mean, does the
administration think that they need to step up either in direct
retaliation or something else?

MR. KIRBY:  The Houthis have a choice to make.  They — we — we’ve warned
them.  We put ships in the Red Sea.  They’ve got a choice to make.  And
the right choice is to stop these attacks.  And as I said, again — I’ll
say it three times now — they’ll bear the consequences for failure to do
so.

Q    And another question is: The AP has obtained some videotape of a
shooting in the West Bank — some Israeli soldiers probably shooting some
Palestinians, allegedly without provocation. 

Have — is the administration aware of this, the shooting?  And also,
what concerns do you have about, kind of, some of the violence that
you’ve seen in the West Bank and how that could escalate the conflict in
Israel?

MR. KIRBY:  This is the first I’m hearing of that report, so I can’t
speak with any granularity about the level of awareness across the
administration.  This is the first time I’ve heard that, so I’ll have to
take that question back.  But the President has spoken, I mean, from an
early time — I mean, really early on — about his concerns about violence
in the West Bank and that being perpetrated largely by settlers with
extreme views and how much he absolutely opposes that.  Those — that
violence needs to stop.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Selina.

Q    Just on Secretary Austin.  When Jake Sullivan learned that Austin
was in the hospital, did he ask why?  Was he given a reason?  
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, of course, he wanted to know why the Secretary was in
the hospital.  But I’m going to — I’m not going to detail each and every
phone conversation that we’ve been having with the Pentagon since
finding out about this.

But yes, of course, we were all curious to know.  He’s the Secretary of
Defense.  He’s a key member of this administration, so we we’re all very
curious as to what — what put him in the hospital.

Q    So, what answers were the administration given when they were asked
why?

MR. KIRBY:  I think I’ve covered this ad nauseam yesterday.  We didn’t
find out that he was in the hospital until Thursday afternoon.  Jake
informed the Chief of Staff, and both of them informed the President
that evening.  We didn’t have information specifically about his
condition.  And, quite frankly, neither — you know, nobody did.  And it
was just yesterday when the Pentagon announced that what put him in the
hospital were —

Q    So —

MR. KIRBY:  — complications from — from prostate surgery.

Q    So, when the President spoke to Austin, I assume the President also
asked why.  What reason wa- — he was given?  We’re just trying to
understand: When people asked why, did the Pentagon just decline to give
the intr- — information?  Did Austin not say anything —

MR. KIRBY:  The — the call —

Q    — or give incomplete information?

MR. KIRBY:  — between the President and Secretary was very brief, and it
was really focused on making sure that the President passed on his best
wishes for a speedy recovery for the Secretary.

Q    So, was it — was the Pentagon then giving incomplete information? 
You said the whole administration was curious.

MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know how differently to answer this question as I
did yesterday.  We did not know he was in the hospital until Thursday. 
We did not know the condition that put him in the — in the hospital at
that time.  We certainly didn’t know about the prostate surgery that
occurred earlier in December.  We didn’t learn about that in- — that
information until ensuing days.  And certainly, we didn’t learn about
the prostate cancer until yesterday.

Q    And just lastly, we’ve learned that the White House instructed the
Pentagon to release the information to the public after learning there
was no disclosure plan in place.  So, what does that say about
transparency, the fact that the Pentagon did not have a plan to give the
information to the public?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Look, I’m not going to address — I’m not going to address
individual press reports.   
   
Look, making a public statement about what the Secretary’s condition was
and the fact that he was in the hospital obviously made eminent sense. 
And — and I’ll let the Pentagon speak to their process when it — when it
came to — to doing that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Trevor.  
   
Q    On the security situation in Latin America.  I saw the statement
from National Security Advisor Sullivan saying you’re committed to
supporting Ecuadorian security and prosperity and bolstering cooperation
with partners to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.  What is
the U.S. position on Ecuador and other Latin American countries using,
kind of, extrajudicial measures, states of emergency in order to deal
with these gangs?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, so, first of all, the — our concern is over the
violence and seeing that that stops.  And as you saw from Secretary —
Mr. Sullivan’s tweet, we strongly condemn these recent attacks.  And we
are committed to helping support security and prosperity by — for the
people of Ecuador.  
   
I would just say, look, we’re monitoring the situation.  We’re willing
to take concrete steps to improve our cooperation with the government of
Ecuador as — as they begin to deal with the violence and the — and the
stressors on the — on the population that this violence has — has
occurred.  And I think I’ll just leave it at that.  
   
Q    What kind of support are you providing to them or were you willing
to provide to them?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We haven’t had a specific conversation about exactly what
that would mean.  But I would walk you away from any consideration of
U.S. military troops or anything like that.  There’s no plans for that,
and we ought to just kill that right now.   
   
But — but, certainly, we were willing to talk with the government of
Ecuador about what they might need.  Could be maybe some investigative
help, that kind of thing.  But that’s sort of what the lane is right
now.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, M.J.  
   
Q    John, last week, the administration said that it was issuing its
last warning to the Houthis.  So, are we about to see a different
response from the U.S.?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m just not going to speculate one way or another about
next steps.  As I said, we’re consulting with our allies and partners
about what the next steps might — might be.  
   
Again, the Houthis have a choice to make here, M.J.  We have made it
eminently clear, as our allies and partners have, that these attacks
have to stop.  
   
Q    Well — but just given that the administration specifically said
last week that the warning last week was the last warning from the U.S,
can you at least say whether we should expect to see something different
coming from the U.S.?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, I cannot say that.  And I’m not going to telegraph
punches one way or the other.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Karine.  And thank you, John.  Happy New
Year.  (Inaudible.)  
   
I have two questions on Russia and North Korea and Hamas.  The first
question: The Israeli government recently showed evidence to the media
that North Korea provided the weapons to Hamas; Hamas attacked Israel
using North Korea weapons.  Meanwhile, all the families harmed by Hamas
are preparing a legal action to hold North Korea accountable.  What is
the United States’ assessment of this?  
   
And the second question: Russian President Putin pointed out the risk of
conflict on the Korean Peninsula this year.  And North Korea continues
to fire artillery fired at South Korea.  Do you think military
cooperation between Russia and North Korea will actually have an impact
on South Korea?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, on your first question, I haven’t seen any indications —
I’m not aware of any indications that there’s been some sort of
cooperation militarily between Hamas and North Korea.  I just don’t have
anything to verify that.   
   
We have talked a long time about the relationship between Russia and the
DPRK and the way that Russia evades — finds ways to evade sanctions and
to continue to do business with North Korea.  And they have at least
expressed publicly some sort of interest in — in sharing goals and
objectives in the region.  We’re watching this very, very closely.   
   
I — I won’t speculate about the degree to which — that we’re seeing
tangible evidence that North Korea is somehow benefiting militarily from
this.  We do know, without question — because I’ve — and I’ve said it
many times — that certainly Russia is benefiting militarily by the
purchase of North Korean ballistic missiles — which we detailed, again,
were used in subsequent strikes in Ukraine — as well as the delivery of
artillery shells.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Michael.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  John, just quickly back on Ecuador.  Do you have a
message for Americans who are in the country about the secur- — security
situation?  And secondly, is there a concern that the crisis there will
further aggravate the flow of migrants to the U.S. southern border?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think too soon to know the answer to your second
question.  And, obviously, that’s something we’re going to watch and
monitor.   
   
I don’t want to step on the State Department.  But, in general, our
message to Americans that are in Ecuador is to please stay vigilant. 
Please avoid areas where you either see or feel or perhaps anticipate
that there could be violence — to stay clear of that.   
   
And then, of course, stay in t- — if you haven’t logged on and — and
gotten the app from the State Department where you can get
notifications, you ought to do that, because I’m sure the State
Department and the embassy there will do everything they can to keep
people informed.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nancy.  
   
Q    On Ecuador.  John, is there any determination that’s been made
about the safety of U.S. diplomatic staff or any discussions taking
place about reducing the U.S. diplomatic footprint in Ecuador?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  None that I’m aware of at this time, Nancy.  This is all
pretty fresh here.  It’s all kind of unfolding as you and I are
talking.   
   
I’d refer you to the State Department.  But I’m not aware of any changes
to our footprint or our force protection posture at the embassy.  
   
Q    And then, going back to Selina’s question about Secretary Austin, I
think what she was getting at — it seems as though there’s a big
difference, when Jake Sullivan was informed by the Pentagon, in whether
he was told when he asked about Secretary Austin’s condition, “We don’t
know because we haven’t been told by the Secretary” versus “We know, but
we’re not going to share that with you,” or “We’ve not been authorized
to share that with you.”   
   
So — so, the question is: Which one was it?  Did — did Pentagon
officials decline to share information they knew with the National
Security Advisor, or did they just not have the information
themselves?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would put it this way: Once we found out he was in the
hospital, we certainly asked all the questions you would think we would
ask to try to ascertain his condition and what — what was — what — what
drove him into the — the hospital.  Of course, we were curious about
that.  He’s the Secretary of Defense, and he’s a key member of the
administration.  
   
I would just tell you that — that that — that that effort to try to get
more information was — was overt and it was genuine and it was certainly
in the spirit of making sure that we understood what was going on with
him and — in terms of his recovery.  
   
I’ll let the Pentagon speak to the information flow, both publicly and
inside the chain of command.  But I can assure you that — that
throughout every step of the way, from the time we were notified until,
you know, yesterday when we all found out that he had prostate cancer,
there was no lack of — of curiosity on our part, no lack of — or
slackening of an effort to try to find out what was wrong with him.  
   
Q    But you don’t want to characterize the responsiveness coming to you
from the Pentagon?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to do that.  
   
Q    Yesterday, House Speaker Johnson met new Taiwanese ambassador.  Has
the President met the new ambassador yet?  If not, does he want to meet
soon?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Has the President — I’m sorry.  Can you repeat the —  
   
Q    Speaker Johnson met new Taiwanese ambassador yesterday. 

MR. KIRBY:  Uh-huh.

Q    So, if — I’m asking if President met the new Taiwanese ambassador
yet.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t believe there’s been a meeting.  And obviously, if
and when there is, certainly that would be something we would make
public.  
   
Q    And North Korea Kim Jong Un say South Korea is their principal
enemy.  At the same time —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  South Korea is what?  
   
Q    Their — their principal enemy.  But at the same time, Kim Jong Un
sent a message with sympathy to the Japanese Prime Minister over New
Year’s earthquake in Japan.  How do you see Kim Jong Un different
approach to the — towards Japan and South Korea?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Do you see — I mean, do you think he implied any message to the
United States?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s a failing exercise for me to try to get inside the
brain of Kim Jong Un.  I — what goes on between those ears is not
something I — I really know about.  I — I can’t — I can’t speak to his
motivations in that regard.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    I just wanted to follow up on a question my colleague asked
yesterday: the Israeli Supreme Court’s decision to prevent journalists
from accessing Gaza and being able to report in Gaza independently. 
Have you had a chance to see if the administration has brought that up
with Israel, Israeli counterparts?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    What is the White House’s stance on that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re — we’re making a good-faith effort to try to get a
better answer to you on that.  I just don’t have it right now.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Danny.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, Admiral.  You mentioned that Secretary
Austin was part of the — the team briefing the President yesterday on
the Houthis.  I just wanted to ask you if you’re — you know, you’re
confident that Secretary Austin is up to speed and fully au fait with
all the — you know, with — with the decisions regarding possible action
against the Houthis.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nadia.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Two questions.  One on Gaza.  The administration
authorized an assessment led by the U.N. to see if civilians can go back
to Northern Gaza.  Would you ask the Israelis or the U.N., in this case,
to do another assessment of how weapons are used, especially against
civilians and also against journalists?   
   
We have unprecedented number of journalists who have been killed. 
Yesterday, you said that maybe they were caught in crossfire.  But human
rights organizations said some of these journalists were targeted.  So,
would you ask for an assessment similar to the one that you
authorized?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We obviously don’t want to see any innocent lives lost.  We
don’t want to see any innocent lives — any innocent people wounded. 
That, of course, includes journalists.  They have every right to be
there to cover this conflict, and we want to see their presence fully
respected and for them to be as protected as possible in a war zone.  
   
There should be no targeting of journalists.  There should be no
targeting of individual civilians.  And we’re going to continue to — to
have those conversations with our Israeli counterparts, as Secretary
Blinken did just yesterday.  
   
Q    And second, as you know, the — you dismissed few days ago the case
that — brought by South Africa against Israel at the ICJ.  Did you read
the indictment?  And if you did, do you believe that cutting off water,
electricity, and fuel on a civilian population does not constitute a war
crime?  By itself, nothing else.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, I read the indictment.  And as I said — and we stand by
what we — what we said about this — we find it without merit.  We fou- —
find it counterproductive.  And I’ll leave it there.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  A couple more.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    So, since the start of the Biden administration, have there been
other Cabinet Secretaries who’ve not been able to perform their duties
but have actually informed the White House?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have that kind of detail for you here today.  I just
— I wouldn’t — there would be no way for me to have that information.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Just a couple more.  Go ahead, sir.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you, Karine.  And thank you, John.  Two
question on Bangladesh, if I may.  The one-sided election in Bangladesh
has concluded, drawing global criticism for its crackdown on
opposition.  The Guardian characterized the election as “overshadowed by
the — by a ruthless crackdown on opposition.”  And the Wall Street
Journal stated, “Bangladesh shows the limits of Biden’s ‘democracy
promotion.’”   
   
In light of your earlier commitment to taking all necessary steps to
reflect the will of the people of Bangladesh and your declaration of the
visa restriction policy ahead of election, what is your response to
concern about the Biden administration’s limitations on democracy
promotion?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We obviously still believe in the importance of viable,
vibrant democratic institutions all over the world.  And nothing has
changed about our desires to see that the aspirations of the Bangladeshi
people are met, and that includes being able to conduct free, fair, and
transparent elections.  
   
Q    I have one more.  Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, a
recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold
Medal, received a six-month sentence on New Year’s Day, widely believed
to be driven by political vengeance from the ruling prime minister.  Is
President Biden aware of this cur- — current situation, considering
Yunus — Yunus’s remarkable contribution to the poverty alleviation
around the globe?  And he was quite (inaudible), and he received
Presidential Medal — Medal of Freedom.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’ll have to take the question.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Going to wrap it up.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You said that Secretary Austin took part in the
conversations regarding the Red Sea.  Do you know if he was conducting
his business from the bedside, or is he released from the hospital?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would refer you to the Pentagon for his whereabouts and
his condition.  It’s our und- — yesterday — at least for where he is
today.  Yesterday, he was still in the hospital when he participated in
that discussion.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Last question.  Go ahead, sir.  
   
Q    Two questions, one on the Houthis.  Given the problem the
administration has had on containing them, how can it be looked at as
anything but a mistake for the fact that they removed them from the
Foreign Terrorist Organization list?

MR. KIRBY:  As I said, we’ve got a review of that designation that we’re
still conducting.  So, I’m not going to get ahead —

Q    (Inaudible.)

MR. KIRBY:  Hang on a second.  I’m not going to get ahead of that.  And
the goal here isn’t to contain the Houthis, just to be clear.  We don’t
want to see these attacks on commercial shipping, and we’re going to do
what we have to do to counter and defend against those attacks.  And as
I said earlier, the Houthi — they have — they’ve — they’ve made certain
decisions up to this time.  They have to make certain decisions going
forward.  And we’ll see what decisions they make.  They will bear the
consequences for those decisions going forward.

Q    And then, one question on General Austin.  Earlier in this
briefing, you said he’s an essential member of the administration.  But
if he can disappear for four days without anybody noticing or really
even seeming to wonder where he is, how essential is he?

MR. KIRBY:  I think I answered this question yesterday with Mr. Doocy
here.  I’ll give you the abridged version. 

When — the — the military operations that have been conducted over the —
over the last week or so, many of those, Secretary Austin was a key
member of briefing the President and right in the middle of determining
the options that the Commander-in-Chief ultimately decided to do.  We
were able to continue to counter Houthi threats in the Red Sea, we were
able to take out a senior militia commander in Iraq, all based on the
advice and counsel that Secretary Austin delivered.

It is not uncommon on any given day here in D.C. that a Cabinet officer
isn’t present for a certain meeting and either can call in by phone or
have a deputy represent them.  That’s the way the interagency process
works. 

Oftentimes, these things are worked at staff levels and then the
principals get involved at the appropriate time. 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right. 

MR. KIRBY:  Okay.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you so much, Admiral.

MR. KIRBY:  Thank you, Karine.

Q    Thank you.

MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, guys.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  You guys still awake?  What’s going on? 
Everyone is so quiet.  (Laughs.)

Q    Are you suggesting that he’s boring to us?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.  (Laughter.)  I’m suggesting you guys are low
energy today.  That’s all.  (Laughter.)

Chris.

Q    So, the President spoke with Speaker Johnson today.  Does the White
House believe that the conversation moved any closer to a deal on
supplemental funding?

And a second thing on this.  Speaker Johnson reportedly told his caucus
that the President does not want to meet in person.  Is that — is that
true?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, what I can do right now is con- — I can confirm
that the President and Speaker Johnson did speak directly.  They spoke
directly today on the phone.  I don’t have any more details to provide. 

I can say this — I’ll add, actually, one more thing is that the
President believed that a call was the most expedient option today.  And
so, that’s why they spoke on the phone.  The President believed it was
important to connect as — as quickly as possible.  Don’t have any more
details about the call.

Q    There’s nothing you can say about what they talked about or where
the — (inaudible) was?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we’re confirming the call.  And we’ve said many
times that we try to keep these conversations private.  But we are
confirming that the President did speak to Speaker Johnson.  I don’t
have anything else beyond that.

Q    And just last thing.  His office says that the Speaker asked for
executive action to shut down the border, secure the border.  Can you
say anything more about that request or how that was received?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have anything more to share.

Go ahead, Nancy.

Q    Was the White House informed in advance that Hunter Biden would be
showing up at the House Oversight Committee’s hearing on Capitol Hill
today?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, here’s what I’ll say, and I’ve said this many
times before: Hunter, as you all know, is a private citizen.  He’s not a
member of this White House.  He makes his own decisions, like he did
today about how to respond to Congress.  And so, I would refer you — any
further questions, any additional questions about — about this process,
certainly, to — I’d refer you to Hunter’s representatives.

Q    Fully agreeing that he makes his own decisions.  But my question
was about whether the White House was informed in advance. 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would just — again, I would say that I don’t have
anything — we don’t have anything else to share beyond that.  He’s a
private citizen, and he makes his own decisions as it relates to this
particular, you know, response.  His particular response to the Congress
is something that he decides on.  And I would refer you to his
representatives.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  First, a whole high school in New York is having
remote classes today because the building was needed to house people who
came into this country illegally.  So, what is the President’s priority
in this case?  Is it the migrants, or is it the students?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just — just clear this up a little bit. 
So, yesterday, New York City informed us that, as a precaution, they
would temporarily relocate migrants staying at Floyd Bennett Field to a
nearby high school.  As of this morning, all migrants have returned to
the facility at Floyd Bennett Field.  And so, anything specific as to
the program and what they decided to do and all of those specifics to
that, I would certainly refer you to New York City for any additional
questions.

Q    But if a working parent had to call out to stay home with their kid
today, isn’t this Biden immigration policy literally taking money out of
people’s pockets?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just — let me just say — I’m going to
actually go back to your first question for a second, because I think I
do need to address that, which is, you know, when it comes to education,
migrants, the economy, the President deals with multiple issues all at
once.  That is his job.  There are multiple things happening all at
once. 

And as it relates to this particular quest- — question that you’re
asking me about in New York City, that is something that New York City
needs to answer to.  That is a — that is a process that they took, so
they have to answer to that. 

And as it relates to migrants and what’s happening at the border, look,
the President has taken this issue very seriously — very seriously by
making sure that, on his first day — which is almost three years — it’ll
be — a couple of weeks, it’ll be three years ago that he put forward a
comprehensive immigration legislation to deal with what’s happening with
the immigration process, obviously, and also the border. 

And this is an issue that’s been going on for decades.  The system has
been broken for decades.  And the President is the one who has taken
action to deal with this while House Republicans do not.   
   
Q    And —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  They get in the way.

Q    And Hunter Biden on Capitol Hill today.  How big of a headache is
that for you?  (Laughter.)

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hunter Biden is a private citizen.  He is not a member
of the White House, as you know.   
   
Q    But the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And I just don’t have anything else to share.

Q    But the last time he was on the Hill, you said the President was
“certainly familiar with what his son was going to say.”

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I did say that.  And here’s —

Q    So, is the official line —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — and what I’m saying today —

Q    — that President Biden —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I’m saying to- —

Q    — does not help him with his business deals, but he does help him
skirt congressional subpoenas?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That is not even true.  That — that is a jump that is
— that is incredibly disingenuous in that question.  What I will say to
you —

Q    Then help us out.  Just tell us —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I am helping you out.

Q    — what the President knew.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m helping you out.  I don’t have anything else to
share.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks.  When is the President’s next physical scheduled?  Last
year, it was in February.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share on the President’s next
physical.  Obviously, we will — once — once that happens, we will be
transparent and share that with all of you, as we’ve done the last two
times.  I just don’t have anything on the books to share.

Q    Given that it’s an election year, that there’s a lot of public
interest in his health, would that transparency include his physician
coming to brief in the briefing room?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything beyond — beyond what I just
stated. 

Go ahead, Selina.

Q    Did the President speak to his son before or after his appearance
on Capitol Hill?  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I’m not going to speak to the President’s private
conversation with his families.  
   
Q    And is there any response to what Representative Nancy Mace said
about Hunter Biden today?  She’s called him, quote, “the epitome of
white privilege,” and that Hunter “should be arrested right here, right
now” and go to jail.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to respond to that.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The White Hou- — White House Chief of Staff was
supposed to meet with Cabinet members today.  I was wondering if you
could confirm that and —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to confirm about a meeting with
Cabinet members today.  What I can share — I don’t know if you’re
talking about the specific memo that — that — that the Speaker’s — not
the Speaker, pardon me — that the Chief of Staff put out yesterday that
went to the Cabinet — the Cabinet members, the agencies about making
sure that they put forward a memo themselves to him that would be for —
for Friday, January 12th, and that kind of highlights their protocols
when it comes to delegation of authority.  That is something that,
obviously, they’re going to get back to us — back to the Chief of Staff
on the 12th.   
   
So, that is something that is happening.  I don’t have a meeting to
confirm with the — the Chief of Staff or Cabinet Secretaries today.  
   
Go ahead, M.J.  
   
Q    Karine, you’ve referred to the Republican impeachment inquiry as a
“stunt.”  The President himself has said that it was a “political
stunt.”  So, I guess, if the whole thing is a stunt, how does the White
House see the President’s son himself pulling a stunt by appearing at
this contempt hearing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have anything else to add.  
   
The decisions that are made by Hunter Biden is — are his own.  He’s a
private citizen.  And I’m just not going to speak beyond that.  
   
If you ask me about the impeachment of — or what the — the GOP and
Congress is doing as they’re — as they’re trying to impeach multiple
Cabinet members, I can speak to that.  But Hunter Biden is a private
citizen.  I’m just not going to speak to that.  
   
Q    Well, you — you have spoken to that.  And, again, you have called
that a stunt in the past.  Right?  I’m just asking —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just don’t have anything else to add.  I — I hear
you for today.  For today, I’m just not going to say anything more.  
   
Q    And can you tell us what the President is up to today?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I have a couple of things I can share with what
the President is doing today.   
   
As he — as he always does, he’s working around the clock, focusing on
the issues that matter to the American people — everyday Americans,
obviously.  
   
I talked at the top about the record-breaking 20 million Americans that
have enrolled in healthcare coverage through — through the Affordable
Care Act.  That’s always his focus, obviously, making sure that
healthcare is available for all.  
   
He is having lunch today with the Vice President.  
   
He was briefed by his national security team this morning.   
   
He spoke directly — as I m- — stated and confirmed to all of you moments
ago — to Speaker Johnson.   
   
And he’s looking forward to traveling to Allentown, Pennsylvania, on
Friday to discuss how communities across America are coming back thanks
to Biden- — to Bidenomics and also Investing in America agenda.   
   
And so, that’s what his day looks like today.  
   
Q    Since — since there isn’t anything on his public schedule, what
would the White House say to any Democrats that might say, you know,
“We’re now getting closer to the election;  the people — the American
people need to see him every day out in public”?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say this.  And I have to be careful.  Right? 
This is an election year.  I am a federal government employee.  I cannot
speak to a upcoming election.  But I certainly can point to the
President’s schedule over the past couple of days.  Right?   
   
He went to South Carolina.  He went to Valley Forge — Valley Forge.   
   
He talked about something that is incredibly important: our democracy,
our freedom, and how we must protect that; how we must do everything
that we can to make sure we keep our democracy strong; and how there’s a
decision for Americans that have to — they’re going to have to make.  
   
He talked — he went to South Carolina, delivered a very similar message,
talking about freedoms.  Went to Mother Emanuel, a — a church that dealt
with an awful, awful shooting and lost nine of their members back in
2015 — a place that he has a personal connection to.  You heard him
then.   
   
And so, look, the President is going to go to — to Allentown to speak
about Bidenomics, Investing in America on Friday.  And you will see a
lot more of this President.   
   
I don’t have anything else to share.  And once we have more to share on
his schedule, I certainly will.  But I want to be really careful not to
speak to 2024.  
   
Go ahead, Jared.  
   
Q    Just a couple of clarifying questions on that call with the
Speaker.  Can you — I’m sorry if I missed it.  Can you say who initiated
that phone call?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything else beyond that.  What I did
say is that the President wanted to make sure he spoke with — he spoke
with Speaker Johnson.  He said that — that — I said that he thought
doing a phone call was the quickest way of doing that.  It was important
for them to — to have a conversation.  I just don’t have anything beyond
that.  
   
Q    And then on the Speaker’s request that the President took executive
action.  Is there action that the White House believes the President can
take in lieu of some sort of agreement, some sort of legislation from
Congress that would help the — the — what’s happening at the border?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we don’t have any executive actions to
announce or that we’ve been looking into or anything like that to — to
share a preview to you at this time.  
   
I can mention the legislation that the President — as I did moments ago
— that he put forward, a comprehensive immigration proposal that he did
on his first day.   
   
Let’s not forget, there is a — there is a bipartisan negotiation
happening in the Senate with Republicans and Democrats on how they can
move forward in a bipartisan way — a bipartisan agreement to deal with
the border security issue that we appreciate, that’s been going in the
right direction.  
   
And so, those are — tho- — that’s what’s happening right now.   
   
You know, GOP in the House — they continue to get in the way.  They do
political stunts.  They get in the way.  They voted in May to eliminate
2,000 Border Patrol agents.  That’s what they’re doing.   
   
And let’s not forget, while that Senate — while those senators were
having — in December were having negotiations, having those meetings —
in the middle of December, House Republicans decided to go home and
start their vacation early.  That’s what they decided to do.  
   
Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Would the White House be okay with another CR to
keep the government funded after the deadline next week?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into the — the technical approach
or the approach of Congress from here.  I’m going to let the
conversations, the negotiations happen — the conversations happen.  
   
Q    Let’s just say that that happens, that there is another CR to avoid
a shutdown.  We could see the President submitting his fiscal year 2025
budget at the same time as lawmakers are still sorting out the fiscal
year 2024 budget.  What does that say about the state of affairs right
now in Washington about these short-term punting of dealing with all of
this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — look, I agree.  This kicking — kicking the can
down the road is not the way that Congress should be operating.  We’ve
been very clear about that.   
   
They have a job to do.  Keeping the government open is one of the basic
things that they can do.  Kicking it down the road — Republicans — House
Republicans kicking this down the road does not help Americans.  It
doesn’t.  
   
In a couple of days, we may see a partial shutdown.  That’s not what we
should be doing for the American people.  We should be delivering on
these programs that they need, that are — that are necessary for them
and their families.   
   
And so, no, that is not something we want to see.  That isn’t.  It is
not something we want to see.  
   
And, you know, they need to do their jobs instead of these political
stunts.   
   
Somebody asked me about the impeachment hearings that are happening in —
in Congress and the — and the House Republicans right now that are
leading that.  That is a waste of time, political stunts, baseless —
baseless accusations.   
   
And that is not what the American people want to see.  They want to see
us working in a bipartisan way.  And that’s what we’re trying to do as
it relates to the — the border security in the Senate.  Right?  We’re
trying to do that in a bipartisan way.   
   
That’s why the President got involved in — in early spring in getting a
bipartisan agreement with the — with the budget — on the budget.  And
so, it’s a — it’s really — it’s really shameful.  
   
Let me see who I haven’t called.  Gerren.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The Vice President met with voting rights
activists in Atlanta yesterday, and they expressed their concern about
election integrity and political violence.  One person even described
volunteers having a gun pulled on them.  And I spoke with LaTosha Brown,
the cofounder of Black Voters Matter, who said that they believe that
this is a result of dog whistles from some elected officials who are
pushing claims of voter fraud.  
   
What level of concern does the White House have for violence to be
taking place on election workers and volunteers?  And what federal —
federal deployment or resources are being deployed to assist them?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  In — in response to the sharp
increase of — in threats of violence to election workers following the
2020 election cycle, in June of 2021, Justice Department created the
Election Threats Task Force to investigate and prosecute those who
target election workers.   
   
And yesterday, the DOJ actually released information highlighting the
work its civil rights, criminal justice, and national security divisions
are doing to enforce civil rights protections, enforce criminal
statutes, prohibiting voter intimidation, and prevent mor- — maligned
influence in our elections.   
   
Any threats of violence towards election workers and other attempts to
undermine our dem- — democratic process and make it harder to vote are
unacceptable.  And, of course, this administration is going to use every
tool at its disposal to protect the sacred right to vote and — and
defend our democracy.  
   
That is something that you’ve heard from the President not only in
Valley Forge recently but also many times during his — the past three —
almost three years of his administration.  So, we’re going to be
steadfast on that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I just want to ask, given the conclusion of
U.S.-China military-to-military talks yesterday, whether — just a
general question: whether the President is satisfied with the progress
made since the agreements made in November.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I — I have not spoken to the President about
that.  I — I get the question.  I just don’t have anything to share to
what we’ve already put out on this.  But I have not spoken to the
President specifically to — to get a sense of that.  
   
Q    Is there any general feeling he has about, you know, a various
range of issues?  You had fentanyl.  We had —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — you know, expectation that China would be a stabilizing force in
different conflicts.  Is there — is there a sense of whether that’s
played out the way he had expected?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, these are conversations that we obviously
are going to continue to have, where we — especially when it comes to
fentanyl.  Obviously, going into — want to make sure that that is — you
know, fentanyl, we don’t want that to go into our communities.   
   
And so, look, that relationship, you’ve seen — you’ve seen the President
meet with President Xi recently.  They had a very good conversation. 
You’ve seen Cabinet Secretaries and also officials here in the White
House continue to have those diplomatic conversations.   
   
Diplo- — diplomacy is very important here with this — with this
administration, with this President.  I just don’t want to go beyond
what we’ve already shared on this.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  The Chief of Staff said in his memo to Cabinet
Secretaries yesterday that they should delegate their responsibilities
if they’re hospitalized.  Since, as far as we know, Secretary Austin is
still hospitalized, does the White House believe he should be delegating
his responsibilities now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m sorry.  Can you say that one more time?  
   
Q    Yeah.  The Chief of Staff said in his memo to Cabinet Secretaries
that they should delegate responsibilities when they’re hospitalized. 
And, as far as we know, Secretary Austin is still hospitalized.  So,
according to the White House and the Chief of Staff, should he be
delegating his responsibilities?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, look, as you heard from the Admiral, Secretary
Austin was involved in a conversation, a meeting with the President on
national security matters just yesterday.  He — and also — the Admiral
talked about this as well — this is — when we have these conversations
or meetings with Cabinet secretaries, not just always with the Secretary
at the top.  There are other people that are involved in these
important, crucial conversation, whether it’s policy, whether it’s
decision-making.  
   
And so, the — obviously, we’ve been in — the Secretary is working, is
having conversations with — with our National Security Council and
others here in the administration.  I just don’t have anything to share
on specifics on — on — on that particular matter.  
   
But what I can say is, you know, Department of Defense is — is certainly
reviewing their process and looking at what could have been done
better.  It’s a 30-day review process.  But obviously, Secretary Austin
has been very much involved and engaged, certainly this — this current
week.  
   
Q    In the way back.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The way back.  Way back.  I’m trying to call — go
ahead, Brian.  
   
Q    Thanks a lot, Karine.  I had a question about supply chains.  Given
how much work that President Biden spent on supply chain mitigation in
2021 when he — when he first came into office, how much — how concerned
should Americans be right now about supply chain disruption, given how
much shipping traffic normally runs in the Red Sea?  And what actions is
the President taking to — to mitigate — mitigate potential supply chain
disruptions?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as you’ve heard from us many times,
obviously, the Red Sea is an important global trade, particularly for
transportation of oil, grain, and consumer goods from Asia.  The
Department of Transportation is in close communication with ocean
shippers, industry, and other stakeholders.   
   
And so, we’re taking every steps to ensure that shipping in the Red Sea
is not obstructed — right? — is unobstructed, including by establishing
Operation Prosperity Guardian and building a coalition of countries from
region and around the world to ensure freedom of nav- — navigation, to
protect the maritime economy, and bolster regional security in the Red
Sea.  
   
So, we’re taking this very seriously.  We’re keeping an eye on this.  As
you heard us me- — say, it is a — the Red Sea is an — very important to
commercial shipping.  And so — so, we’re going to take this very
seriously.  
   
Q    Is the President seeing impact on the economy at this point?  Is he
— should Americans be prepared to see an impact in supply chain
disruption?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, what I can say is we’re going to continue to
monitor the situation, and we are taking action to make sure that
doesn’t happen.   
   
Go ahead, in the middle.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The President announced earlier this week that
Mitch Landrieu is leaving the administration.  I wonder is there any
plan to replace him or appoint someone new to oversee —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Natalie Quillian, who is Deputy Chief of Staff, is
going to take over his portfolio.  And so, she has been — part of her
portfolio is doing implementation — implementing all of these pieces of
legislation — historic pieces of legislation that we’ve been able to get
through Congress.   
   
I don’t have anything beyond — whatever he’s going to do after that, I
certainly will leave that to Mitch Landrieu.  But that’s what — that’s
how it’s — his portfolio is being taken care of from here.   
   
Q    And is the White House preparing for any other staffing departures
as the campaign ramps up?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to — to announce from here.  
   
AIDE:  Time for a couple more, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Right — go ahead.  Yeah.  
   
Q    What is the administration doing to address the billions of dollars
in overpayments the Social Security Administration has been trying to
call back for millions of Americans?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, on that — on that particular piece, look, the
President requested 10 percent — 10 percent increase in funding for
Social Security Administration to help invest in the staff and
technology neces- — nece- — necessary — necessary to improve customer
service and determination services.  
   
The administration is committed to protecting Social Security.  You
heard him during the State of the Union last year, the Pr- — the
President standing up in front of — in front of, you know, millions of
Americans who were watching protecting Social Security, protecting
Medicare, and protecting Medicaid.  And that’s something that he’s been
certainly doing.   
   
And so, anything further on that, I would certainly refer you to the
Social Security Administration.   
   
Go ahead, Colleen \[Courtney\].   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    I —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, right behind you.  Yeah.  
   
Q    I wanted to ask you about update — or updates on the
administration’s conversations with Mexico.  Do you have any changes or
agreements to talk about as they work to alleviate pressure on the
southwest border?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, there was a meeting that occurred
during the holidays with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan —
actually, no, it was Blinken — Blinken — Secretary Blinken, Secretary
Mayorkas, and also National Sec- — Deputy National Security Advisor
Sherwood-Randall.  And they went to Mexico City to continue the
conversation that the President, obviously, has been having with
President — President of Mexico.  
   
The conversation went really well.  Obviously, it’s continuing.  It’s —
these are diplomatic conversation.  They’ve been a partner with us on
migration, a partner with us on how to — how to deal with fentanyl as
well.  And so, he — the President of Mexico and his team have taken
significant efforts to — that — that they are putting underway to make
sure that we deal with the border in a way that — in a way that
obviously is — is effective.   
   
And so, we’re seeing — we’re starting to see those results.  I don’t
have anything beyond that.  But obviously, those diplomatic conversation
continue.  And we appreciate the President Mexico — President of Mexico
being a partner in this.  
   
Q    What do you mean by —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    — results?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we have seen results in — in the — the migration
of migrants.  Right?  We’ve seen a decrease because of the actions that
President — President of Mexico has taken.   
   
And so, again, because of this — these diplomatic conversations, they
have been effective.  We see them as being effective.   
   
Go ahead, Andrew.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Two questions.  First, the former President — President
Trump yesterday warned that there would be “bedlam” in this country if
the case against him affects the election results in November.   
   
Without speaking to the former President himself, because I know you’re
covered by the Hatch Act, is the administration tracking the possibility
of potential violence around the time of any trial date that he might
have?  Is that something that’s being prepared for?  
   
And then I have another question.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I have to say this: I can’t comment on anything
that is related to 2024, as a federal government employee.   
   
What I will say is President Biden has always been absolutely clear when
it comes to this: Political violence has no place whatsoever in
America.  It just has —  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let me — like, there are a couple of things — more
things I want to say.   
   
So, leaders need to put their country first.  They need to put the
safety of American people and respect for the rule of law above
themselves, like President Biden does every day.   
   
And there are no — there is no one who would even imagine Joe Biden
being afraid to condemn violence.  Right?  This is something, again,
that we’ve done pretty — pretty often here, unfortunately, that we’ve
had to do this in the last three years.   
   
Failing to condemn or discourage criminal violence, especially —
especially after dangerous conspiracies and violent rhetoric have cost
law enforcement officers their lives — we saw that on January 6th;
officers lost their lives — and resulted in gut-wrenching assaults, like
the attack on Paul Pelosi.   
   
It’s horrific.  It’s horrifying.  And if you’re a leader in this
country, you need to put this country first.  You need to put the safety
of the American people first.  That’s what leaders do.   
   
Q    Thank you.  And then, on Hunter Biden, I understand he is a private
citizen.  He is not a member of the administration.  He is, however, a
member of the President’s family.  So, could you tell us if he stayed at
the White House in the residence last night?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything else to share.  I think I —  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What — last one, back there.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks.  Without getting into the specific case that you’ve —
you’ve said that you wouldn’t or couldn’t or shouldn’t, the question
about presidential immunity — the idea that a president should be immune
from prosecution — not about any specifics, what does the President
think about that?   
   
Because, for example, in a courtroom yesterday, a judge opined that a —
that a president might be able to have a rival assassinated by SEAL Team
Six.  I’m assuming that President Biden does not agree with that idea. 
What are his thoughts on immunity, generally?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m going to be very careful because it is
connected to what a former President said and it is an ongoing case. 
Just not going to comment on a legal case or make statements that may
impact the ongoing case.   
   
So, going to refer to Department of Justice of any specific questions
you may have on that.  Just going to be very careful from here.   
   
With that, I will see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks, everybody.
