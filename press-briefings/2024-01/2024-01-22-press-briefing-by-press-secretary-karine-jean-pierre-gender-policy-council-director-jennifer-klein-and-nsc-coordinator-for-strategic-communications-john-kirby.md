James S. Brady Press Briefing Room 

1:04 P.M. EST   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Trevor — (laughter) — what did you do?

Q    (Inaudible.)

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What’s going on?  You causing problems?

Q    We’re ready.  We’re ready.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Are you sure?

Q    Yes.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, I can — I’m happy to just stand here and
wait.

Q    You guys are early.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re — we’re —  
   
Q    On time.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   — we’re not — we’re on time.  1:02.  I don’t even
know if it’s 1:02.  I think that time is a little either fast or slow.

Okay.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Where is the rest of the class?   
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, my gosh.  Okay, well, good afternoon.  Happy
Monday.  Today marks what would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v.
Wade, a ruling from the Supreme Court that recognized a woman’s
constitutional right to make deeply personal healthcare decisions free
from the interference of politicians.  But then the Supreme Court ruled
to take that constitutional right away.

The aftermath has been devastating.  Women’s health and lives now hang
in the balance.

Today, 21 states have abortion bans in effect, 27 million women of
reproductive age live in states with bans.  That’s more than one in
three women.  Over 380 state bills restricting access to abortion care
were introduced just last year.  And on Capitol Hill, congressional
Republicans have proposed three national abortion bans.

The stories of women being denied care are gut-wrenching.  In Texas, a
woman was forced to go to court to ask permission to receive the care
her doctor recommended before she ultimately fled Texas to receive the
care she desperately needed. 

And she’s not alone.  We’ve seen one harrowing story after another of
women who are experiencing a miscarriage and are turned away from
emergency rooms, then, later — later, nearly dying — nearly dying
because of that.

This should never happen in America.  Never.  But here’s the reality:
The overturning of Roe v. Wade has led to the chaos and confusion we’re
seeing play out — out across the country.  And it’s exactly why
President Biden will continue to fight back and urge Congress to restore
the protections of Roe v. Wade back into federal law.

The health and lives of women are on the line here.  So, in about an
hour, you will hear directly from the President on this, who will
convene a meeting with the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare, while
Vice President Harris today kicks off her reproductive freedoms tour in
Wisconsin.

And with that, as you can see to my right, I am grateful to welcome Jen
Klein, the Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, back in
the briefing room.  And she will talk about our actions that we’re
taking today.  
Jen.

MS. KLEIN:  Thank you, Karine.  As Karine said and as has — as President
Biden has made clear since the day of the Court’s decision to overturn
Roe, Congress must pass a federal law restoring the protections of Roe. 
And, in the meantime, the Biden-Harris administration will continue to
fight to protect access to reproductive healthcare.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, the administration has
taken action to help ensure that women receive the care they need in an
emergency, to protect access to safe and effective medication abortion,
to defend the right to travel for medical care, to expand access to
contraception — affordable contraception, to strengthen privacy
protections for patients and doctors, to support access to reproductive
healthcare for service members and veterans, and to partner with state
leaders, who really are on the front lines of protecting reproductive
freedom.

To coordinate this work across the federal government, the President
established a Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, which I
chair alongside HHS Secretary Becerra.  And today, as you heard, as we
mark what should have been the 51st anniversary of Roe vs. Wade,
President Biden will convene the fourth meeting of that task force with
agency leaders.

The task force will hear directly from two physicians who are on the
frontlines of the fallout from the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, and who
will — who will share their on-the-ground experiences of how state
abortion bans have wreaked havoc on their patients and interfered with
their ability to practice medicine.  
The President will then receive updates from his task force on the
efforts to protect access to reproductive healthcare and the continued
threats to emergency care and FDA-approved medication abortion.

Task force members will also report on new policy actions the
administration is taking to strengthen access to reproductive care.

While the President is convening his Cabinet, the Vice President is in
Wisconsin, a state where Republican elected officials want to enforce an
extreme abortion ban from 1849 — that’s before women had the right to
vote — that includes no exceptions, including in cases of rape or
incest.

As you heard from Karine, she’ll kick off her Fight for Reproductive
Freedoms tour, and she’ll be hearing and listening to women and
healthcare providers about the devastating impact of state abortion
bans.

And with that, I am happy to take some questions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, go ahead, M.J.

Q    I’m just wondering how much more new action the White House
believes they can take between now and November on this front.  Or do
you mostly expect that the actions and announcements that are to come
will be, you know, expansions on actions we’ve already seen since the
Supreme Court took action?

MS. KLEIN:  Yeah, I mean, as the President has been quite clear since
Roe was overturned, the ultimate solution is to pass federal national
legislation to restore the protections in Roe.  And we will continue to
work to hope that Congress will pass that legislation so the President
can sign it.   
   
He has also been clear, literally since day one, of — when the decision
came down in Dobbs that we will do everything we can.  So, that’s why
he’s issued three executive orders and one presidential memorandum.  The
executive orders are on strengthening access to abortion and
contraception, on protecting patient privacy, on protecting patient
safety and security, on protecting access to emergency care, and
defending the right to travel.   
   
And we will take actions in all of those areas.  We have already, and we
will continue to.   
   
So, to your question, is there anything left to do?  I think the answer
is yes.  And today, when the President convenes his task force, you will
see actions in a few more areas.  They do build on the executive orders
that he has already released.   
   
So, just to outline what — a little bit more about those — what those
policy actions today will be — you know, first, on contraception, there
will be new guidance to support expanded coverage of a broader range of
contraceptives at no cost under the ACA.  The Secretary of Health and
Human Services will also issue a letter to private insurers, state
Medicaid programs, and Medicare to reinforce their obligations to cover
affordable contraception.  
   
On emergency care, the — there — they will be — HHS will be announcing a
comprehensive plan to educate patients about their rights under the
Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, known as EMTALA, and the
process for filing a complaint; and also disseminate training materials
for healthcare providers, convene those providers to ensure that they
know how to comply with EMTALA, and also establish an expert team at HHS
to help hospitals and healthcare providers comply with those legal
obligations under EMTALA.   
   
And last piece is we will take additional steps to implement the
presidential memorandum on medication abortion to protect the safety and
security of patients, providers, and pharmacies who need, prescribe, or
dispense medication abortion.   
   
Q    And could you just talk to us a little bit about how the White
House is viewing ballot initiatives heading into November — the
importance of them, what the landscape is?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  Yeah, I think the ba- — the series of ballot initiatives —
most recently in Ohio, but also in Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana,
Vermont, California — really show how salient this issue is and how
every time Americans are given the opportunity to make their voices
heard, they make their voices heard very loudly and clearly in favor of
reproductive freedom.  And there are more ballot initiatives coming, and
we will do everything we can to support state leaders, as I said, on the
ground, who are on — really on the front lines.   
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Selina.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Can you talk a little bit about the significance of
this rally in Virginia tomorrow and just how much more time you think
the President is going to spend on the issue of abortion between now and
November?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  I can’t speak to the rally tomorrow directly because that’s
a campaign event.  So, it’s a political event.   
   
What I can say is that the President has been prioritizing and
delivering on reproductive freedom for his entire administration,
starting with creating the Gender Policy Council and asking me, actually
before Dobbs, to help lead the administration’s whole-of-government
approach to Texas S.B. 8, and then, of course, once Dobbs came down, to
mobilize the entire administration’s efforts, and he will continue to do
that.   
   
And, of course, the Vice President, who has been a leader on this issue,
will continue to be that leader.  She’s, as you just heard, in Wisconsin
right now.  She will, of course, be part of the — of the rally tomorrow
with all four of the principals participating.  And she will be around
the country — she’s met with legislative leaders, state and local
officials around the country.  And they will both continue to draw the
sharp contrast between what this administration stands for and what
Republican elected officials stand for for the months to come.  
   
Q    Just bouncing off of M.J., though, do you feel that the White House
is reaching the limits of what it can do when it comes to abortion
rights without congressional action?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  Again, I think, you know, the President was — was quite
clear.  He literally said it, you know, within an hour of the Dobbs
decision coming down: that the only way to restore the rights that were
lost — the fundamental constitutional right that was lost that was
protected for nearly 50 years under Roe vs. Wade is to have federal
legislation.  
   
And that’s why he is — his entire administration is laser-focused on
that.  And he has made it entirely clear that when Congress sends him
that legislation, he will sign it immediately.   
   
I don’t think that means that there is nothing we can do.  I think
there’s quite a lot we can do.  And I think that’s evidenced by what
we’ve done so far to — you know, all the categories that I mentioned,
but really to protect access to reproductive healthcare in this
country.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Kelly.  
   
Q    Can the federal government help to define some of the circumstances
that women have found themselves in when medical questions about is it
the life of the mother at risk — where state law may not spell it out
very clearly or clearly enough, is there a role for the federal
government there?   
   
And since some of these instances do result in ordinary citizens having
to get involved in litigation, is there something that the
administration can do to support them in pursuing those remedies?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, to — to state the obvious:
We are seeing a lot of chaos — legal chaos and medical chaos — because
of the overturning of Roe vs. Wade and the state abortion bans that have
been passed across the country. 

You know, it just bears mentioning that there are 21 states with
abortion bans right now.  That means that 27 million women, one — of
reproductive age — one in three are living in states with those bans.   
   
There are federal tools.  So, the one that, you know, we are talking
about today that we are going to build off of — EMTALA, the Emergency
Medical Treatment and Labor Act — you know, the administration has long
said — long held the view that that law requires that when somebody
walks into an emergency room requiring emergency care to stabilize their
medical condition, that treatment, even if it includes abortion, is
required under federal law.  
   
So, I think, you know, that’s one of the things that we’re trying to
make sure that, as I said, patients know what their rights are, know how
they can file a complaint — but even before you get to that, that
providers know what is required of them under that federal law.  And —
and that’s what we will be doing more of.  
   
Q    So, you think you can add clarity where there is confusion at this
point?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  Yeah, I mean, again, you know, to return to where we
started, ultimately, the only way to — to ensure that, you know, women
in every state across the country have the right that they lost when Roe
was overturned is to pass a piece of federal legislation restoring Roe. 
But I do think this is a step — an important step in that direction.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    To your point about federal legislation, is the President willing
to compromise with lawmakers who think there should be some restrictions
on reproductive rights in order to get a bill through?  Or is his
approach more all or nothing at this point?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  I — I think what the President has said — and he will
continue to say that he believes that Roe was rightly decided and that
we need a bill that restores the protections that were in Roe.   
   
And, you know, by the way, the majority — the vast majority of American
people agree that Roe was ri- — rightly decided, and that’s exactly what
we need to do.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Danny.  
   
Q    Thanks.  You mentioned the 21 states that have a ban at the
moment.  Do you have any number or any estimate of how many women have
been forced to travel out of state s- — since the — you know, since the
decision?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  I don’t have numbers on that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Courtney, in the back.  
   
MS. KLEIN:  I — I will say one thing, which is that the Department of
Justice filed a statement of interest in two cases in Alabama, where the
right to travel is at issue, where the Alabama Attorney General has
threatened to prosecute women and those who help those women cross state
lines.  But that’s not a — that’s not a number for sure.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Courtney.  
   
Q    Thank you.  You’ve been talking about abortions and medical
emergencies.  On the Fifth Circuit’s decision on that, it’s unusual to
see a court agree to review agency guidance, let alone rule on whether
it can be implemented.  How does that court’s decision affect your
strategy going forward as you try and navigate this post-Roe
landscape?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  Yeah, as you probably know, in addition to, you know, making
clear our longstanding position that that law and the guidance that
followed it reflects the position that EMTALA does cover emergencies —
when somebody walks into an emergency room needing medical care and
that’s — abortion is the care that is required, that that is covered by
EMTALA — of course, that — we are also — the Department of Justice is
also litigating that, defending that in court, and that stands before
the Supreme Court at the moment in a different case.  
   
Q    And on traveling, are you doing anything to support providers in
states that are seeing an increase in patients from neighboring states
with more restrictive laws — for example, Illinois?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  I think the best answer to that question is that we’ve been
really working with those state leaders in states like Illinois, New
York, where they’re seeing an influx of patients.  But, really, that’s
more about, you know, connecting states to each other, which has been
one of the things we’ve done in our state convenings, so that they can
learn from each other and help each other.  There’s less of a federal
role there.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Last question.  
   
Q    Can I ask one more thing, Karine?  Thank you.   
   
Does today’s announcement that the administration is going to publish
training materials for providers in medical emergencies — does that mean
you’re going to pr- — advise that same information to hospitals in Texas
and Idaho, which I know are the st- — states involved in those cases
that the Justice Department is in?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  That information will be available to any hospital and
healthcare provider who needs to access it.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Last question in the back.  Go ahead,
Evan.  
   
Q    I just wanted to ask about medication abortion and the Supreme
Court weighing restrictions on the mailing of mifepristone.  Do you see
— or rather, does the Biden administration see this as sort of the next
big frontier of this abortion fight?  And then, you know, what are the
stakes of that case, and is there any recourse that the White House
would have?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  I do think that that’s a really important frontier.  You
know, they’ve already made it clear that, in some sense, they don’t
think they need to pass a national abortion ban because there is a
national abortion ban if they were to be able to limit the mailing, the
dispensing of mifepristone.   
   
So, you know, I can’t speak to the litigation.  But, of course, you
know, again, there’s a case in the Supreme Court, Alliance Defending
Freedom vs. FDA, where exactly what’s at stake is the — is whether
limits can be put on the FDA who has made a judgment to — to —
initially, a judgment to approve and then further judgments to regulate
using their scientific, evidence-based judgment that this is a safe
medication that should be available.  It’s, by the way, 53 or so percent
of abortions in this country. 

So, we will continue to — to defend that and make clear that, you know,
that is a safe and — and legal drug.   
   
You know, one of the reasons I think that case has attracted a lot of
attention is because it is obviously squarely about medication abortion,
but, you know, you have pharmaceutical companies and executives, you
have medical associations, you even have conservative legal scholars re-
–weighing in on the danger of that case, because it could have
implications for any drug that the FDA, you know, long ago approved and
has regulated several times since.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thank you so much, Jen.   
   
MS. KLEIN:  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know you have to go to the Oval Office.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Thank you.  Thank you so much.  
   
Okay.  Thanks, Jen.   
   
Couple things before we continue.  So, just a scheduling update.  So, on
Thursday, January 25th, the President will travel to Superior,
Wisconsin, to discuss how his Bidenomics and Investing in America agenda
are rebuilding our infrastructure, lowering costs, spurring a
small-business boom, and creating good-paying jobs.   
   
The — President Biden remains focused on investing in America and
opposing congressional Republican efforts to shower massive giveaways on
the wealthy and big corporations, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid and Social
Security, and block us from lowering costs for American families.  
   
And before we continue with the briefing, I wanted to say one last thing
to my dear friend, Emilie, the Deputy of — the Deputy Press Secretary,
as she is going to head out to maternity leave today.  And, Emilie, we
are so happy for you and Steven on your — on your road to parenthood. 
And I think you are such an amazing human.  You’re going to be an
amazing mom and just have so much joy.  I know everyone here feels that
and everyone, certainly, on our team.  And I’m going to miss you
terribly.  
   
You’re going to — you’re going to be gone for, like, five months — five
months too long.  But I’m going to miss you terribly, and I hope you,
you know, spend that time — I know you’ll spend that time being very,
very busy.  But, also, time with your — your little one.   
   
And so, excited for you.  I have something for you.  
   
MS. SIMONS:  Aww.  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Give me one second.  Give that to you.  Well,
actually, you open — you open that.  
   
MS. SIMONS:  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   I want you to open it.  I want you to show
everybody.  
   
MS. SIMONS:  Okay.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   Show my gift to everyone.  (Laughter.)  It’s a little
gift for Emilie.   
   
Q    Aww —

MS. SIMONS:  “Future President.”  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  “Future President.”  (Laughter.)   
   
Q    Very nice.   
   
MS. SIMONS:  So sweet of you.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Please — please come in the back — to the back if you
don’t get a — if you get a second today to say goodbye to Emilie and
wish her — wish her luck.   
   
All right.  
   
MS. SIMONS:  Thank you, Karine.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   All right.  We love you, Emilie.  
   
And with that, we have Admiral John Kirby here to give us an update on
the Middle East.  
   
Admiral, podium.   
   
Q    Follow that, sir.

MR. KIRBY:  Karine is bringing you up, and I’m bringing you down. 
(Laughter.)  Just a couple of things, I promise, and then we’ll get
right to it.  
   
Today, the United States is announcing additional sanctions designed to
protect our — not only our financial system but our national security. 
First, the United States, today, sanctioned Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad
and its CEO for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,
otherwise known as the IRGC, and, as well, supporting Iran- —
Iran-aligned militia groups in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.  
   
Additionally, the United States is designating three leaders and
supporters of Kata’ib Hizballah, one of the IRGC’s Iran-aligned ami- —
militias in Iraq, and one business that facilitates and launders funds
for Kata’ib Hizballah.  
   
Kata’ib Hizballah, I think as you all know, has been responsible for a
series of drone and missile attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and
Syria.   
   
Now, second, we imposed a fifth round of sanctions on Hamas.  This is
the fifth round since the October 7th attacks.  
   
And alongside the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom are
also placing sanctions on key Hamas officials and facilitators.  
   
We’ll obviously continue to use all the tools at our disposal to target
Hamas, its financiers, and its financial transfer mechanisms that funnel
funds in support of their terrorist activities.  
   
In a — in a related way, I can also let you know that the President just
recently hung up the phone talking to Prime Minister Sunak of the United
Kingdom.  Clearly, they talked about what’s going on in the — in the Red
Sea and the need for a continued international multilateral approach to
disrupting and degrading Houthi capabilities.   
   
They also had a chance to talk about, obviously, what’s going on in Gaza
with a — stressing the need to continue to bring down the number of
civilian casualties and to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance
into Gaza.   
   
And, of course, they also talked about Ukraine and the urgent need that
Ukraine is facing right now for additional supplemental funding and
support for their ability to defend themselves in the — on the field of
battle.  
   
And then, lastly, I’d be remiss — speaking about the field of battle —
if I did not also point you to the President’s statement today,
acknowledging and mourning the death of two Navy SEALs who were killed
while conducting an interdiction operation in the — in the Gulf of Aden
— trying to interdict munitions and weapons that we believe were heading
from Iran to — to the Houthis in Yemen.  It’s a — underscores how
dangerous the mission can be and the dangers that these — these brave
warriors are willing to face every day.  
   
And I think, as we all go about our day, we ought to just take a moment
to remember that a couple of families are — just got the worst news
possible.  And it’s important that they know that the President and the
First Lady will stay solidly behind them and their families, make sure
that they get all the support they need.  And I know that the same
sentiment has been expressed to them from the Defense Department and
from the Navy Department.   
   
With that, I’ll take questions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Trevor.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  John, I just wanted to go back to the President’s
comments from last week about there being a number of types of two-state
solutions and referencing the idea that a number of — of U.N. members
don’t have their own military.  Is it — is it the President’s current
view that a Palestinian state that’s demilitarized is the most viable
outcome there?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t get ahead of — of where the — where we are in the
process of trying to achieve a two-state solution, Trevor.   
   
It’s the President’s view that a two-state solution is the best path
forward for people of Gaza, for the Palestinian people, as well as the
Israeli people.   
   
And as he said in those comments, there’s a lot that can go into
creating what that construct looks like.  And, you know, when we say
“two-state solution,” what does it actually mean?  And there’s many
different interpretations.  There’s lots of different ways you can get
at that ultimate solution.  And the President, as he has always done,
kept an open mind about trying to pursue that.   
   
Now, he’s also under no illusions at how difficult it’s going to be to
get there, particularly with this conflict going on in Gaza.   
   
So, we’re going to keep the discussions going with our Israeli
counterparts.  We’re going to keep talking about it with Mahmoud Abbas. 
We’re going to keep talking about it with our counterparts in the region
in the hopes that more progress can be made.   
   
One significant milestone to help us get there is prot- — is try to
pursue normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which we still
believe is possible.  We were working on it very hard before the 7th of
October; we’re still working on it hard.  And we’ve got, you know,
positive feedback from — from the partners in the region, including
Saudi Arabia, about pursuing that.  That could open up additional
opportunities to try to get at a reasonable two-state construct.   
   
Q    Is the reporting accurate that the President has flo- — floated
that idea in his last call with Bibi Netanyahu and that it’s something
that he’s —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Floated what idea?  
   
Q    — sympathetic to?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  What idea?   
   
Q    A demilitarized Palestinian state.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t get into the — the specifics of the discussions that
the President is having with the Prime Minister.  I think he was very
clear with all of you about how he views the ultimate path to a
two-state solution and the need for some flexibility in how you describe
what that looks like.   
   
But, again, it’s going to require leadership on all sides in the region
as well.  And it’s going to require leadership there to also be willing
to look at it the same way that the President is.  
   
Q    Just one more thing.  By my count, there is at least two different
Israeli operations today that are taking place in Gaza, in hospitals. 
What is the current U.S. guidance to Israel about operations within
hospitals where civilians are seeking care?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We don’t want to see hospitals as warzones.  We don’t want
to see hospitals as battle- — battlefields.  They should be as protected
as possible.   
   
That said, we know that Hamas deliberately uses places like hospitals to
store weapons, house their fighters, even, to some degree, for command
and control.  And so, that places a special need on the Israeli Defense
Forces but also a special burden on how they approach any fighting in or
around hospitals.   
   
They have a right to defend themselves.  They have a right to go after
these leaders.  They have a right to take away the ability for Hamas to
— to store and — and resource themselves, even if that is in
hospitals.   
   
But, again, I would say the same thing that we’ve said before on this
issue, that we — we expect them to do so in accordance with
international law and to protect innocent people in hospitals — medical
staff and patients as well — as much as possible.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Seung Min.  
   
Q    And just a quick follow on that question.  Has the — have the
Israelis briefed the U.S. on their plans to protect those civ- —
civilians?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware of specific military briefings about that.   
   
Q    And does the U- —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  But we’ve been very clear about our expectations.   
   
Q    And does the U.S. agree with a prominent Israeli War Cabinet member
who said recently that the remaining hostages can only be released
through a ceasefire?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We believe — well, I mean, look, we’ve seen the way — the
way we got those hundred hostages out was through a one — a week-long
humanitarian pause, stopping the — a temporary stoppage in the — in the
fighting, because, obviously, at the very root of it, you can’t — you
can’t enact safe passage for hostages out of a danger zone if people are
shooting at each other.  So, you need a — you need people to lay down
their arms at least long enough to affect a hostage transfer.   
   
And that one week got a hundred people out, and the fact that there was
no fighting helped enable that.  So, clearly, we still support pauses in
the fighting to get hostages out.   
   
We don’t support a general ceasefire, which is usually put in place in
the expectation that you’re going to end a conflict, that it’s going to
lead to specific negotiations.  That’s — that’s no — no change to our
policy there.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Weijia  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thank you, Kirby.  So, on Friday, the President
did make his view clear about a two-state solution, but he also
suggested that Netanyahu was open to that view.  So, did Netanyahu
express to the President that, or why did the President think that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I — I — they had a — they had a very constructive
conversation.  And I think I just need to leave it at that.  Pri- — the
Prime Minister should speak to his comments, and I’m sure he has and he
will.  All I can tell you is where the President’s head is: still
believes in a two-state solution.   
   
And as you heard him say himself, he believes that there — that there’s
a way to it.  He’s optimistic that we can get there and that it could —
you know, obviously, any two-state solution is going to require some
compromises.   
   
Q    On Friday, when we asked you about it, you said, obviously we see
things differently than Netanyahu, based on his public remarks.  But the
President interpreted those public remarks differently.  He said, no,
Netanyahu didn’t say that he was opposed to a two-state solution.  So,
based on what Netanyahu has said publicly, how do you interpret whether
he’s open or not to a two-state solution?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would point you back to what the President said: They had
a good conversation, including about the importance of a two-state
solution.  That doesn’t mean that we agree on every component of what
that can look like.  That’s why leadership is important here.  That’s
why the President is not going to let go of this, and it’s why we need
leadership in the region on moving forward.  
   
But, look, this is — if this was easy, I mean, my goodness, we — we’d
have a — we’ve had a two-state solution for years now.  It’s not easy. 
It’s hard.  It’s really hard.  And it requires a compromise.  It’s going
to require negotiation.  It’s going to require sacrifices, again, on
both sides.   
   
The President understands that.  He’s not Pollyannaish about that.  And
that’s why he’s staying — he’s staying true to it.  
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
Q    Two things, if I can also ask about this.  Over the weekend, we did
see Netanyahu make rather explicit, again, his opposition to a two-state
solution.  Do you or does the administration not take that opposition at
face value when Netanyahu is saying he does think this is irreconcilable
with a Palestinian state?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We can and have, and I’m sure we’ll have very frank
discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his Cabinet about the
future of — of the Palestinian people and what Gaza looks like
post-conflict.  And, as I said earlier, that doesn’t mean we’re going to
agree with everything.  
   
I’ll let the Prime Minister speak to his comments.  
   
Q    I guess I’m just struggling to understand.  It seems like the
President supports a policy or this White House does, and then the
Israeli Prime Minister is coming out in direct opposition to that
policy.  And I don’t understand (inaudible) —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, is the suggestion that we should then change our minds
—  
   
Q    I don’t understand how the —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — and we should not —  
   
Q    No, no, no —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — advocate for it anymore?  
   
Q    — it’s just, how does the President think that he gets there? 
That’s what I don’t understand.  Or is he thinking that he gets there
without Netanyahu?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, only the — the Israeli people determine who their
elected officials are going to be, not the United States.  That’s
one.   
   
Two, the President still believes — and he’s, again, not Pollyannaish. 
He knows this is going to be hard stuff.  And it has been — it has
proven extraordinary elusive — ext- — to date.  But he believes that
it’s in the best interest of our Israeli friends to have an independent
Palestinian state.   
   
Now, how that looks, what that looks like, whether they have a military
or not, that — those are discussions that — that need to be had in the
region and with leaders on both sides.  But he still believes in the
power and the promise of it, and he has for — for many, many years.  
   
So, we’re going to keep at this.  We’re going to keep these discussions
going.   
   
It’s also important to remember that Israel is in the middle of a
hard-fought fight here with — with Hamas, and we’ve got to make sure
that they can continue to defend themselves.  
   
Q    Can I ask you one unrelated question as well?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Sure.  
   
Q    On Friday, you were asked about a Palestinian American teenager —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — who was killed in the West Bank.  I think you were trying to get
some additional information.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Do you have additional information?  I’m just curious how you all
are interpreting that situation and if the administration has been in
touch at all with his family.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I — I don’t know about family communications.  I’ll come
back to you on that one.  That’s a good question.   
   
But we have been able to get some more information about this.  Cert- —
certainly a tragic killing by all accounts that — that we’ve been able
to glean so far.   
   
Our deepest condolences go to the family.  I think he was 17 years old —
just a teenager.  So, our thoughts and prayers are certainly with the
family.  And we call on Israel to conduct a full, thorough, transparent
investigation into his killing.  And, of course, we have every
expectation that those — that those responsible for it will be held
properly accountable.   
   
This kid is 17 years old.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Talk about another family that is going through some
enormous grief right now.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, sir.  
   
Q    After last week’s meeting on Ukraine here at the White House, the
Speaker of the House implied that President Biden did not particulate —
articulate a clear strategy for Ukraine.  So, does the White House have
one?  And what, quoting Speaker Johnson, is the “endgame” for Ukraine?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Look, I — I can’t — I can’t speak to what the — the Speaker
has heard or read or understood from the countless discussions that
we’ve had with members of Congress about Ukraine and what we’re trying
to do here.  It’s — it’s been pretty transparent and pretty clear: We
want Ukraine to win this war, as the President has said.  We want a
whole, prosperous, sovereign Ukraine.  We want Ukraine’s borders —
internationally established borders — to be fully recognized by
everybody, and that includes Mr. Putin.  And we want to be able to
continue to give Ukraine the support that it needs so that it can — so
that it can achieve those outcomes.  
   
And we’ve been nothing but clear about that.  I mean — and with every
package that’s gone out to Ukraine, there has been a consultation with
Congress.  There’s been a conversation.  We’ve been very clear about
this.   
   
And we have talked to the Ukrainians throughout this last two years —
it’s hard to believe we’re coming up on two years — meeting their needs
along the way.  We want to continue to do that.  
   
Q    What do you make of Speaker Johnson’s comments –repeated comments
—  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The —  
   
Q    — that there’s no strategy?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The Speaker can own his comments, and he should — he should
be the one answering questions.   
   
I can tell you, we have been nothing but clear and consistent with
members of Congress since the beginning of the war about what we are
doing to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield and what we’re going to
need to continue to do.  
   
I mean, we can get caught up in all this — the comments out here on the
microphones, but the next couple of months are going to be critical for
Ukraine.  I mean, if you think that the fighting is just going to stop
because the snow is falling, think again.  The Russians continue to fire
drones and missiles at Ukraine.  And the — and while the battlefront
hasn’t moved a lot on either side, there’s still a lot of active
fighting going on there.  
   
And Ukrainian commanders, I believe, can be forgiven right now for
having to make some pretty difficult decisions about what weapons
they’re going to expend, what shells they’re going to fire, what
missiles they’re going to use, because they don’t know when the next
shipment is going to come.  And that’s a horrible place — that’s a
horrible place to put the Ukrainian military in as the Russians
certainly aren’t suffering under that — that same uncertainty, as they
reach out to North Korea for ballistic missiles — and, by the way,
continue to fire them — and drones from Iran and — and producing on
their own.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Sabrina.  
   
Q    Thank you.  My colleagues at the Wall Street Journal reported on a
proposal by Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, and Qatar for a post-war Gaza that would create a pathway toward
a Palestinian state in exchange for a Saudi recognition of Israel.  Is
the U.S. aware of this proposal?  Does the administration support it?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I am not going to — obviously, not going to try to negotiate
here from the podium.  So, certainly seen that reporting.  All I can
tell you is that we — as — even on the call with Prime Minister Sunak
today, we continue to be in touch with our counterparts, our allies and
partners, about trying to get those hostages out, trying to get the
appropriate humanitarian pause in place so that we can do that and get
additional aid in, as well as making sure that — that Israel has what it
needs to defend itself.   
   
But I — I won’t — I won’t get into specific negotiations one way or
another.  
   
Q    And is there anything else that you can tell us about Brett
McGurk’s visit to the region, both in terms of the focus of his
discussions and how, you know, the first day of talks has gone?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I don’t have any readout from his first day of talks. 
He just got in the region.  I’m sure we’ll have more to say about it as
he — as he moves through this trip.  As you know, he comes in and out of
the region all the time.  And I suspect that in all his discussions
he’ll be talking to a range of partners and counterparts on a range of
issues to include, of course, the fighting in Gaza and our desire to —
to get those hostages out.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Kelly O.  We have to wrap it up soon because
we have to gather soon.   
   
Q    Does the U.S. have any concern that the positions of the Israeli
government on two-state solution or the pace or intensity of the war
have more to do with Benjamin Netanyahu’s domestic position in term- —
as opposed to the long-term goals that the U.S. and allies would have
that there is a focus on his own needs versus what might be — what the
U.S. believes is the right course?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  In all our discussions, Kelly, with the War Cabinet, we’re —
we’re not having them from a perspective of their domestic politics. 
And — and I recognize the validity of the question, but we’re not —
we’re not focused on what their domestic political issues are.  That
would be — that wouldn’t be a sound place for us to have discussions
with them about the war in Gaza.  That’s really for them to speak to
that — whatever pressures they might feel or might not feel from a
domestic perspective.   
   
What we want to make sure is that they know they’re going to continue to
get our support but that we also want to see reduction in civilian
casualties, more humanitarian assistance going in, and, obviously, as I
said earlier, get those hostages out.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Admiral, just a quick one on China.  Over the
weekend, the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands was commenting on
ASML’s ban of further chip equipment to China.  And he said it stretched
— “The U.S. has stretched its idea of security far too far, even the
matters that have nothing to do with military risks” and that the U.S.
is “putting pressure on their allies to do the same.”  I was wondering
if you had any response to that.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, we talked about this coming out of the — the G20.  I
mean, there is — it’s not just about the United States.  Other countries
share our concerns about certain export licenses of certain technology
that can have a national security implication.  And we made it very
clear: We’re trying to de-risk, not decouple.   
   
And our decisions in terms of — of these export licenses is really
designed specifically to make sure that we can continue to protect U.S.
national security.  That’s what we’re focused on.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  And these — and these companies obviously have to make their
own decisions.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jon.  
   
Q    Thanks a lot, Karine.  John, it seems as if the administration and
Prime Minister Netanyahu are on the same page as it relates to the
hostages, and that is that you can’t talk about having a cessation of
hostilities in Gaza without a release of the hostages.  Would you agree
with that idea?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  You — you — we believe that it’s important for — in order to
be able to get hostages out safely, you’ve got to have a pause in the
fighting.   
   
Q    And where do things stand as it relates to that?  We’re almost
approaching February.  The hostages were initially taken October the 7th
of last year.  Are there efforts underway?   
   
There’s various reporting, for instance, about efforts in Cairo, Egypt. 
Can you confirm those efforts?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  What I can confirm for you is that there are ongoing,
serious, sober discussions with our partners and — and our counterparts
to try to get another hostage deal in place.  I wish I could stand here,
Jon, and tell you that, you know, I can announce it today or we’re going
to do it tomorrow.  I can’t do that.   
   
But I can assure you that this is not something we’ve — we’ve forgotten
about.  It’s not something we haven’t worked on every single day.  And
as I said earlier, you know, Brett is in the region, and I have no doubt
that this will be a key part of his agenda while he’s over there.   
   
Q    Thanks, Admiral.  There have been roughly 150 attacks on U.S.
troops in Iraq and Syria.  Is the U.S. response working?  Is the U.S.
doing enough to protect its troops?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’ll continue to do what we have to do to protect our
troops and our facilities.  We are certainly mindful of the — of the
danger.  And — and in these attacks over the weekend, now, a small
number, but a number nonetheless, of — of U.S. troops were being
evaluated for traumatic brain injury.  That’s a — that’s a wound, and we
take that seriously.  
   
Q    And the Houthis, they aren’t stopping their attacks.  So, when the
U.S. retaliates, how can that not be seen as escalatory?  And how does
this all end?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  If you’re trying to — look, if — if you’re — if you’re going
to scrap with somebody, and you can find a way to tie one or both of
their hands behind their back, that’s not deescalating — or that’s not
escalating, that’s deescalating.  That’s taking ability away from the
other party to — to inflict harm.   
   
And the strikes that we have conducted ashore in Yemen have degraded
Houthi capabilities.  As I’ve said earlier, it doesn’t mean that they
don’t still have offensive capability available to them.  Clearly, they
do, because they continue to — to use it.   
   
And as the President said, as long as they continue to make that choice,
we have a choice too.  We have a choice to keep defending our ships and
our sailors and merchant traffic.  And we have a choice, when we have
the information available to us, to preempt their ability to conduct
those attacks.  And we’ll continue to do that.   
   
Q    And there was a pretty stark statement from a senior Israeli
official to ABC News saying that Israel is closer than ever to a war
with Hezbollah and possibly a full regional war.  Do you agree with
that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Everything the President has done since October 7th —
everything — has really been designed to — to keep this conflict from
escalating and — and widening.  And we’re going to — that’s — that’s
going to be our focus.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Toluse.  
   
Q    I wanted to get your response to a comment from the EU Foreign
Policy Chief Josep Borrell.  He was meeting with other European Union
foreign ministers in Brussels, and he said that the Israeli military
operation is not working and that it is “seeding hate for generations”
in Gaza.  I wanted to get your response on what the White House thinks
of that.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The Israelis themselves have talked about the progress that
they’ve made against Hamas leadership.  We believe that going after
leadership is a useful approach when you’re — when you’re dealing with a
terrorist network.  It worked for us with al Qaeda; it worked for us
with ISIS.   
   
I’ll let them speak to their progress.  We’ve been very careful not to
armchair quarterback this thing and throw in plays from the sideline. 
But — but they have made some progress against the — the network. 
They’ve made some progress against the network’s ability to resource
itself and the infrastructure — particularly underground infrastructure
— that they continue to use.  But as the Israelis have said themselves,
that’s going to be a fight that’s going to take them some time.   
   
So — and as for the second part of that comment, I mean, look, every
single — every single life lost — innocent life lost is a tragedy and
should be mourned.  And we have been very clear with our Israeli
counterparts about the need to be more precise, more deliberate, more
cautious.  There have been too many civilians killed in this conflict. 
And we — the right number — the right number is zero.  And we recognize
that there could be long-term effects from that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  M.J.  And then you have the last question.  
   
Q    Thank you, John.  Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected Hamas’s
conditions to end the war in exchange for releasing all of the
hostages.  Does President Biden support that decision?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  The decision by?  
   
Q    Prime Minister Netanyahu.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’d let the Prime Minister speak to his — his
comments.  We want to see all of the hostages home.  And we want to see
Israel not have to face a threat next door like the fa- — like the one
that they faced on the 7th of October.  
   
Q    I’m just asking if the President supports this decision to reject a
proposal that would have freed all of the hostages, including, of
course, the six remaining Americans?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  I can’t val- — I can’t validate that proposal itself.  I’m
not in a position to confirm that proposal.  What I —  
   
Q    Well, the Prime Minister has talked about it publicly.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I understand that.  I’m not in a position to confirm
that.   
   
What I can tell you is that the President supports Israel being able to
defend itself.  He supports getting all those hostages out.  He
supports, in order to do that, an additional humanitarian pause of some
length that will allow those hostages to go to freedom safely and more
aid to get in.   
   
And, again, you need a pause in the fighting to be able to do that.  We
don’t support, still today, some sort of general ceasefire.  
   
Q    And just on the — going back to the phone call between the
President and the Prime Minister on Friday.  We reported that the Prime
Minister, in that phone call, had privately indicated that he was not
ruling out the possibility of any Palestinian state in any form. 
Obviously, you’re aware of what he has said in public over the last few
days.  My colleagues have referenced those statements.  I guess I’m just
wondering, as far as you’re aware, is there any daylight between what
the Prime Minister says in private versus in public on this matter.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s a question for the Prime Minister and his office.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Last question.  
   
Q    So, if the U.S. aid is delayed further for Ukraine, is there a
danger — does the President worry that other European states might
withdraw their support?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would say that the President is mindful that other nations
are watching what we do.  Obviously, Mr. Putin is watching what we do. 
And other nations not involved in this conflict are watching what we do
— I’m sure.  I’m sure China is watching it too — President Xi.   
   
But our allies and our partners, yeah, they’re watching closely what we
end up doing here, because American leadership has been critical in
supporting Ukraine.  We have literally led the way, not only in the
contributions but in the coordination of contributions of other nations
to get stuff into Ukraine.   
   
And so, yeah, I think it’s entirely possible we — we should expect that
some of our allies and partners might have to make different decisions
if — if they see American leadership falter here or the United States
pull back from supporting Ukraine.  And that would have potentially
disastrous consequences for Ukraine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, Admiral.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah —  
   
Q    Has the President had any conversations with any of these European
states?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, he just talked Prime Minister Sunak today, and one of
the topics was Ukraine.  So, yes, absolutely.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks.  Thanks, Admiral.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you so much, Admiral.  
   
All right.  We don’t have too much time.  So, rapid fire, I guess.   
   
Go ahead, Seung Min.  
   
Q    Okay.  First of all, does the White House see this week as sort of
a make-or-break week when it comes to the border deal coming together
and advancing in the Senate?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we think this week is — obviously, you heard
from the President on Friday — right? — right before he — right before
he addressed — or when he was addressing the mayors.  So, this is — I
think the way to look at it is this is an urgent moment, an urgent time
to get things done at the border, to make sure we move his national
security supplemental forward.   
   
And it’s not — obviously not just the border security.  You just heard
the Admiral talk about Ukraine.  You just heard the Admiral talk about
Israel.  All of these requests in that supplemental is urgent, is
important.  That’s why supplementals are for when you have an emergency
request.   
   
So, the border is important.  We think that — we’ve had said before, and
I think you also heard a little bit from the President on Friday, that
we think it’s going in the right direction.  We are very grateful and
than- — and very thankful to the senators — to the senators, both
Republicans and Democrats, who have been doing this for several weeks,
several months now trying to get to a bipartisan agreement on the
border.   
   
And we want to see that happen.  It is time.  They have to act.  And we
need to move quickly.  
   
Q    And there is a robocall circulating in New Hampshire that uses what
appears to be fake audio of President Biden’s voice.  And acknowledging
that’s obviously a campaign issue and that the campaign itself has
spoken to it, can you nonetheless talk about the concerns that the White
House has about the President’s likeness being used in this false
manner?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as you just stated, because I always have to
say that at the — at the top: It’s a robocall for an upcoming election,
2024, obviously.  So, I just want to be careful in that comment.   
   
But that call was indeed fake and not recorded by the President.  I can
confirm that.   
   
And so, I just want to be really careful since it doesn’t — it is a
primary election.  It is a campaign.  Don’t want to speak too much about
that.   
   
And, look, more broadly, as we talk about deep fakes, the President has
been clear that there are risks associated with deep fakes.  Fake images
and misinformation can be exacerbated by emerging technologies.  And
that’s why this President has directed the Department of Commerce
through — through the AI Safety Institute at NIST to help develop clear
watermarking and content — content standards.  So, that’s important.   
   
But, again, to the — your — your question on — on this robocall, that
was not the President.  That was fake, and it was certainly not recor- —
recorded by this President.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  On Friday, President Biden said that he does
not believe the border is secure, which is different from what Secretary
Mayorkas has testified multiple times on the Hill.  Why do they have two
different views of the security of the border?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, the President has been really clear,
right?  He has been clear that we need to move on the border.  The
border needs — he needs resources to deal with the situation at the
border.  That’s why they’re having these conversation at the Senate — on
the Senate level.  And that’s why he’s asking for mor- — more
resources.   
   
And he wants to see additional resources but also changes to policy to
address what we’ve been seeing at the border.  So, him asking for it,
him saying that we need to deal with the bor- — border security — as
Mayorkas, as we all here have been doing at the White House — I think
shows that, yeah, we have — there’s an issue at the border, we need to
deal with it, and we have to act now.  There’s an urgent need to act
now.   
   
We want to find a bipartisan agreement to deal with that.  And so, we
feel that meaningful change and additional resources are critical at
this time.   
   
Q    But it’s Mayorkas who is tasked —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — with, you know, making sure those resources are applied.  If he
is saying something different than the President about whether it’s
secure or not, I guess I just have a hard time understanding why there
is a disconnect here.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I — look, the President has repeatedly said that
the sys- — the immigration system is broken.  He has said that on day
one — from day one when he put forward his first piece of legislation. 
His first big policy was to deal on the border.  And it’s been three
years.  We haven’t seen any action.  We’re glad to see that there’s
conversation at the Senate.   
   
But he has said — he has said it is broken.  The immigration system is
broken.  Border security, we need more resources.  He’s been very, very
clear — very clear at — at — about that.   
   
And I think those are the actions that he’s taken over the last three
years.  Those — when you look at this bipartisan agreement, obviously —
those conversation, when it leads to the border security, has been about
that.  How can we see significant, meaningful — meaningful policy
changes and also funding — adding funding to that to deal with what’s
happening at the border?  
   
So, look, it’s broken.  The system is broken.  The President has said
this.  That’s why we have — that’s why, on the first day — again, I’m
just repeating myself here over and over again — he put forward a
comprehensive immigration policy to Congress to deal with that broken
system that we — that has been around for decades.   
   
Q    I just had a very quick follow-up on the — the robocall.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    You know, understanding that that may raise some — some federal
issues as well, is there going to be any kind of federal response in
terms of national security, election integrity, law enforcement policy,
anything like that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything else to share beyond, you
know, confirming that it was indeed a fake.  It was not recorded by this
President.  Want to be also really, really careful because it’s an
ongoing — obviously, an election year that we’re in, 2024, so I don’t
want to get too far into it.   
   
But I also just laid out why we have to be mindful.  Right?  There are
going to be deep fakes.  That’s why the President has taken this very
seriously over the last couple of years here in the administration.   
   
So, I don’t have anything to preview or to lay out on any response from
the federal level.  But I can certainly confirm that that was not the
President.  It is not the President’s voice.  He did not re- — record
that message.   
   
Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s been a while.  Hi.  
   
Q    It has.  Hello.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Where you been?  
   
Q    Just preparing for this moment.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think I’m going to disappoint you really badly if
you’ve been preparing all this time for this moment.  It’s not going be
that exciting, I’m pretty sure.  (Laughter.)   
   
Q    Well, let’s see.   
   
Karine, why do you think it is that more and more people polled feel
like, over time, President Biden is getting less and less mentally
sharp?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Which poll is this?  
   
Q    ABC has President Biden’s rating for health since May down five
points and for mental sharpness down four points.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, I have to say that’s a little confusing for
me, because if you look at what this President has done the last three
years, historical pieces of legislation — right? — and when it comes to
a bipartisan infrastructure deal, many presidents before, like your
favorite president, had said that (inaudible) —  
   
Q    Who’s my favorite president?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  Why don’t you — why don’t we let the
American people guess.  But had said —  
   
Q    No, no, no, no, no, no, no.    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, no, no, no, no.  Let me finish.  Let me finish. 
Let me finish.  You asked me a question.  I’m going to —  
   
Q    I don’t understand what you’re —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no, no.  Let me —  
   
Q    — what you’re getting at.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Let me finish, and
you’ll — you’ll guess who I’m talking about.  Who used to say,
“Infrastructure Week.”  Infrastructure Week, which was a punchline,
became a joke.  And now we are seeing Infrastructure Decade because of
this President.   
   
There’s the CHIPS and Science Act.  Right?  There is the Infla- —
Inflation Reduction Act.   
   
These are legislation that is going to have a difference for generations
to come.  Right?  And so, this is something that this President has
done.  That’s pretty sharp for this President to have been able to do
that.   
   
Let’s look at the economy.  The economy — now unemployment is under 4
percent.  Fourteen million jobs created.  The economy is in a better
place than when it was when he walked in.  That’s just a fact.  That’s
just the data.   
   
And we’re seeing consumer sentiment is going up.  And we saw just in
December how — how people spent more, and we hadn’t seen that in some
time.   
   
So, I think you needed a president like President Biden to get that type
of stuff done.  Someone who’s had Senate experience, someone who was the
VP — Vice President under –under President Bi- — Obama, obviously, and
someone who has been a pretty effective president over the last three
years.   
   
Q    Okay.  Following up on immigration.  Authorities in Fairfax County,
Virginia, ignored an ICE detainer.  They released an illegal immigrant
from Honduras who is charged with sexually assaulting a Virginia minor
and production of sexual abuse material.  Doesn’t that go to show that
as record numbers of people appear at the border, you guys have no idea
what kind of people are coming into this country?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let me just say, first of all, this is why the
President is having negotiations with the Senate — senators, Republicans
and Democrats — right? — for the past couple of weeks to deal with
what’s going on with the border security — right? — as it re- — as it
relates to border security.   
   
This is why the President, on day one, put forward a comprehensive
immigration plan that — that, more than three years now, Congress didn’t
do anything about.   
   
But he’s appreciative that we’re having these conversation in the
Senate.   
   
We’ve de- — we’ve deployed additional troops and federal agents to the
border who have, by the way, returned more than 482,000 individuals
since May.  That’s the — that’s what we’ve been able to do.   
   
We’ve led the largest expansion of lawful pathways, and — that we
haven’t seen in some time.  The President continues to have diplomatic
conversation with Mexico, who have actually taken — taken actions to
deal with the situation.   
   
There’s more work to do.  There’s more work to do.  We understand that. 
We have said that.  You’ve heard that from the President on Friday.  We
understand that there’s more work to do.  We need more resources.  We
need more funding, which is why we’re having these negotiations in — on
the Hill. 

But Republicans in the Senate is working with us; Republicans in the
House are trying to get in the way.  So, it’s up to them.  Are they
going to help?  Are they going to actually deal with an issue or
continue to move forward on a political stunt?  
   
Q    And as President Biden tries to make the national conversation more
about reproductive rights, abortion, how many weeks into a pregnancy
does he think abortion should still be legal?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, you’ve asked me this question before.  I have been
very clear.  The President has been very clear.  We want to see the
protections in Roe — we want to see Roe become the law of the land. 
That’s what the President wants to see.  That’s what the President
believes in.   
   
And let me be very clear here: It’s not some sort of shift that the
President is making.  Majority of Americans want to see their
protections protected by their — by — by this — by — by the — by the
folks who are here in Washington, D.C., in Congress, by this President
and the Vice President.  That’s — the President is standing with
majority of Americans.  
   
We saw that in the 2023 midterm elections, and we saw that in 2022 — not
midterm election, but the 2023 election and 2022 midterm elections.   
   
They’ve been very clear.  We need to stand for freedoms, for — make sure
women have the right to make their own decision — personal decisions on
their body, on their healthcare.  That’s where a majority of Americans
are.   
   
Guess what?  Republican officials, they’re not there.  They’re not with
majority of Americans.  So, the President is going to continue to stand
with the majority of Americans on this.  
   
Go ahead, Brian.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The President on Friday said that he wants to see
massive changes at the border.  What kind of policy changes is he
discussing and open to?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I am not going to negotiate from here.  I’m going
to be very careful, very mindful.  We want to see meaningful change —
meaningful change — so that we can actually deal with a broken system. 
The immigration system is obviously broken, and we want to make sure
that we have resources to deal with what we’re seeing at the border.  
   
And so, that’s what they’re talking about in the Senate with both
Republicans and Democrats.  I’m not going to negotiate from here.  I’m
going to let them have those conversations.  I think that’s important
that they have the space to do that.   
   
But the President wants to deliver meaningful change.  And he is also
very grateful to — to those legislators continuing to have those
conversations.  We think it’s headed in the right direction, but not
going to get into specifics as to what those policy changes would look
like.  
   
Go ahead, right behind you.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Biden admitted Friday that the border isn’t secure. 
Does he have any plans to visit the southern border before the
election?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President was in — visited the border recently.  
   
Q    In January of 2023?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, yeah, that was — that was a year ago.  He’s been
there.  
   
Q    In December of 2023, there were 300,000 migrant encounters, which
is the highest month ever on record.  How bad does the border crisis
have to be for Biden to take a trip back?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, just to reiterate what I just said seconds ago,
the President has been to the border.  He has visited the border.  He
saw for himself.  He spoke to law enforcement.  He saw exactly what goes
on at the border.  The President understands what’s going on at the
border, which is why he included in his national security supplemental —
right? — which is, again, a request that is — when you feel like there’s
an emergency, you make that supplemental request, which is what the
President did.  
   
It included border security.  It included, obviously, Ukraine and
Israel.  And it is incredibly important, which is why he continues to
push for it.  And you’re seeing those conversations happening in the
Senate in a bipartisan way — a bipartisan agreement, and the President
is very thankful to that.  
   
And so, I’m going to leave that there.  He’s taking this very
seriously.   
   
Remember, day one — day one, he put forward an immigration — a
comprehensive immigration legislation.  
   
Go ahead, Earle.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  You made clear that the — that call in New
Hampshire was a fake with the President’s voice, and that was
discouraging people from coming out to vote.  Does that mean that he
would encourage people to go out and vote in New Hampshire, even though
he’s not on the ballot (inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I am not going to speak to an ongoing — an ongoing
election.  I can’t — I can’t from here.  I’m a federal employee.  I
cannot speak to this.  
   
Q    Even if he doesn’t (inaudible) or he doesn’t want to (inaudible)
—  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I cannot — I can’t — you — I would refer you to the
campaign.  I cannot speak to that from here.  
   
Q    And then a quick follow-up from, I think, Friday.  I know that the
President, through his Chief of Staff, apologized to Asa Hutchinson, who
is a defeated candidate.  It — does that — I know that he wanted — he
didn’t agree with those words in the DNC statement, but does he fear
that the DNC has taken its eye off the ball as far as trying to win over
disaffected Republicans with that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to be very careful, because you are speaking
— you’re — you are asking me, essentially, about an upcoming election,
an election year that we’re in.  So, I’m not going to speak to the DNC. 
I would refer you to the DNC themselves.  
   
But I — I reiterated that the statement that came out from the DNC, that
I can speak on behalf of the President, that what he — what was said and
what was in that statement did not reflect this President.   
   
I just don’t have anything else to share beyond that.  
   
Go ahead, Toluse.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Governor Whitmer was on “Face the Nation” on
Sunday, and she talked about the abortion issue.  And she said that it
would be good for the President to talk more about it.  And she also
said that he should use more “blunt language.”  What’s your reaction to
that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, in a — in a few minutes, you’re going to hear
directly from this President.  He’s going to be meeting with his task
force.  It is the fourth time he’ll be meeting with this task force. 
The President has made it very clear that women across the country
should be making these personal — deeply personal decisions about their
own bodies, and not politicians.   
   
He’ll continue to stand for that.  He’ll continue to stand with
overwhelming — overwhelmingly majority of Americans.  And — and, you
know, he believes and agrees that — that reproductive freedom is a
fundamental right.  It is a fundamental right.   
   
Within — I believe, if my timing is right, within the hour after the
decision was made by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, you heard from
the President.  He — he spoke passionately about it.  He spoke
forcefully about what had just happened, freedoms being taken away.   
   
And at the top, I talked about how 21 states now have — have bans on
abortion or some sort of restriction — restrictive ban on abortion or
restrictive — restricting rights on that.  And that affects 27 million
women — 27 million women.  
   
So, you’re going to hear from the President in very — like I said, in a
few short minutes, you’ll hear from him, and he’ll speak directly to
this.  And he’s been very, very clear, he’s going to stand with the
majority of Americans on this.  
   
Q    On another issue, the President is going to South Carolina on
Saturday.  He’s going to spend the night.  Do you have any more
information about what he’s going to be doing —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ll have —  
   
Q    — especially on Sunday?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I believe the campaign will have more to share on his
trip to South Carolina.  I don’t have anything at this time.  
   
All right.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, you said to Peter that the President wants to see Roe
restored.  It’s still not clear to me, though, if he supports the
late-term abortion restrictions that were included in Roe.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — well, if it’s in Roe, then that’s what he wants to
see.  I’m just not going to get into it.  It’s — whatever is in Roe,
what Roe was when it was a constitutional law, that’s what the President
wants to see restored.  He’s been very clear about that.  
   
Q    He also said he wants to be a president for all Americans.  But
how, in this situation, with this issue, does he best represent the
pro-life Americans who want to see more unborn babies saved?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I will say is a majority of Americans — a
majority of Americans wants to see their rights protected, wants to see
women have their rights protected, wants to be able to — wants — want
women to be able to make those deeply, deeply personal decisions on
their bodies on their own, and not politicians.  That’s what the
majority of Americans want to see.  
   
And so, the President is going to stand with the majority of Americans
on this issue.  
   
Q    And do those unborn babies have any rights, then?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into that specific — I’m not
going to get into that question.  I’ve been very, very clear about this
— where a majority of Americans stand, and that’s what matters.   
   
But the President wants to see Roe become the law of the land, and
that’s what he’s going to continue to ask Congress to do.  
   
Thanks, everybody.  We’ll see you tomorrow.  
   
2:08 P.M. EST
