James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:49 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Last night, as you saw
from Dr. O’Connor’s letter, President Biden completed his course of
Paxlovid.  His symptoms are almost completely resolved.  And as you’ve
seen today, he’s had another busy day of working.  All of his tests
remain normal, and the President now feels well enough to resume his
physical exercise regimen.  We’ll continue to keep you posted on any
developments there.   
   
But today, with CHIPS for America moving ahead in the Senate and ahead
of Q2 GDP on Thursday, we wanted to bring in Brian Deese, Director of
National Economic Council, to answer your questions directly on all of
the economic news of the day.  
   
And with that, Brian?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Thanks, Karine.  Hi, everybody.  I just wanted to start with
a couple of updates on some of our core economic priorities here at the
White House, and then happy to take your questions.  
   
So, three updates.  
   
The first is on what has been a longstanding administration priority
around attracting more investment into the United States, building more
secure supply chains, and building more industrial strength here in
America.  
   
I just came from a meeting in the Roosevelt Room with the President and
the chairman of SK, a South Korean conglomerate.  And they made today a
very significant announcement: $22 billion in investments in the United
States across a broad complex of investments that all share a common
feature — they all are at the cutting edge of innovation in
manufacturing globally.  So we’re talking large-capacity batteries,
electric vehicle charging manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing,
and pharmaceuticals.  
   
And the President noted this at top but it was clear in the context of
the meeting that SK’s confidence and commitment in making this kind of
long-term and very significant investment in the United States is a
clear signal that the United States, along with its allies, is winning
the technology competition for the 21st century.  
   
And, of course, this comes in the context of a significant vote that the
Pre- — that the Senate took just earlier today in bipartisan fashion to
move forward the historic CHIPS for America Act.  Some of you were with
us yesterday — just yesterday, when we were meeting with CEOs and labor
leaders to underscore the economic and national security significance of
this piece of legislation.  And we are hopeful that we can get that
piece of legislation to the President’s desk here without delay.  
   
And I think if you connect these things together, what you see is a
really historic resurgence in American manufacturing and American
innovation.  I would note that over the past 18 months, we’ve seen the
economy create 613,000 jobs just in manufacturing alone.  That’s the
strongest growth in manufacturing in three decades.  And, again, I think
it demonstrates that, in the aggregate, across investing in
infrastructure, working with partners and allies, prioritizing research,
prioritizing things like semiconductors, we are building an innovation
ecosystem here in the United States to attract this investment,
particularly in the context of a period prior to this when we were
seeing more and more of that investment go to China.  
   
The second part I just wanted to update you on is energy and energy
markets.  I hope that you are all aware and have seen the progress that
we’re making on gas prices coming down here in the United States.  
   
But as you’ve heard the President say and certainly our team’s focus is
to keep up on the key policy priorities that are helping to stabilize
markets, even in the face of global uncertainty and a globally uncertain
energy market.  
   
And so I would just note today, again, two pieces of news.  The first is
that the Department of Energy published its next notice of sale for
release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  These releases
have really proved critical over the last several months.  
   
When I think I was here initially and announced that the President had
directed the goal of releasing a million barrels a day, a lot of the
questions that you and others had was whether this was even feasible,
whether it was actually feasible to sustain putting a million barrels a
day onto the market consistently.  We’ve now demonstrated that that is
the case.  And a new analysis out from the Treasury Department today
underscores the significance that that collective release from the
United States and our allies has reduced gas prices by about 40 cents a
gallon compared to where we would be had the President not directed that
action and worked with our international partners.  
   
The second is: The administration, the Department of Energy is proposing
a new rule today that would allow DOE to enter into forward contracts to
purchase oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future at a
fixed set price.  This sounds a little wonky, but bear with me; it’s
actually quite important.  
   
What it means is that producers — oil producers have more certainty
about future demand for their product because the Department of Energy,
having released significant oil onto the market, is now going to be a
significant purchaser of oil into the future.  
   
So with this rule in place, they will be able to enter into fixed
contracts to buy at a set price.  And what that does is it provides oil
producers more certainty and more incentive to produce in the near term
if they know that they’re going to get paid at a fixed price at a future
date.  
   
I would note that those purchases are not going to happen until well in
the future.  And because of the shape of the futures curve in oil, we
can actually purchase more oil, replenish the SPR, strengthen that
natural asset without competing for demand for barrels in the near
term.  
   
So that rule was proposed today, and the Department of Energy will be
working to finalize that and then — and then work with the industry to
enter into these fixed-price contracts for repurchase.  
   
The third priority is in context around what we have discussed with you
all around our economic goal of transitioning from a historically strong
recovery into a period of more stable and steady growth.  
   
We are in that period of transition right now.  I think it’s — the
analogy is to running legs of a race where we ran the first leg of this
race at an extraordinarily fast clip.  That has served us well in terms
of positioning us in a stronger position than virtually any other
country in the world.  
   
And now we are seeing growth slowing, which is what we should expect —
or we would expect.  But as we look across the economy today, what we
and other outside analysts identify is that consumer spending remains
solid, household balance sheets remain largely in good shape.  We are
seeing credit delinquencies and measures of credit stress at
historically — at historic lows; credit card delinquencies at a 15-year
low, mortgage delinquencies at a 30-year low.  And we’re seeing
industrial output sustain and in positive territory five of the last six
months.  
   
And so the totality of the economic data is consistent with that type of
transition, and is not consistent with a recession.  
   
Just to dig into that a little bit, I just — a couple of points.  One is
on hiring.  And I think we have a chart here.  But just to explain what
you’re looking at here: During the second quarter, the economy created
375,000 jobs a month.  So that’s the yellow bar on the far side.  
   
In the first few months of every recession since the 1980s, the economy
lost jobs.  And so, historically, in the United States, when we’re in a
recession — I think this is a sort of typical, commonsense understanding
of recession, but it also happens to be the case — the economy is losing
jobs.  In the second quarter of this year, there was record-setting job
creation.  
   
In fact, if you look at the period immediately preceding recessions in
the United States, job growth is roughly one third of what it was in the
second quarter.   
   
So what we’re seeing on the labor market side is a continued resilient,
strong labor market recovery.  
   
On spending and investment — again, what economists think about as core
to the economy’s strength, what consumers are doing in terms of
spending, what households are doing in terms of investment in businesses
— real private final demand, which measures consumption and investment
by consumers and businesses, it grew at 3 percent in the first quarter,
and it’s expected to grow in the second quarter.  And then, again,
that’s in contrast to what we see typically during recessions.  
   
So I just want to make a final note on the definition of recession,
which has been an issue that I know many of you have reported on.  
   
As Secretary Yellen said on Sunday, two negative quarters of GDP growth
is not the technical definition of recession.  It’s not the definition
that economists have traditionally relied on.   
   
There is an organization called the National Bureau of Economic
Research, and what they do is they look at a broad range of data in
deciding whether or not a recession has occurred.  That is the process
that economists and administrations have used for years and decades to
identify when a recession has occurred.  
   
But from the President’s perspective, putting that technical question
aside, the most important question economically is whether working
people and middle-class families have more breathing room, they have
more job opportunities, their wages are growing up — going up in a — in
a stable way, and they’re able to afford the important things in their
lives, from food and gasoline, also to healthcare and prescription
drugs, and afford education for themselves and their children and
otherwise.  
   
And that is what has animated his economic strategy.  It’s what his
focus is on.  It’s why you have seen him as focused as he has been on
trying to work to take policy actions that will lower prices and lower
costs for American families in this moment, even as we work to bring
inflation down and effectuate that in terms of the transition to a more
stable and steady state.

So with that, let me — let me pause, and I’m happy to take any questions
you may have.  
   
Q    Thanks, Brian.  You’ve spent a lot of time, and the White House
has, this week trying to explain why you believe that the — that your —
that the U.S. is not definitionally in a recession.  But why should the
average American who is really concerned about their personal economic
situation, and their wages aren’t increasing as fast as inflation,
they’re struggling to put food on the table, fill up their tank — why
should they care if the U.S. is definitionally in a recession or not?

MR. DEESE:  Yeah, it’s a great question.  It was sort of what I was
trying to underscore in terms of where the President really centers on
in terms of his economic policy and his economic goals.

At core, what his focus is and the direction to his team is to say: Are
we putting in place the right policies and the right strategies that
will help those working Americans, middle-class families achieve some
measure of economic security and economic dignity, and be able to have
upward economic mobility as well?

And I think if you look at the progress that we have made over the
course of the last 18 months, we have made historic strides in many ca-
— in many areas, not the least of which has been the pace of this
historic economic recovery and the return of job growth; the increase in
wages, particularly for those at the bottom end; the equitable nature of
this recovery.

And we have a serious inflation challenge, which is hitting economies
around the globe, but is hitting Americans.  And that’s why you have a
President that is focused as acutely as he is on what we can do to
actually lower prices right now.

And I would say that, you know, the reduction in gas prices that you’ve
seen over the last couple of weeks is providing some measure of
breathing room — not enough, but some measure of breathing room.

The steps to pass the CHIPS bill, as we’ve discussed, will make a big
difference in terms of not only jobs here in America, but increasing the
supply, building the resilience of our supply chains, which we have seen
have been so connected to increased costs.

So those are — that’s where the President’s priorities are, and that’s
where he’s focused.  This is about trying to actually improve the lives
and outcomes of middle-class families.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, MJ.

Q    This is a related question, but all the discussions that are
happening about the definition of a recession aside, I wonder if you
could help us understand how much weight the White House puts on that
definition versus just the simple reality that the majority of Americans
right now just feel like we are living through a recession right now.

MR. DEESE:  Look, our focus is on trying to improve economic
circumstances in this country.  That’s what we are focused on, and
that’s what all of our policies are designed to do.

So when we think about what we’re prioritizing, when the President is
focused on taking actions, like a historic step to put a million barrels
a day of oil onto the market, it’s because we know, and we now have seen
in the data, that that helps to reduce energy prices, that helps to
reduce gas prices, and we can help to encourage the process we’ve seen
of gas prices coming down by about 70 cents, by about 100 bucks a month.

So that’s — that’s — that’s where — that’s where our focus is. 
Obviously, there are — you know, there’s — we spend a lot of time
analyzing economic data, as — as you do as well.  But in the core,
that’s what our objective is and that’s where our focus is.

Q    And just, as his economic advisor, do you think that the President
currently is sort of able to fully understand, internalize the fact
that, I think, a recent CNN poll said that 64 percent of Americans
believe the country is already in a recession?  Do you think his
travels, his meetings, the conversations he’s able to have with people
from the White House, that that has been enough for him to really
understand that?

MR. DEESE:  Look, I think that President Biden, before he ran for office
as President and now, is somebody who deeply understands what it means
to be in a family where if you’re sitting around a kitchen table — you
all have heard him say this multiple times, but it’s because it’s his
lived experience to sit around a kitchen table and understand what it
means when the price of gas goes up or the price of food goes up.  And
that’s why you hear him, when he is talking about economic issues, go
directly to that as the core of understanding that’s the challenge and
what can we do to address it.

It’s also why you’re going to hear him be as emphatic as he is about why
when something like gas prices come down, that means that those same
families are getting a little breathing room.  And that’s — you know,
I’m using his terminology of how he communicates about this issue, that
it’s that breathing room; it’s that, when you get to the end of the
month and you have enough to make things add up, that is — that — that
certainly animates him.  And you’ve heard that from him repeatedly.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Karen.

Q    On that breathing room: Gas, of course, is down.  You guys have
been touting that — down over the past month.  But in other areas,
things like food and rent still appear to be climbing.  Is it the White
House view that inflation has peaked?

MR. DEESE:  So it’s our view that inflation is the top economic priority
that we need to be focused on as a country.  And it is our view that if
we move out more quickly and more aggressively on the types of steps
that the President has outlined, then we are going to move more quickly
to helping to bring prices down.

So — so you talked about some of those — some of those costs.  Well, one
of the costs — one of the big cost drivers that families are facing is
the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs.  And we have an
opportunity, and the President has been fighting for some time, to
finally do something to reform prescription drug pricing; to bring down
the cost for seniors, for families, for people with chronic conditi- —
chronic conditions; and also bring down the cost for the federal
government and reduce the deficit in a way that would be complementary
to the Fed’s policies.

So — so that’s — that’s our view, and that’s why we’re putting the
priority that we are on getting more progress on these policies.  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Peter.

Q    Brian, the President — the President’s economic advisors were
telling us last year that inflation was going to be temporary.  That’s
not true.  Now the President’s economic advisors are saying there’s not
going to be a recession.  Are you sure?

MR. DEESE:  Well, let me just say this: We look at a range of data, we
assess that data, and we lay it out for ourselves and for the
President.  But you don’t have to take our — our word on this.

Q    But the President does, right?

MR. DEESE:  On the question — no, no, on — but on the — but — but we
also — we also look at what outside analysts are doing.  We look at
every type of analysis that you could imagine.

But let me just — let me just — let me just highlight:  
   
So, Citigroup: “Little of the data \[that\] I see tells me that the U.S.
is on” a cup — “the cusp of a recession.”   
   
Morgan Stanley: “With strong job growth and continued robust final
domestic demand and consumption, this economy really does not look
particularly recessionary.”   
   
JP Morgan: “It is inconceivable for a labor market that has generated
close to 500,000 jobs average monthly gains for the past six months to
be in a recession.”

So — so, we — we analyze the data.  We look at the data.  We understand
the — the significant uncertainties that exist in the global economy,
including issues of war, including issues of supply chains.  But we also
look at what other analysts and outside observers are, and — and
certainly that’s something that I know you and your outlets do as well.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Peter.

Q    Yeah, so, Brian, when — if you look back at the Rescue Plan last
year — the COVID relief plan last year, do you have any regrets or you
thought it was a mistake not to have structured it like the Child Tax
Credit to last longer?  I mean, those have run out.  A lot of families
are still struggling today.  I mean, when you look back on that, do you
wish you’d done it differently?

MR. DEESE:  So I think that if you look at where we are economically
right now, one of the most striking features is the resilience — the
resilience of our economic recovery, the resilience of consumers and
households and our businesses through a period of what were significant
and unanticipated shocks — shocks with waves of COVID, successive waves
of COVID, a war in Ukraine.  And when you look at the resilience of our
economy, a lot of it can be traced back to the strength — the unique
strength of our labor market recovery.   
   
And so I think that we are in a better position as a result of the
policies that we’ve taken and those policies that directly put us in a
position to be more resilient.  And certainly that is true if you look
at it on a global basis.

Q    But the Child Tax Credit — I mean, would you have wanted that to
have lasted longer than it has at this point?  I mean, it’s — the
economy (inaudible) families who benefitted from that temporarily no
longer — you know, no longer have it.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I think the President has made his policy views on
that issue clear.  And certainly — certainly there and in other areas,
there are places where he has — he has had longer-term — longer —
longer-term goals and priorities.   
   
But if you’re asking the — but I think that you also have to look at
where we are compared to not just where we could have been, but where
other countries are globally.  And if you do that, then I think what you
see is that we are in a relatively stronger position, and that is due in
no small part to what this President was able to actually get done
legislatively — not just the American Rescue Plan, but also the
Infrastructure Bill as well, which is continuing to help to drive
investment here and also improve the investment climate so we see more
things like SK, a global company, deciding to invest across the United
States as well.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Steve and then Seung Min.  
   
Q    What sort of impact would relaxing the tariffs on China have on
U.S. economic growth?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I think that that’s a — an issue that, as you know, is
under active consideration.  And the President will, you know, make a
determination on that question.   
   
I think you’ve heard that he has mentioned that he intends to have a
conversation with President Xi of China here shortly.  And so I will
reserve on that issue, understanding that — the question that — that the
— there are a number of different analyses of that question.  You can
rest assured that we are looking into and looking underneath and around
all of them, and we’ll come back to that issue when the President has
more to say.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Seung Min.  
   
Q    So administration officials have said the level of hiring indicates
the economy is not in a recession.  But as you know, the jobs report
relies on two separate surveys.  We’ve seen gains in the establishment
survey.  But in a survey of households, the total number of jobs has
actually dropped since March.  So what is the administration’s
explanation for that discrepancy?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, again, I would say that you — you point to the
administration.  Certainly that is our view, but it’s not our view in
isolation, just to reinforce.   
   
I will not repeat myself, but in this case, Moody’s, for example: “Job
numbers are incongruous with fears that \[a\] recession is dead
ahead.”   
   
Pantheon Macroeconomics: The “talk of the economy being in recession…now
is fanciful,” given the jobs data that we are seeing.  So, that
certainly is our view, but it’s not our view alone.   
   
The — the issue of discrepancy between the payroll and the household
survey is something that certainly we understand and keep close track
of.   The economists and statisticians that look most closely at this
tend to put greater weight on the payroll survey because of its broader
breadth — significantly broader breadth.  
   
But we also — and I think that you’ve heard this from the podium
consistently as well: We don’t put too much stake in any one individual
month of data, which is why I think looking at the trend — (chart on TV
screen is removed) — at least we were looking at the trend — looking at
the trend in the labor market probably provides the clearest picture. 
And that trend on that front is consistent, historically strong job
growth.  
   
I — as I mentioned, about 400,000 jobs a month over the course of the
last three months.  That is down from a rate of closer to 600,000 jobs a
month in the prior three months.  But again, that would be consistent
with what we would expect to see as we move through this transition.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to go to the back.  Alex, in the back.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Brian, I’m sure you saw the chief economist of the IMF
said that the global outlook had “darkened significantly since April.” 
And I think he said that the world was “teetering on the edge of a
global recession.”  So if that were to happen, wouldn’t the shockwaves
reverberate?  And sort of, even if we’re stabl- — in a stable position
right now, wouldn’t that sort of affect us as well?  
   
And then just to go back to what Peter asked — I don’t want to reiterate
this question, but — I mean, I don’t want to repeat it, but for some
reason, people are very gloomy about the state of the economy.  And I
wonder if you could just think through why the data you presented, the
reassurances you have made, seem to — are being challenged, you know,
from Left and Right alike.  
   
MR. DEESE:  So on your first question: Look, there’s no question that
the global economy right now faces a set of very serious historic
challenges and real and elevated risks.  A lot of that is emanating the
second- and third-order impacts of the war in Ukraine and its impact on
supply and its impact on energy markets.   
   
But we’re also still dealing with the impact of COVID, which is
affecting different parts of the world.  And we know, having lived
through this pandemic, that our supply chains are not yet resilient
enough to be unaffected by those — those shocks as well.   
   
So those risks in the global context are real.  And it’s part of why you
see the President putting the priority that he has on working to
maintain a strong, unified, global coalition on things like the war in
Ukraine; working proactively on issues like the price cap on Russian oil
to try to get ahead of future challenges in the market; working
diplomatically around issues of food security; and trying to do what we
can to address the very serious challenges of food security
internationally.  And certainly, we are — we are attentive to those
risks internationally and the impact they have on the U.S. economy.   
   
I think the thing that I would say in the face of those real risks is
that the United States is in a stronger position to actually train our
focus on tackling inflation than virtually any other country.  And you
see that not only in the indicators that we’ve talked about today; you
see that, for example, in the strength of our currency.  
   
Q    Right, but do you think we’re stronger than the Euro bloc in
aggregate, in terms of weathering a recessionary shock?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, look, I think that our — our economy is more resilient
to the — to the types of challenges that we’ve faced.  For example, you
know, with respect to food, we’re a net exporter of agricultural
commodities.  And, obviously, the high prices are hitting Americans very
hard, but they’re — that — in a way that is different from some places
that are facing famine, for example.   
   
But — but I think if you look at the sort of core elements of economic
resilience, the United States is better positioned, which is not to
suggest — and I think it goes to your second point — the challenges that
American families are facing and the concerns that they have about the
cost of food, the cost of gas, the challenges of supply chains that are
still not fixed so that things don’t work the way that they always have:
We understand, the President certainly understands those challenges are
real and they’re affecting people in their daily lives.   
   
So our goal and our focus is not to try to ignore them.  In fact, it’s
the opposite.  You have a President who is saying, “Those are the key
challenges that I’m trying to wake up every day to try to improve.” 
There’s a lot of things he can do on his own.  And in places where he
can, you’ve seen some real progress.  There’s places where he needs help
from Congress as well.  But we’re seeing some real progress on there as
well.  
   
This vote on the CHIPS Act today is historic.  And, hopefully, we’ll be
in a situation to sign that into law and start having the impact of that
happen in real-time.   
   
Hopefully, we’ll be able to make some progress on big, significant
issues like prescription drugs here in the coming days.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Ken.  
   
Q    Brian, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in
chunks in order to try to tame inflation.  We’re expecting 75 basis
points this week.  What is the risk of overkill here that they go too
far?  And do you think that so-called “soft landing” is still
attainable?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So the — as you said, the Fed is operating its course on
monetary policy.  And this will not surprise you, I will leave the —
that to the province of the Federal Reserve.  
   
I think that if we look at where we are in this transition, then
certainly we believe that we — not only can we move through this
transition and get to a place of more stable growth without having to
give up those economic benefits, but that we’ve identified — as the Fed
operates and takes the steps that it will take, we have identified a set
of very clear steps that we could take, and that we could take working
with Congress, to actually help to increase the prospect that we get to
that goal.   
   
And one of the things that I would underscore in that context is — and
we’ve had — you know, had conversations about this and that.  You know,
it’s a place where we don’t always find common ground with our
Republican colleagues in — is that actually enacting deficit reduction
at this time would be complimentary to what the Fed is trying to
accomplish.   
   
And if you look at something like prescription drugs, where you can
actually lower costs for the end-consumer or the end-user and lower the
cost to the federal balance sheet, then it has the — that sort of — the
— all of the attributes that you would want at this moment to try to
reduce price pressures in the economy and reduce price pressures for
individuals’, families’ balance sheets.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Just two quick questions on NEC projections.  Is it — to level set
and get it on the record, is it NEC’s projection that the second quarter
numbers will show positive growth or negative growth?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, we — I will wait, as all of you will, to — to receive
that data.  We don’t have the data, obviously.  And we will — we will
not receive it until the appropriate time.  And until then, I will — I
will leave it there.  
   
Q    You have no expectation one way or the other?   
   
MR. DEESE:  We are looking at every — at every analysis and every — and
every projection that is — that is being made.  But we will — we will
wait and see where those numbers come out.  
   
Q    So when it comes to strength in the labor market going forward, if
there is a picture that shows that the U.S. economy has shrunk over the
first half of this year at a time when inflation is at a four-plus
decade high, at a time that the Federal Reserve is increasing interest
rates, is it sustainable for there to be a strong, hot labor market in
this country going forward?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So, we have a — we have a strong labor market, and we
believe that the goal of our policy is to bring down inflation while
maintaining strength in the labor market.  That is the goal, and we
believe that that is achievable and that the policy steps that we are
outlining would help increase the likelihood that we can get to that
goal.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jenny.

Q    Thanks.  Brian, I’m curious how concerned you are about reports
that U.S. retailers like Walmart, which came out last night, are
reporting that inventories are piling up and consumers are foregoing
pricier items.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Well, I would say we’re seeing a number of — I won’t speak
to any one individual company.  But what — I think what we’re seeing
across consumer categories is that consumer spending overall is —
continues to hold up.  The composition of that spending is changing. 
We’re seeing less spending on goods, more spending on services.  And we
are seeing some, you know, discounting activity as well.  
   
But I think that, you know, with respect to the question of inventories
and discounting, this is also, you know, one of the issues of
transitioning — that there was a period of time where the concern was
companies couldn’t get enough inventory and they were working through
supply chain challenges.  Certainly, it’s clear that at least a number
of companies across the economy may have over-ordered on inventory and
are now seeking to actually discount prices.  
   
That discounting is, again, part of a process and can mean some good
news for — for the American consumer.  But I think, you know, in the
aggregate, consumer spending is continuing to sustain at the macro
level.  
   
Q    And then one follow-up to Steve’s question on the China tariffs,
which I know you guys have been discussing internally for a long time. 
But did I understand you right that you’re not giving us your internal
projections of what cutting a portion of the tariffs would do to ease
inflation or impact growth until the President makes his announcement? 
So, you’re not giving us anything ahead of time, like how you’re viewing
the debate, which is playing out internally and externally?  Obviously,
lots of stakeholders have thoughts on that.  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, I’m — I’m going to leave — I’m going to leave our
commentary on that issue for the President.  As I mentioned, he’s going
to be having a phone call and we’ll come to that issue when he’s — when
he’s ready to do so.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  A couple more.  Caitlin.  
   
Q    How do you explain the drop in the Consumer Confidence Index
today?  
   
MR. DEESE:  I think what we’ve seen, I mean, it connects to some of the
other conversations that we’ve — we — or some of the other questions
that we have had is that, clearly, the — the impact for, you know,
typical families of high food prices, high gas prices, and dealing with
the impact of inflation is — is challenging and challenging for a number
of — for families across the country.  
   
And so, we see that reflected in surveys and sentiment.  And that is one
of the reasons why we are as motivated as we are to try to do everything
that we can to bring prices down.  Even as we see that there is this —
there is a divergence in the economy right now between sentiment and
spending behavior, we are motivated to try to bring prices down exactly
because it’s — it’s hitting — it’s hitting families.  
   
And so, it’s also why, you know, you’ve seen — you saw in the University
of Michigan sentiment a little bit as well, bringing gas prices down is
an important part of trying to bring some relief economically and also
in terms of consumers’ outlook.  
   
Q    And, sorry, just one quick question, because you mentioned the
CHIPS bill: For people watching at home, can you give a brief
description of how exactly they will see prices fall because of the
passage of that bill?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Sure.  So, we’ve seen over the course of this pandemic
crisis and pandemic recovery that when our supply chains aren’t resil- —
are not resilient and when we don’t have access to the input components
that go into everything that — that our economy is dependent on, that
our manufacturers are incapable of making enough of those products, and
that raises prices.   
   
The most salient example of that is cars.  The President spoke to this
yesterday.  If you look in 2021, for, you know, typical people at home,
a third of the inflation that we had in 2021 was reflected by the cost
of cars — new and used automobiles.  And much of that was driven by the
fact that there was insufficient supply of semiconductors, insufficient
supply of the computer chips that kept our manufacturers from making
more vehicles.  
   
So, we need to increase production and supply of semiconductors.  Doing
so will actually allow our manufacturers to produce more goods — not
just cars, but consumer electronics, appliances.  Semiconductors are in
almost every — each of you is carrying or engaging right now with
products that have multiple semiconductors in them, and having more
supply will do so.

Even as this bill will help to encourage multi-year investments in the
United States, there are companies all around the world right now that
are making decisions this week and this month on where they are going to
invest and how much they are going to expand.   
   
Passage of this bill — you’ve heard it from the CEOs themselves —
passage of this bill will be a game-changer for them into — in deciding
how quickly they will move out, how aggressively they move out, and,
importantly, whether that investment will be here in the United
States.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    Thank you.  You talked about the Treasury Department analysis on
what the Strategic Petroleum Reserve release is on the gas prices.  So,
my question is: Is that going to continue beyond that 100 days to sort
of keep that trend going?  And if not, is there a worry about sticker
shock for drivers once the release is exhausted?  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, so the release was — the commitment and the direction
the President made was for six months, so 180 days.  And we are contin-
— we continue to be in that process.  
   
The timeline of that was — it was deliberate.  It was because earlier
this year, in engaging with industry, we urged them to increase their
own production — private production — and that we heard from a number of
industry players that they would be able to increase production by about
a million barrels a day by later in the fall, by the October time
frame.  
   
And so, the six-month release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of a
million barrels a day was intended to be a bridge to that — to that
period.  And that certainly continues to be our intention and our policy
goal.  We don’t have, as of — as of today, as we sit here today, we
don’t have an intention to continue that further.  What we need is the
private sector to come in and provide that production.  We have that
resource and it has provided a valuable role, but it’s not intended to
be a permanent solution.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Franco.  
   
Q    Thanks, Brian.  Understanding that the administration doesn’t think
that it’s in a recession or heading towards a recession, is the
administration taking — making plans for if things do turn worse that
would meet the administration’s definition for contingency plans?  
   
Is there an escalatory roadmap, for example, of actions that the
administration can take?  Or is the administration already putting
everything it can into it?  Or are there more steps that can be taken if
things go worse?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So we engage in wide-ranging analysis of data and scenarios
as a matter of our work and our job, but our focus is actually on
policies that will improve the prospects of us moving forward and
bringing prices down without giving up the economic gains that we’ve
made.  
   
So, our focus and our priority right now is on a set of very important
steps that we can make progress on, as I’ve mentioned, around CHIPS, but
also around prescription drugs; around providing some degree of deficit
reduction; reducing utility bills; maintaining progress toward
lower-cost sources of energy, even as we take on the issues that we
must, with respect to climate change.  Those are the focus areas.   
   
But we certainly — we certainly analyze data broadly and look at a broad
range of scenarios.  But we train our focus on the steps we can take
right now to actually make progress on the economic end.  
   
Q    But, for example, as Steve was pointing out: If the labor market
takes a turn, are there contingency plans in place that — actions that
could be taken?  
   
MR. DEESE:  We are always looking at, broadly, both data and future
scenarios.  That’s part of — that’s part of how we operate.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Two more.  Go ahead, (inaudible.)  
   
Q    The President has been weighing a decision on student debt relief
for more than a year now.  On April 28th, he said a decision was coming
in the next couple of weeks.  So can you help explain why it’s taking so
long and when there might be an update on that decision?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So the President spoke to his — the timeline on this issue,
and I’ve got nothing beyond what he’s said on that front.  
   
Q    Brian, just following up on the CHIPS question.  When will the
first chip that’s produced with money from this bill come online?  
   
MR. DEESE:  So the way that this bill operates — I would answer that
question in two ways.  The first is: When will we start seeing the
economic impact in terms of investment decision-making and production? 
And the answer to that is: immediately.   
   
And you don’t need to go any further than asking the CEOs of the
chip-producing companies and the chip-consuming companies about — they
have been actively weighing decisions about when and how and how
aggressively to make investment decisions on the confidence that the
United States was going to step up and do this.  
   
In terms of the actual process of then distributing and allocating the
resources in this bill, that will operate over the course of time. 
We’ll move quickly out against that process.  But, of course, doing that
requires great care to make sure that we are clearly enforcing the
taxpayer protections that are in the bill.  
   
Q    Sure.  Because I just — it’s — you want to be careful not to
conflate that this is somehow — the passage of this bill is going to
address supply chain vulnerabilities in the near term, right?  You’re
not suggesting that?  
   
MR. DEESE:  What I’m suggesting is that if we pass this legislation, it
will be the most significant thing that we have done in decades as a
country to actually demonstrate a long-term commitment to building more
resilient supply chains, investing in research and innovation here in
the United States.  That is a multi-year project.  It’s something that
the United States has failed to do for multiple years, and we have seen
the economic and national security consequences of that.   
   
And so, it’s something that, you know, we should have done years ago. 
The sooner we get started, the better positioned we’ll be.   
   
But I’m also suggesting that we will see the impact of this, in terms of
companies’ decision-making, almost immediately.  But the long term —
this is a — this is a long-term project, a long-term national project
that is of vital economic and national security consequence, and the
ultimate impact of that will be felt over the course of years.   
   
Q    Brian?  Brian?  I just have one last quick — over here, Brian.    
   
MR. DEESE:  Thank you all very much.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s up to you.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Thanks, Brian.  Appreciate it.   
   
Q    Thank you, Brian.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, Brian.    
   
Okay, just one thing at the top here.  So, later today, President Biden
will virtually join the House Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus celebration
marking the 32nd anniversary of the landmark Americans with Disabilities
Act, which afforded inclusion and access for disabled Americans.  
   
President Biden was proud to co-sponsor this historic legislation as a
senator, and his administration has taken a number of steps to advance
equity for Americans with disabilities.  That includes expanding
employment opportunities, ensuring access to education and health, and
increasing access to affordable housing, transportation, and
broadband.  
   
For example, thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, today the
Federal Transit Administration announced new investments to make it
easier for people to get on board at the nation’s oldest rail public
transportation systems.  
   
Earlier today, the Vice President also hosted a roundtable with
disability rights leaders to discuss access to reproductive healthcare,
where she emphasized the administration’s commitment to protecting
reproductive rights and self-determination of all individuals with
disabilities.  
   
Our nation has made great progress since 1990, and the Bi- —
Biden-Harris administration will continue working to ensure that the
vision of the ADA is fully implemented for all Americans with
disabilities.  
   
With that, Seung Min, go ahead.   
   
Q    Yeah, I just have one.  Can you discuss any measures that the
President’s doctors may be taking to try to lower the risk of long COVID
with the President?  And the reason I ask it is obviously he’s — I know,
he’s up to it, or he’s feeling up to it now, but obv- — but there’s
anecdotal data to suggest that, you know, taking it easy, not exercising
might be one way to perhaps lower the risks.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, one thing I would say is that — and you heard
Dr. Jha say this as well — because the President’s symptoms have been
very mild — and as we saw from Dr. O’Connor’s letter, he’s — he asked
last night to exercise.  You know, we are pretty confident that we will
continue to see the President to continue to recover from this.   
   
I mean, look, the thing to remember — and you’ve heard us say this over
and over again; Dr. O’Connor said this in his letter; you’ve heard Dr.
Jha say this as well — is because the — because the President is fully
vaccinated, double boosted, and has this treatment of Paxlovid, which is
— you know, we see this as a teachable moment, you’ve heard us say, for
the American public.  Who — who else can they — for those who have not
been vaccinated or have not gotten their boosted — booster yet — learn
from than the President of the United States of how important it is to
get those free vaccines, to get those free booster, and to be able to
get Paxlovid, and to protect — and to get that extra protection?  
   
And so, you know, again, there’s a reason why he’s having very mild
symptoms.  It’s because of the work that he has been able to do.  And we
are pretty confident that he will continue, you know, to — to get
better.  
   
Q    On monkeypox, is the administration encouraging all Americans to
get vaccinated?  I guess, what’s the guidance?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, our guidance is: First, we’ve had a comprehensive
and aggressive response to this.  That’s what we deployed.  We rolled
out that strategy last month, in June.   
   
And so, once we — once — once we, you know, realized that it was — what
was — what was happening with the cases that we were seeing, there were
more than 300,000 vaccines across the country in a matter of weeks.  And
we quickly ordered the production of 5 million more vaccine when we saw
that the virus was starting to spread.   
   
What we are telling people is to make sure that — well, HHS has also
made available testing, which is really important in the — in this
process.   
   
But we are also telling folks that if you have concerns or if you are —
want to know what your protocol — personal protocols should be, that you
should go to your provider — your medical provider — have that
conversation with your medical provider, or also reach out to the local
— local health dep- — local health agency in your state or city.  
   
Q    So it’s not just saying, “Everybody should get vaccinated”?  It’s
“go to your doctor and talk about it”?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I mean, the best — the best person or place to
go to is your medical provider and have that conversation to see if — if
it is — you know, if it is beneficial to you to get vaccinated.  
   
Q    And then, is the White House going to appoint a monkeypox
coordinator, similar to Dr. Jha’s position?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.  I understand the question.  I don’t have any
personnel announcement to make at this time.   
   
Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Just a quick follow-up on the President’s COVID status.  So since
today is day five of isolation and I know that the White House would
like him to first test negative, will he presumably take a test tomorrow
and then you will assess from there?  Do you have a plan yet?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So that’s up to the — the President’s physician. 
We’re going to continue to be transparent and share the President’s
physician’s note — detailed — detailed note of his examination of him
and how the President is going to do.  We’ll have that for — for all of
you tomorrow.  
   
We will — when he gets tested, we will be transparent about that and
share that with you.  
   
Q    And then just two separate questions.  It’s been two and a half
weeks since the President signed an executive order on protecting
reproductive rights.  I just wanted to know — I’m not asking you to
preview anything that’s not been announced — can you say whether people
should expect more executive actions from the President?  And any kind
of timeline you can offer?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — I’m not going to get ahead of the policy
process.  The President has said he’s going to do everything that he can
to — to protect the — to protect the access to reproductive health for
women across the country.  And we’re talking about privacy.  We’re
talking about contraception.   
   
We see what’s happening on the other side with extreme policies to have
national bans on — on abortion, which is unacceptable to us, as we’ve
made really clear.  
   
You’ve seen the Vice President has been out there these past couple of
days.  She went to Indiana to talk to state legislators, as their state
legislative process was moving forward, and made that clear on where the
Biden-Harris administration stood.   
   
Again, I don’t have anything at this time to share with you.  But also,
as you know, the President has been very clear on continuing to ask
Congress to act — to take action to codify Roe via legislation, and also
to make sure that — to make sure American — the American public has —
their voices are heard.  
   
Q    I wanted to know whether the President has spoken with any
Republican senators on the bill to codify same-sex marriage.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any calls to read out to you.  The
President is in regular touch on different — on a different array of
issues with members of Congress.  So is — so are his offices here,
whether it’s the Office of Leg Affairs or any other office in the White
House that has regular conversation with members of Congress and their
staff on just an array of issues.  I don’t have anything specific to
share.  
   
Q    Without reading out calls, can you say whether those calls have
happened, period; whether those conversations with Senate Republicans on
this topic have happened?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I appreciate the question.  I just don’t have anything
to share with you — any specifics to share.  
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    Karine, what sort of exercise is he doing?  It is treadmill? 
(Laughter.)  Any —  
   
Q    I was just going to ask that.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I knew that was going to come.  I knew, and I should
have asked.  
   
Q    Stationary bike?  Weights?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, you know, I think — I — look, I think it
says a lot — and I spoke to Dr. O’Connor earlier today — that the
President is feeling, you know, well — and we should be thrilled and
wanting him to have that negative test; I’m sure you guys are waiting
for that as well so you can see him in person — that he’s doing well
enough to say that he wants to work out.   
   
I think it’s been reported in the past that he likes to do weights and
he likes to be — you know, do the treadmills.  I don’t think I’m sharing
anything — anything confidential here.  
   
But yeah, I think — I think — it brought a smile to my face when I saw
that he wants to work out.  You know?   
   
Q    And, secondly, what are the implications of Russia’s apparent
decision to withdraw from the — support from the International Space
Station?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So we saw that report as well.  And so, look,
you know, we’re keeping an eye on that for sure.  And so the government
has — has not formally notified the United States of their intentions to
withdraw from the ISS.

Like I said, we saw their comments, we saw the reporting on that.  We
are exploring options to mitigate the potential impacts on the ISS
beyond 2024 if Russia does withdraw.

For our part, we are — we remain committed to working with ISS partners
to ensure the safe operation of the ISS and the astronauts who are on
board.

I refer you to NASA for any additional details, specifics on that.

Go ahead, Karen.

Q    Just a couple on the President’s COVID.  When he was talking at the
event today with the South Korean officials, he had said, “I’m in the
last day of having been diagnosed with COVID.”  Was he referring to the
fact that he’s going to get that test to potentially come back to work?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, I didn’t — I actually didn’t even —

Q    Okay. 

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — hear — hear that statement.  My assumption is, you
know, he’s been isolating.  This is, I believe, the fifth day of
isolation.  Maybe that’s what he was speaking to.  I — I didn’t hear him
say that.  I would have to ask — ask him directly myself.  
   
I know when I had COVID, I was ready — (laughs) — I was ready to go. 
You feel like you’re just, like, “Oh, my gosh.  How can I bust out of
here and really get out there and see the people?”

So I’m sure that he’s excited to — he’s excited.  I know I said this
yesterday, but it’s true: He’s excited to see all of us and be in person
and be out there with the American public again.  And so I’m sure that’s
what he’s looking forward to.

Q    And just to get a follow-up from yesterday, when I asked you about
the potential — how you guys would be testing for the rebound cases.  Is
there any clarity on, when he does get that negative test, of what the
cadence would look like going forward on the monitoring of the Paxlovid
rebound?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, that’s a great question.  I would have to get back
to you on that.  I — we haven’t had a chance to get, kind of, that
protocol and what that looks like.

Again, we’re going to continue to be transparent here.  We’re going to
continue to share the doctor’s notes with you and his detailed
information on how the President is doing.  And so, you know, we’re just
going to make sure that you all have the information that you all need
on that.

Go ahead, Jenny.

Q    Thanks.  Let me try one more time on the Taiwan —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What — the exercise?  The weights?  (Laughter.)

Q    — the Taiwan visit.  No, actually — I mean, I don’t know, if you
want to give us details on that, that’s fine too.

So, I know you guys want to say that the Pelosi visit is, you know, a
hypothetical, but the Speaker hasn’t denied that she had tr- — you know,
plans to go.  So I think we’re sort of past the fact that it is a
hypothetical, and it’s now, you know, also a real issue because
lawmakers are speaking out supporting her, from both parties, saying,
you know, Pelosi not going to Taiwan would hand “a victory” to China,
from McConnell.  And Menendez said, “If we can allow the Chinese to
dictate who can visit Taiwan and who cannot, then we \[have\] already
ceded Taiwan to the Chinese.”

So at the very least, like, is there something the White House can say
in response to those lawmakers having very strong thoughts about what it
would mean for the Speaker of the House to pull down her trip?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, I’m going to let the lawmakers speak for
themselves.  As I speak for the President and the White House, we are
just not going to get ahead or an announcement that — that actually has
not happened yet on her travel.

What we will say is, as we normally do with any members of Congress who
travel abroad, who travel internationally, we provide — you know, we
provide information, whether it’s national security or geopolitical
information on what’s happening around the world.  It doesn’t matter if
it’s Taiwan.  It doesn’t matter where they go.  And so that is what
we’re going to continue to do.

I’m just not going to get ahead of the Speaker.  I’m sure none of us
want to get ahead of the Speaker in general, but let her speak to her
own travels on her own.

Q    And you can’t — you can’t say whether the President personally
would support this trip, even in a hypothetical?  I mean, he said very
strong things about supporting Taiwan, even militarily, and, of course,
that was then walked back.  But whether the President, you know,
personally would be in favor of such a trip or against it?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, I have not spoken to him personally.  You’ve
heard him — I think it was someone — maybe someone on your team asked
him a week ago, last Wednesday, about this particularly — specifically
about the Speaker’s travel.  I’m not going to go beyond what he said.

Q    But he only talked about the military saying it’s a bad idea, not
what he himself —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m just saying that I’m just not going to go
beyond what he said.  And again, the trip has not been announced, or if
there is a trip, not a trip.  I’m just not going to get ahead of her own
announcement.

Q    Okay.  Can I get one more on the —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Maybe.  Maybe.  (Laughter.)

Q    — student loan forgiveness?  Totally different topic.  The
President obviously has been weighing his decision for a long time.  And
I’m curious: Is there anything more you can say on whether — why it’s
taken so long and whether rising prices has played a role in the fact
that you guys are still internally deliberating this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I mean, look, the President understands firsthand
how burdensome this could be for many Americans just across the
country.  
   
That’s why when it comes to loan debt, that’s why he took the action
that he did when it came to pausing repayment.  And so, you know, he
made sure that that was a — something that he took action on when he
first got into the — got into the administration, and then took an
action on it again, as you all know.  
   
But as far as the loan cancellation: Look, he understands, again, what
this means for families, how burdensome this could be.  I just don’t
have anything more to share.   
   
And he said himself by the end of August, so that’s right around the
corner; that’s pretty soon.  I have no idea what day it is today because
we’re always so busy here.  But he’ll make a decision.  He spoke to that
last week, so I’ll let him speak when he’s ready.  
   
Go ahead, Franco.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Is the test tomorrow that the President will take — will
that be an antigen test, will it be a PCR test?  Is the decision whether
to resume normal activities dependent on a PCR test being negative?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me — and Dr. Jha actually spoke to this.  And
many of you who have probably had COVID — taking a PCR is not something
that you can do for about maybe in, I think, 60, 90 days because it’s
probably going to be positive.  So, I’m — it probably wouldn’t be a PCR
test, is my guess, from my experience and I’m sure many of your
experiences as well.  
   
What was the other part of your question, Franco?  
   
Q    About — that was whether you thought it would be an antigen or a
PCR, considering (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  And I — and Dr. Jha also spoke to this when he
was asked about this last week.  
   
Q    And another question.  I mean, what plans does the administration
or does Biden have in place for the anniversary of the withdrawal from
Afghanistan?  Is he going to give a speech?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’ll have more to share on that — on what our
plans are going to be.  I don’t have a — I don’t have a speech right now
to detail or anything specific about the President’s schedule to share
on the anniversary.  But we will have more to share as we get closer,
just more broadly speaking.  
   
Go ahead, Michael.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  The Pacific Northwest is facing, in the next
couple of days, record heat.  It’s the part of the country least
prepared for this sort of weather.  What’s the administration doing to
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I spoke to this — I spoke to this yesterday and
how our agencies here have been pretty much activated.  We’ve been
talking — our offices here have been talking to the governors and the
state — local, state officials who have reached out and have asked for
assistance.  
   
And so, I don’t have anything more specifically to share, but this is
something that we’re monitoring, especially as we see the fires in
California.  FEMA is involved.  We have other agencies that are involved
as well.  We’re helping with — you know, as we talk about the fires —
firefighters and however else we can — we can be helpful, whether it’s
funding or anything — any assistance.  
   
But it is something that the President is being updated on regularly. 
And this is something that we are clearly closely taking — taking a look
at and monitoring.  
   
Q    And then, just a quick follow-up on the Respect for Marriage Act. 
It seems as if the Democratic leadership in the Senate has two possible
strategies.  One is they secure 10 Republican votes and — before
bringing it to a vote; and the second is that they put it on the floor
and they challenge Republicans to take a stance.  Does the White House
have a position on which strategy they would prefer seeing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m not going to speak to the strategy of what’s
happening in Congress or the mechanism that they’re using.  I could say
this — and I spoke to the President about this legislation, the Marriage
Act — the Respect for Marriage Act, last week.  As you know, this is
something that the President has supported for many, many years.  He was
out front on marriage equality, ahead of so many other congressional
members and senators when he was — when he was, himself, a senator and
also as Vice President.  
   
As you all know, we put out a SAP last week when the legislation was
moving forward.  And so, this is something that the President is going
to continue to keep an eye on.  We’re going to continue to work with
Congress and do everything that we can to make sure that it gets over
the finish line.  
   
Q    All right.  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh — Oh, okay.  All right, guys.   
   
Q    Last question?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll — I’ll take one more question.  
   
Q    One more question.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Chris.  Because I haven’t called on you in a
while.  
   
Q    Thank you.  So yesterday in his speech, the President said you
can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy.  And he also said you can’t
be pro-insurrection and pro-America.  There’s Democrats across the
country that are spending money supporting these candidates, basically. 
What does the President think of that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Can you say that?  “There are Democrats…” —  
   
Q    There’s Democrats across the country who are supporting some of
these candidates in primaries who are —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Like, Democrats like Americans — like everyday
Americans, or elected officials?  
   
Q    Demo- — elected officials and candidates.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  So, I can’t — I mean, I’m not going to — I’m
not going to speak to — to that.  I — you know, especially as we’re
looking at an election or anything that’s related to potential
midterms.  It’s not something that I can speak that from here.  
   
But I do want to make it very — make very clear what the President did
yesterday.  And he has said this before when he has talked about what
the former President, his predecessor — how much he — what he — he bears
responsibility for what happened on January 6th, 2020 \[2021\].  
   
You know, there was — his predecessor, Donald Trump, had an opportunity
to be on the side of democracy, but instead he was on the side of the
mob.  
   
And let’s not forget what happened to the law enforcement on that day,
the heroism that we saw.  They’re supposed to be protecting our streets,
and here we have law enforcement that was protecting our democracy. 
While they were doing that, they were being assaulted, they were being
attacked, and by — by a mob that the former President clearly
supported.   
   
And so, what the President wanted to do yesterday — he took the
opportunity while he was in front of law enforcement — clearly via
video; he was supposed to be in person yesterday in Orlando — and he
took that opportunity to thank them for their heroism and also to
compare their bravery to the lack of courage that we saw from the former
President.  
   
I’ll see you — I’ll see you guys tomorrow.
