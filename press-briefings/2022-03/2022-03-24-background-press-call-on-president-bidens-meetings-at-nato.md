 Via Teleconference

11:53 A.M. CET

MODERATOR:  Well, good morning, everyone.  And thank you for joining the
White House background call on the President’s trip to Europe.  As a
reminder of the ground rules, this call will be on background,
attributable to “senior administration officials.”

For your awareness but not for your reporting, the three officials
joining us on our call today are \[senior administration officials\]. 

We will have two sections of the call today.  The first will be a recap
of the President’s time at NATO, which will be embargoed until the call
concludes.  The second section, which previews the G7 and EU meetings,
will be embargoed until this afternoon at 2:15 p.m. Central European
Time, or 9:15 a.m. Eastern Time.

With that, I’ll turn it over to our first speaker, \[senior
administration official\], for the first section of the call.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  And good morning, almost good
afternoon, to everyone.  I just stepped out of the listening room where
I have been for the last hour or so, and I’m happy to share a little bit
of color from what’s been happening in the meeting.

So, Secretary General Stoltenberg opened the meeting.  I’m sure all of
you saw his open remarks, which were open to press. Then the leaders
went into a closed session.   
   
As I think everyone is tracking, President Zelenskyy was beamed in via
video link from Ukraine to address the group.  He spoke very eloquently,
as he has to a number of national parliaments in recent weeks, with a
message very much focused on the efforts of the Ukrainian military and
people to defend their country, to defend their citizens, and also to
defend our shared democratic values.

He repeated his requests for continued and increased Western security
assistance.  But notably, there was not a request for a no-fly zone. 
There was also not a request for NATO membership in his remarks.

Following his intervention, he departed on the video link, and the
members moved into a closed session among the Alliance.

After him, the President was the first speaker.  He set out the
three-pronged approach that we have taken throughout this this crisis,
noting that today marks the one-month anniversary of the launch of
Russian military aggression against Ukraine.

First, he talked about everything that we have done to impose costs on
Russia, including the very significant package of sanctions. 

Second, he reiterated our strong support for Ukraine, both in terms of
security assistance — increased and continued security assistance, as
well as humanitarian assistance that we were continuing to provide to
those both in Ukraine and to those fleeing the violence.

And third, a very strong message of support for NATO — reaffirming the
U.S. commitment to Article 5 and the steps that the United States, in
partnership with other Allies, had taken in recent weeks to reinforce
the security of the eastern flank.  
   
As part of that, speaking more generally: In terms of the Alliance, he
talked about force posture adjustments, as I mentioned.  He welcomed the
similar moves that we have seen from a number of countries to strengthen
NATO’s eastern flank.  He welcomed the increased defense spending
pledges that we have seen from a number of countries, as well as the
ongoing robust exercises that are continuing.

Finally, he looked ahead to the Madrid summit, which will be in about
two and a half months in late June, and laid out a number of issues that
the Alliance is going to have to grapple with in advance of that summit,
given the changed security context that we see ourselves in and as the
Alliance is finalizing the strategic concept that will be addressing a
number of these changes in security architecture.

By the time I left the room, I think about six leaders had spoken.  So,
just to give you a sense of the mood: First, there was a very strong
sense that we are facing a significant, historical moment, and very
strong support from all of the leaders who spoke about the need to
defend our democracy, the need to defend our shared values, and a strong
sense that NATO was appropriately poised to be able to do that.

Second and relatedly, there was a very strong message of unity — notes
of how united the NATO Alliance was, notes of unity across the
transatlantic alliance; very strong support for NATO, for its Article 5
commitments; a number of leaders speaking about increases in their own
defense spending; and also notes about changes that various countries
have made in terms of force posture, particularly with what we’ve seen
in the last couple of weeks with a significant movement of NATO forces
to NATO’s eastern flank to defend the security of Allies there.

Third, very strong admiration for the Ukrainian military and the
Ukrainian people in terms of everything they are doing to defend their
country from Russian aggression.

There was also very strong pledges of support from across the Allies
that I heard speak about their readiness to continue, as well as
increase, their security assistance to Ukraine.

Related to that, many of the leaders also spoke about the importance of
economic sanctions and the need for us to continue imposing robust
economic costs on Russia in response to its aggression.

Related to that: On the Ukrainian people, very strong support for
refugees; a lot of appreciation to the eastern flank Allies that have
been bearing the brunt of the crisis; and continued pledges by Allies to
continue contributing financially to the humanitarian assistance, as
well as, of course, a number of these countries taking in refugees
themselves.

And just a final note: There was also a reference by many of the
speakers to China and a recognition that China needs to live up to its
responsibilities within the international community as a U.N. Security
Council member, that we need to continue to call on China not to support
Russia in its aggression against Ukraine, and that we need China to call
for a peaceful end to the conflict as a responsible member of the
international community.

So the mood overall has been sober, it’s been resolute, and it’s been
incredibly united.   
So let me stop there with my opening comments.

MODERATOR:  Thank you so much, \[senior administration official\].  With
that, we’ll open it up to a couple of questions on the NATO portion
before we move on to the second portion of the call, which will be EU
and G7 specific.

If I can ask everyone who has a question to please indicate you have one
using the “raise hand” feature.

Josh Wingrove from Bloomberg.  I saw your hand up first.

Q    Thank you very much.  Hello from the travel pool.  Thank you for
doing this.  Can you give me a sense of what President Zelenskyy did ask
for if he didn’t mention NATO membership and didn’t mention the
closure?   
And also, NBC is reporting that 100,000 refugees — the U.S. will
announce a pledge to take in 100,000 refugees.  Is there anything you
can tell us on that in particular that we could publish before any later
embargo? 

Thank you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thank you for that.

So, on your question about refugees, I don’t want to steal any thunder
from my colleague, so let me defer that to the later part of the call
where \[senior administration official\] is going to have more
information specifically on some of our refugees and humanitarian
assistance.

In terms of President Zelenskyy’s comments, I will let the Ukrainian
government speak for themselves in terms of what specifically Zelenskyy
conveyed to leaders in what was a closed, private session to leaders.

What I can say is that President Biden was very clear in his remarks
about the security assistance that the U.S. has continued to provide,
underscoring the $2 billion that we have provided over the last year,
underscoring the billion dollars in new security assistance to Ukraine
that we have just announced; talked in some specifics, as he has done
previously, about the additional types of assistance that we have been
providing to Ukraine.   
And then, just more broadly, I would say that we have started consulting
with Allies on providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine.  There may be
some technical challenges with making that happen, but that is something
that we are consulting with Allies and starting to work on.

MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Next, we go to Kevin Liptak with CNN.

Q  Hi.  Thank you.  Yesterday, Jake said that discussion of Russia’s
potential use of chemical or biological or nuclear weapons would come up
in all these discussions.  I wonder if you could say whether that came
up at NATO today and what the leaders — what was — if there was a
consensus among the leaders about whether NATO would be obliged to
respond to the use of those kinds of weapons should that take place.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, there were some references to
that.  I think there is a recognition that NATO needs to continue a lot
of the good, ongoing work to be prepared to respond to various
contingencies.  It’s something that NATO, as a military alliance, is
already postured to do, and it’s something that they recognize that they
need to continue to do given the various scenarios that could emerge as
part of this conflict.  
   
The United States is already taking steps both nationally, as well as
through NATO, to enhance the readiness and capability of our defense
forces to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear
incidents.  Frankly, for NATO, this is an important part of
strengthening our longer-term defense and deterrence postures.  
   
NATO has a Combined Joint CBRN Defence Task Force, which is an element
of the NATO Response Force, which is prepared to deploy at SACEUR’s
direction.  This includes specially trained and equipped forces who are
able to deal with these types of incidents if there are attacks against
NATO populations, territory, or forces.   
   
And NATO Allies are also continuing to consult, as well as to take
national decisions, to be able to provide on a bilateral basis
protective equipment and medical countermeasures to help Ukraine detect,
identify, and respond to these types of threats.  
   
So, in sum, yes, it was a subject that came up in discussion today and I
assume is a continuing part of the ongoing discussion.  
   
Second, there are broader conversations within NATO about how to respond
to these types of incidents.  
   
And third, some NATO Allies are already taking national decisions to be
able to respond to, potentially, Ukrainian needs on these threats as
well.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  And then we’ll do one more
question from Chris Megerian with AP.  After that, we’ll move on to the
second portion.  
   
Q    Hi, everybody.  I wanted to see if you could talk any more about
force posture adjustments.  What specifically are we speaking about?  
   
And then on China, when you said that China needs to do more, what
specifically do you want to see them do more or see them stop doing?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks for that.  So, in terms of force
posture, there was considerable discussion by leaders about the number
of changes that have already been made across the Alliance.  I think
what we’ve seen within the last couple of weeks with NATO Allies acting
with great unity and speed to deploy additional defensive forces and
capabilities in response to renewed Russian aggression against
Ukraine.  
   
NATO activated its response plans.  It deployed the NATO Response
Force.  It increased NATO’s readiness.  And there’s now approximately
40,000 Allied forces under direct NATO command with particular emphasis
on the eastern flank.  
   
As part of that, the United States has already deployed thousands of
additional forces to Europe.  There’s now approximately 100,000 U.S.
forces on land, in the air, at sea, training, exercising, and ready to
defer — or to deter and defend against any threat.  
   
So, in the parts of the meeting that I was in, there was a lot of
recognition about the steps that the U.S. has taken and, frankly, that a
large number of other Allies have taken to move their forces to the
eastern flank as well.  
   
And in terms of China, I would refer to what I had said earlier in terms
of similar messages that Stoltenberg himself actually has given within
the last couple of days as well: that there is a desire for China to
live up to its responsibilities within the international community,
clearly a strong desire for Russia \[China\] not to provide economic or
military assistance to Russia in furtherance of its aggression against
Ukraine, and for China to join with other responsible members of the
international community in calling on Russia to end its violence.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  And with that, that
concludes the first portion of the call, which, as a reminder, is
embargoed until this call concludes.
