title: "Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and National\
  \ Security Advisor Jake Sullivan En Route Brussels,\_Belgium"
---
 
1:43 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi, everybody.  Okay.  We have National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan here.  And he’s going to say a few words, take a
couple of questions, and then I’ll take over after that and take any
other questions you might have.   
   
Go ahead, Jake.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Hey, guys.  So, we’re heading into a full day tomorrow in
Brussels.  The President will start by meeting with the Secretary
General to check signals, you know, get on the same page in terms of the
agenda for the NATO Summit.  And then he’ll be at the NATO Summit for
three hours with his 29 fellow Allied leaders.  So, it’ll be NATO with
30.   
   
NATO itself has not, as institution, been involved in the coordination
or facilitation of security assistance to Ukraine.  It’s been individual
members, individual Allies who have done that.  The United States,
obviously, providing a really significant amount of military equipment
and weapons to Ukraine and also coordinating the supplies of Allies as
well to facilitate their delivery.   
   
So, it will be a subject of discussion at the summit — even though,
institutionally, NATO is not engaged in it, how we make sure that we’re
continuing to support Ukraine in its effort to defend itself, you know,
will be a topic of conversation among the leaders while the President is
in Brussels.  
   
They will also discuss the question of NATO’s force posture on the
eastern flank.  The leaders will ratify some of the decisions taken by
defense ministers last week.  We’ll have more to say on that
tomorrow.   
   
But they’ll also task the military and political instruments of NATO to
set out a longer-term game plan for what forces and capabilities are
going to be required in those eastern flank countries — to be,
ultimately, agreed at the Madrid Summit this summer — so that we’ve got
a long-term footprint that is matched to the new security reality that’s
been created both by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and by
what’s happening in Belarus, including the fact that we’re seeing
Russian forces and projecting Russian forces ending up in a posture
where there is more of them more frequently on the territory of Belarus,
and perhaps other capabilities as well.  
   
So that’ll be the NATO Summit piece of it.   
   
The President will then have opportunity to meet with the G7 leaders,
and they’ll issue a statement.  And it will cover a range of issues. 
The G7 has been a central locus for sanctions coordination.  It’s where
many of the key elements of the sanctions architecture were agreed and
have been — have been — the details have been worked through.  
   
And the G7 leaders tomorrow will agree on an initiative to coordinate on
sanctions enforcement so that Russian efforts to evade the sanctions or
other countries’ effort to help Russia evade the sanctions can be dealt
with effectively and in a coordinated fashion.  And there’ll be, you
know, a specific example of what that means discussed at the meeting and
rolled out tomorrow.  
   
In addition, we, the United States, will announce a package of sanctions
designations tomorrow that relate both to political figures, oligarchs —
so, individual designations as well as entities — and that’ll be
released tomorrow.  
   
The G7 will also cover a number of other critical issues, including the
global energy picture and the global food security picture, and some of
the other knock-on and spillover effects of the conflict in Ukraine on
the global economy and on the livelihoods of the citizens of our
countries and people all around the world.  
   
And then the President will have the opportunity to have a signals check
with President Michel, the President of the European Council, before he
goes into a European Council meeting where he will have the opportunity
to discuss the refugee and humanitarian situation that has been fast
evolving over the course of the past month since Russia’s latest
military action got underway.  
   
He’ll have the chance to talk about next steps on sanctions with the
European Union.  He’ll have the chance to talk about democratic
resilience and supporting civil society and journalists and other
instruments of strong democracies in many of the partner countries of
the European Union in the east.   
   
And there will be a few other elements to the discussion that he will
have with European leaders, including China and how we get coordinated
on our approach vis-à-vis China, especially as it relates to China’s
involvement in the crisis in Ukraine — because the EU has a summit with
China coming up on April 1st, so just a few days after the President
will be engaging them in in Brussels.  
   
The last thing is, throughout the day, the President will obviously
consult on potential contingencies: the possibility of cyberattacks by
Russia against the United States or other Allied and partner countries,
the possibility of the use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine,
the possibility of escalation in the conflict in other ways.  And as I
discussed yesterday at the podium, how to deal with the rhetoric and the
commentary coming out of Russia on this whole question of the potential
use of nuclear weapons.  
   
I said yesterday that we haven’t seen anything that’s made us adjust our
posture — our nuclear posture, but it’s, of course, something that we
will have to continue to stay in close consultation with Allies and
partners on, as well as communicate directly to the Russians on.  
   
So, let me stop there in terms of what tomorrow looks like, and I’m
happy to take your questions.  
   
Q  Can I ask, on energy sanctions or energy actions, what — you
mentioned this yesterday — what is on the table in terms of some sort of
deal or anything between the U.S. and the EU to try to reduce reliance
on Russian energy?  
   
Of course, European partners have been more hesitant to enact the same
measures that the UK, the U.S., Canada, and others have because they
rely more heavily on it, in particular on natural gas.  Is there
anything you’re going to discuss or announce on that?  Is there deal in
place?  What can you tell us?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, this is a substantial topic of conversation.  A major
priority for both the President and his European allies is to reduce the
dependence of Europe on Russian gas.  Full stop.   
   
And the practical roadmap for how to do that — what steps have to be
taken, what the United States can contribute, what Europe has to do
itself — this has been the subject of intense back-and-forth over the
course of the past few days and weeks.  And we will have more to say on
this subject specifically on Friday, particularly with the European
Commission and the European Commission President, von der Leyen.  So
he’ll discuss it tomorrow.   
   
But in terms of further things to say publicly on the subject, I’m not
going to preview it today.  But you can zero in on Friday morning for
more news on that, so stay tuned.  
   
Q    Can you say what the U.S. will tell its European partners what it
wants to see from China or what it hopes Europe will seek from China? 
In other words, what is the latest in terms of what you’re — what you
perceive to be China’s involvement or lack of involvement in Russia’s
war and the trajectory, I guess?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, as I said yesterday, we have not actually seen or
do not have evidence of the actual provision of military equipment for
use in Ukraine from China to Russia.  But we are monitoring that closely
and, of course, our European allies are as well.   
   
And we’ve sent a clear message to China about the implications and
consequences of any such provision of military equipment.  And we’re on
the same page with our European allies on that, and we expect that they
will convey similar messages in their dealings at the highest levels
with the Chinese government.   
   
The same thing goes for systematic efforts to undermine, weaken, or
circumvent the sanctions regime that we have put in place.  And we’ve
communicated on that as well to China, and we expect similar
communication by the European Union and individual European countries. 
And we’re also on the same page in that regard.   
   
And the G7 sanctions enforcement initiative ensuring that there isn’t
systematic sanctions busting, that’s not specifically about China, but
it will apply to every significant economy and the decisions that any of
those economies take to try in an intentional and active way to
undermine or weaken the sanctions that we put in place.  
   
Q    Can I just follow up on the energy issue?  The idea of reducing
energy dependence sounds like a medium- to long-term question.  Is the
United States — is the President going to be pressing the — his European
allies to do more in the immediate term — a ban on oil, a ban on gas?  A
ban on coal has been raised.  I mean, is — and understanding that their
reluctance is because of their greater dependence, is the message from
the United States going to be, “You guys need to act now”?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, I think it’s important to note that the
United States itself is acting now to help Europe on the issue of Russ-
— dependence on Russian gas, diverting cargoes to help increase the
supply of gas — U.S. LNG — to Europe in the immediate term.  And I think
you can expect that the U.S. will look for ways to increase LNG
supplies, surge LNG supplies to Europe not just over the course of
years, but over the course of months as well.  Of course, that amount
will grow over time.   
   
So, our focus now is not on — over the course of the next couple of days
— is not on a particular sanctions move we’re asking Europe to make on
this.  It is, rather: How do we put in place a strategy that is not just
a long-term strategy but is a short-term strategy to help reduce
dependence and to create more freedom and flexibility then for different
policy choices by the Europeans?  
   
Q    Can I put a finer point on the China question?  You — they have a
preexisting economic relationship — China and Russia.  Are your concerns
about an incremental growth in that relationship as a financial
relationship?  Is status quo okay? Could you maybe elaborate a little
bit more about those concerns?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  What do you mean?  I’m sorry, I’m not sure I fully —  
   
Q    China and Russia have a preexisting financial relationship: trade. 
Is it okay if that trade continues as is? Or are you concerned about
incremental change in that — or growth in that kind of trade to avoid
sanctions?  Can you put a little finer point on that?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Sure.  I mean, just three sort of examples that I think
will give a little bit more flavor to the kinds of things we’re looking
out for.   
   
One is attempting to backfill in response to the export controls that we
have imposed — Chinese companies or companies from other countries
choose to backfill.  We obviously have tools available to us to ensure
that backfilling can’t happen.  That’s one.  
   
Second is, from the point of view of payment settlements and financial
sanctions, systematic efforts, industrial-scale efforts to try to
reorient the settlement of financial payments and so forth.  That’s
something that, in coordination with our G7 allies, we will look at and
respond to.   
   
And then third, of course, is the kinds of non-steady state, new efforts
to try to seize opportunities that have been created by the reduction in
commerce between Europe, Japan, and other countries because of the
sanctions not just with China but across the board.  That’s something
that we will look at as well.   
   
And, you know, I’ve been clear that we’re not going to lay out in
specifics the particular countermeasures we would take, the particular
steps we’d impose.  We’re communicating that privately to countries. 
You know, I don’t want to use the microphone to threaten; I just want to
say this is something we’re vigilant about and that we have tools at our
disposal to deal with in coordination with the G7 and with other
countries.  
   
Q    A question on chemical and biological.  Has the U.S. seen evidence
that Russia has moved or deployed any of these weapons in a way to
threaten Ukraine?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t have any intelligence to share with you today on
this subject.  The main thing that we’re looking at right now is the
deliberate drumbeat of misinformation, propaganda, and lies on this
subject that has all the markers of a precursor to them actually using
these weapons.  
   
Q    So is the U.S. assessment based entirely on that drumbeat of
propaganda, or is it also based on movements of weapons?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  It’s a very fair question.  All I can tell you right now
is I can’t comment further on the intelligence picture on this today. 
To the extent that I’m in a position to share further information
related to our intelligence, I’ll be sure to do so.  But right now, I
don’t have anything else to share.  
   
Q    Jake, was there anything in your conversations with Chinese
officials last week or President — or the President’s conversations with
President Xi that left you at all reassured that the Chinese would not
provide weapons or other assistance to the Russians?  Or do you — are
you more concerned after those conversations?   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I will beg your forgiveness in advance by being sort
of intentionally vague in my answer to your question.  And the reason is
because this is not the kind of circumstance where you just kind of feel
reassurance.  It’s going to require constant vigilance, constant
monitoring.  We will have to see what happens.   
   
So, all I can really say to you is that coming out of that conversation,
we have not seen the Chinese government move forward on the supply of
weapons, but it’s something we’re watching every day.  And I really
can’t characterize my level of comfort with that out one way or the
other; it’s something we just have to maintain vigilance about.   
   
Q    I have a question on the EU.  Do you want to see the European Union
— does the administration want to see the European Union spend more on
defense — such as what President Macron has suggested, that they should
become — you know, borrowing more money, spending more, bolstering its
defense spending to this point?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  When President Biden and President Macron met in Rome in
October, they put out a joint statement.  And one of the points in that
statement was support across the board for increased European capability
and investment in the strength of their defense tools and the
modernization of their defense establishments with one very important
principle underlying that, and that is complementarity with NATO.   
   
So, all of this work that’s being done by individual European countries,
by the European Union, this is something that contributes overall to the
health and strength of the transatlantic Alliance so long it is — it is
done in complementarity with NATO.  
   
Q    Should Russia still be part of the G20?  Any concern, any talk
about that?  There are some countries that have voiced some — some
opinions on that.  I know there’s a financial leadership meeting in
Washington of the G20 come maybe April.  Should Russia be a — should
Russia representatives attend that?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So what I said yesterday, which I’ll repeat today, is
that we don’t believe it can be business as usual with Russian
international institutions.  But in terms of specific answers to that
kind of question for the G20 or other international organizations, we
want to have the opportunity to consult with our Allies and partners
around the world, including our G20 partners before I opine on that
question publicly.  
   
Q    A couple.  On — if you’re looking at the sanctions and the upcoming
planned sanctions that you plan to announce, on — say, on like a scale
of 1 to 10, or do it on however measure you would like to — like, what
do you have left?  Like, where would you be at if 10 were ratcheted up
to the highest degree?   
   
Q    And what else could you do?   
   
Q    Yeah, how much room to grow do you have?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So I — I would ask you guys, I guess, two — two questions
— two things.  The first is: In terms of an analysis of the
macroeconomic impact of what we have done and then, you know, what
additional tools are in the toolkit, Daleep — who is on the trip, and
we’ll get you with him in a backgrounder so you have the opportunity to
speak with him directly on this — is the expert and then to speak also
with the Treasury Department.  So that’s one thing.   
   
Because I think this is one where really getting down granularly into
what hit has the Russian economy taken, in what way, and then, you know,
what are other things that we could do over time.   
   
But the second thing I would ask you is to consider this not just like
we’re firing bullets out of the chamber of a gun and we fired X number
and there’s Y number left.  I think it’s the wrong way to think about
it.   
   
What we’ve done on the financial sanctions and the export controls is
create a vise that is squeezing harder and harder with each passing day
and week.  And then, as we see the impact and we see efforts to evade,
we think about adjustments we need to make to ensure that vise continues
to tighten.   
   
So our theory on this was never: Every three days we fire another
bullet.  It was: Put the major pieces in place, look for ways to
continue to tighten the screws, and then consider other means as we go
forward.  And, of course, we will do that.   
   
So I can’t characterize this question of what we’ve done and what we
have left precisely, in part because we don’t think of it quite in the
terms that your question posed.   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  But on — on the kind of macro picture, which is a kind of
— the way to back into an answer to your question, I’d ask you to speak
with Daleep.   
   
Q    Can you talk a little bit about Friday?  There’s obviously a big
gaping hole in the President’s schedule.  Is he going to go close to the
border?  Is he going to meet with — is he going to tour refugees — with
refugees?  What — what else can you tell us about Friday?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ll let Karine talk to you about Friday when —  
   
Q    When do you think we may see —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  — when the time is right.   
   
Q    — JCPOA updated?  And to what extent that will be discussed on this
trip during this week?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So he’ll have the chance to talk to our E3 European
partners — UK, France, Germany; four members of the P5+1; as well as the
European Union, which plays this important coordinating role in the
P5+1.  
   
Where things stand now is we’ve made progress over the course of the
past several weeks.  There are still some issues left.  We’re working on
those issues.  It’s unclear whether this will come to closure or not. 
But, you know, we’re diligently trying to drive the diplomacy to a place
where we have put Iran’s nuclear program back in a box.   
   
Q    Are you sure that a deal could put more money or more freedom to
use money in the hands of Iran, and that, in turn, could be a lifeline
to Russia’s economy?  Can you talk about the sort of triangulation of
that here?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  First, Russia posed both publicly and privately this
proposition that Iran should somehow be entirely carved out of the
sanctions regime, which was not accepted by any of the parties.   
   
So the only question of sanctions as it relates to Russia in the context
of the JCPOA is about sanctions on Iran being able to, for example,
cooperate with the Russian Atomic Energy authorities to ship out their
enriched uranium.   
   
So we feel confident that if we were to get back into the JCPOA on a
compliance-for-compliance basis.  It would not create a significant
economic opportunity for Russia.   
   
And we would take whatever necessary enforcement steps to ensure that
that was the case.  
   
Q    Jake, how much visibility do you have into the status of
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations right now?  And how much faith do you
have in the Russians being a trustworthy negotiation partner in the
first place?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I will point out that Russia has not been
trustworthy in its public statements about its intentions with respect
to Ukraine for months.  So, we take everything that they say at the
negotiating table or from their podiums with a very large grain of
salt.   
   
We are in very consistent communication with our Ukrainian friends.  And
President Biden speaks to President Zelenskyy on this issue.  President
Biden also speaks with the Presidents of France and Germany, the Prime
Minister of Israel, the President of Turkey, others who have been
actively engaged in discussions with President Putin and President
Zelenskyy.  So, we’re actively engaged in monitoring the ongoing
diplomacy, though the United States is not directly at the table or
directly playing any kind of mediating or brokering role.  And we will
see how things unfold.   
   
Our basic principle is: This is about Ukraine’s future, Ukraine’s
destiny, and therefore it is up to Ukraine and the Ukrainian leadership,
the Ukrainian people to make their own judgments about any agreement
that they would reach with the Russians.  
   
Q    Can you comment on the transfer of air defense systems to Ukraine. 
Is that moving forward?  You know, we’ve talked about the S-300 system —
things like that.  There’s a large shuffle going on.  What’s the latest
on that?  When could Ukraine expect to see those systems in their
country?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We feel good about the progress that we are making with
respect to air defense systems.  And I’m not going to get into further
details on that because I don’t want to compromise the ongoing effort to
ensure that Ukraine gets the tools it needs to protect itself from the
sky.  
   
Q    Can you confirm that NATO — NATO Allied countries want to extend
the contract of the Secretary General, Stoltenberg, and what the
President’s view — possibly through September of 2023 — and what the
President’s view on that might be?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The President thinks very highly of Secretary General
Stoltenberg.  They’ve developed a relationship of trust.  And Pres- —
Secretary General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping
secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at NATO through this crisis.  And
I don’t have anything for you on the question of his tenure.  
   
Q    Can you say whether he wants to see continuity there and not sort
of breaking this up in the middle of this conflict?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, all I will say is: We think that Jens Stoltenberg has
been doing a fantastic job and, day in and day out, has played a
critical leadership role for NATO.   
   
And you’ll forgive me if for today, on this plane flight, I will add
nothing to that other than our unreserved view that that Stoltenberg is
a real asset to the Alliance.  And then, you know, the leaders will have
the chance to talk tomorrow.  
   
Q    Does the President plan to send additional U.S. troops to Eastern
Europe?  And if so, how many?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we don’t have any plans for announcements of specific
additional units to move to Eastern Europe at this time.  But the
President is constantly reviewing plans for near-term adjustments to our
force posture in all the eastern flank countries, depending on how
things develop.  So that’s not a today thing or a tomorrow thing, but
it’s — it’s a matter of consistent reassessment.  
   
Q    Do you know if any additional troop deployments will be announced
on this trip?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t.  
   
Q    And that’s — but what about the broader — the long-term of NATO
force deployment along the eastern —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes, we have —  
   
Q    — that — that could involve U.S. troops to —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Two aspects of this will be discussed tomorrow.  One is
the immediate need to shore up on a rotational basis those Allies on the
southern end of the eastern flank, and that will be discussed
tomorrow.   
   
And then the second is, across the entire eastern flank, as we head to
the Madrid Summit, what decisions does NATO have to take for longer-term
force posture adjustments?  And of course, some of those will involve
U.S. forces.  
   
Q    On this trip, what are you looking to hear from other EU and the UK
leaders?  You’ve talked about trying to reduce Europe’s energy — energy
dependence on Russian oil and gas.  What else would you like to hear
from the leaders that the President will be meeting?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think what we would like to hear is that the resolve
and unity that we’ve seen for the past month will endure for as long as
it takes.  That’s at a topline.   
   
Then how that translates specifically: that countries follow through on
the commitments they’ve made with respect to the supply of military
equipment and add to those commitments as Ukraine’s needs evolve over
time; that countries remain fully committed to enforcing the sanctions
on the books and, to the extent we find additional targets that can help
impose pressure on Putin, we do — we move in a joint way on that; that
we all work together to do our part on the humanitarian element of this
crisis, both the suffering inside Ukraine and the refugee crisis outside
Ukraine — here, Europe has really stepped up in a huge way, and it’s the
United States that will be coming with additional commitments on both
humanitarian assistance and refugees tomorrow; and that NATO, as an
Alliance, puts its money where its mouth is when it comes to actually
defending every inch of NATO territory, and that means following through
on the necessary capabilities and contributions to defend the eastern
flank and to defend the whole Alliance.   
   
That’s what tomorrow is all about across an integrated set of three
meetings.  And we think that we will have a substantial set of outcomes
that will emerge by the end of the day when, after many hours, the
President will emerge to address all of you.  
   
Q    Does President Biden plan to have a short bilat with Turkish
President Erdoğan on the sidelines of NATO?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We don’t have a bilat scheduled with President Erdoğan. 
But you know how these things go.  They’ll be hanging out at NATO
Headquarters, and I expect he’ll have the chance to have brief
conversations with a number of leaders.  
   
Q    Is the U.S. position on giving planes to Ukraine — remains the
same?  Or are you looking to discuss that if the Polish, for instance,
bring it up?  Is it still your belief that it should not be NATO giving
planes to Ukraine?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  There’s been no change in our position on the MiG-29s.  
   
Q    And have you guys formally shot down the idea of a peacekeeping
force that the Poles have raised?  Or is that something that is still at
least open for discussion from the U.S. perspective?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  President Biden’s been very clear that we’re not sending
U.S. soldiers to fight Russian soldiers in Ukraine.  I have not, myself,
had the opportunity, nor has President Biden had the opportunity to
consult with his Polish counterpart, or I with mine, on exactly what
they have in mind.  So, we’ll — we’ll have that conversation.   
   
But our position, with respect to deployment of U.S. forces in Ukraine,
has been clear from the start, and it remains unchanged.  
   
Q    There’s a difference between saying U.S. forces shouldn’t be
deployed and NATO forces should not be deployed into Ukraine.  Do you
have the same red line about forces under a NATO banner from other NATO
countries going into Ukraine?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think before I opine on what is a hypothetical or
theoretical question like that, I think it’s important for us to get the
opportunity to hear more about something we’ve just seen in the press,
and then we can speak to it.  
   
All right.  Thank you, guys.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jake.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, Jake.  Thank you so much.   
   
Q    Now you get to tell us all about the refugees in the Friday
schedule.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Is that what you want me to talk about?  
   
Q    Jake —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  No, Jake did a great job laying out tomorrow —
NATO, EU, G7 meetings that the President will be — will be part of.  
   
I mean, look, what I — what I can do is — you guys already have all of
this — is say what happens when he leaves Brussels — right? — in a more
broad stroke —  
   
Q    Right, just because —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — and say what happens after Brussels in a more broad
— broad stroke.  
   
So, as you guys already know, he’s going to meet with President Duda
once he leaves Brussels and goes to Poland to thank him for everything
the people of Poland are doing and to discuss our coordinated
humanitarian response to support the many Ukrainians who have been
impacted by Putin’s war.  
   
I think Jake also talked about the President — where he will engage with
U.S. troops who are now — who are now helping to defend NATO territory
yesterday.  He talked about that.  And he will meet with experts
involved in a humanitarian response.  
   
We talked about the speech that the President will be giving, but I
won’t give any more further —  
   
Q    His speech?  I’m sorry, which?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We talked about that.  The President is going to be
giving a speech in Poland.  
   
Q    In Poland?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, we announced that probably a day or two ago.  
   
And so those are kind of — (laughs) — Michael, you got to keep up.  You
got to keep up.  So, we talked — I’m just going to, like I said, talk
about the broader strokes of things that he’s going to do tomorrow.  
   
Clearly, we’ll give more guidance on what Friday will look like.  But
for security purposes, we just want to keep it more broad and not go
into details.  
   
Q    Can you give us an update on whether the President tested before
this trip since Monday and what his most recent COVID test result was?  
   
Q    And just any general update of other people who tested positive in
the White House.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the President ha- — was tested yesterday, as Josh
just mentioned, and as part of his regular testing cadence.  There’s no
change to the President’s testing cadence during his travel because he
was not a close contact.  
   
He will be tested throughout the trip in alignment with the various
entry and departure requirements for the countries he will be
visiting.  
   
For example, for context here, there’ll be no testing entry requirement
for Brussel — testing requirement.  There’ll be testing requirement for
a Warsaw exit requirement for return to the U.S.  
   
As far as your question, so, since — when we’re talking about staff and
all of those things that you just asked — so, since July, because of our
commitment to transparency, we provide updates when any White House
official tests positive for COVID-19 and with White House Medical Unit
deems them as having had close contact with the President, Vice
President, First Lady, and — or Second Gentleman.  That will be up to
the White House Medical Unit based on the criteria of the CDC.  
   
You know, Jen, for example, shared her positive case yesterday, as she
did in October, out of an abundance of transparency.  
   
If an individual does not meet this criteria that I just laid out,
meaning they are not a close contact of our four principals, it would be
up to the individual.  This has been our policy since July.  It hasn’t
changed.  
   
Q    Can you give us an update on whether you’re still considering any
further releases of the SPR to deal with the current gas price?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything new to share on that, on any new
actions.  But as the President has said previously, we’re going to
continue to assess, and our government will take action as needed as
evidenced — as evidenced by recent Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases
that we announced not too long ago, and the — and announced
International Energy Agency agreement — those two things that we
announced probably, I don’t know, about a month ago — a couple weeks
ago.  
   
Q    And acknowledging that there are other things on the go, has he
made any decisions on when you will name a new Fed nominee?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to preview for you on the new
Fed nominee.  
   
Q    Forgive me for having to ask.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  No, it’s a fair — it’s a — not a surprising
ask.  
   
Q    Does the President have any further reaction to yesterday here on
the Sup- — on Ketanji Brown Jackson?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, as we noted, the President did watch some
of — some of the — did watch some of the portions of yesterday’s hearing
with Judge Jackson.  
   
And again, he couldn’t be more proud of her intellect, her grace,
character, and the value of her experience.  The country is seeing just
how qualified Judge Jackson is and how she determines cases fairly based
solely on the facts and the law, which is what the American people
expect in a Supreme Court justice.  That’s why she is endorsed by
conservative judges, the Fraternal Order of Police, the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, dozens of police chiefs, sheriffs, and
83 bipartisan former State Attorney Generals.  Just today, 43 former
federal prosecutors in Florida endorsed Judge Jackson.   
   
So, like we said yesterday, the President was also impressed with how
she dismantled bad-faith conspiracy theories and that have — that have
been fact checked by major media outlets and experts, like some of you
all here, and moderates in both parties are now dismissing them for the
fringe smears that they are.   
   
She thoughtfully and thoroughly answered questions from senators for
nearly 12 hours, as you all know, demonstrating the temperament required
for a Supreme Court justice and showing the strength of her intellect
and character.  
   
Q    I guess — I just wanted to follow up really quickly. Does he have
any reaction to the kind of questioning that Senator Cruz, Senator
Hawley, Senator Cotton — I mean, you know, a range of them — did?  What
did he think of their questions?  
   
Q    And just to piggyback on that — just the critical race theory as
well — you know, theory and all of that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let me talk more broadly about your point, Michael,
about the overall attacks.  Look — so, you know, we’re going to — we’re
focused on the full Senate.  Right?  She’s been working hard to earn
support since day one.  She has — since the day she was — the President
named her, she’s met with 45 senators, and she’s going to meet with more
after.   
   
And you’ve heard Republicans react well to her qualifications and her
neutral methodology based in the facts of law — law and facts — based in
the law and facts.  And so, I want to be really clear: Our strategy
doesn’t depend on Josh Hawley or any of the other senators who attacked
her.  
   
On the critical race theory, you know, she actually spoke to this
yesterday as well — Judge Jackson.  And to quote her, she said, when it
comes to critical race theory, “never been something I’ve studied or
relied on.”  She applies the facts and the law when making decisions on
the bench, not academic theory.   
   
And I also saw PolitiFact already found an attack about base — about —
based on this “false” after a senator claims she considered it when
judging cases.  In comments to students about academic subjects that may
— that they may find interesting, she mentioned critical race theory in
a list of other academic topics such as administrative law,
constitutional law, negotiations, and contracts.  
   
But again, I would refer you back to what she said herself about that.  
   
Q    But I guess the questions is: Did he think the questions from the
senators that we mentioned about critical race theory and the other
issues — the, you know, pornography, and whatever — did he think those
questions were inappropriate, racist, whatever — however you want to
say?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, it’s basically what I said, Michael.  He’s very
proud — he’s very proud of how she handled herself yesterday.   
   
Q    That doesn’t answer —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, I think — I think it does.  We — I just told
you he watched — he watched yesterday, and I just told you his
reaction.  We’re not going to go — we’re not going to break it down —
break it down specific to details.  I just laid out how he felt and why
she was chosen and her bipartisan support that she’s getting.  
   
Q    Can you give us more of a preview of the humanitarian assistance
that we might expect to see?  He’s going to go to Poland.  Polish
leaders have been pretty clear about their breaking point.  He’s going
to presumably see some evidence of that.  I know you’re not going to get
ahead of the President, but can you give us some — should Americans
expect a more open-door policy to get these — some of these folks into
the U.S.?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — you know, again, he’s going to announce
further American contributions to respond to the growing flow of
refugees and to the coordinated humanitarian response to ease the
suffering of civilians inside Ukraine, but I don’t have anything further
to preview.   
   
Look, we are surging humanitarian assistance to countries neighboring
Ukraine who are providing them with support.  We’ve kind of laid out
what we’ve done in the past — these past couple weeks.  
   
Q    And with Poland, to help them — some kind of relief package for
Poland to help them deal with —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m not — I mean, you even said it in your
question.  I’m not going to get ahead of the President, but this is
something that’s coming forward.  
   
Q    I just — last time on this one, to follow up on Michael’s point. 
You know, he’s served on this panel for many years, like many of these
confirmation fights.  Like just generally — I know you don’t want to
respond to any specific senator — how does he think that these
Republican senators have comported themselves?  Not her reaction to
that, but the senators themselves.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not going to get into specifics on that at
all.  I’m just going to lay out what I said already and how he saw her
performance, which is what is the most important thing is — how Judge
Jackson performed yesterday.  He’s very proud of her.  We feel very
confident in her being the next justice on the Supreme Court.  I don’t
have anything further to read out to you.  
   
Q    Do you have any lists of bilats or anything you can share on what
meetings he might have during this trip?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say that last part.  
   
Q    Do you — can you share anything about what bilateral meetings he
might have on this trip?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.  Jake just talked about that.  We don’t have
anything — at least when he was asked about Turkey — we don’t have
anything else to preview on a bilat meeting.  And just to reiterate what
Jake said —  
   
Q    Right.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — which is, you know, at these type of events — the
NATO in particular and the EU and G7 — you never know what might
happen.  But we — I don’t have anything else to preview on a bilat.  
   
Q    All right.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate you
all.  
   
Q    Thank you.
