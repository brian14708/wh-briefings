11:06 A.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  Hey, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  Sorry for the
delay.  Kirby has a few words here at the top, and then we’ll take some
questions.  
   
MR. KIRBY:    Thank you.  In the interest of time — and I know everybody
wants to get postured and ready for the President’s remarks, so I’ll
just very, very quickly just draw your attention to the letter written
jointly this morning by nine of our ambassadors to countries across the
Indo-Pacific, to include Japan, China, India, the Philippines, and the
Republic of Korea — a letter that they sent to Congress urging them to
act quickly to pass the President’s national security supplemental
funding request, including the funding that it contains for the
Indo-Pacific, as well as, of course, for Ukraine and for Israel.   
   
The ambassadors wrote about how, quote, “Many countries in the
Indo-Pacific are intently focused on the conflicts in Ukraine and the
Middle East.”   
   
Again, with Russia’s growing strategic partnership with the People’s
Republic of China and with military support from Iran and North Korea,
our support for Ukraine — or the potential termination of that support
at such a decisive moment here in these winter months — will
fundamentally affect not just Ukraine, but other strategic theaters as
well, obviously to include the Indo-Pacific theater.   
   
And then, just before I close out, I’m sure many of you saw the
statement that I issued yesterday, correcting what I had said Friday
night about pre-notification to Iraqi officials on Friday night before
the strikes that we took on facilities related to the Iran-backed
militia groups.  And I deeply apologize for the error, and I regret any
confusion that it caused.  It was based on information we had or that
was provided to me in those early hours after the strikes.  Turns out
that information was incorrect.  And I certainly regret the error.   
   
And I hope that you’ll understand there was no ill-intent behind it, no
deliberate intent to deceive or to be wrong.  I take those
responsibilities very, very seriously.  And I deeply regret the mistake
that I made.   
   
And with that, we can take some questions.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Steve with
Reuters.  
   
Q    John, could you just give us a little readout of what you’re
expecting Biden to talk about with the German Chancellor on Friday?  Is
it Ukraine assistance?  Is it the attempt to use Russian assets to pay
for Ukraine assistance?  What are you expecting on Friday?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, just broad-brush, Steve — there’s no question that
they’re going to talk about the war in Ukraine and how we can work
together to push back on Putin’s continued aggression.  I have no doubt
that they’ll have an opportunity to discuss what things look like along
that battlefront.   
   
I have no doubt that they’ll discuss the work on the Senate side that
Republicans and Democrats have worked so hard to get a bill put forward,
which would allow for funding for Ukraine to continue.  And the
President, I’m sure, will share his views on that, as he will share his
views on that with the American people here shortly.   
   
And I think that they will also have an opportunity to talk about what’s
going on in the Middle East writ large, I mean, just in terms of the
scope of activity that’s being supported by Iran throughout the region,
but also more critically, the fight between Israel and Hamas, and share
our steadfast support for Israel’s right to defend itself, as well as
our mutual obligations to try to do what we can to increase humanitarian
assistance and to decrease the number of civilians that are being harmed
in Gaza.   
   
And then lastly, I think, Steve, they’ll have an opportunity to touch on
the NATO Summit coming up in Washington soon — later this year, and just
sort of check signals on the approach that we want to take and the
things that we want to get done at the NATO summit.  
   
Q    And lastly, John, do you know — as far as you know, has Hamas
responded to the U.S.-Qatar proposal to release hostages in exchange for
a pause?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would say that the negotiating effort is still ongoing,
Steve; that we aren’t at a place where we have finality on it and that
we’re about in — about to be in imminent execution.  So we’re still
working on it.   
   
I’d rather not talk about sort of where folks are on the particulars and
where they are in terms of final approval.  But we don’t have a deal at
this point, as you and I are talking.  And we’re hoping that we can get
closure on it very, very soon.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Aamer with the
AP.  
   
Q    Thank you, John and Sam.  Following on Steve’s question on the
Scholz visit, what can President Biden tell him to assure Germany and
the rest of Europe that they won’t be alone in helping Ukraine,
particularly considering where things are with Congress?  
   
And is the President and the U.S. now in sort of a place where we have
diminished credibility in these conversations?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  To some degree — I don’t want to get ahead of the President
here today; you’re going to hear from him soon, Aamer — and I think the
answer to your first question will be, I think, part of the President’s
arguments today.  So I want to be careful I don’t get ahead of him.   
   
But I think he will make clear to Chancellor Scholz how much he
personally wants to continue to support Ukraine, how hard Senate
negotiators worked on both sides of the aisle to get at this final
bill.  I think he’ll stress that if that bill reaches his desk, that
he’ll sign it.   
   
And I think he’ll also, you know, remind the Chancellor that there is
strong bipartisan support, actually in both chambers.  And I recognize
what we’re hearing out of the Speaker.  I get that.  But if you talk to
the leaders in the House, certainly the leadership of the national
security-related committees, all of them will tell you they want to
continue to support Ukraine.  And that’s not an insignificant fact.  And
I think he’ll be willing to, you know, remind the Chancellor of that.  
   
Again, up on Capitol Hill, for all the dysfunction that we tend to see,
particularly regarding on the House side, that there is strong
bipartisan leadership support for Ukraine and that the President is
going to stay committed to the task.   
   
And on your second question: As I’ve said before, American leadership
matters.  What we say matters.  What we do matters.  And it’s American
leadership that has really spearheaded and helped make the contributions
to Ukraine’s security so tangible and so operational.  People look to us
to lead in that effort, as we have, through the Ukraine Defense Contact
Group and other initiatives.   
   
And so, it’s important — there are a lot of eyes on us right now,
certainly in our allies and partners and some adversaries as well.  So
it’s really important that this deal that was reached in the Senate find
its way through the process, of course, but find its way to the
President’s desk so he can sign it so we can continue to do what we have
to do to support Ukraine.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Neria with Israel
Channel 13.  
   
Q    Hey, Kirby.  Thank you so much for doing this.  When America is
talking about a hostages deal, is it part of a bigger deal of
normalization with Saudi Arabia, or are we talking about two different
paths here?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, these are two different things.  We’re working very
hard, as I mentioned to Steve, to try to come to closure on another
hostage deal and an extended pause that will allow us to get the
remaining hostages home with their families, to get more assistance in,
and certainly to reduce harm to civilians.  Obviously, we’d like to have
something that’s longer in length than a week that we were able to
achieve back in November — again, to be as thorough as we can be on
getting those hostages home.   
   
And then, you know, once that gets put in place then, you know, we’ll
have to see where it goes from there, assuming that both sides meet
their commitments.   
   
At the same time, we were, before the 7th of October, and are still now
having discussions with our counterparts in the region, Israel and Saudi
Arabia — obviously, the two key ones — about trying to move forward with
a normalization arrangement between Israel and Saudi Arabia.   
   
So those discussions are ongoing as well.  We certainly received
positive feedback from both sides that they’re willing to continue to
have those discussions.  But that is a separate track and not related
specifically to trying to get this extended humanitarian pause in
place.  Both are really important though.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nathan with Israel
KAN.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  I’d like to know about the
supplemental assistance.  Is there any assessment of how critical this
is for Israel right now?  How long can Israel wait before this is
approved?  And are there any measures that the U.S. can pass in order to
mitigate that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I’m going to be careful here that I don’t talk about
operational security matters for the Israeli Defense Forces.   
   
But the figure that we came up with in October and then the one that’s
in this bill — roughly, they’re about the same:  more than $10 billion. 
And it’s designed — the figures that we came up with were achieved in
close consultation with our Israeli counterparts about their
expectations of what they would need so many weeks hence.  So, we’re
glad to see that this bipartisan Senate bill does continue to provide
security assistance for Israel.   
   
I want to say just one thing, though.  I want to be — again, I will let
the Israelis speak for how much longer they have to go and (inaudible)
the munition, but we know that air defense capabilities are a key,
critical need for the Israelis as rockets continue to get launched
against them and targets in Israel.  And they have expended quite a bit
of air defense munitions, and we know that that’s a critical need.  So
that’s one area where, you know, I am comfortable talking about and
saying that, you know, we know we’ve got to do more to help replenish
their stocks.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nick with PBS.  
   
Q    Hey, Sam.  Thanks very much.  Hey, John.  Two questions on
Ukraine.  Given the response so far by Speaker Johnson, is the White
House interested in and/or pursuing an alternative — for example,
somehow combining the Israel bill that came out of the House with the
Ukraine funding that would have to be created by the Senate and then
sent back to the House?  
   
And then, on air defense for Ukraine, I know you won’t be able to be
specific, but if there’s no supplemental, could you say anything about
how critical air defense for Ukraine levels  
would be?  Thanks.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Nick.  On the first one — you’ll hear more from the
President soon, so I hope you understand that I won’t get ahead of him —
our focus is on this negotiated bill from the Senate side, where
Democrats and Republicans really worked hard to come up with a proposal,
a bill that we believe and the President has said, you know, we support
and we believe will go a long way to helping us with these emergency
supplemental requests.  And that’s our focus.   
   
And as the President — as we have said — as we have said, that, you
know, if it gets to the President’s desk, he’ll sign it.  So that’s our
focus.  And we’d prefer that, on the House Republican side, instead of
political gamesmanship and ploys, that they focused on — they focused
more seriously on this Senate bill, because there’s an awful lot of
goodness in this bill for not just the people of Ukraine but also
Israel, and, of course, to help our Border Patrol agents down at the
southern border.   
   
And as the ambassador said in the Indo-Pacific, there’s a lot of
goodness in here for our national security.  And we urge members of
Congress in the House to take it up and to take it up seriously.  That’s
our focus.   
   
On your second question, on air defense — again, without getting into
inventory numbers, which I would never do for the Ukrainians — air
defense, likewise, for Ukraine is critical right now, particularly in
these winter months.  We have seen a continued onslaught by Russian
drones — actually supplied many of them by Iran — and cruise and
ballistic missiles targeting particularly two things in Ukraine: one is
obviously military units, but also specifically and directly targeting
Ukraine’s defense industrial base to try to eliminate Ukraine’s ability
to organically produce many of the munitions that they need to defend
themselves.   
   
So, air defense is critical, whether it’s short, medium, or long range. 
And it’s going to become more critical over these winter months as Mr.
Putin continues to try to pound away at that Ukrainian defense
industrial base.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Asma with NPR.  
   
Q    Hey.  Thanks, John, for doing this.  I have two questions on two
different topics.   
   
First, I know, on Friday, when you spoke of the administration’s
response to the servicemembers who were killed in Jordan, you had said
that at that time you did not yet know, kind of, the scale of what that
meant in terms of militants who had been killed or wounded.  I’m
wondering now if you have anything that you can share on that front.  
   
And then, second topic is: In regards to the ongoing negotiations to
release remaining hostages that were taken by Hamas, could you
characterize what or whom has been the primary holdup?  My understanding
is this is now in the hands of Hamas, but could you characterize what is
the major sticking point?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m going to be unsatisfying on both of these questions.   
   
I think the Pentagon briefed yesterday and spoke to their belief that
there probably were some militia group members killed and/or wounded,
but they did not have a number.  And so, I’m not really able to go
beyond what they are assessing.  Your question is really better put to
them.  They’re doing the battle damage assessment, and they would
know.   
   
And I’m not going to negotiate here, in public, and start throwing out
labels on who’s the holdup or what’s the holdup.  We believe that there
has been a serious proposal put forward here and — for an extended pause
that can do all the things we’ve said it can do.  And we are still now
in the process of trying to get that proposal inked and underway.   
   
And I think I probably should just leave it at that lest I say anything
that could negatively affect what is still a very sensitive negotiation
process.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Michael with the
Washington Post.  
   
Q    Hey.  Thanks so much for doing this.  Question or two about
Ukraine.  In the Scholz meeting on Friday, to what extent are you guys
hashing out a strategy about how to help Ukraine if the supplemental
doesn’t pass and if there isn’t substantial more U.S. funding for
military assistance to Ukraine?  
   
And just wanted to ask also about Jake’s visit to Brussels tomorrow.  I
mean, is that what’s on the agenda there with Stoltenberg?  Thanks a
lot.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  Without additional funding to support Ukraine, the
United States, at least unilaterally, won’t be able to continue to
provide security assistance.  We said that very clearly.  We’ve got to
have the supplemental funding in order to be able to provide continued
security assistance.   
   
And I would remind that one of the things baked into that Senate bill is
a significant amount, something to the tune of $20 billion, of
replenishment authority for the Defense Department to help restock its
shelves and a significant investment in our own defense industrial base
here at home.  It’s really critical.   
   
Other nations are also providing support to Ukraine.  I think you’ve
seen, just a week or so ago, the EU pledged like $10 billion in
financial assistance to Ukraine.  That’s welcomed.  That’s important. 
And other nations, you know, unilaterally are continuing to support
Ukraine, and we certainly hope that that support will not lapse
either.   
   
But again, back to, I think it was Aamer’s question, the United States
is certainly seen, and rightly so, as a real leader here on the support
to Ukraine front.  And people will look to us for that leadership.  And
we have the most robust defense industrial base, the most significant
ability to continue to support in a robust way, more robust than many
other nations around the world.   
   
And so, that we might not be able to provide support doesn’t mean that
support won’t still be able to flow from other countries.  But our
absence from that will certainly be felt in the hands of the Ukrainian
soldiers on the battlefield, and that’s what we want to avoid.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Morgan with
Semafor.  
   
Q    Hey, John.  Thanks so much for doing this.  I’m wondering if you
can give us a sense of what the impact the lapse in U.S. aid is already
having on the battlefield in Ukraine.  What kind of things are you
hearing from the Ukrainians?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, again, without getting too much into their operations,
we know for a fact that some of their battlefield commanders on the
ground are making tough decisions about how many munitions they’re going
to fire on a given day at a given target, how many do they have to keep
back.  They’re making operational maneuver decisions based on their
ability to continue to support the troops going forward in the field. 
So they’re in a tough position.   
   
They’re also having to defend against, as I said earlier, a pretty heavy
barrage in the air by drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. 
So they’re expending air defense, again, mostly medium to long range, at
a rate that they’re concerned about.  And the Russians notice.  I mean,
part of the tactic here is throw metal into the sky, knowing that the
Ukrainians are going to have to throw metal back at it, and that there’s
not a steady stream or reliable stream of backfill for that air defense
capabilities.   
   
So we know that soldiers on the battlefield — on the battlefront are
running low on certain types of ammunition.  We know that air defense is
going to be a key inventory item for them going forward.  And we know
that battlefield commanders, again, as I said earlier, are making some
pretty dang tough decisions about what they’re going to expend and how
they’re going to operate with what they have to spend in order to
preserve some capability for the future, if that support is not
coming.   
   
And I just — one last point on this, and then I promise I’ll shut up. 
But, I mean, these winter months, it’s not as if the fighting has
stopped.  Both sides are slugging it out in the air and on the ground. 
And so, it’s not as if everybody can just take a knee here and wait for
the spring, the “spring offensive,” and so we’ve got months and months
to help resupply the Ukrainians.  The time is now.  They need this stuff
now.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Kevin with CNN.  
   
Q    Thank you, John.  On Friday, you said, after these strikes, that
there had been no communications, backchannel or otherwise, with Iran. 
Has that changed in the last couple of days?  
   
And then, I had a separate question on the hostage negotiations.  In the
past, there had been reporting about some of the difficulties in
actually getting in touch with Hamas, you know, between the
communications blackouts in Gaza and the bombardments there, that there
had been gaps in when Qatar or Egypt could actually communicate with the
leaders.  Is that having any effect now in the back-and-forth over the
hostage deal that appears to be coming together?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I know of no private messaging to Iran since the death of
our soldiers in Jordan over a week ago.   
   
On your second question — again, I’ll be careful here because I don’t
want to insert myself in the negotiations — but the communication with
Hamas is done through Qatar.  And that communication process — because,
ultimately, whatever is being negotiated has to reach Hamas leaders in
Gaza too, not just the ones that are present in Qatar — that
communication process can sometimes be cumbersome.  It doesn’t mean that
it’s not effective; it doesn’t mean that it’s not reliable.  Just, at
times, it can be cumbersome.  But we have managed in the past to work
through that.  And I have no doubt that we are right now still able,
through the Qataris, to communicate effectively with Hamas leaders.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Aurelia with AFP.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  A really quick one on the
impact on the battlefield.  Without American assistance, what do you
think will happen on the battlefield in Ukraine?  Do you think the
Ukrainian forces will collapse?  Do you see the conflict dragging on? 
What’s your scenario here?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not very good at predicting the future when it comes to
military operations.  I’ll just tell you that American security
assistance and the security assistance from so many other countries
remains critical to Ukraine.  They’d be the first to tell you.  In fact,
President Zelenskyy has said that without foreign support he would not
be able to wage this war in Ukraine’s defense and to be able to claw
back, as they have, more than 50 percent of the territory that the
Russians originally took.  It’s absolutely vital.  It’s critical.  
   
And the President is going to stay focused — and, again, you’ll hear
more from him in just a wee bit — we’re going to stay focused on making
sure we can continue to find a way to get them that security
assistance.   
   
But as I said — again, I’m not going to predict the future here; I would
not do that — but as I said to the previous question, the commanders on
the battlefield are having to make some difficult decisions that they
should not have to make to be able to defend themselves and their
troops.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And as Kirby said, we’re going to hear from the
President in a wee bit, so we’ll let you go.   
   
If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out, and we’ll get
back to you.   
   
Oh, wait, Kirby has one more thing.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yep.  Just again, I want to foot-stomp my apology at the
top.  I made a mistake there on Friday night, and I do really regret
it.  And I promise you I’ll do a better job going forward and work
harder to not put bad information out there.  Again, my apologies. 
Thanks.  
   
MODERATOR:  Great.  Again, if there’s anything else we can do, feel free
to email us, and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.  Thanks.
