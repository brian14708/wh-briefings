11:07 A.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining.  As a
reminder for these calls, these are on the record, and we’ve got no
embargo here.  
   
We’ll kick it off to Kirby at the top for a few words, and then we’ll
take your questions.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, everybody.  I just want to take a couple of minutes
here at the beginning to draw your attention again to events in Ukraine
over the weekend, in particular how Ukrainian troops were forced to
withdraw from the city of Avdiivka in the eastern part of Ukraine — and
that happened on Saturday; I think you all know that — because they
practically ran out of supplies, including artillery ammunition.  
   
For many months, we’ve talked about how Russia was trying to take
Avdiivka as part of its offensive in the east.  I talked it from the
podium just a few days ago last week, and we talked about how Russia had
suffered thousands and thousands of casualties in the process.  For
months, Ukraine had been able to keep the Russian attacks at bay, until
they started to run out of ammunition, particularly with respect to
artillery — the kind of ammunition that they needed to prevent those
Russian forces from reaching Ukrainian defensive lines and overrunning
those positions.  
   
Let’s be clear about this: Ukraine’s decision to withdraw from Avdiivka
wasn’t because they weren’t brave enough.  It wasn’t because they
weren’t well-led enough.  It wasn’t because they weren’t trained.  It
wasn’t because they didn’t have the tactical acumen to defend themselves
and to defend that town.  It was because of congressional inaction.  And
we’ve been warning Congress that if they didn’t act, Ukraine would
suffer losses on the battlefield.  And here you go — that’s what
happened this weekend.  And that’s what’s at stake here in Ukraine if we
can’t get the supplemental funding and get the kinds of arms and
ammunition into the hands of Ukrainian soldiers as soon as possible.  
   
On Friday, now, we also got the horrific news that Aleksey Navalny died
in a Russian prison.  As you heard the President say, Mr. Navalny had
courageously stood up to the corruption, the violence, and all the
malicious activity that the Putin government had been doing.   
   
Whatever story the Russian government decides to tell the world, it’s
clear that President Putin and his government are responsible for Mr.
Navalny’s death.   
   
In response, at President Biden’s direction, we will be announcing a
major sanctions package on Friday of this week to hold Russia
accountable for what happened to Mr. Navalny and, quite frankly, for all
its actions over the course of this vicious and brutal war that has now
raged on for two years.  
   
One of the most powerful things that we can do right now to stand up to
Vladimir Putin, of course, is to, again, pass the bipartisan National
Security Supplemental bill and support Ukraine as they continue to fight
bravely in defense of their country.  
   
And with that, I’ll take some questions.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Zeke Miller with
the AP.  You should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thanks, John.  First off, on that sanctions package, can you give
us any indication of what might come with that and how it will be
different in any way from the barrage of sanctions that the U.S. and
allies have put in place on Russia since the invasion of Ukraine?  
   
And then, secondly, on Ukraine, has the loss of Avdiivka sort of changed
the trajectory of the conflict?  You know, can Ukraine make up the
ground that has been lost by the delays in supplying?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Zeke.  On the sanctions package, as you know, we
don’t get ahead of sanctions announcements in terms of any great
detail.  But I think what you’ll see in this package that we’re going to
be announcing Friday is a set of sanctions, a regime that not only is
designed to hold Mr. Putin accountable for now two years of war in
Ukraine, but also specifically supplemented with additional sanctions
regarding Mr. Navalny’s death.   
   
That’s, unfortunately, about the most — the amount of detail I can get
into right now.  We’re always careful before we announce sanctions. 
But, again, I would say, stay tuned, look to Friday, and we’ll have more
to say about that.   
   
On Avdiivka, I think, taking a step back, I mean, why have the Russians
been trying to get Avdiivka?  Largely because they want basically a hub
— a logistics and operational maneuver hub in the Donbas area,
specifically in Donetsk.  And that’s why they’ve been trying to get
Avdiivka.  They believe that it will give them a stepping-off point, if
you will, to conduct further operations in the Donetsk and even in the
Luhansk areas.   
   
Now, whether they’re capable of actually doing that, we’ll see.  I mean,
they have struggled with logistics and sustainment command and control
since the very beginning of this conflict.  It’s not likely that they’ve
sort of reached some breakthrough capability here in terms of sustaining
their troops on the battlefield.  But that’s ostensibly what they were
trying to achieve by getting Avdiivka.   
   
It will not change in the aggregate the kinds of defensive works and the
defensive operations that the Ukrainians are going to be capable of
conducting.  In fact, it was a wise decision by President Zelenskyy to
withdraw so his troops did not get encircled so that he could preserve
them and the precious resources that they have.  And it is precious, by
the way.   
   
But it remains to be seen whether or not the Russians are going to be
able to achieve the sort of overarching strategic goal of taking
Avdiivka.   
   
What we can say for sure is that if the Ukrainians aren’t better
supplied, if they don’t get a relief from the shortage of ammunition
that they are suffering right now, this could — this move on Avdiivka
could actually have a larger effect on the fighting in the east and the
amount of territory that the Russians might be able to get over time.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Missy Ryan.  You
should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hey, John.  Thanks for doing this.  I wanted to check in on the
artillery issue that you mentioned that is driving some of the problems
for the Ukrainian forces.  You know, I know you guys have said many
times that the Congress needs to approve the supplemental request, but
I’m wondering, if that does not happen, is the administration
considering providing additional artillery from U.S. stockpiles without
the replenishment funds?  As you know, there is PDA authority
remaining.  Would the administration be willing to take that hit at some
point if the Ukrainians really need it and there isn’t movement from
Congress?  Thanks.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Missy.  We need the supplemental funding.  We
absolutely have to have the supplemental funding to be able to continue
to support Ukraine.  The replenishment authority is important.  Because
we have provided so much, we’ve got to be mindful of our own stocks for
our own national security purposes.   
   
Now, I’m not going to get into hypotheticals about what we might or
might not do, because we’re focused on actually getting the supplemental
bill passed.  That is the answer to being able to provide Ukraine with
the resources that it needs for this very kinetic fight.  And it is not
like these guys are dug in over the winter.  I mean, you’ve just seen
over the weekend, it’s a very kinetic fight.  They need these — they
need those resources, and we need Congress to do its job and pass that
supplemental bill.   
   
And, you know, to your other question about the existing PDA and the
importance of it — yes, there’s existing authority left, but without the
replenishment authority, as I said, it’s not cost-free in terms of our
own national security needs.  And we have obligations around the world
that we need to be mindful of as well.  
   
MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Steve Holland.  You should be able to
unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hey there, John.  Just a bit more on Navalny.  How hard is it going
to be to determine how he died?  Is the U.S. making an independent
effort to try to determine how he died?  Have you asked Russia for
details?  Anything on this at all?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Our embassy has been engaged, Steve, as you would expect
them to.  But, you know, it’s difficult to get to a point where you can
be confident in what the Russians would say about his death.   
   
We all want — would love to know exactly what happened here, not setting
aside the fact that regardless of the actual scientific answer, Mr.
Putin is responsible for it.  But absent some credible investigation
into his death, I mean, you know, it’s hard to get to a point where, you
know, we can just take the Russians’ word for it.   
   
So, clearly, we’re calling for complete transparency by the Russian
government for how he died.  And we’ll continue to do that.  
   
Q    And secondly, John, one of the suggestions that came out of the
weekend TV shows was declaring Russia a state sponsor of terrorism to be
able to increase the amount of pressure on the Russian government.  Is
that being considered at all at the White House?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’ve put an awful lot of pressure on Russia, Steve, over
the course of the last couple of years specifically.  And as I think
you’ll see on Friday, we’re going to ramp up that pressure on Russia. 
But I don’t have anything to announce or to speak to with regard to the
state sponsor of terrorism designation.   
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Next up, we’ll go to Vivian Salama.  You should
be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thanks, Eduardo.  Hi, John.  I wanted to ask you about the U.N.
Security Council vote that just happened.  The U.S. was the sole veto to
the Algerian plan calling for an immediate ceasefire.  You know,
increasingly, it seems the U.S. is isolated in its position that now is
not the time, where most other countries felt like it should happen
right away.   
   
And so, I’m curious, you know, does the White House — you know, what is
the White House’s position with regard to sort of this isolation in the
world and its persistent support of Israel and the Hamas — and the
hostage negotiations?  You know, at some point, do you feel like you’re
going to have to embrace the calls for an immediate ceasefire if you’re
not able to make headway on the other issues, including the hostages? 
Thanks.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, look, we just weren’t able to support a resolution
today that was going to put sensitive negotiations in peril.  And that’s
what we believe this resolution would do.  We are in the midst — in
fact, Brett McGurk is traveling to the region as we speak to have
meetings in Cairo tomorrow, and then follow-on in Israel the next day,
specifically to see if we can get this hostage deal in place, which
calls for a temporary ceasefire, calls for a humanitarian pause of an
extended nature to get all those hostages out.  And to vote for this
resolution today could very well put those negotiations at risk.   
   
You know, you talk about isolation.  I think the American people, and I
think most of the people around the world, would love to see those
hostages home with their families.  And if we just voted and went along
with this resolution, the chances of doing that would be greatly
reduced.   
   
So we’re comfortable with the approach that we’re taking.  We all want
to see this conflict end, but it’s got to end in a way that keeps the
Israeli people safe from any future attacks by Hamas, that doesn’t leave
Hamas in control, and doesn’t take the pressure off Hamas to release all
those hostages, let alone the humanitarian assistance, which needs to
continue to get in and increase volume.  And that could happen if we can
get this deal in place.   
   
We are at a very delicate time right now, Vivian, with these discussions
going on, and we’re still hopeful that we can get this over the finish
line.  This resolution — this was not the time for that kind of
resolution.  As our U.N. Ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: “A
vote today was wishful but it was irresponsible.”  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Next up, we’ll go to Patsy.  You should be able
to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thanks, Eduardo.  And thanks, John.  So, just to follow up on
Vivian’s question, I think the U.S. is also proposing a draft U.N.
resolution to oppose a ground offensive in Rafah.  This was perhaps
going to be seen in a difficult way by Israel.   
   
As you know, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that bending to
international pressure to delay offensive in Rafah is the same as
telling Israel to lose the war against Hamas.   
   
So this is another instance where the Prime Minister is pushing against
what President Biden wants.  Can you help us understand this?  Is the
President losing patience with the Prime Minister?  Yeah, just help us
figure this out.   
   
And then I have a follow-up on Russia.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, as you know, he talked to Prime Minister Netanyahu not
long ago, and we’re going to keep those discussions going.   
   
Again, Brett will be in Israel the day after tomorrow.  I have no doubt
that he’ll also have an opportunity to talk about what’s going on in
Rafah and reiterate our concerns about the current circumstances and
what a major ground offensive in Rafah could look like under the current
circumstances without due appreciation for and planning for, in a
credible way, the safety and security of the more than million people
that are down there.  And that has not changed.  President Biden hasn’t
changed on our view of that.  Brett will certainly convey that when he’s
in Israel.   
   
This is — we — absolutely nothing has changed about our desire to see
the threat from Hamas eliminated in terms of the Israeli people.  We
don’t believe that Hamas leadership should be able to get off scot-free
here after what happened on the 7th of October.  And we certainly
understand the right and responsibility of the IDF to eliminate that
threat to their own people.   
   
We’re still solidly in support of that.  This isn’t about wanting Israel
to do anything but to succeed against the threat against Hamas.  But it
also comes with the desire to have that success.  For any major
military, there comes an obligation — an added obligation to make sure
that you’re looking after the safety and security of innocent people
that are in harm’s way.  And again, we’ve been very, very consistent
about that.  
   
Q    And on Russia, Yulia Navalnaya is calling on Western countries,
including the U.S., not to recognize the result of the presidential
elections in Russia next month.  Is this something that the
administration would consider?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything for you on that.  
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Justin Gomez.  You should be able to
unmute yourself.   
   
Q    Hey, John.  Good morning.  Yesterday, the President said he’d be
happy to meet with Speaker Johnson to discuss Ukraine aid.  Can you just
explain what changed, now that the President said he’s open to sitting
down with him?  Last week, the White House was questioning, kind of,
what the point of a meeting between the Speaker and President Biden
would be.  And some of his previous requests were denied when he asked
the White House for this meeting.  So, can you just kind of give some
insight into why the President is now open to that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Look, I think, as we’ve said, we have sat down and discussed
this with Speaker Johnson and other congressional leaders, including at
the White House several weeks ago, the importance of this supplemental
funding.  And that was, of course, before the Speaker got exactly what
he wanted and then decided that he didn’t want it, which was a bill that
included billions of dollars additional for border security.   
   
It is — we are at a critical time, as I said in my topper.  The
Ukrainian troops on the battlefront are literally running out of
ammunition and having to give up defensive positions to the Russians —
defensive positions, by the way, that they’ve been holding and holding
well — because they’re having to make the impossible decisions on the
battlefield of whether they’re going to fire this or fire that and who
they’re going to shoot at and how many bullets are going to — or
artillery shells they’re going to use.   
   
We’re at a critical time.  And I believe that the President’s comments
and willingness to have another conversation with the Speaker reflect
the sense of urgency that we all believe we’re in and, frankly, we
believe Congress should believe we’re in, instead of being on
vacation.  
   
MODERATOR:  Next question, we’ll go to Hiba Nasr.  You should be able to
unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thanks, Eduardo.  Good morning, John.  I go back to that Security
Council resolution, the draft you introduced.  You said in the draft
that this draft underscores its support for a “temporary ceasefire in
Gaza as soon as practicable.”  I know you went through what you want to
see before seeing a temporary ceasefire, but I’m asking here about the
time factor — I mean, to what extent this is important to you.  And my
second question — and if you can elaborate a little bit about what do
you mean by “practicable.”  
   
The second thing: I will ask about the Lebanese front.  Yesterday, the
Israelis hit inside south Lebanon.  It is 50 kilometers far from the
border.  This time we’ve seen the rules of engagement changing.  Is the
risk higher on the Lebanese front?  Thank you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m going to ask you to repeat your second question in a
minute, as I didn’t quite get all of it.   
   
But, look, when we talk about “as soon as practicable,” we mean in the
context of what we’re trying to get done with this hostage deal.  We
are, again, in very sensitive negotiations that we hope will bear fruit
soon to be able to get these hostages out and get an extended pause in
place.   
   
And we just don’t believe — we still don’t believe that a general
ceasefire, meaning a permanent ceasefire, that this is the right time
for that — a ceasefire that leaves Hamas in control and alleviates any
responsibility for them to release the hostages.   
   
Again, where we’re at right now in time and space, we believe the
approach that we’re taking is the best option to getting those hostages
home, to getting aid increased, and frankly, getting the violence down
for an extended period of time — more than one week; it could
potentially be up to six weeks if we’re successful.  That’s what we mean
by “as soon as practicable.”   
   
And I’m sorry, can you repeat your second question?  There was a garble,
and I think I missed the gist of it.   
   
Q    Yes.  My second question: Yesterday, the Israelis hit Hezbollah
infrastructure in a location 50 kilometers far from the southern
borders, which indicate a change — a big change in the rules of
engagement.  Is the risk higher on the Lebanese front?  And what are you
trying to avoid further escalation, especially that there’s a difference
between your approach and the French approach toward Lebanon?  Thank
you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I can’t speak for anybody’s approach but ours.  And I wasn’t
tracking that particular event.   
   
But just in general, our approach remains the same.  And this has been
really an approach shepherded by Amos Hochstein, who has, as you know,
done quite a bit of diplomacy on this particular issue.  But we don’t
want to see a second front open up.  We don’t want to see the conflict
widen and deepen.  We don’t want to see the fighting that has occurred
between Hezbollah and Israeli Defense Forces up in the north continue;
we certainly don’t want to see it become more aggressive.   
   
I can’t speak for the IDF and what they will or won’t do as a result of
this most recent event that you talked about.  But I can just tell you
that we’re going to continue our conversations with our Israeli
counterparts, continue our conversations with Lebanese counterparts as
well, about not letting the tensions up there boil over to the point
where it truly does deepen and widen the conflict in a way that could
alleviate any kind of pressure on Hamas.  And I think I’ll just need to
leave it at that.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nadia.  You should
be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thank you, Eduardo.  Good morning, John.  Correct me if I’m wrong,
but the U.S. position regarding Rafah — that you do not mind an Israeli
operation unless or except that if the Israelis give you a feasible or
practical solution to evacuate civilians, which we’re talking about one
and a half million — is this the case, or actually you are adamantly
against any military operation?  And whether the Israelis have given you
any plan that you consider actually workable.  
   
And second, I don’t know if you’ve seen this report, but there is a
report that was published today that a pro-Israeli group that is linked
to the White House are basically targeting journalists at the Washington
Post who are writing or perceived as writing stories that are
pro-Palestinians or pro-civilians or exposing the Palestinian suffering
in Gaza.   
   
So how can the White House ensure that journalists have the right to do
the duties — fulfill the duties without any harassment from any groups,
whether it is a lobbyist or especially somebody who’s linked to the
White House?  Thank you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  On your second question, let me take the question, Nadia. 
I’m not aware of —  
   
Q    I can send you the article.  Sure.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, please do.  We’ll take a look at that.   
   
Obviously, we would take seriously any effort designed to stifle,
intimidate, or pressure reporters to do their jobs a certain way.  We
believe in freedom of the press, and would not counsel or approve of any
effort by anybody to interfere with freedom of the press and
journalistic endeavor.   
   
So, please do send it to me, and we’ll take a look at that.  But that’s
the first I’ve heard of it.   
   
On your first question: Nothing has changed.  We don’t believe that —
well, let me put it a different way.  We believe that any major
operation in Rafah, under the current circumstances, without a credible
and operable plan to look after, to ensure the safety and security of
the more than million people — and you’re right, I’ve seen estimates of
up to a million and a half innocent Palestinians that took refuge in in
Rafah because of the fighting up north — would be a disaster.  We have
conveyed that privately to our Israeli counterparts.  Again, Brett is on
his way to Israel here later this week.  I’m sure he will carry forth
that same message.  
   
We would not support such an operation unless there was a credible plan
for the safety and security of all those innocent people that, again,
moved as requested to the south because of fighting in Khan Younis and,
earlier still, in Gaza City.  And they need to be looked after.  Their
safety and security need to be fully and carefully considered before
major military operations should be conducted in Rafah.  
   
Now, we understand that there are Hamas leadership — in fact, full Hamas
units — that are now operating in Rafah, mixing among the civilians,
trying to find refuge there.  That’s classic Hamas conduct, and that’s
inexcusable.  And Israel has a right to go after them, of course, but
they also have an obligation, as I said earlier, to minimize any harm to
civilians.  And that’s what we want to see.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Emily Goodin.  You
should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thank you, Eduardo.  Thank you, John.  I wanted to ask about
reports of this U.S.-Russian ballerina, Ksenia Karelina, who has been
held in Russia and charged with treason.  Just wondered what you guys
were hearing and tracking there.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have a whole lot I can offer here.  I can tell you
that we at the White House and, of course, the State Department, we’ve
been aware of the reports of the arrest of a dual U.S.-Russia citizen. 
And we are trying to get more information and to secure some consular
access to that individual.   
   
Out of respect for privacy, we’re not really able to comment a whole lot
more than that.  I hope you can understand that.   
   
The last thing I’d say is I want to reiterate our very strong warnings
about the danger posed to U.S. citizens inside Russia.  So if you’re a
U.S. citizen, including a dual national, residing in or traveling in
Russia, you ought to leave right now if you can.  Just depart
immediately.  And that’s clearly stated in our travel advisory for
Russia.  And obviously, it goes without saying, if you’re a U.S. citizen
or you have a U.S.  passport, and you haven’t traveled to Russia but
you’re considering going, we obviously urge you not to do that.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’ve got time for a couple more questions. 
Next up, we’ll go to Asma.  You should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks, John.  And thanks, Eduardo.  I had a quick question. 
And I know this has been asked in a few different ways, but if I can try
again, John, because I still don’t have a clear sense of what the U.S.
position is on Rafah at this moment.   
   
Is there the sense that the Israeli military has offered you all any
credible alternative or credible, you know, civilian pathway out?  I
think that’s the question a few of us have asked in different ways,
which is: Is it the position that you do not want to or that you see an
alternative vision where it is plausible to go into Rafah?  And have you
at all seen any plans that suggest that is possible?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Okay, thanks.  I’m sorry if I’ve been less than clear, so
I’ll try it again.  And if it still doesn’t scratch the edge, let me
know.   
   
We’ve been consistent that we understand Israel has a right and
responsibility to go after Hamas.  We understand that there are Hamas
units and Hamas leaders who have migrated down to Rafah as a result of
the fighting in Khan Younis.  We understand that those Hamas leaders and
those units are in many ways embedding themselves in and around the
civilian population, hiding behind human shields as they have done in
the past.  Classic Hamas behavior.  That makes it difficult, as it has
made it difficult for the Israelis, to fight against Hamas since the
attacks of October 7th.   
   
It is an even more difficult challenge for Israel given the sheer number
of Palestinians that are trying to find refuge in Rafah and have been
forced down to Rafah as a result of the fighting farther north —
somewhere between a million and a million and a half people.  That is a
lot when you’re talking about a strip of land that’s only 12 miles
wide.   
   
So we do not support major operations in Rafah that do not properly
account for a credible plan — and include a credible plan to care for
the safety and security of those million-plus people finding refuge in
Rafah.  We would not support operations that put those people at greater
— at deliberate and greater risk.   
   
Now, hopefully that’s clear.  We certainly support going after Hamas. 
We certainly support decapitating their network and eliminating the
threat.  But with that, particularly in an environment like Gaza, comes
an added burden by the Israeli Defense Forces to reduce civilian
harm.   
   
I am not aware of the existence of a credible plan to do that at this
time or that has been presented to us.  I’m sure that when Brett is in
the region, he will have an opportunity to talk to the Israelis more
about what their plans.   
   
I did see comments by Prime Minister Netanyahu that he ordered his
military leaders to come up with such a plan.  Again, I am not aware
that any plan has been completed and/or presented to Prime Minister
Netanyahu.  I’m certainly not aware of any presentation to us on what
that would look like.   
   
But we do not support operations in Rafah, under the current
circumstances, without a credible plan to deal with the safety and
security of the people there.   
   
Did that make it clearer?  
   
Q    Yes, thank you.  That was helpful.  Thank you.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, ma’am.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our last question will go to Jacob Magid.  You
should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for doing this.  So, on that: President Biden, on — I
think it was Friday — talked about the reasoning that he doesn’t want
Israel to go into Rafah being about while the negotiations are ongoing. 
And you haven’t mentioned that as the main reason.  I just wanted to
clarify: Is that because he kind of spoke off the talking point that
it’s not — that it’s really just about the plan issue?  Or is that also
part of the calculus, that we don’t want the Rafah operation to take
place until we’ve reached some sort of deal or if the negotiations fall
apart?   
   
I also just wanted to clarify — because, I mean, I have spoken to
Israeli officials that have said there has been a plan that was
presented and that we’re talking about moving those in Rafah to just
north of Khan Younis, south of Wadi Gaza, that there is space there,
that they have plans.   
   
I mean, Netanyahu ordered this plan publicly over a week ago.  It’s kind
of hard to imagine that no plan has been presented.  Is it possible that
there has been; it’s just that you don’t want to talk about it
publicly?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  As I said, I’m not aware of a plan that we’ve had a chance
to look at and examine.  But I can’t speak for the Israeli Defense
Forces and what planning they’ve actually done and if they’ve planned —
if they’ve presented it to the Prime Minister.  I said I wasn’t aware,
which is an honest answer.  I’m not aware.  That doesn’t mean that they
haven’t done that (inaudible).  
   
And again, our principal concern here is that, under the current
circumstances, without properly accounting for the safety and security
of those refugees, we continue to believe that an operation in Rafah
would be a disaster.  And obviously, we’re working very hard on trying
to get a hostage deal in place.  
   
As I said, Brett is heading to the region — he’ll be in Egypt tomorrow
and then Israel the next day — with that being a principal focus of his
efforts to try to get that hostage deal in place.   
   
And as I said earlier, many times in this gaggle, we are in a sensitive
moment here and believe the President was referring to the sensitivity
of the moment that we’re in and how hard we’re trying to get this over
the finish line.  
   
Q    So it’s not a condition that, like, the negotiations have to be
over for the Rafah operation to take place?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think I’m just going to leave it the way I did.   
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks, everyone.  That’s all the time we have today.  We’ll
do this again soon.
