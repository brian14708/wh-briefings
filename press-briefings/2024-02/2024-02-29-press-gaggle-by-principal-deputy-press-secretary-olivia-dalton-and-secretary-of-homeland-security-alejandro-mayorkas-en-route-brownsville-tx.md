En Route Brownsville, Texas

1:36 P.M. EST  
   
MS. DALTON:  Good afternoon.  We’re on our way to Brownsville, Texas,
where President Biden will meet with Border Patrol agents, law
enforcement officials, frontline personnel, and elected leaders,
including Representative Gonzalez, who is headed down to Brownsville
with us today.      
   
Secretary Mayorkas is joining us to talk a little bit more about the
latest on the ground.  
   
But before I turn it over to him, I want to highlight just a few
points.  Earlier this month, congressional Republicans rejected the
bipartisan border security agreement simply because the former President
told them to.  You heard President Biden say he would take this deal to
the American people and make sure they know who is about political
rhetoric and who is about solutions.  
   
Today, there’s new polling out showing Americans overwhelmingly support
the bipartisan border security agreement, including a majority of
Democrats, Republicans, and independents.  You will hear from the
President as he continues to make the case that this bipartisan border
security agreement would make our country safer, our border more secure,
while ensuring we are treating people fairly and humanely, consistent
with our nation’s values.  
   
And then I’ll turn it over to you, Secretary.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Thank you, Olivia.  So, before I talk about today’s
operational briefing on the border, let me just say a few words about
the fires in Texas and Oklahoma.  The latest report is that —  
   
Q    I’m sorry.  We can’t hear you.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Oh, I’m sorry.  The latest report is that over a
million acres have burned, one life has been lost.  We, in the
Department of Homeland Security, especially FEMA, are intensely focused
on these fires and providing the resources, equipment, and personnel
that the impacted communities need.   
   
We have Fire Management Assistance funds available to Texas and
Oklahoma, and we also already have deployed firefighters, first
responders, trucks, and other equipment to help fight the blazes.   
   
Let me turn, then, to the — to the visit to Brownsville, Texas.  This is
a very important operational briefing for the President as the
Commander-in-Chief.   
   
The President is going to hear from Border Patrol, Office of Field
Operations, both within U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  He’s going
to hear from Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security
Investigations personnel in Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  He is
going to hear from asylum processing experts in U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services.   
   
He’s going to hear about what they’re able to do with the too-few
resources that they have.  He’s going to hear about what they need and
what impact, operationally, those additional needed resources would
deliver.  And he’s going to hear about the incredible value and
importance that the legislation would deliver if Congress passes it:
more people, faster processing times, more technology, more equipment,
more facilities.   
   
Q    A —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  If I can, Brownsville, Texas, provides a very good
glimpse of how dynamic and challenging the migration phenomenon is. 
Last year, in April and May of 2023, approximately 30 percent of all
encounters across the southern border were realized in the Rio Grande
Valley Sector, of which Brownsville is a part.   
   
Now, those numbers have been reduced significantly, primarily because of
the enhanced law enforcement efforts south of our border.   
   
The key is to address the regional challenge that is migration.  We need
regional participation not just on the part of the United States, of
course, but on the part of our partners and allies to the south.   
   
In this, Brownsville demonstrates the impact of that partnership when
everyone’s working together to address a shared challenge.   
   
And now I’ll turn it over.  
   
Q    Can I follow up on that point?  The head of the Border Patrol union
said that Brownsville is actually not a place where the President will
be able to evaluate what’s going on because there are relatively fewer
crossings comparative to other sectors.   
   
So, is the President going to be able to get a fulsome evaluation of
what is actually needed right now when it comes to the border by going
to Brownsville?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Yes.  Yes, he will.  I mean, Texas is seeing a
reduction in encounters across — across the board over what we
experienced in December and immediately before then.  The primary reason
is the enhanced enforcement efforts on the part of the Mexican
government.   
   
The President had a conversation with the President of Mexico in
December.  Secretary Blinken and I, with our Homeland Security Advisor,
visited Mexico.  We spoke of the importance of really renewing their
enforcement efforts.  They did.  We’ve seen a tremendous drop in the
number of encounters across the southern border.   
   
The most difficult part south of our border to patrol is Sonora, on the
Mexican side, which is why Arizona — the area of Arizona in Tucson
continues to see an increase in — in the number of encounters.  
   
But the President will see firsthand what the Border Patrol needs and
what the legislation would deliver if Congress would pass it.  
   
Q    Is he — Mr. Secretary, is he going to contrast his approach with
that of Donald Trump, who’s calling for mass deportations?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  This is focused — this visit is focused on the work
that we do, not the rhetoric of others.  This is focused on operational
needs, operational challenges, and the significant impact that
legislation would have in enhancing our border security.   
   
Q    Are there no executive actions that the President can take to
reduce the number — the large number of migrants that are coming to the
U.S.-Mexico border that we saw in 2023 and continue this year?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  The fact of the matter is that the only enduring
solution is legislation.  Congress needs to act.  We have a bipartisan
piece of legislation that three senators worked on intensely for a
number of months.  I was very privileged to be at the table to provide
technical and operational expertise.  The administration was represented
at the table.  We need Congress to act.  
   
Q    In lieu of the bill passing Congress, though, we’ve reported that
the administration is considering using its 121-F \[212-F\] authority. 
Can you comment on that?  Is that something the administration is
considering?  And will there be any executive action announced today at
the border?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  There will not be any — 212-F — there will not be
any executive actions announced today.  As I continue to say, the
legislation is what we need.  It is the enduring solution.  Actions
taken outside of legislation are often met with litigation challenges in
court.   
   
Q    Do you think that would be the case with 212-F?   Is this a power
—  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  I don’t want to speculate right now.  
   
Q    Can you — can you then speak to the relationship with Governor
Abbott?  Obviously, that’s been multidimensional, to say the least.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  One — one of the — one of the benefits — one of the
benefits of being in Brownsville is to see what can be accomplished
productively in the service of border security when local officials work
with federal officials to address a shared challenge.  We have a very
good relationship with the leaders in Brownsville.  And the Border
Patrol will speak to that to our president.   
   
Q    And w- —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  And — and we will have local officials present in
Brownsville.   
   
So, when we work together, we have a better result in achieving what the
American people expect and need.  
   
When a state leader purposefully and deliberately refuses to cooperate,
coordinate, collaborate, communicate, we see actually a detriment to our
enforcement efforts.   
   
Q    Can I ask what you think about his effort of busing migrants
directly to other cities?  What — what has that done for the feds, for
you guys —  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  It is a —  
   
Q    — (inaudible) as well?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  It is a tragic thing when a public official uses
human beings and their lives as political pawns.   
   
Q    Can I just ask, with Congress back in session, what are you doing
to prepare for the possible impeachment trial?  And have you spoken to
any lawmakers in Congress?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  I have been incredibly busy with the work of the
Department of Homeland Security.  That’s my exclusive focus.  
   
Q    Mr. Secretary, why are you — why is the President and you — why are
you taking this visit now?  What is the significance of this time of
year?  Is it just something that, you know, was able to be put on the
President’s schedule right now?  Essentially, what I’m asking is: What’s
so special about this day at this time?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We have a bipartisan piece of legislation that
needs to pass to enhance our border security.  The President continues
to advocate to Congress that they must pass this bipartisan piece of
legislation.   
   
He is going to hear firsthand from the people who work tirelessly and
bravely to secure the border the impact that this legislation would have
on advancing their mission.  
   
Q    And you also talked about — you’re talking about the resources that
your agencies need.  And in addition to the border legislation being
dormant last night, so was the extra money that DHS was going to get.   
   
Can DHS get the money that they need through the regular approps process
that would end March 22nd at this point?  Is that possible with all the
help that you need right now?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  We desperately need the funds that the bipartisan
legislation provides.  We’re talking about approximately $20 billion in
funds.  We’re — we are — that provides for more than a thousand more
U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel.   
   
It calls for more than 4,000 asylum officers to meet the challenge of
increased migration that is not only impacting the southern border of
the United States, that is not only impacting the Western Hemisphere,
but we are seeing this globally: the greatest number of displaced people
around the world since World War Two.  
   
So, those are — it would provide for more than $400 million to — to
purchase and implement nonintrusive inspection technology, this
state-of-the-art equipment that enables us to better detect and
interdict fentanyl, contraband, and individuals who are being smuggled
across the border through our ports of entry.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) one more here.  The makeup of people crossing has
changed a lot.  Why do you think that is?  I mean, it’s different source
countries, different claimants, different grounds.   
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  It is.  So —  
   
Q    Why is that happening?  Why is it changing?  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  The demographics have changed significantly over
the years.  Traditionally —  
   
Q    Even in the last, like, 12 months even.  (Inaudible.)  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  It’s mul- — it’s a number of years.  Traditionally,
the vast majority of individuals encountered were from Mexico and the
Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  
   
We have seen country conditions throughout Latin America — particularly
Ecuador and Venezuela, for example — diminish in quality, as well as
country conditions around the world, whether it’s in countries in Africa
or elsewhere — authoritarian regimes elsewhere.  And by reason of that,
we’re seeing a level of migration around the world that is really
historic.  
   
And that has resulted in increased encounters at our southern border. 
And very interestingly, in my conversations — bilateral and multilateral
conversations with my counterparts from around the world over the last
few weeks, when I discussed this with the Home Secretary in the United
Kingdom, the first issue that arose was migration — the migration
challenge that the United Kingdom is facing and what they are seeking to
do legislatively.  
   
I spoke with the Home Secretary in Australia, and the number one
Homeland Security issue that she raised was immigration.  So, this is a
global phenomenon that, of course, we are — are experiencing
ourselves.  
   
MS. DALTON:  Thank you so much, Secretary.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  
   
SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  Thank you all.  
   
MS. DALTON:  Do you have anything left?  
   
Q    There’s a lot.  
   
Q    Can we get a — I think right before we took off, the President
talked to reporters on the South Lawn about reports of the hun- — over a
hundred dead in Gaza after — can you tell us a little bit about it?  Has
the President been briefed on the situation?  What’s the latest?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Yes, he’s been briefed on the situation.  And I’d just like
to make a few points about this.  Obviously, the events in Northern Gaza
are tremendously alarming and of deep concern to us — deeply tragic, the
loss of human life.  Too many civilian lives have been lost as a
consequence of military operations in Gaza.  
   
We think that this latest event needs to be thoroughly investigated. 
We’ve been in touch with the government of Israel this morning about —
to gather information and to request that they investigate and provide
more information about the circumstances that led to this tragedy.  
   
We also think that this event underscores the need for expanded
humanitarian aid to make its way into Gaza.  You may be aware, our USAID
Administrator, Samantha Power, is in the region right now doing just
that: working on delivering additional resources, she announced
yesterday, for humanitarian aid; also meeting with a variety of
stakeholders in the region about trying to open up additional
humanitarian corridors in addition to the two that are currently serving
as corridors for humanitarian aid into the region.  
   
But beyond that, you know, we have consistently and vocally communicated
to our Israeli counterparts the need for there to be viable plans to
maintain basic security in areas of Gaza where their military campaigns
against — and military operations against Hamas have concluded.   
   
We have consistently also communicated a desire to see that those plans
move forward.  And we have yet to see those be implemented, and we’re
deeply concerned about that.   
   
Once again, today we’re making — making clear to our Israeli
counterparts that we’d like to see those plans implemented very soon and
— and provide for the basic security of the Palestinian people because
the continued loss of life is deeply alarming and very — very, very
tragic.   
   
Q    You kind of already said that the estimates for Monday for a
ceasefire was optimistic.  How does this affect that?  And what — I
mean, does this give — does this mean more pressure on Netanyahu to — to
back a ceasefire?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Well, what I would say to that is you heard from the
President on the South Lawn just a few moments ago — a couple hours ago,
actually, now — that certainly this will make things more complicated. 
But he is continuing to work aggressively toward a hostage deal that
would involve at least a six-week ceasefire and help us expand the flow
of humanitarian aid into Gaza.  And, of course, we hope that would be
the basis for something longer.   
   
Since we’ve been in the air, we’ve released a couple of readouts of
calls that the President made to the heads of state of Egypt and Qatar,
where the tragedy that we all woke up to this morning was discussed; the
need for a hostage deal and expanded humanitarian aid, temporary
ceasefire was discussed.   
   
The President is going to stay on every available opportunity to make
headway in brokering a hostage deal and reaching a temporary ceasefire
that could be the basis for something longer.  He’s going to keep at
it.   
   
Q    Does he plan to raise this directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu —
what happened on the food line?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t — I don’t have any calls to preview.  But like I
said, this was discussed in calls with — that were on the books with the
heads of state of Qatar and Egypt this morning.  They had also discussed
the — the plans for — work towards a hostage deal.   
   
Q    But how seriously are you looking at the idea of an airdrop of
humanitarian supplies into Gaza?   
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t have anything on that front to preview.  But
certainly, we’re on the ground working — right now working to expand the
flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.  
   
Just yesterday, Administrator Power announced $53 million in additional
assistance for humanitarian aid to go into Gaza.  She’s working on
expanding the channels, the corridors through which that aid can flow. 
We’re going to keep at this.   
   
The events of this morning just underscored how deep and dire the
humanitarian needs amongst civilian population in Gaza are right now.   
   
Q    Olivia, there have been a number of administrative actions taken
just over the course of the past few days targeting China.  Why — is it
just a coincidence that these actions are targeting China over the span
of a few days?  What’s the — what’s behind these actions?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Well, I think you’re referring to the actions that the
President announced this morning with respect to connected vehicles?  Is
this what you’re talking about?  
   
So, yes, the — as you heard from the President this morning, the
President is committed to ensuring that, you know, American automakers,
American autoworkers are best positioned to outcompete the rest of the
world in the years ahead.  And he’s also concerned about — about
countries like China.  China is, right now —  
   
(Air Force One experiences turbulence.)  Sorry, guys, this turbulence
might be a little much.  
   
China is right now looking to flood the market here in the United States
and around the world with vehicles equipped with advanced technology
from countries of concern.  And so, that is a security risk.  That’s a
national security issue that we take very seriously.  And it’s the basis
— basis from which the President decided to direct the Commerce
Department to review those national security risks and take any
regulatory action they deem necessary to protect our people and our
national security.   
   
Q    What explanation — going back to the — the people killed while
waiting for aid.  What explanation have the Israelis given the U.S. as
to what happened?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I — I don’t have any details to share on that.  As you
heard from the President, we’re still working to get to ground truth, so
I just don’t want to get ahead of the preliminary reports.   
   
Q    And a quick thing on that trip today.  Will he meet with
migrants?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t have anything on — of that nature to preview for
you.  As you heard from the Secretary, this is really about hearing
operational, on-the-ground updates from the law enforcement and border
personnel who are on the frontlines of dealing with these challenges and
who have been under-resourced and caught flat-footed as we’ve seen
migration surge.  
   
We currently, today, have the same number of Border Patrol agents as we
had four years ago, despite the fact that migration has surged 250
percent.  That is just simply unacceptable.  It’s a national security
issue.  And the President is really here to hear firsthand from the
frontline personnel about what they’re facing and what they need to do
their jobs more effectively and keep us all — keep our — our border
secure.  
   
Q    And one more, if I may.  Can —  
   
 AIDE:  Can we just have you move forward because there’s a bunch of
people who wanted to use the restroom right here.   
   
MS. DALTON:  Oh, I’m so sorry.  Can we just move —   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Can you give any preview of Prime Minister Meloni’s visit to the
White House tomorrow?  And also, what — you know — you know, when the
President has these meetings and conversations with people like Prime
Minister Meloni and Chancellor Scholz, what kind of — what can you say
about the U.S. credibility beyond the fact that Republicans are holding
up aid on Capitol Hill, when you do see Russian advances into Ukraine
and Ukraine is badly outgunned and really need all these equipment?  I
mean, what — beyond blaming Capitol Hill, like, what is — what can you
do to shore up U.S. credibility?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Well, look, the President has continued to aggressively
make the case for Congress to patch — to pass the national security
supplemental.  That is — that is literally the only avenue through which
we can provide Ukraine with the resources, the ammunition, the weaponry
that they need to defend themselves against Russia’s aggression.   
   
There’s no substitute for it.  There’s just no substitute for it. 
There’s no mistaking that.  It’s — it’s a clear message the President
has continued to send.  It’s a bipartisan message shared by many members
across Capitol Hill.   
   
And so, you know, we’re going to continue to press Congress to act. 
Every day that we do not pass the supplemental is a good day for Russia
and a bad day for Ukraine.  And we can’t let that stand.   
   
Q    Can seized assets fill this gap at all?   
   
MS. DALTON:  Like I said —  
   
Q    Seized Russian assets, obviously.  
   
MS. DALTON:  — there’s — there’s no substitute for — for our ability to
provide immediate resources through the national security supplemental
to provide Ukraine with the weapons and ammunition that they need, like,
right now.  So, this is an urgent matter.  It becomes more urgent by the
day for the people of Ukraine.   
   
 And we’re already seeing the impact of — of this lapse.  And we need to
see Congress move immediately to put the national security supplemental
on the President’s desk, and he’ll sign it.   
   
Q    Do you have a sense of, like, the lag time between any bill being
passed and actual munitions reaching Ukraine?  You’ve got to make this
stuff —  
   
MS. DALTON:  I don’t have a —  
   
Q    — before you send it.  
   
MS. DALTON:  Yeah.  I don’t have a — sort of a precise timeline for
you.  All I can say is that we’ll move Heaven and Earth to get that
assistance quickly out the door as soon as Congress sends a bill to the
President’s desk.   
   
Q    Olivia, you blamed President Trump for the blockage or the
derailing of the border compromise.  Do you think that given that there
is broad bipartisan support for Ukraine funding, does the President
believe that the former President is a big part of why the Speaker has
refused to bring the supplemental package to the floor?  
   
 MS. DALTON:  I — I can’t provide a portal into those conversations. 
But look, there was a clean — there was a — there was clean support for
Ukraine and Israel on the table and the House didn’t act.  So, you’ll
have to ask them why they didn’t move on that.   
   
But our message has been unmistakable and clear.  We have sought the
resources to — to secure the border.  We’ve sought the resources to
equip Ukraine to defend itself, sought the resources for Israel to — to
defend itself against an exis- — an existential terrorist threat from
Hamas.  And we are meeting inexplicably with continued resistance from
the House Republicans.   
   
 And, you know, throughout this process, we’ve bent over backwards to
try to extend in good faith a hand across the aisle.  It’s — it’s hard
to explain.   
   
Senate Republicans are working with us.   
   
So, look, I can’t — I can’t, again, provide a portal into the thinking
of House Republicans right now.  But it’s obviously having a
demonstrable impact on not just our national security but the security
of partners and allies around the world.  
   
Q    Does the administration support a discharge petition to get this
supplemental on the floor of the House for an up-or-down vote?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, we always leave the mechanics of these congressional
processes up to leadership in the House and the Senate, so, I won’t
weigh in on particular procedures.   
   
What we think is important is that this legislation get to the
President’s desk immediately, and then he’ll sign it.   
   
Q    Does the President expect to learn anything new today when he hears
from border personnel?  Anything that might move the bill along or —  
   
MS. DALTON:  I think he’ll — I think he’s likely to hear in vivid detail
what it’s meant that Border Patrol has re- — you know, staffing has
remained flat; that, you know, asylum judges are — are just, you know,
facing incredible backlogs; that ICE detention centers are well over
capacity.   
   
 I think he’ll hear directly on the ground from people who are on the
front lines trying to secure our border without the resources they need
to do their jobs.  And having those stories and hearing those stories
and taking them back to Washington will be an important part of his
ability to tell the Ameri- — American people who is responsible for
holding up this critical assistance.  
   
Q    Just on Israel and Gaza.  The President told Seth Meyers on Monday
that he’s concerned that Israel is starting to lose support on the
international stage.  Does the event overnight sort of increase those
fears among the administration?  And will he convey that to the Prime
Minister?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Well, I can’t speak for other countries, but I can say that
the President and the administration — certainly, we’ve expressed our
concerns about civilian casualties in Gaza, the mounting humanitarian
crisis there, the need to surge resources into Gaza to address the
extreme civilian harms that are occurring there.  He’s been unequivocal
about that.  The administration — everybody in administration has been
unequivocal about that and as — you know, we’ve continued to communicate
our concerns directly to Israel as recently as this morning in the wake
of this tragic event.  
   
Q    But if communicating those concerns hasn’t moved the needle, is
there any talk of withholding aid or changing the aid to Israel?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Look, Israel is also a sovereign nation that makes their
sovereign decisions.  We are vocal about our concerns.  And I think, you
know, it’s also important to bear in mind that they’re a — a close
ally.  They’ll remain a close ally.  They are in the throes of an
existential — battling an existential crisis — an existential threat to
their existence from Hamas.  And we’re going to continue to support them
in that process, even as we continue to make very, very, very clear our
concerns about how this milit- — how these military operations are
prosecuted and our concerns that civilian life be protected at — at
every turn.  
   
Q    Olivia, the administration often takes positions on Supreme Court
cases.  They file amicus briefs.  There is a Supreme Court case
involving President Biden’s predecessor involving presidential immunity
that will be heard by the Supreme Court the week of April the 22nd. 
Will the administration file an amicus brief on either side concerning
that case?  
   
MS. DALTON:  We’re not going to comment on the legal process here.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. DALTON:  All right.  See you all on the ground.  
   
Q    Thank you, Olivia.  
   
2:03 P.M. EST
