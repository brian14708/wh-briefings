11:57 A.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  Hello, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining today’s
on-the-record news of day gaggle with White House National Security
Communications Advisor John Kirby.  This call is on the record, and
there’s no embargo.   
   
I’ll turn it over to Kirby now to kick us off, and then we’ll take your
questions.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Eduardo.  Thanks, everybody.   
   
As you all know, tomorrow is the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine.  And as you all heard, the President marked that anniversary
in a statement, and in remarks just now, as we mourn the many Ukrainian
lives who have been lost in this terrible conflict and to express our
resolve to continue to support the people of Ukraine as they defend
themselves against this vicious and brutal war Russia started in
Ukraine.   
   
As the President said, Vladimir Putin launched the invasion.  He thought
he could easily bend the will and break the resolve of a free people and
that he could just roll right into a sovereign nation and the world
would roll right on over.  
   
But two years later, it’s clear that Mr. Putin was absolutely wrong. 
The Ukrainian people, with support from the United States and more than
50 other countries around the world as part of a global coalition that
we actually built, have resisted Putin’s invasion.  They won the battles
for Kyiv, for Kharkiv, for Kherson.  They retook more than 50 percent of
the sovereign territory that Russia seized from them in 2022.  And they
are continuing to fight bravely right on the battlefield there, from
east to the south.  
   
But they are being forced to ration ammunition and equipment because
Congress has failed to act and provide them with resources that they
need to continue this fight.  
   
The President has talked about what’s at stake.  The American people and
people around the world understand also what’s at stake.  We need the
House of Representatives to act.  The President’s commitment to
supporting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable is absolutely clear.  
   
And at his direction, also today, the United States announced a
significant set of new actions to hold Russia accountable for the death
of Aleksey Navalny and to mark the two-year anniversary tomorrow of
Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful invasion of Ukraine.   
   
We sanctioned over 500 targets to impose additional costs for Russia’s
repression, for their human rights abuses, and, of course, for their
aggression inside Ukraine.  These include a major cog in Russia’s
financial infrastructure; more than two dozen third-country sanctions
evaders in Europe, East Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East; and
hundreds of entities in Russia’s military industrial base and other key
sectors to cut off funding for Putin’s war machine.   
   
The Department of State, I think as you all know, is also designating
three Russian individuals who are connected to Navalny’s imprisonment
and the Russian government’s harsh treatment of him.  
   
You can expect more from the administration with respect to holding the
Kremlin accountable for Mr. Navalny’s death.  Today was just the
start.   
   
The Department of Commerce is, of course, also adding more than 90
companies to the entity list for their activities in support of Russia’s
defense industrial base and war effort.   
   
So, all told, the Department of Treasury and the Department of State
have designated now more than 4,000 entities and individuals pursuant to
Russia’s related sanctions authorities over the last two years, the
strongest set of sanctions ever imposed on a major economy.  With
today’s actions, Commerce has now placed more than 900 parties on our
entity list for their role in Putin’s war.  Our actions to ensure Mr.
Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and
repression at home are actually having an impact.  And we will continue
to act.  
   
We urge, of course, the House Republicans to do the same.  They must
come back from this recess, vote — because we know if they put it on the
floor to vote, it will pass — vote on the supplemental funding so that
we can get the artillery shells, we can get the small arms ammunition,
we can get the air defense capabilities into the hands of Ukrainian
battlefield commanders and soldiers on the front so that they can
continue to defend their country.  
   
And with that, I’ll take questions.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Our first question will go to the line of Aamer
Madhani.  You should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hi there, John and Eduardo.  Question on Israel.  Is the
administration comfortable with the vision that Netanyahu has set out
for post-war Gaza?  Does it meet the administration’s basic standards
for setting the grounds for a viable long-term peace?  
   
And then secondly, also on Israel, does the administration have any
reaction to Israel’s plans to move forward with more than 3,000
settlement homes in the West Bank?  Thank you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Aamer.  On the first question about the
post-conflict plan for Gaza, we’ve seen the reports.  I’m going to defer
to Israel to speak to the specificity of these plans.   
   
What I can speak to is our views, and we’ve been clear about what our
views are.  We have had constructive discussions with the Israelis on
all these issues over recent weeks, where we have, of course, continued
to make clear positions, including where those views and our positions
diverge from them.  Both Israelis and Palestinians have a right to be
secure with equal measures of freedom and dignity.   
   
And again, let me just reiterate some of the top points here.   
   
We believe that whatever post-conflict Gaza looks like, the Palestinian
people should have a voice and a vote in what that looks like, through a
revitalized Palestinian Authority.  We don’t believe in any reduction of
the size of Gaza.  We don’t believe and will continue to be very vocal
about the fact that we don’t want to see any forcible displacement of
Palestinians outside Gaza.   
   
And, of course, we don’t want to see Gaza dominated or rolled or
governed over by Hamas.   
   
Those are very consistent positions.  We still hold to them.  And as I
said earlier, we’ve made that consistently clear with our Israeli
counterparts.   
   
On your question about settlements — again, seen those reports and,
frankly, disappointed in the announcement.  It’s been longstanding U.S.
policy under both Republican and Democratic administrations that new
settlements are counterproductive to the cause of peace.  Frankly,
they’re also inconsistent with international law.  And this
administration maintains this firm opposition — our firm opposition to
settlement expansion.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Our next question will go to the line of Barak
Ravid.  You should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thank you, Eduardo.  Thanks, John.  I want to follow up on the
previous question, your previous answer that you just said, as Secretary
Blinken also said a few minutes ago, that the administration sees
settlements as inconsistent with international law.   
   
The previous administration, and especially previous Secretary of State
Pompeo, said that the U.S. position is that settlements are not illegal,
per se, and a shift at U.S. policy from 1978.  Does your statement right
now mean that the Biden administration has overturned this Pompeo
doctrine and that it’s not valid and not U.S. policy anymore?  
   
The second question: If you have any updates for us about the Paris
summit and the hostage negotiations.  Thank you.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Barak.  Look, this isn’t about the previous
administration.  We are simply reaffirming the fundamental conclusion
that these settlements are inconsistent with international law.   
   
And as I said in my previous answer, I mean, that is a position that’s
been consistent over a range of Republican and Democratic
administrations.  If there’s an administration that is being
inconsistent, it was the previous one.   
   
And then on your question, I don’t really have an update on the hostage
deal negotiations and the talks that are happening in Paris, except to
say we continue to work at this very, very hard.  We believe that the
discussions and negotiations to date have been constructive.  Obviously,
they have not been — they have not been conclusive because we don’t have
a deal in place.   
   
But the fact that these negotiations are still ongoing and that people
are, in fact, sitting together to try to hash it out is a good thing. 
And we’re obviously very hopeful that we can come to closure on a deal
that would allow for an extended pause; get all the hostages out over
time, in stages; and then, of course, be able to increase humanitarian
assistance.   
   
So I really don’t have much more to add to that.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Our next question will go to the line of Nandita
Bose.  You should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thank you, Eduardo.  Appreciate it.  Couple of questions from me,
just on the sanctions.  It does not look as if you used the December
executive order to target foreign financial firms that helped Russia
circumvent sanctions.  Can you explain the decision not to target these
foreign financial firms in this action?  I mean, is this something that
we should expect to see soon?  
   
And then my second question is: Has the President been briefed by Brett
McGurk yet?  Could you tell us a little bit more about what’s going on
on his trip?  Thank you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, on your first question, I think it’s critical that we
remember to put it in some perspective.  We would need additional legal
authorities to be able to do that.  We continue to be supportive of
having those domestic legislative authorities that would give us the
flexibility as we continue to discuss with partners and allies how best
to cease Russia’s aggression and to assure that Russia pays for the
damage that it’s caused to Ukraine.   
   
It is something, as I think you heard from the Deputy Secretary of the
Treasury today, that it’s something that we continue to be in touch with
on the Hill and with our allies and partners.  There’s several key —
several pieces of legislation that have been working their way through
Congress; we’re watching that closely.   
   
And because the vast majority of the immobilized sovereign assets aren’t
in the U.S., again, I want to stress it’s absolutely key that we take
action in concert with our international partners.  And that’s our focus
right now.   
   
And then, on a readout from Brett’s trip, as I’m sitting here talking to
you, I’m not aware that Brett has provided a full readout of his
meetings.  I know they’ve wrapped up.  As I said yesterday, he met with
leaders in Egypt, particularly on the intel side, and, of course, with
the war cabinet, with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with Defense Minister
Gallant, with Benny Gantz, and, of course, had a chance to meet with the
families of American hostages in Israel yesterday.  But I’m not aware
that we’ve received a full readout.  
   
Obviously, we always appreciate the opportunity to have those in-person
discussions with our counterparts in the region on a range of issues. 
And first and foremost, Brett was over there really trying to make more
progress on this hostage deal, but he also had a chance to talk to them
about their plans and their thinking for operations down in the south
near Rafah.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question, we’ll go to the line of
Patsy.  You should be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thanks, Eduardo.  And thanks, Kirby.  I have two questions on
Gaza.  I know that you said that Brett has not given a readout yet, but
I wonder if the issue of the post-war plans from Netanyahu was discussed
in their meetings.  And what do you make of the fact that it was
released just as Brett was in the region?  
   
And then, another one.  How does the administration feel about Netanyahu
using Ramadan as a deadline for the Rafah offensive?  As you — sorry,
I’m just running out of breath.  As you would understand, it is received
by the Muslim world as inflammatory.   
   
And then, once you’re done with that, I have a question on China.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Okay, well, there’s an awful lot there.   
   
I mean, again, I don’t have more to say about Brett’s trip than what
I’ve already told you.  I mean, I think we should wait to talk to Brett
when he gets back and to get a fuller sense of his discussions.  There
hasn’t been too many conversations we’ve had with the Israelis where we
haven’t talked about post-conflict Gaza and what that looks like.  But
again, I can’t go into more detail without having a chance to talk to
Brett myself on that.   
   
I’ll let the Israelis speak to their plans and intentions to conduct
military operations in Rafah.  Again, there’s been no plan presented to
us that I’m tracking.  And as of yesterday, I think that that was still
accurate based on the preliminary discussions we were able to have with
Brett in the region.   
   
So no plan presented for us to look at that I’m aware of in terms of
Rafah operations.  And so, therefore, I think, again, I would refer you
to the Israelis to speak to whatever deadlines they’re setting here.   
   
I think it’s important to reiterate what I’ve said so many times and
including yesterday: We still would not support operations in Rafah no
matter what the timescale is.  We wouldn’t support those kinds of
operations unless or until the Israelis had properly accounted for the
safety and security of the more than 1 million people that are seeking
refuge down there.   
   
And again, I’m certainly not aware of any plan that we’ve had a chance
to look at and to peruse.  So, again, I put you back to the Israelis to
speak to that.   
   
Q    Thank you.  And on China, there’s this Five Eyes report that shows
that Chinese hackers are potentially already inside critical U.S.
infrastructure.  I think we discussed this about the telecommunication
outage yesterday — we discussed in your gaggle yesterday.  At this
point, are you 100 percent confident that that outage was not part of a
Chinese hacking operation or any other adversarial powers?  And does the
administration have a plan should another incident like that — similar
incident conducted by a foreign adversary?  Thanks.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The best we know right now, Patsy, is what we’re hearing
from the network industry, particularly AT&T, and that they do not
believe — they’ve said they don’t believe that this was the result of
some sort of cybersecurity incident.   
   
That said, it’s still being investigated, so we need to let the
investigators do their work.  We’ve obviously pledged support to that
investigation as appropriate.  But right now, the initial indications
coming from industry itself is that this was not a cybersecurity
incident.  
   
MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to the line of Jake Epstein.  You should
be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hey, thanks for doing this.  I just want to ask a question about
the Houthis.  The U.S. Navy preemptive strikes have really become a
daily thing.  We’ve also seen a few interceptions of Iranian weaponry
bound for Yemen.  Are you able to speak at all about how much of the
Houthi capabilities remain and how often they’re being resupplied?  Is
there any intelligence or indication of, you know, how long this might
go on for?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Not a whole lot of information on the intelligence that I’m
able to offer you here on that one.  And I certainly would, at the
outset, point you to DOD to speak to what we call battle damage
assessment.  And they give you a sense of what their assessment is of
how much the capability has been degraded.   
   
That said, broadly speaking, we do know that the strikes that they have
conducted inside Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen have had an impact on
degrading capabilities.   
   
While it is certainly true that Houthi attacks continue, what you’re not
seeing lately have been those major swarm attacks where, you know,
multiple waves of drones and missiles are being shot at multiple ships. 
Typically, what you’re seeing now are more one-off attacks, and they
have continued to be largely ineffective in terms of stopping ships on
their way to prior destinations.   
   
That doesn’t mean that they aren’t still dangerous.  It doesn’t mean
that they haven’t scored a hit here now and then.  Of course, they did
just the other day; they hit a ship that was ironically bound for Aden
to bring grain to the people of Yemen.  And even that attack, which did
score a hit on the ship, didn’t stop that ship from still pulling into
Yemen and dropping off food for the Yemeni people.   
   
So they’re still dangerous, absolutely.  And we’re taking it seriously. 
But we do believe that we have had an impact on not just the degradation
of their capabilities, but the way in which they’re using the
capabilities they have available to them.  They are not, again,
conducting the major sort of drone swarm attacks that they were able to
do in the past.  
   
As for the flow, we still believe that they continue to be supported by
the regime in Tehran, that materials, weapons systems are still being
supplied.   
   
As you also know, we have been and continue to conduct interdiction
operations at sea, and those continue.  
   
So we’ll obviously do everything we can to try to limit and stem that
flow, but the flow is ongoing — which is all the more reason why, again,
that we need Congress to act and pass the supplemental funding.   
   
In that supplemental funding there’s about two and a half billion
dollars for CENTCOM, deliberately set aside for U.S. Central Command, to
restock its own inventory of weapons ammunition and to provide the kinds
of funding that they need to support their many activities at sea and on
the ground — frankly, in the air — in the regions.  And part of that
would go a long way to helping us continue to stem these Houthi
attacks.  
   
MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to the line of DJ Judd.  You should be
able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hi, this is Priscilla on DJ’s phone.  So, two quick questions.  One
on Ukraine.  The President said today in his remarks before governors
that top U.S. ally — that he would have a call with top U.S. allies on
Ukraine.  What assurances, if any, can he give them in trying — as he
himself is trying to get that additional funding from Congress?  
   
And then separately, on Israel, the Prime Minister sort of unveiled a
plan for the day after in Gaza.  It didn’t appear to include the
two-state solution.  So is it a nonstarter already for the White
House?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t get ahead of the President.  You heard him talk
about this conversation he’s going to have with G7 leaders later today. 
And we’ll certainly be able to share more of that with you when it
occurs.   
   
He will absolutely make it clear that he’s going to continue to do
everything he can to support Ukraine, and that that includes doing
everything he can and our team can do to work with members of Congress
to get that supplemental funding on the floor, get it voted, get it to
his desk.  Because if it reaches his desk as it currently stands, as he
said, he’ll sign it.   
   
He cannot control what the Speaker does or doesn’t do.  But we can
certainly continue to do everything we can to make clear how important
this is, as we’ve been doing just today, and continue to do everything
we can to work with members of Congress to move it along.  And that will
be his message to his G7 partners — how seriously we take the challenge,
how much we know American leadership matters, and how far he’s working
to get that supplemental bill passed and on his desk.   
   
On your second question, again, I would refer to the Israeli government
to speak to those post-conflict Gaza plans.  All I can do is reiterate
what I said before: We’ve been very clear, we’ve been very consistent
with our Israeli counterparts about what we believe post-conflict Gaza
needs to look like.  And those views haven’t changed.  I described them
for you a little bit earlier in the gaggle; I won’t repeat that.  But
those are all still valid, in our view.   
   
And we are not going to be bashful about holding to those views, and
certainly not going to be bashful about expressing them continually with
our Israeli counterparts on the things we agree on, which is Hamas
cannot govern Gaza, and the things where we diverge.   
   
And the last thing I’ll say is: On the two-state solution — you’re
right, they didn’t say anything — there wasn’t anything in the public
rendering of that plan about the two-state solution.  But the President
remains fully committed to the promise and the possibility of a
two-state solution and how that can benefit the entire region, certainly
with Israeli security guaranteed.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Next up, we’ll go to Jacqui Heinrich.  You should
be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Thanks, guys.  On these sanctions, why not just go forward and
designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything to add in terms of what we haven’t
done, Jacqui.  I’d ask you to take a look at what we have done — you
know, over 4,000 entities sanctioned, more than 500 just today, and
there’s more coming.  We’ll continue to hold Russia accountable.   
   
What we do is we make decisions based on what we think will actually
have the right impact and an impact on their ability to continue to fund
their war machine and work it.  And we know that it’s had an effect.  I
mean, my goodness, Mr. Putin is reaching out to Iran now for potentially
close-range ballistic missiles, and he’s been reaching out to North
Korea for artillery shells and for ballistic missiles as well.  So we
know that these sanctions have had an impact on his ability to conduct
military operations.   
   
And what we’re focused on are tools and techniques that we believe
actually will have an impact on his economy and on his ability to
conduct a war, as well as making sure that whatever we do doesn’t
unnecessarily make it hard for humanitarian purposes for the Russian
people themselves.  
   
MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to the line of Halley Toosi.  You should
be able to unmute yourself.  
   
Q    Hi, John, everyone.  Thanks for doing this.  Listen, I’m just going
to ask you to be very frank and maybe set aside your talking points for
a minute on this Israel stuff.   
   
Why should the Israelis care about what the United States keeps saying? 
They don’t really seem to be feeling the pressure from your rhetoric. 
And I realize that you’re putting these sanctions and making some moves
related to the West Bank, including this — you know, saying now that the
settlements are illegal — but isn’t that, like, three years late under
this administration?  I mean, extremist violence by settlers in the West
Bank has been going on for a long time; settlements have been around for
a long time.   
   
Why didn’t you guys do this three years ago?  And couldn’t that — if you
had acted sooner, couldn’t that have maybe affected the dynamics between
the administration and the Israeli government right now, maybe even
affected the dynamics of Israeli politics right now to where you
wouldn’t have far-right figures in the government to deal with who
clearly have so much influence over the government?  
   
So, I guess I’m just trying to figure out, like, if I’m Benjamin
Netanyahu right now, why should I care what John Kirby or Secretary
Blinken or President Biden keep saying to me?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think — I guess I’m going to challenge the premise of the
question just a little bit.  I think the Israeli people absolutely do
care about the support of the United States.  I think they absolutely do
care about the leadership President Biden has shown and a strong way
that we —  
   
Q    I’m talking about the Israeli government, not the Israeli people.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Listen, you asked a really long question, so you’re going to
have to give me a little latitude to give you a really long answer.  You
said you didn’t want to listen to my talking points, so I’m going to try
to do the best I can here, but you got to let me finish.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think they do care.  I think they do care about what the
United States thinks and does.  And I said it — I think they do care,
and they value and they appreciate the leadership that President Biden
and this administration have shown when it comes to supporting them in
what is truly a right and a responsibility to rid themselves of the
threat of Hamas.   
   
I think they also are smart enough to appreciate — and it goes to the
government too — smart enough to appreciate that we’re not going to
agree with them on every single thing.  We’ve been talking quite a bit
here today about things we don’t agree with them on.  We don’t agree
about the issue of settlements.  We clearly have differences on what the
future of post-conflict Gaza needs to look like.  And, yes, there have
been differences over the promise and the possibility of a two-state
solution.   
   
But that doesn’t mean that you just clam up and stop talking about it. 
It doesn’t mean you just put yourself in a shell and don’t engage with
them in meaningful conversations.   
   
And this idea — and I’ve heard it time and time and time again since
October 7th — that we’re being ignored or Israel is just walking all
over us, or they’re not paying attention to anything that we’re having
to say — and I’m telling you, that’s just not the truth.  It just ain’t
so.   
   
Now, that doesn’t mean that every single bit of advice and every single
perspective we share with them they act on in the way that we would want
them to.  There are obvious ways where — we want to see, for instance, a
much stronger, devoted effort to reduce civilian casualties.  There have
been too many innocent people killed in this conflict.  And too many —
obviously, the great majority of those innocents killed have been
Palestinians.  And we have been very, very consistent about that.   
   
It doesn’t mean that we’re going to agree with the results.  But I can
assure you that we do have the ability to share with them our
perspectives and that they have in the past acted in ways consistent
with how we have asked them to act — again, not in every way, not in
every sense, and maybe not to the degree that we want, but they have. 
And I think they appreciate the good faith in which, and the good
intentions with which, our perspectives and our support is being shared
with them.   
   
So I just push back on the premise that we’re talking to a brick wall. 
We’re talking to a friend — a friend, as any friend, you can be honest
with, who’s not going to agree with everything that we say.  But the
President’s — we believe the President’s approach has had an impact, and
we’re going to continue to do that in that way.   
   
Now, look, as to why now after three years, we thought that at this
moment it was particularly important to reaffirm our commitment to a
two-state solution.  And at this moment, we felt it was particularly
important to reaffirm, again, our view of the inconsistency with
international law that these settlements present.   
   
And again, we also think that, at this moment, it’s particularly
important to work together to build a political horizon for both
Israelis and for Palestinians.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’re coming up at time, so we’ve got time for
one more.  We’ll go to the line of Tommy Christopher.  You should be
able to unmute yourself  
   
Q    Hey, thanks for doing this, Kirby.  The thing I wanted to ask about
is this — I don’t know if you guys have seen it; I’m sure you have —
seen this sort of stunning filing for detention for Alexander Smirnov. 
And there’s a lot of really, like, crazy allegations in there that he
had contact with the leader of an assassination squad.  Have you guys
seen the filing?  And are you perusing it for — are you concerned about
any of this stuff, any of the security risks?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I have not seen the filing.  I don’t know — I can’t speak
for the rest of my NSC colleagues, Tommy.  How about if I take that
question and we’ll have somebody from the team get back to you.  But I’m
not in a position where I can speak intelligently to it.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thanks all.  That’s all the time we have today.  We’ll do
this again soon.  Enjoy the rest of your day.  
   
12:28 P.M. EST
