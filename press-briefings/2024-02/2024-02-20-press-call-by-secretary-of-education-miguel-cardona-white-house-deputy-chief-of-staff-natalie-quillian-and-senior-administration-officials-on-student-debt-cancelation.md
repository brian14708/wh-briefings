  Cancelation"

5:02 P.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  (In progress.) …efforts to cancel student debt.  
   
As a reminder, the contents of this call and the materials you all
received over email are embargoed until 5:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.  We
will share embargoed materials again at the end of this call with those
who RSVP’d.  
   
We will begin with on-the-record remarks from Secretary of Education
Miguel Cardona and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian. 
After their remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer period, which
will be on background and attributable to “senior administration
officials.”  
   
With that, Secretary Cardona, I will turn it over to you.  
   
SECRETARY CARDONA:  Thank you, Angelo.  And thank all of you for being
with us.  
   
From day one of President Biden’s administration, we’ve been fighting to
fix a broken student loan system.  That’s why we launched the most
affordable income-driven repayment plan in history: the SAVE Plan.  
   
This plan reflects our unapologetic commitment to deliver as much relief
as possible to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible. 
And the progress we’re announcing today demonstrates not only that we’re
making good on that commitment, but we’re doing so ahead of schedule.
   
   
In January, we announced that we’d be implementing a special benefit of
the SAVE Plan nearly six months early to automatically forgive the loans
of borrowers who took out smaller loans for college after as few as 10
years of paying back those loans.  Now, I’m excited to announced that
we’ll start automatically forgiving $1.2 billion for over 150,000
borrowers who are eligible.  
   
That brings the total student debt relief approved by this
administration to nearly $138 billion for nearly 3.9 million borrowers. 
These are historic efforts that reflect the President’s commitment,
again, to deliver as much relief as possible to as many borrowers as
possible as quickly as possible.   
   
We also now have 7.5 million Americans enrolled in SAVE.  4.3 million of
them now have monthly payments of zero dollars.  This is truly a
lifeline for borrowers.   
   
The people getting the debt relief announced today have sacrificed and
saved for a decade or more to make their student loan payments, have
lower loan balances, and are more likely to have qualified for Pell
Grants to attend college.  Many SAVE forgiveness recipients come from
lower- and middle-income backgrounds.  Many took out loans to attend
community colleges.  Some were at high risk for delinquency and
default.  That’s why the actions we’re announcing today do matter.   
   
The bottom line is this: We’re providing real, immediate breathing room
from an unacceptable reality where student loan payments compete with
basic needs, like putting food on the table and accessing healthcare.   
   
For borrowers who are not yet at full debt forgiveness, SAVE is still
providing them with real help today.  It already protects more income
from loan payments, and it ensures borrowers won’t have to worry about
runaway interest and exploding loan balances, giving them additional
peace of mind.  
   
It bears repeating: SAVE is already our most affordable income-driven
repayment plan in history.   
   
Student borrowers can sign up today at StudentAid.gov/SAVE.  The
Department will continue to identify borrowers who qualify for debt
forgiveness and discharge loans regularly.  And we’re going to be
emailing borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness if they switch onto
the SAVE Plan.  
   
Look, I’m proud of what we’re doing to fix a broken student loan
system.  And we’re just getting started.  
   
We won’t accept a broken system where too many people are locked out of
opportunity, where too many default on their student loans each year,
where cost makes starting and finishing higher education feel
impossible.  We won’t stop fighting to deliver more relief and open
doors of opportunity to more Americans more quickly.  
   
And with that, I’ll turn it over to a colleague at the White House who
is also a staunch supporter of fixing a broken loan sys- — system and
opening up access to higher education, the President’s Deputy Chief of
Staff, Natalie Quillian.  
   
Natalie.  
   
MS. QUILLIAN:  Thank you, Secretary.  And thank you for all of your
leadership.   
   
Thanks, everyone, for being with us this afternoon.  
   
As the Secretary said, this announcement is a reflection of the
President’s commitment to cancel student debt for as many Americans as
possible as quickly as possible.  This announcement will provide
essential breathing room for 153,000 borrowers and their families,
totaling $1.2 billion in student loan debt canceled starting this
week.  
   
When President Biden came into office, he vowed to fix a broken student
loan system and make sure higher education was a pathway to the middle
class, not a barrier to opportunity.  And over the last three years,
President Biden has canceled more student debt than any president in
history.  
   
And through more than two dozen executive actions, this administration
has approved nearly $138 billion in student debt cancelation for nearly
3.9 million Americans.  Those actions include fixing the Public Service
Loan Forgiveness Program so nearly 800,000 nurses, firefighters,
teachers, and more have gotten their debt canceled through the program. 
Before President Biden took office, only 7,000 individuals had ever seen
forgiveness through PSLF.   
   
It also inclu- — includes holding colleges accountable for defrauding
their students and providing relief to over 9- — 930,000 borrowers who
have been in repayment for over 20 years but never got the relief they
earned through income-driven repayment plans.  
   
These actions have allowed nearly 4 million people to afford other
expenses in their lives: buy homes, start businesses, pursue dreams that
they had to put on hold because of their student loans.  Now, because of
the President and the Biden-Harris administration, millions of borrowers
and their families are no longer weighed down by the burden of student
debt.  
   
Last year, as you know, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision
striking down the administration’s original student debt relief plan,
President Biden promised he wouldn’t stop fighting to cancel student
debt for as many borrowers as possible who need help.  That included
pursuing an alternative path for student debt relief through negotiated
rulemaking.  That’s a process which is currently underway.  
   
And it also included implementing the SAVE Plan, the most affordable
repayment plan in history.  And he tasked his team with implementing
this as quickly as possible so as many borrowers as possible could
benefit from the lower monthly payments or from early forgiveness
benefits.  
   
And as Secretary Cardona mentioned, we’re proud that our administration
was able to implement forgiveness for low-balance borrowers enrolled in
the SAVE Plan nearly six months ahead of schedule.  And for these
150,000 borrowers, that’s six months few- — six fewer months they have
to make a monthly student loan payment.  And for many, it may mean six
fewer months they need to make hard decisions between a monthly student
loan payment and other expan- — expenses their families depend on.  
   
Starting tomorrow, these 150,000 borrowers eli- — eligible for early
relief will receive an email from President Biden notifying them that,
in the coming days, their remaining student debt will be canceled
because of his SAVE Plan.  And over the coming months, we will regularly
notify and discharge student debt for borrowers who meet the criteria
for early forgiveness who are enrolled in SAVE.  
   
And tomorrow, President Bilen — Biden will be in Los Angeles, where he
will announce the debt cancelation for these 150,000 borrowers.  Some of
the people in the room include individuals who will benefit from this
forgiveness, as well as borrowers who have had their debt canceled
through other actions this administration has taken, such as fixes to
the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.  
   
President Biden will never stop fighting to deliver relief to as many
borrowers as possible.  And our team will continue to work tirelessly to
make sure Americans across the country are feeling and benefiting from
the President’s actions and policies as quickly as possible.  
   
Thank you, again.  And I’ll turn it back to you, Angelo.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you, Natalie.  And thank you, Secretary.   
   
With that, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. 
As a reminder, this will be on background and attributable to “senior
administration officials.”   
   
Please use the “raise hand” function on Zoom to queue up for questions. 
I will give you all a minute to do that, and then we will take your
questions.  
   
All right.  We will start with Haley Bull.  You should be unmuted now.  
   
Q    Hey.  Thanks for doing this.  I’m just curious, with President
Biden’s remarks tomorrow, if you can give any further preview of the
message he is hoping to convey while out in California, how fine of a
point he will hit on this.  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is \[senior administration
official\].  I can take that.  The President will be underscoring,
again, his firm commitment to delivering student debt relief to as many
borrowers as possible as quickly as possible.  He’ll be describing how
this is — I mean, this additional relief that — that he is announcing
tomorrow is just one in a series of efforts — at this point, more than
25 — or at this point, 25 actions — to address student debt and to
deliver loan forgiveness.  
   
So, this is just one more step in a long, ongoing effort to fix a broken
system and deliver student debt relief for millions of Americans.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We will go to Eliza Haverstock next.  You should
be unmuted now.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks for taking this call.  I just had two quick
clarification questions.  First, does this wave of SAVE relief
incorporate past periods of repayment accounted for by the IDR account
adjustment?  And then, the second: Is there, like, a state — like, an
enrollment cutoff date for borrowers to be enrolled in SL- — in SAVE to
be included in this wave of forgiveness?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, these include months that are
credited due to the IDR account adjustment.  And the borrowers who are
receiving notifications tomorrow were enrolled earlier this year.   
   
As the Secretary mentioned, we’re going to continue to reach out to
borrowers to encourage them to enroll in the SAVE Plan.  This benefit is
just one more reason that the SAVE Plan is the most affordable way to
repay your loans.  And we’ll be continuing to update these discharges
periodically.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We will go to Jeff Mason next.  You should be
unmuted now.  
   
Q    Great.  Thanks very much.  Just a question about where the money
comes from.  Is this — is there a pot of money that was set aside first
for student loan relief or debt forgiveness, or, otherwise, where is —
where does the money come to pay for this?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, Jeff.  At the Department of
Education, we have the authority to administer the student loan
programs, including delivering to students all of the benefits for which
they are eligible.  So, we don’t need an additional appropriation or act
of Congress like — like some of our programs do.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’ll go to Michael Stratford next.  You should
be unmuted now.  
   
Q    Hey.  It’s Michael Stratford at Politico.  I have a question about
these congratulatory emails from the President.  I know you’ve announced
that you’re — you’ve sent those out in relation to past buckets of
student debt relief.  But I’m wondering, can you clarify: Have all 3.9
million borrowers who have received relief under this administration
received those emails from the President at this point?  And is it fair
to say that, going forward, you intend to — to send out those emails
directly from the President to anyone else who — who receives relief?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, Michael.  No, they haven’t gone to
everyone in that 3.9 million.  We do see them as an important way to
communicate with borrowers, to make sure emails get opened, and to raise
the profile of the benefits that we’re offering and encourage more
borrowers to take advantage of them.  
   
And I don’t have a commitment or a policy going forward as to what we’ll
do.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We will go to Ebony McMorris next.  You should
be unmuted now.   
   
Q    Wonderful.  Thank you so much for doing this.  (Inaudible)
question.  One is about the IDR adjustment.  When will the IR — IDR
adjustment — when will that (inaudible) —  
   
MODERATOR:  Ebony, I think we are losing your line.  Do you want to try
one more time?  
   
Q    Can you hear me?  Okay.  
   
MODERATOR:  No, unfortunately, it does not —  
   
Q    — when IDR adjustable — you can hear me?  
   
MODERATOR:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    I think I’m going in and out.  Sorry.  
   
MODERATOR:  Okay.  We — we’ll follow up with you on that question. 
Next, we will go to Cary Barbor.  You should be unmuted now.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Do you have any sort of data, any breakdown on, state
by state, how many borrowers are being relieved in various states?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at that time.  Happy to take a
look, if that’s something we can produce in the — in the coming days.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We will go to Cheyenne Haslett next.  You should
be unmuted now.  
   
Q    Hi, everybody.  Thank you for doing this call.  So, of the 3.9
million people who have been approved for debt relief, can you tell us
how many have received that debt relief and when you expect it to hit at
3.9?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Those are individuals who have all been
identified as eligible for loan relief.  And we’re in the process of
delivering that relief.  In some cases, it takes a little bit longer. 
For example, an individual that is entitled to a refund of past payments
takes a little more time to process to make sure those — those funds
reach them.  
   
I don’t have an update on — on the number of loans that have been
formally discharged at this point.  
   
MODERATOR:  Okay.  We will go to Amanda Fitzpatrick next.  You should be
unmuted now.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you again for taking the call.  When you send the email,
can you kind of walk us through what the email will entail.  I know that
there have been instances with some of the previous emails — not even
just from — from the White House — where it’s spam or people are trying
to take information.  I’ve interviewed people that have also fallen
victim to scams through student loan forgiveness.  Is there something
you could kind of share with our viewers and listeners about what they
should look out for?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I appreciate the question.  We have
worked really hard to make sure that students know the most reliable
information is on StudentAid.gov and, if they see information that they
suspect is fraudulent, to refer that to the FTC.  
   
You know, obviously, this email is coming from the President.  I’m
trying to nail down what address it will be sent from or other
identifying details.  And we can follow up with you on those — on that
information.  
   
MODERATOR:  Yes.  And the — the embargoed copy of the email that will
come from the President should also be in your inbox.  And if it’s not,
I’m definitely happy to follow up with you on that.  
   
Okay.  Our last question will come from Natalia Wilson.  You should be
unmuted now.  
   
Q    Thank you so much for having this today.  I just wanted to ask: As
Black college graduates, on average, have higher student debt than their
white counterparts, how will this SAVE Plan relief benefit Black
graduates — and, even more specifically, HBCU graduates — who, again,
typically have higher student debt?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It’s — you know, it’s true that Black
borrowers are more likely to borrow, they borrow larger amounts, and
they typically struggle to repay.  And making student loan programs more
fair is an important step toward addressing inequities in opportunities
by race in our country.  
   
The SAVE Plan is, for most borrowers, the most affordable way to repay
student loans.  And it’s particularly helpful to people who have larger
debt amounts.  And so, we anticipate it’s going to be a valuable tool
for many Black borrowers and for many alumni of historically Black
colleges and universities to help them afford to repay their student
loans or — or earn loan forgiveness.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  With that, that was all the time we have today. 
As a reminder, the contents of this call are embargoed until 5:00 a.m.
Eastern tomorrow.  
   
Thank you again for joining us.
