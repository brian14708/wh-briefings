Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

11:17 A.M. EST  
   
MR. BATES:  We’re en route to Philadelphia, where the President will
build on his decades-long commitment on behalf of firefighters. 
President Biden will deliver remarks at the announcement event for the
city of Philadelphia receiving a $22.4 million SAFER Grant award.   
   
The President has fought for firefighters and prioritized issues
affecting them throughout his career.  His remarks today will underscore
his unwavering support for the firefighting community and pay tribute to
those killed during the tragic Fairmount rowhouse fire in 2022.   
   
Last night, Mike Bresnan, the leader of IAFF Local 22, who is joining us
today, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that these funds mean President
Biden, quote, “kept his word” to deliver funds that will allow them to
re-establish the firehouse that could have responded the most rapidly to
the tragic Fairmount fire.   
   
Also, today marks a milestone for our implementation of the CHIPS and
Science Act, as the Department of Commerce announced its first
preliminary agreement with BAEs — BAE Systems, Incorporated, for a CHIPS
Incentive award of approximately $35 million.   
   
Today’s announcement is the first step of many to come.   
   
Over the coming year, Commerce is going to award billions more to make
sure semiconductors are made in America, to invest in research and
development capabilities, to keep us at the forefront of new
technologies, to strengthen our national security, and keep bringing
good-paying manufacturing jobs back to America.   
   
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mr. Kirby.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Andrew.  So, tomorrow, as you know, the President is
welcoming President Zelenskyy to the White House for a series of
discussions.  And I believe President Zelenskyy will be doing some —
(coughs) — excuse me — some other meetings in town with some key
officials.  
   
We’re looking forward to this visit.  It’s a chance for the President to
get an update from President Zelenskyy about how things are going on the
battlefront, but also to make it very clear to President Zelenskyy and
the Ukrainian people that we’re going to continue to support them,
particularly at this very difficult time.  
   
As winter approaches, we’re seeing now increased missile and drone
attacks by the Russian Armed Forces against civilian infrastructure.  We
expect that that will continue, particularly against energy
infrastructure and as the Russian forces continue to try to take
offensive action against the Ukrainians all along that front, but
particularly in the East.   
   
And obviously, the other — the other bit of context here is, of course,
the — the negotiations on Capitol Hill about funding the President’s
supplemental request.  I think you’ll hear more from the President
tomorrow in — in that context, but he’ll continue to make clear his —
his case for why additional funding for Ukraine and Israel are vital to
our own national security interests at this time.   
   
And he’ll — he’ll keep urging the negotiations forward and urging
compromise, where — with the goal of getting these — all these national
security issues fully funded as — as we need.  They’re all urgent. 
They’re all — they’re all important.   
   
Now, just quickly, yesterday marked Human Rights Day, the start of Human
Rights Week and the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.  And obviously, we remain committed to working together
towards a freer and more just world for everybody.   
   
On Friday, the United States took action to promote accountability for
human rights abuses and violations by imposing visa restrictions and
sanctions on 37 individuals and 13 countries.  We’re obviously going to
do — continue to take these sorts of actions to hold people properly
accountable for the way they treat each other and their own population
and the population of other — of other nations.   
   
So, with that, I’ll take some.  
   
Q    John, can you talk about the decision to invite President Zelenskyy
at this moment?  Did President Zelenskyy request to come to D.C. to
lobby for the supplemental?  Did President Biden invite him?  What are
you hoping that this — this visit kind of makes a difference in this at
this moment?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  This was an invitation by President Biden.  And, again, I
think it comes at a critical time.  This is exactly the right time to be
having President Zelenskyy in town to have these discussions.   
   
Because of what’s going on in Ukraine, the increased activity we’re
seeing by the Russian Armed Forces as winter approaches, but also what’s
going on on Capitol Hill and the argument that the President is going to
be making with all of you tomorrow about the need to fund this
supplemental.   
   
Q    Kirby, what will —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  But he came at the President’s invitation.   
   
Q    What will the President tell Zelenskyy about the supplemental aid? 
I mean, he can’t really promise that it’s coming for sure, right?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think, without getting ahead of the President, I can
assure you that — that he will make it clear to President Zelenskyy that
we’re standing firm on this supplemental request.  We absolutely need to
get additional funding to support Ukraine going forward.  
   
Now, and he’ll also talk to him about the approach that him and his team
has taken on Capitol Hill, but I don’t want to get further afield than
that.   
   
Q    Will we have a new weapons package?  I know you just had one last
week.  Will you have another one to announce, do you think?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, again, I don’t want to get too far ahead of the
President.  But as you know, Steve, we don’t have too many more weeks
left in this year to be able to provide security assistance.  So, I
would fully expect that you’re going to see us announce additional
security assistance before the end of the month.   
   
Q    Kirby, there’s the new reporting that Israel used U.S.-supplied
white phosphorus munitions in an October attack in southern Lebanon. 
Some rights groups are saying that it should be investigated as a war
crime.  Does the U.S. have any comment on that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’ve seen the reports.  Certainly concerned about that. 
We’ll be asking questions to try to learn a little bit more.  
   
I do think it’s important to remind that white ph- — phosphorus does
have a legitimate military utility in terms of illumination and
producing smoke to conceal movements.   
   
And obviously, anytime that we provide items like white phosphorus to
another military, it is with the full expectation that it will be used
in keeping with those legitimate purposes and — and in keeping with the
law of armed conflict.   
   
But we’ve seen these reports.  They’re — they’re fresh.  Just don’t have
any more on it right now.   
   
Q    Just to follow up.  Obviously, that is something that occurred in
Lebanon.  Is the U.S. concerned about this conflict spiraling out and
involving more countries and more fronts beyond where it is right now?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We absolutely don’t want to see this conflict spill over
into Lebanon.  We don’t want to see a second front.  We don’t want to
see it escalate and widen.   
   
And so, it is also in the context of that that we’re — we’re concerned
about these reports.   
   
Q    John —  
   
Q    Are you all —  
   
Q    — and so, the UAE and other nations are really pushing for another
ceasefire in — in the war right now.  Can you kind of tell us a little
bit about what the U.S. is doing at this point to communicate to Israel
what you’re interested in as far as seeing another temporary pause?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, so, big dif- — you know, a difference between a
ceasefire and humanitarian pause.  We still don’t support a general
ceasefire here.  That leaves Hamas in control of Gaza.  But we
absolutely do support additional humanitarian pauses.  
   
And we are in active — and when I say “active,” I mean daily
conversations with our partners in the region, from the Arab states as
well as in Israel — about the likelihood of getting humanitarian pauses
back in place.   
   
Don’t have any progress to report today, but it is an active issue of
discussion and conversation with our — with our partners.  We think it’s
still valuable.   
   
Now, I will say that even — even absent a humanitarian pause — and,
again, we want to get one back because we want to get those hostages out
— we are still working with the Israelis to get humanitarian assistance
in.  And there was a big backlog of trucks over the weekend that are —
that have started to flow in now.   
   
It looks like Kerem Shalom will be — will be available for additional
humanitarian assistance convoys in the near future.  That’s a good
thing.   
   
So, even without the pause, we haven’t let up off — off the gas in terms
of the humanitarian assistance.   
   
Q    Is the White House in touch with Alexei Navalny’s team?  And are
you all concerned about his disappearance?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re deeply concerned about these reports that he’s now
been gone for, allegedly, a week and neither his representatives or his
family know where he is.  He should be released immediately.  He should
never have been jailed in the first place.  
   
And we’re going to work with our — with our embassy in Moscow to see how
much more we can find out.  
   
Q    Kirby, just one more.  Can you confirm that Jake Sullivan is
traveling to Israel this week to meet with officials there?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything on Jake’s calendar to — to speak to
today.  But — but, you know, if — if and when we get to a point where we
can talk about it, we will.  
   
Q    Taiwan —  
   
Q    Could you —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  One thing I’d say, though: There’s a — look, you have seen
repeated visits by senior offic- — officials from the administration to
the region since October 7th.  I would fully expect that you’re going to
continue to see that.  
   
Q    John, on China.  Taiwan has arrested two service members for trying
to share sensitive U.S. helicopter tools with China.  Is that something
that concerns you?  What are you doing to prevent China from getting
access to sensitive technology like this?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I haven’t seen those report, so let me take that question
and get back to you.  Obviously, we take our operational security and
classified information, the capabilities our mili- — military systems
very, very seriously.   
   
But I’ll have to take — I’ll have to take that question.  
   
Q    Have you had time to re- — have you had time to review the Section
702 legislation that was introduced?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, so, there’s two things moving forward here on Capitol
Hill which are important to watch this week.  There’s one bill proposed
by the House Intelligence Committee which fully reauthorizes 702.  We
think that’s important.  702 is critical to our national security. 
Going after Zawahiri, the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack — all of those
were — our response was aided by access to 702 information.  So, there’s
some reforms in the House Intelligence Committee proposal that we think
will be difficult to get to, but — but, in general, it reauthorizes
it.  
   
There’s another one in the House Judiciary Committee that basically guts
it and would really be damaging to our national security.   
   
And so, we urge members of Congress, if you’re going to move forward
this week, move forward on the one proposed by the House Intelligence
Committee.  
   
Q    On the F-16 that crashed into the Yellow Sea —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — near South Korea.  Any update on that for us?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know much more than you do.  I mean, the Pentagon
has already spoken to this.  Apparently, the pilot ejected and is in
reportedly good condition.  That’s a good thing.   
   
I don’t know what the cause of the mishap was.  
   
Q    Can I —  
   
Q    I think the ground is coming up pretty soon.  So, Andrew, if we
(inaudible) — a couple questions for you, too.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you, John.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  You guys done with me?  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    See you soon.   
   
Q    Thanks, John.  
   
Q    Andrew, any comment on things moving forward with a potential
impeachment inquiry of the President?  And, also, does the White House
believe that the President’s son, Hunter, should testify this week?  
   
MR. BATES:  I am not going to weigh in on that process except to say
that President Biden is laser- — laser-focused on the issues that matter
most to American families.  You see him today getting ready to deliver
for firefighters in Philadelphia.  
   
Like I mentioned, we’re making an historic announcement in advanced
manufacturing to keep bringing jobs back from overseas.  He’s focused on
what matters to American families, not Marjorie Taylor Greene’s
conspiracy theories about his own family.  
   
Q    Senator Murphy indicated that the White House will be stepping up
its engagement this week on the supplemental, specifically on border
policy.  Any updates on what the White House is going to be doing this
week?  
   
MR. BATES:  Last week, you heard the President make the case to Congress
and the country on the urgent need to support Ukraine in its fight
against Putin.  He has repeatedly conveyed that message to congressional
leaders personally.  Our Legislative Affairs Office, OMB, NSC — they are
in close touch with lawmakers from both parties, and — and we’ll
continue to do that.   
   
Like we have said, like you heard from Director Young, from Secretary
Blinken yesterday: Our own national security is at stake in Ukraine. 
Putin has indicated that if he is successful there, he has designs on
other Eastern European countries who are members of NATO and who we are
obligated to defend.  And like the President has been exp- — explicit
about, we would defend them.  So, it would be infinitely more expensive
in every way not to act on this supplemental.  
   
Q    Does the White House see Trump’s “dictator” comments as a threat to
national security?  And what are you doing to prevent, you know, the
U.S. from getting a dictator?  
   
MR. BATES:  Now, I’m going to follow the Hatch Act and avoid commenting
on the 2024 election.   
   
But I want to be very clear: President Biden has been working to protect
American democracy and to unite people of all political views against
these unprecedented threats we’ve seen to our democracy in recent years,
since before January 6th.  And those warnings are bipartisan.   
   
You’ve heard a number of Republican congressional leaders weigh in
similarly.  You’ve heard members of the McCain family echo the
President’s warnings.  You — you’ve heard — you’ve heard Jay Michael
Luttig, a retired judge, echo the President’s warnings.   
   
And I want to say: It is wrong to suspend the Constitution and abuse
federal power to persecute critics and trample the First Amendment.  It
is wrong to override the will of the voters, as upheld by over 80
federal judges and the Trump administration’s top election security
official.  It is wrong to engage in violent rhetoric and spread
dangerous conspiracy theories that have cost brave police officers their
lives.  
   
Q    Thanks, Bates.  We’re heading to Philadelphia.  Do you have a
comment on the University of Pennsylvania president resigning after her
congressional testimony?  
   
MR. BATES:  I’m not going to weigh in on personnel matters directly. 
You saw our response last week to the hearing.  We were full-throated. 
The President believes strongly that this is a moment to put your foot
down and to ensure we have moral clarity.  He has done that
consistently.  He always will.   
   
I — I saw that she issued a statement withdrawing those comments.  That
was the right thing to do.  I’ve seen others have done the same.  That
was the right thing to do.  
   
Q    The President has a relationship with the University of
Pennsylvania.  Did he talk to anybody in school leadership about the
incident — the board of trustees, the school president — about what
happened there?  
   
MR. BATES:  I don’t have any private conversations to read out to
you.   
   
But, again, genocide is an obscenity.  And it is the responsibility of
every leader any time it is raised to speak out in very clear terms that
that is an attack on the dignity of every single American and we have to
reject it.  
   
Q    Andrew, is he going to say something similar tonight at the
Hanukkah reception?  
   
MR. BATES:  I — I am not going to preview the President’s remarks.  But,
as you mentioned, that is an important event.  It’s something that he
takes very seriously on a personal level.  And I know we put out some
details for all of you about who will be joining us, including Holocaust
survivors.  But I — I’m not going to get ahead of his — his remarks
here.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    How do you guys define success for President Zelenskyy’s meeting
with Speaker Johnson?  
   
MR. BATES:  President Zelenskyy, like you were hearing Mr. Kirby
underline, is the most effective advocate for Ukraine.  He is someone
who is respected across the country and in both parties in Congress, and
no one can better articulate why we — we need to continue the very
successful efforts that we have led in the world.  
   
Remember that the President has led a coalition across the world, united
in defending our values: democracy, sovereignty.  I know there are a lot
of congressional Republicans who talk about sovereignty.   
   
We should also keep in mind that if congressional Republicans want to be
serious about joining President Biden in countering Iran, there is no
better way to do so than to vote for this supplemental.  Iran has been
critical to Putin’s war effort.  And they also are assisting Hamas; they
sponsor Hamas.  
   
So, we need to keep that context in mind this week.  
   
Q    Thank you, Andrew.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Do you know how many visits he has made to Pennsylvania in the last
year or so?  
   
MR. BATES:  We can try to get that for you.  I don’t know offhand.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thanks.  Appreciate it.
