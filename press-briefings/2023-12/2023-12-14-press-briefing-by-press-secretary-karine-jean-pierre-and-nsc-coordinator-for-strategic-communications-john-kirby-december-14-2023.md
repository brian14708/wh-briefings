James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:17 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everyone.   
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, President Biden vowed to lower prescription drug
costs for seniors and families, and he’s delivering on that promise.   
   
Today, the President will visit the National Institutes of Health
Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to announce that dozens of
pharmaceutical companies raised prices faster than inflation, triggering
rebates to Medicare for outrageous, outrageous price hikes.  
   
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act that — that every single
congressional Republican voted against, we’ve taken steps to cap the
cost of insulin at 35 bucks for seniors, allow Medicare to negotiate
lower prescription drug prices, and lock in $800 per year in health
insurance savings for 15 million Americans.   
   
The Biden-Harris administration is also continuing to use fair pricing
clauses to keep prices low for new treatments created with taxpayer
dollars.   
   
Our work is not done.  President Biden remains focused on making sure
families can access the medicine they need at an affordable prices — at
affordable prices.  And you’ll hear directly from him shortly.   
   
Now, today, we remember the 26 souls who lost their lives at Sandy Hook
Elementary 11 years ago.  Twenty first graders were mercilessly gunned
down with a weapon of war, and six brave educators were also killed,
sacrificing their lives to protect their students.  The President and
the First Lady are praying for the moms and dads who lost their young
children that day.   
   
For the family members and survivors in the Newtown community, so many
of them have courageously gone on to fight for change and end the gun
violence ripping apart lives and communities.   
   
As the President said this morning, we should not live like this.  This
administration is doing everything it can to stop the epidemic of gun
violence, but we need Congress to act.  We need Congress to act.  We
need universal background checks, we need a national red flag law, and
we must ban assault weapons like the one used to kill these innocent
children.   
   
Looking ahead to next week, I have two pieces of news to share.   
   
On Tuesday, December 19th, President Biden will travel to the National
Cathedral here in Washington, D.C., to deliver remarks paying tribute to
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor at her funeral service.   
   
Justice O’Connor dedicated her life to public service and a relentless
pursuit to strengthen our democracy by finding common ground, reminding
all Americans that there is far more that unites us than divides us.   
   
And on Wednesday, the President will travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to
discuss how Bidenomics is creating a small-business boom, lowering costs
for hardworking families, and building an economy from the middle out
and bottom up.   
   
He will also discuss how, under this administration, Americans have
filed a record 14.6 million new business applications, including 178,000
in state — in the state of Wisconsin.  
   
With that, the Admiral is back in the briefing room to give you an
update on what’s happening in the Middle East and take some
questions.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Good afternoon, everybody.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think, as you all know, National Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan is in the Middle East for discussions about the conflict in
Gaza.  
   
Since arriving, he’s had a chance to meet with the Saudi Prime Minister
and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, where they discussed a
range of issues, including work that was already underway between Saudi
Arabia and the United States over recent months to work towards a
sustainable peace between Israelis and the Palestinians, as well as to
increase the flow of food, water, medicine, and fuel into Gaza.  
   
In Israel, Jake had the chance to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and
members of his War Cabinet.  His message was consistent: The United
States will continue to support Israel in its fight against Hamas, and
we will continue to do everything we can to help broker another pause so
that the remaining hostages can be reunited with their families.  
   
As I said yesterday, Yahya Sinwar and Hamas started this war.  They can
end it right now by letting those people go, by ordering their fighters
to lay down their arms, and by turning in everyone else responsible for
the October 7th attacks.  
   
Jake also discussed the next phase of Israel’s military campaign.  And
he asked hard questions, as we have been doing,  about what all that
could look like.  
   
Of course, Jake also discussed efforts Israel is now undertaking to be
more surgical and precise in their targeting and efforts they are taking
to help increase the flow of aid.  
   
This is Jake’s second visit to Israel since the conflict began, and it’s
part of our ongoing engagement with both Israel and our regional
partners.  
   
He’ll remain there tomorrow, and we’ll provide more details and readouts
of his meetings and engagements then.  
   
If I could turn to Ukraine.  Today, Vladimir Putin, in his annual press
conference, doubled down on his goal of conquering Ukraine and
subjugating its people.  
   
Nearly 20 months after he launched his brutal and barbaric invasion, Mr.
Putin said today that — that his aggression in Ukraine will not end and
there will only be peace, quote, “when our goals are achieved.”  End
quote.  
   
We all know what that means.  
   
But I sure hope that those House Republicans who have, for months, held
hostage critical assistance to Ukraine heard Putin’s message loud and
clear.  
   
Instead, they’re heading home for the holidays while Ukrainians are
heading right back into the fight.  They’ll face more shelling; more air
attacks; more cold, dark nights.  And just over the last 24 to 48 hours,
we’ve seen additional airstrikes by Russia on critical infrastructure. 
And they’ll face more death and destruction to their families and to
their homeland.  
   
They need our help.  And they need it now, not after the eggnog.  
   
If that’s not enough to move you or change your mind, think about our
own interests here.  We know that what happens in Ukraine doesn’t just
happen to Ukraine.  It’s no foreign war.  
   
Putin is challenging the very international order that we helped build. 
He’s challenging the U.N. Charter.  He’s challenging the very notion of
sovereignty.  He’s challenging democracy itself.  
   
Russia seeks to remake the international order to create a world
conducive to its highly personalized and repressive type of autocracy. 
That would have profound effects on freedom and prosperity everywhere.  
   
So, in short, we cannot afford not to help.  Imagine the cost in blood
and treasure, in the lives of our own troops and those of our NATO
Allies if we just walked away from this effort, if we just let Putin
take Ukraine, wipe it off the map as an independent country.  
   
As President Biden has said, we know from history that when dictators
don’t pay a price for their aggression, they just keep on going.   
   
And make no mistake, Putin is not the only — he’s not the only one
watching what’s going on here and how this plays out.   
   
Other nations, friend and foe alike, will certainly learn lessons from
our own ability here to stand up or our inability to stand up.   
   
Inaction is action too.  It’s well past time for us to act in defense of
our national security interests.  
   
Now, just quickly, I think today you also saw we announced joint
Treasury and law enforcement actions against a notorious transnational
criminal organization.   
   
Malas Mañas engaged in the smuggling of people and illicit fentanyl into
the United States from Mex- — Mexico.  This is part of the
administration’s ongoing efforts, coordinated with the government of
Mexico, to tackle the global threat posed by the scourge of human
smuggling and drug trafficking into the United States.   
   
Specifically, Treasury issued sanctions against this notorial transnat-
— this tran- — notorious transnational criminal organization and two
human smugglers associated with this organization under the President’s
2021 executive order, which targets those involved in global illicit
drug trade.   
   
Separately, the Department of Justice also unsealed a combination of
human smuggling, money laundering, and drug trafficking charges against
five individuals, including the head of Malas Mañas.  And today’s
actions, of course, were based on a joint investigation by DHS’s
Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement
Administration.   
   
Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Gabe, go ahead.  
   
Q    Admiral, Israel’s Ministry of Defense said it will last several —
that the war will last several months, or that it will take several more
months to defeat Hamas.  Does the U.S. find that timeline
unacceptable?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s consistent with what they’ve been saying since almost
the very beginning that this could — this could take some time.  And
certainly they’ve talked about it in a — in terms of months.  There’s
nothing new there.  That’s very consistent with what they’ve been
saying.  
   
Q    But — and then separately, a senior Israeli diplomat is saying that
the country will not accept a two-state solution.  That runs contrary to
U.S. policy.  What’s your reaction to those comments?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We still — we still adhere to the promise and the vision of
a two-state solution.  Nothing has changed about our policy.  I’ll let
the Israelis speak for themselves.  We still believe, the President
still believes it’s not only possible, it’s in the best interest of the
Israeli people and the Palestinian people.  
   
Q    But how is peace at all possible if the Israelis cannot accept
that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  As I said yesterday, Gabe, a two-state solution may seem
elusive right now.  We’re not fooling ourselves.  We know that everybody
is focused right now on the fight against Hamas.  But it requires
leadership — a two-state solution.  It requires leadership on all sides
here to be able to roll up their sleeves and do the right thing not only
for their people but for everybody in the region.   
   
The President is an optimist, and he still believes that it’s the right
answer to the right solution, and he still believes it’s achievable.   
   
We’re not — nobody thinks we’re going to pull a rabbit out of a hat here
and get to it tomorrow, especially while they’re in a fight for their
lives right now, but it doesn’t mean we’re going to give up on the
efforts.   
   
And just one more thing, and then I promise I’ll shut up.  When he was
in Riyadh, this was an idea — this was — this notion was — was brought
up by Jake with the — with the Crown Prince.  And as you know, before
October 7th, we were working towards normalization between those two
countries.  And the indications that we’ve gotten from the Saudis is
that they’re still interested in pushing forward on that.  
   
Q    But you said it requires leadership.  Does it require more
leadership on the part of Benjamin Netanyahu?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It requires leadership across the board.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Zeke.  
   
Q    Thanks, John.  Follow on Gabe’s question.  You mentioned the
Israelis have been consistent about running additional months for this
campaign.  Is that acceptable, now at this stage, to the United States,
for this to continue on for more — it’s been two-plus months now?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think — I think — look, we all want it to — to end as soon
as possible.  And as I said in my opening statement yesterday and today,
it could end today if Sinwar did the right thing and just laid down his
arms and surrendered and got — got — and gave the hostages back.  That
doesn’t look likely right now.  This war that Hamas started — and Israel
has a right and responsibility to continue to conduct this war to
protect their people and to protect their nation.   
   
Again, how long that’s going to take, I can’t predict.  And we’re not —
you know, we’re not dictating terms to the Israelis about how long it
has to take.  It has to take as long as they feel they need to take to
be able to eliminate this threat.  But obviously, we all want it to be
over as soon as possible.   
   
Q    The U.S. position over the last several months has been that in a
post-war environment that Gaza must be controlled by a revitalized
Palestinian Authority.  What gives the U.S. any sense that the people of
Gaza want the Palestinian Authority involved in the Gaza Strip or even
in the West Bank, since a majority want Abbas to go?  Does Abbas need to
go?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We believe that the Palestinian Authority should be involved
in the governance of the Palestinian areas, including Gaza, and that —
we believe that that’s best achieved through a reformed and revitalized
Palestinian Authority.   
   
We’re not, again, dictating who — you know, who’s in charge, but we — we
do believe that there needs to be a regional effort — a effort that
we’re willing to participate in — to help the Palestinian Authority
become reformed in such a way that they can — that they can manifest
themselves in terms of governance in Gaza.   
   
Q    And then lastly, yesterday, you suggested that Jake was going to be
talking about new humanitarian aid corridors in Gaza and said you might
have some news for us today.  I was wondering if you had an update on
that.  Is this —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t.  
   
Q    Okay.   
   
Q    Just one more time on the timing here.  I understand obviously you
want this to end as soon as possible; everyone does.  But there are
reports that Sullivan told Netanyahu that Israel has to end this current
phase of fighting in weeks, not months.  Is that part of the message
that he’s delivering to today?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to divulge private conversations that we’ve —
we’ve had and will continue to have with the Israelis.   
   
Obviously, one of the things that Jake did talk to him about was
progress in the war and where the Israelis think it’s going to go.   
   
He did talk about possible transitioning from what we would call
high-intensity operations, which is what we’re seeing them do now, to
lower-intensity operations sometime, you know, in the near future.  But
I don’t want to put a timestamp on it.  I think you can understand that
the last thing we’d want to do is telegraph to Hamas what — what they’re
likely to face in coming weeks and months.  
   
Q    And I know this came up yesterday, but I just want to be clear:
Does the administration agree that indiscriminate attacks are prohibited
under international humanitarian law?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  If — if — if attacks, obviously, are — are not done with due
concern to civilians, then — then, obviously, that’s — that’s a deep
concern.  
   
Q    But you have stressed that the President, you know, speaks for
American foreign policy.  He has said that Israel is engaged in
indiscriminate bombing in Gaza.  So then wouldn’t it stand to reason
that this is a violation?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think — I’ve answered that question I don’t know how many
times yesterday.  I have nothing more to add on that.   
   
The President was referring to concerns that he has and that we have
that we know the intent is there by the Israelis to limit civilian
casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure but sometimes the
results don’t always come out that way.  That’s what he was referring
to.  
   
Q    But you keep stressing their intent — that it’s Israel’s intent to
minimize civilian casualties.  But that intention isn’t what we’re
seeing on the ground right now. 

By the President’s own admission, they are bombing indiscriminately. 
So, are you saying that their intent is somehow more important than the
result?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Both are important.  I mean, obviously, the most important
thing is the results and the outcomes, but it has to be driven by a
sincere intent to limit civilian casualties.  So, both are important.  
   
Look, I don’t want to — I don’t think it’s useful to revisit the whole
discussion from yesterday because you’re not going to get a different
answer out of me.   
   
We don’t want to see a single more innocent civilian killed or wounded. 
One is too many.  We’ve — we’ve said that over and over again.   
   
And we’re working hard with the Israelis — and Jake is doing that right
now — to — to get a better sense of what they can do, as I said in my
opening statement, to be more surgical, to be more discriminant in their
— in their targeting.  That’s important.   
   
At the same time, it’s important that they have the tools and
capabilities they need to go after a truly genocidal threat represented
by Sinwar and these Hamas terrorists.   
   
Q    You said that Jake was encouraging the Israelis to start
transitioning from a high-intensity to lower-intensity operations in the
near — near future.  I know you don’t want to get into the timeline, but
how would the U.S. describe low-intensity operations?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think that’s best left to our discussions with the
Israelis and for the Israeli Defense Forces to — to describe.  This is
something that they have said they’re going to do, and they’ll do it in
their due course.   
   
But, again, I don’t want to get into too much detail here from this
particular podium about that.   
   
Q    And if they were to transition into those lower-intensity
operations in the coming weeks, would the U.S. reconsider its support
for Israel at this point?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s a great hypothetical.  I’m not going to engage.   
   
Q    And then you also said that the U.S. is also — remains committed to
trying to get back to the table to broker a potential pause to get these
negotiations — to get the hostages out.  But the Israeli government
called off a trip by the head of the M- — Mossad to travel to Qatar to
restart these hostage — hostage negotiations.  The War Cabinet is saying
that they felt conditions are not right.  Does the U.S. agree with that
assessment?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re still working by the hour to try to get a pause back
in place so that hostages can get released.  I’ll let the Israelis speak
to their negotiators and where — where they are and what they’re going
to focus on.   
   
I can tell you one of the things Jake is doing in the region — I mean,
if you need proof that we still want to see a pause, just look at where
the National Security Advisor is today.   
   
I mean, we are engaging at all levels to try to get that back in place,
and we still believe it’s possible.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Andrea.  
   
Q    Yeah.  John, I just want to follow up on the West Bank violence. 
So, 275 people have been killed there since October 7th, including 12
just over the last three days in Jenin.  Are you worried about the
violence that you’re seeing there and that it could escalate — that it
could basically engulf and move the conflict from Gaza, the enclave in
the south, to a broader region across the West Bank and potentially even
including Palestinians inside of Israel?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yes.  And the President has, from a very early time in this
conflict, talked about that exact concern, that exact worry.  These
numbers are troublesome as well.  And — and we are deeply concerned
about that.   
   
And that is yet another thing that we continue to talk to our Israeli
counterparts about.   
   
Q    So, what — what exactly is the U.S. plan to sort of help these 2.7
million people that are displaced in Gaza right now?  I mean, nearly all
of them have been forced from their homes.  Winter is coming.  It’s
getting colder.  There’s no food.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s —  
   
Q    People are —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s why, even when the pause fell apart, we continued to
urge for a flow of humanitarian aid and assistance that was about at
that level.  Now, we haven’t always reached it every day, but we’ve been
trying very hard to keep that level of assistance up.  And we’re going
to continue to do that.   
   
I mean, the United States literally is leading the international effort
to get food, water, medicine, and fuel into the people of Gaza.  And we
know that as winter comes, that’s going to be even more important.  And
we’re not going — we’re not going to lay off that task.   
   
Q    Can you airdrop supplies in?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Airdrops can be done.  But the — but the —  
   
Q    Is there anything —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  — the best way to do it in Gaza — just because it’s so
densely populated and so densely urban, the best and safest way to get
it in there, in — in terms of volume as well, is through trucks.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then just one quick question.  Today, there was an
attack reported on a Maersk cargo ship.  Do you know anything more about
that?  Can you give us any details on that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have any details on that particular — are you
talking about something in the Red Sea?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I — I am not familiar with that particular attack.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, J.J.  
   
Q    On the President’s phone call with Turkey and President Erdoğan
today.  Can you share any details about their discussion about Turkey’s
request for the F-16 fighter jets?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’ll — we’ll have a more detailed readout for you here
shortly, I think.  The President appreciated the time that President
Erdoğan gave him.  They certainly talked about a range of issues,
including what’s going on in the Middle East between Israel and
Hamas.   
   
They talked about NATO and Sweden’s accession.  And — and I do believe
just the general support for — again, we’ll wait for the readout, but I
certainly wouldn’t be surprised at all if it was also raised that — that
we continue to support a modernization program for their F-16s.  
   
Q    On the Defense budget.  Are you worried that the extension of FISA,
which gives the FBI the power to conduct warrantless spying on
surveilling — on foreign citizens and Americans who they interact with —
do you think that’s — Americans are also at risk of being spied by the
government?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Are you talking about 702?  
   
Q    Yeah, 702.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, look, we have talked about this for quite some time. 
We — we believe that 702 gives us very important tools and capabilities
to protect the American people by focusing on the collection of useful
intelligence overseas.  And that’s what it’s designed to do.   
   
And, again, we’re watching what’s going on in the — in the House.  The
House Intelligence Committee has put forward a full reauthorization of
702 that we — that we think is — is worth looking at.  And we urge
everybody in the House to — to look at it seriously.   
   
There’s some reforms in there that I think, as I said earlier, might be
a little bit difficult for us to sign up to.  But — but in general, 702
— look, I mean, Zawahiri — right? — the — the Colonial Pipeline — I
could go on and on of — of things we were able to help — to help improve
our safety and security and to go after threats to that safety and
security that 702 gave us.  So, it’s really important.   
   
Q    From — from your experience, after 20 years of war in Afghanistan,
fighting also ISIS, do you think that Israel is really going to
dismantle Hamas with the U.S. cooperation?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Our own experience tells us that if you can go after the
leadership of an — of a terrorist network — and this isn’t just a
terrorist network; it’s also a military organization as well — that you
can have a very significant effect on their ability to plan, train,
resource, recruit, retain, and execute attacks.  We saw that with ISIS. 
We saw that with al Qaeda.  So, the idea of going after their — their
leaders makes sound military sense.   
   
Now, are you going to eliminate the ideology?  Probably not.  I mean,
ISIS still exists in Iraq and Syria, and al Qaeda still exists in
places, although they’ve metastasized somewhat.  Both groups are
radically diminished in terms of their ability to — to threaten our
national security because we focused so much on their leadership.  So,
it can have a profound effect.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Patsy.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  John, you told me yesterday that a future
governance in Gaza must exclude Hamas, requires reform in the
Palestinian Authority, and represent the Palestinian people.   
   
Can you explain what the administration believes to be Israel’s role in
supporting this, especially if one is to believe allegations that Prime
Minister Netanyahu has been working to divide leadership in the
Palestinian people essentially by choking the Palestinian Authority
while also supporting Hamas by allowing foreign funds to — to re- — to
be received by them?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t think I can really improve upon what I said
yesterday.  We believe that whatever governance in Gaza looks like, it’s
got to meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people.  We know Hamas
does not represent the vast majority of the Palestinian people.  
   
And so, what we believe, as I said earlier, is that the best way to get
at that kind of governance is to re- — reformed and a revitalized
Palestinian Authority, which Secretary Blinken has spoken to quite well,
that we’re going to continue to work on.  
   
Q    Do you believe that Israel has a role in that, though?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Of course.  We’re — Israel would have a role in helping us
move towards that outcome, as well as other regional partners and Arab
states in the region as well.  
   
Q    And on Jake’s visit.  With him meeting the Saudis and, you know,
the administration saying that normalization between Saudi and Israel
will bring the goal of a two-state solution together, can you break that
down for me, please?  How does that work in the current post-October 7th
reality?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, Patsy, we know that a two-state solution right now is
going to seem elusive to a lot of folks.  We understand that given
what’s going on since the 7th of October.  So — but that doesn’t mean
you give up on it.  
   
And in his meetings in Riyadh, one of the things Jake talked about with
the Crown Prince was the idea of normalization between Israel and Saudi
Arabia.  This is an idea we had been pushing forward before the 7th of
October, and we have indications that the Saudis are still interested in
having that conversation going forward.  That’s a positive thing.  
   
Are we going to get there tomorrow?  No, of course not.  But that —
that’s a — as I said yesterday, it’s an important milestone to perhaps
getting to a viable two-state solution.  
   
Q    And one last one, please.  The Council on American-Islamic
Relations — or CAIR — has called on the Biden administration to respond
to reports that the Israeli military has shot women, children, and
babies, in, quote, “execution style” after they sought refuge in a
school in Gaza.  Is there any truth to those claims?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I — I haven’t — I have no indication to ver- — to verify
those accusations.  
   
Q    Just take you to another part — two other parts of the world real
quick.  In that marathon news conference, Vladimir Putin said that
Moscow and Washington are, in fact, in contact over the fates of Evan
Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, which is different than what has been said
by you and others here about the requests to get them back being
rebuffed.  He said we have “not refused” to return our Wall Street
Journal colleague.   
   
So, what is the status of talks between the U.S. and Russia in terms of
those two?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, he’s right that we continue to talk to Moscow about
getting Evan and Paul home where they belong, that those — those
discussions are ongoing, and they’re ongoing actively.  I’m not going to
detail them from — from here.  
   
He’s absolutely wrong that his government did not rebuff a serious
proposal.  There was one put forward, and they rebuffed it.  He’s just
wrong, flat out.  
   
Q    One other thing in this hemisphere.  How is the White House
monitoring today’s talks between Venezuela and Guyana over what could
become a minor land war in South America?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  There’s no reason for it to ever get to that point, Ed. 
We’re watching that very, very closely.  We know that the history here
goes back to the late 1890s here, an — an arbitration that was done to
sort of set that boundary.  We believe that arbitral award should be
respected.   
   
We don’t want to see this come to blows.  There’s no reason for it to,
and our diplomats are engaged in real time on this.  
   
Q    Is there anyone down there for those talks or —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know that we’re participating in the talks, but our
— our existing diplomatic structure down there is — is involved.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, John.  If I can go back to the Middle East.  You’ve said
that the administration has made it very clear to the Israeli government
about the need to limit, minimize civilian casualties.  Is it your sense
that the Israeli government is heeding that advice?  And can you give us
some clarification on how you make that assessment?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I talked about this a little bit yesterday.  Happy to
revisit it.  We have seen them be receptive to those messages.  We have
seen them act on those messages in terms of the scope and scale of the
ground force that they — that they used to go into North Gaza, much
reduced than what they had originally planned.  
   
We saw them beginning to rely less on airstrikes.  And because they’ve
got troops inserted, and when you have troops inserted on the ground,
you are able to target in a more precise way.  You also take a higher
risk to your forces.  They lost 10 of their soldiers a day or two ago —
largest loss in a single day.  So, there’s a risk to your forces when
you do that.  
   
And we’ve also seen them, as I’ve said before, telegraph their punches a
little bit by publishing a map online of — in Southern Gaza of where
people can go and where they can’t go.  
   
They’ve also opened up humanitarian corridors from the North to the
South, again, at our urging.  That doesn’t come without — without risk
as well.   
   
So — and by the way, they agreed to a weeklong pause in the fighting — a
weeklong pause that — that saw no civilian casualties because there
wasn’t fighting going on.  And, of course, that weeklong pause
potentially allowed Hamas to regroup, reequip, restore themselves.  So,
they — they are taking steps.   
   
Jake’s message to them is, obviously, gratitude for the steps they’re
taking, but also to continue to urge them to take more because we want
to see them be more precise, more surgical, more deliberate, more
cautious going forward.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  In the back, go ahead.  
   
Q    Admiral, I’m wondering if you can explain to us why the
administration is slow-walking the transfer of rifles — M4s, M16s — made
in the U.S. to Israel.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would have to refer you to the State Department to speak
to that.  That’s — that’s their purview.  
   
Q    John, why would somebody around here leak that the Vice President
is upset with the President about Gaza?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Man, that’s a great question, because I just — (laughter) —
I mean, if I — if I could answer a question why somebody would leak, I
mean, that would make me pretty smart and a lot smarter than I am.   
   
Let me just — just give me a second here.  (Laughs.)   
   
You’ve seen us, officially and on the record — not in a leak — refute
the basic premise of the story that there’s some sort of daylight
between the Vice President and the President.  
   
I found the headline of the story interesting, that — that the Vice
President is pushing the White House to — you fill in the blank: X, Y,
Z.  Last I looked, the Vice President is part of the White House.  She’s
part of the team.   
   
And if she wasn’t offering her advice and counsel to the President on
innumerable issues, that would be a story.  Her job is to provide advice
and counsel to the President.   
   
Q    So, she does want President Biden to show more concern publicly for
humanitarian damage, then, in Gaza?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We have — I think we’ve already pushed back on the premise
of the story that there’s some sort of daylight between her and the
President.  I would say that the entire leadership team here in the
administration, Peter, wants to see no civilian casualties; wants to see
the Israelis be more surgical, more precise; wants to see that
humanitarian aid is increased into Gaza.   
   
And, obviously, as the Vice President has said herself, we all want to
make sure that Israel has the tools and capabilities they need to defend
themselves.  
   
Q    Is President O-Biden — is President Biden — (laughter) — okay.

MR. KIRBY:  Yes, he is.

Q    Yeah, is he — (laughter) — that’s good.  That’s a big story for
us.  (Laughter.)

Is the President —

MR. KIRBY:  And only you.  (Laughter.)

Q    — okay that people from the Vice President’s team are going to the
press with this?

MR. KIRBY:  The President is comfortable and confident that in Vice
President Harris he has a real teammate and a significant leader who
understands the foreign policy direction that he’s trying to take this
country and our leadership on the world stage and is candid, forthright,
educated, smart, and willing to tell him exactly what she thinks.

I’m not going to talk about what her advice and counsel is to the
President.  I would just tell you that the entire leadership team here
all understands the importance of making sure Israel is more precise,
more cautious, and more deliberate in their targeting, even as we are
sure and certain that Israel continues to need our security assistance
and support to go after Hamas.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nadia.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  CNN is reporting that, according to U.S.
intelligence assessment, that nearly half of the Israeli munition
dropped on Gaza are imprecise, what you call a “dumb bomb.”  Does this
support what the President said yesterday, that the Israelis are using
indiscriminate bombing in Gaza?  What’s your reaction to that?

MR. KIRBY:  I can- – I cannot confirm the reporting of that.  I’d refer
you to the Israeli Defense Forces to talk about the — the —

Q    But this it the U.S. intelligence —

MR. KIRBY:  — types of munitions —

I would refer you to the Israeli Defense Forces to speak to the types of
munitions that they’re dropping and the strikes that they’re conducting.

I have said I don’t know how many times here: I’m not going to armchair
quarterback every single strike and every single attack that they
conduct.

Q    Okay.  Another question.  You just said that this war can end if
Hamas laid down their arms.  Hamas political wing in Qatar indicated
today that they will be willing to be a part of the PA.  Is this
acceptable to end the war?  Is this acceptable —

MR. KIRBY:  What —

Q    — to the U.S.?

MR. KIRBY:  What needs to happen to end the war today is the conditions
I just laid out.  And there’s three of them, and they’re not that
difficult: Lay down your arms, turn over those who were responsible for
the October 7th attacks, and give up all the hostages.  Three simple
things, and this thing can be over — could be over today.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Phil.  And then —

Q    Thank you.  I have two quick questions.  First, I wanted to follow
up on your comments about the Palestinian Authority remaining in
governance.  I’m just curious: As Congress puts together an aid package
for Ukraine and Israel, does the President want to see the Taylor Force
Act remain in effect?  Or is he open to U.S. aid going directly to the
Palestinian Auth- — Palestinian Authority there?

MR. KIRBY:  You’re going to have to refresh my memory on what the Taylor
Force Act is.

Q    The Taylor Force Act prohibits direct funding to the Palestinian
Authority so long as their policy of sending aid to the families of
deceased terrorists is in effect.

MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, look, this is all part of what we believe should be a
reformed and revitalized Palestinian Authority so that they can be
credibly and authentically in charge of governance over Palestinian
territories.

Q    So — and then, second question.  Any comment on Argentinian
President Milei’s proposal to dollarize their economy there?  Is that
something that the White House welcomes?

MR. KIRBY:  I’ll take the question.  Don’t have an answer for you.

Q    Thank you, sir.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re going to wrap it up.  Go ahead, Danny.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, Admiral.  On Ukraine, the European Union
has just agreed to open membership talks for Ukraine.  Just wondered if
you’ve got any reaction to that.  And, also, does that mean that Europe
might ultimately be a more reliable partner than the United States at
the moment, given the current problems of supplemental funding —

MR. KIRBY:  Europe is already a very reliable partner to Ukraine.  And
we would fully expect that that — that will continue.  There’s been
terrific unanimity with our European allies about supporting Ukraine.

The EU can speak to their decision-making here in terms of inviting
Ukraine or not.  I’ll let them talk about that.  That’s not something
that we would comment on.

We are focused on making sure Ukraine, as I said at the top, has what it
needs, particularly in these tough winter months.  We’re also — there
was just a conference here last week, over at Commerce, working on
making sure that, long term, Ukraine has an ability to both develop a
more resilient, organic defense industry and a defense industrial base,
as well as tap into the defense industrial base of the United States and
some of our European partners so that there’s long-term — that they can
meet their own long-term security commitments.

And the last thing I’ll say is: Here, we’re also working with President
Zelenskyy, as you saw this week, on his idea for a just peace and what
that has to look like and operationalizing that with nations around the
world.  
   
Q    John —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Last question.  Go ahead.

Q    On Ukraine.  The — there’s a small working group on Capitol Hill. 
Senators Lankford, Sinema, and Murphy say that they’re making some
progress when it comes to the dispute at the heart of — of what’s going
on on Capitol Hill, which is over changes in border policy.

They say they’re making progress.  This may or may not, of course, end
up extending their time here in Washington before they go home for the
holidays.  But just having them say they’re making progress, is that
enough to start the ball rolling and to assuage some of the concerns
that the U.S. isn’t doing anything?

MR. KIRBY:  Is just saying they’re making progress enough to get the
ball rolling?

Q    In terms of assuaging the concerns about the international
community that is watching and trying to follow the U.S. lead regarding
aid to Ukraine.

MR. KIRBY:  I think what will be most effective to that end is actually
getting a deal done.  And we certainly wouldn’t dispute the senators’
take that — that there’s progress.  And we’re going to continue to
engage, again, in good faith in those negotiations.

I’m obviously not going to get into the details from the podium.  But
the process is moving forward.  And that’s a good thing.

But what — what really will send a strong message not just to our allies
but to Mr. Putin, who just today said he still wants to wipe Ukraine off
the map, is actually getting the funding to support Ukraine.   
   
And, yes, we recognize that that requires compromise and discussions
over border policy as well as border security.  And the President and
his team — we’re willing to engage in those discussions.

Thanks.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, Admiral.  Thank you.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    — have a right to defend —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  We heard from the — from Kirby a few minutes ago —
he had the colorful line, “They need our help right now, not after the
eggnog.”  (Laughter.)  I’m just wondering, you know —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Is that wrong?

Q    So, the White House is sort of, you know, trying to amp up the
pressure on — on congressional Republicans, it seems.  Why do you think
that’s an effective strategy?  And can you — given that you’re saying
that the Hill is not doing enough, can you talk about what the President
himself is actually doing, since we haven’t seen him do much?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, look, as you know, the President has been in
regular contact, regular touch — and he said this — with congressional
leaders from both sides, from the Republican and Democratic side —

Q    Has he called the Speaker?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — of the leadership.

I’m sorry?

Q    Has he talked to the Speaker?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into, like, specifically who he’s
called, but —

Q    I mean, he’s the leadership.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — but, obviously, congressional leaders — right? —
from the Republican side and also the Democratic side — both parties.   
   
And, as you know, staff has also been on — on the Hill — our staff has
been also — his staff has been also on the Hill negotiating on his
behalf.   
   
And they met on Tuesday.  They met again on yesterday.  And we believe
it’s going in a productive place.  We’re — we’re — we believe it’s
heading in the right direction.  We believe that — that conversations —
the fact that it’s continuing, it’s encouraging.   
   
And we’re seeing progress.  And that’s because, obviously, of the
President, we believe, continuing to — to certainly negotiate, have
those conversations.  And this is a President who knows how to
negotiate.  We’ve seen him do it multiple times over the past almost
three years in this administration, being able to negotiate across the
aisle and working on legislation, making things happen on behalf of the
American people.   
   
Look, it’s going in the right way.  We understand that we’re going to
find — we have to find a bipartisan compromise to get this done.  And
we’re talking about the policy side of it and the funding side of it, as
we talk about the border — in relation to the border.   
   
And so, we’re going to continue to have those conversations.  It
continues on the Senate side.  You heard us talk about how — and Speaker
said this himself — how he’s going to — you know, they’re going to go on
vacation.  They’re going to go on vacation while the Senate side
continues to work.   
   
And that’s — you know, that’s not doing — that’s not delivering for the
American people when you go on vacation and go on Christmas recess.   
   
Q    So, you mentioned the President is negotiating.  What — how is he a
part of these negotiations?  Is he — is the White House now at, you know
— do you des- — is he evalu- — is he personally evaluating proposals
(inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, he’s in regular — he’s in regular touch with
congressional leaders.  
   
Don’t have any specifics.  Not going to negotiate from here.   
   
Obviously, his staff — his staff has been on — on the Hill yesterday and
the day before yesterday and — Tuesday and yesterday, having those on
con- — conversations on behalf of this President, negotiating on behalf
of this President.  And so, that’s where we are.  
   
It is going in the right direction, we believe, because those
conversations continue, and that’s what matters as we talk about the
border — border security and moving forward with making sure we get the
supplemental done.  
   
Q    And “going in the right direction” — does that mean a deal gets
done when?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We — I don’t have a timeline on the deal.  Obviously,
we needed to get it done before the end of this year.  That’s — that’s
our — that’s our — kind of our timeline here.  But I don’t have a
specifics on if it’s going to happen tomorrow, the next day.  We just
know it’s going in the right direction, and that’s what matters.   
   
Go ahead, J.J.  
   
Q    On those Ukraine border deal negotiations, what is your message to
those Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists who are worried
that the White House is giving up too much in these negotiations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So look, we’ve been in constant communication with
Democrats and, obviously, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.  I know
that they have put some concerns out there or have been very clear about
their thoughts.  Don’t have anything to read out on those
conversations.   
   
Look, here’s what the President believes: He believes we need to fix
what’s happening at our — with the broken immigration system.  He
believes that that needs to get done, that needs to get fixed.  And he’s
willing to find a bipartisan compromise to get that done.  And that’s
the direction and that’s the path that we’re taking to try to figure out
how do we fix this broken immigration system, something that he has been
really talking about since day one with his comprehensive immigration
legislation that he put forth.   
   
And so, that’s the direction this conver- — this conversation is going
in: How do we find a bipartisan compromise to get this done as we talk
about the policy and the funding, as it relates to border — border
security?  
   
Go ahead, Ed.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I’m going to ask you about inflation.  So, you
mentioned the price of eggs, milk, and gas are down over the past year. 
But what do you say to Americans who are looking at the month that
President Biden came into office?  Eggs are up 24 percent, milk is up 17
percent, all types of gas is up 37 percent, and the prices overall are
up 17 percent.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the President actually spoke to this not too
long ago — I believe, on Tuesday, actually — just a couple days ago —
and he says, “We know there’s more work to be done” — right? — and it —
and that things are still unaffordable.   
   
And so, while the prices, as you just mentioned, of eggs and gas and
milk and toys and TVs are down, especially in this time as we’re heading
into a holiday season, as we’re in the holiday season, there’s more work
to be done.  And that’s important.   
   
And that’s why we’re fighting to lower inf- — insulin.  That’s why we’re
— we — we talk about junk fees and how we can save Americans money,
right?  That’s why we continue to talk about health insurance premiums. 
That’s why we’re — we — the President is going to make an announcement
about what we were able to do with one of the provisions that’s in the
Inflation Reduction Act that only Democrats voted for, not Republicans,
in order for seniors to get rebates on — on their Medicare.   
   
So, all of those things are truly important, and so that’s why he’s
doing everything that he can to do that.   
   
And you have Republicans on the other — on the other side of the aisle —
right? — who are talking about cutting taxes for the wealthy and big
corporations — right? — who are talking about cutting Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid.  So, the President is going to continue to fight for
the American people, continue to make sure they have a little bit of
breathing room.   
   
Is there more work to be done?  Absolutely.  But we have seen some —
some prices go down — and all of the products that I just listed.  We
have.  
   
There’s still more work to be done, and we’re going to continue to do
that work.   
   
Q    But I wanted to ask you a question — I wanted ask you about the
transition —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Right, over the past — and that matters, right?   
   
Q    Well, but — but —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It matters that we’re not in —  
   
Q    But since President Biden came into office —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, wait.  Wait.   
   
Q    — his policies —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It matters — it matters — let’s not forget what has
been happening — almost two years now.  Right?  Putin — right? — Putin’s
war in — in —  
   
Q    That was a year into the President’s —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Right?  But that has —  
   
Q    — administration.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — caused inflation.  That has caused prices to go up,
right?  And so, the President took action to make sure gas prices went
down — which they have, right?  And we com- — we’re coming out of this
pandemic.  So, all of those things have been a — have been part of the —
where inflation is.  
   
But inflation is moderating.  The President is going to continue to make
sure that we lower cost and lower prices on those goods that you just
listed out.   
   
Q    I want to ask you about the transition.  The White House is asking
today to speed up the transition — (inaudible) electric.  You know, one
of the things they announced is — is that federal employees would take
the train.  It’s 250 miles.  There’s a list of things.   
   
I’m wondering if the President is thinking about putting — making The
Beast electric.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, that’s certainly a question for G- — GSA and the
Service — Secret Service, obviously.   
   
But we are committed to boosting public and private access to electric
vehicles, and today’s announcement would save taxpayer dollars and help
tackle the climate crisis.   
   
But as it relates to The Beast, that’s something for GSA and Secret
Service to speak to.  
   
Q    So does he mean Cabinet members would take the train —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That, again —  
   
Q    — to New York?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would — I would refer you to GSA and — and also the
Secret Service as it relates to The Beast and any other questions.   
   
Go ahead, Zolan.  
   
Q    I know you’ve said Leg Affairs and different parts of the White
House —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — are involved in the negotiations on the Hill, but who’s the
highest-ranking White House official that’s physically on Capitol
Hill?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, you’re talking about the OMB Director — right? —
Shalanda Young, who’s been in this briefing room multiple times, having
conversations with members on the Hill.  
   
You’re talking about the — you know, OLA — Office of Leg Affairs.  You
have Shuwanza — right? — who — who runs that.   
   
You talk about the President’s senior advisors.  
   
There are been a lot of people involved, and all of those folks have the
trust in the President to get this done and to do these negotiations.   
   
Remember, we have done negotiations multiple times here and have gotten
things done for the American people in a — and many times in a
bipartisan way.  So, that’s what’s important — that the President has a
team that he trusts that has done this before — in the past two years,
even more — and getting these bipartisan kind of conversation,
compromises done.  And so, he entrusts in that whole entire team to get
that done.   
   
And sometimes, it’s Jake Sullivan.  Sometimes, it’s — it’s — you know,
Shalanda Young has obviously been involved in this more — more
consistently.  And OLA and others.   
   
But that’s how it works.  We work as a team; we work as a unit to get
things done on —  
   
Q    Has — has —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — on behalf of the American people.  
   
Q    Has his Chief of Staff been in the room on Capitol Hill for
these?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I don’t have — I’m not going to start listing
names.  But obviously, his senior — his senior advisors have been very —
very involved in this.  And has the ch- — the Chief of Staff — yes, I
can say the Chief of Staff has been involved.   
   
But, again, he has a team of folks who have been critical parts of — a
critical component of getting this done and —  
   
Q    He’s been involved?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — having these conversa-  
   
Q    Just to clarify: He’s been on Capitol Hill?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — not — look, not everybody has been on Capitol
Hill.  People have picked up the phone, have conversations.  People —
you know, members of leadership in Congress call on this side wanting to
talk to maybe the Chief of Staff and others who are part of this — the
President’s team.  And so, conversations certainly have had — have been
had.   
   
I don’t have a list of who’s been back and forth from here to — to the
Hill.   
   
So, it’s been — again, this is the President’s team, who has done this
many times before, on negotiating and finding compromise, especially on
important issues that matter to the American people.  
   
Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Two questions, if I can.  How concerned is the White House
that there seems to be very little movement on appropriations bills and
that when lawmakers get back into town after the holiday recess that
first funding deadline on January 19th will be very quickly
approaching?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, let’s not forget that that deal that was
made — as we’re talking about finding — negotiating and the President’s
team being able to deliver — right? — and working with congressional
members on the Hill — one thing that we want to be real clear, like
House Republicans should respect — right? — that bipartisan budget
agreement that was made.  
   
This is — two thirds of House Republicans voted on that bill.  Right? 
And — and it got bipartisan support from — obviously, from the House and
from the Senate.  And it is now law.  It is something that the Pres- —
they passed it out of the House, out of the Senate.  The President
signed it into law, and it is the law in — law of the land.  It is still
in effect.   
   
So, that should be honored.  And that certainly — it should be the full
— that full agreement — they should abide by that full agreement.   
   
Q    The second question.  This is a local story, but a pretty big local
story.  Does the White House have any reaction to the possible move of
two professional sports teams — the Wizards and the Capitals — and what
that might mean for the revitalization of downtown D.C. after COVID?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m going to be very careful.  They are private
organizations.  So, don’t want to comment on private organization.   
   
But what I can say more broadly — and I know you all are aware of this —
that the White House Chief of Staff, Jeff Zients, sent a memo to Cabinet
secretaries earlier this year on the importance of returning to — re- —
returning to the office.   
   
So, I’ll let D.C. government speak to its plans for — for downtown.  But
the White House has called for federal agencies to aggressively execute
plans to return to — to — to work and to return — obviously, return to
the office.   
   
So, that’s kind of how we’ve done our part here on the federal
government.  But as it relates to a private organization, I’m just not
going to comment on their decisions here.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Karine, there’s sort of an interesting problem brewing in Maine,
where the IRS has reversed its position in terms of taxing an energy
subsidy that was paid to people in the state.  It’s not a huge amount of
money, but it is really a frustration for the people there who were —
are angry about what they say is sort of a switch in position on the
IRS.   
   
So, have you had any contact with Maine about this?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —  
   
Q    And is this anything you can say?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Certainly, I would refer you to the IRS on that
particular question.   
   
I saw some of the reporting.  I haven’t had a chance to talk to — to the
team about this particular situation in Maine.  So, I would have to go
back to the team and ask them that question.  But in the meantime, I
would certainly refer you to the IRS on this.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then, I just have a question on this ongoing question
about inflation and how Americans feel about prices.  This year, the
Biden administration has made a big effort to sort of push Bidenomics
and go out into the country.  Do you anticipate doing more of that to
try to hammer home this message?   
   
And is there, especially sort of in — in some of the bigger categories —
rental — is there anything that you can do short of, you know — or — or
in addition to what’s already being done to just alleviate pressure for
Americans feeling the sustained brunt of this crisis?  So —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — inflation is coming down.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s moderating.  
   
Q    But prices are —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — still high —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
   
Q    — across the board.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I totally understand that.  That’s why the President
has said himself things are still unaffordable, right?  That’s what he
said just recently, just a couple of days ago on Tuesday.  And he said
he’s going to continue to do the work to make sure that we lower costs
for the American people, which he has done.   
   
We’ve talked about gas prices.  We’ve talked about the products that
people — you know, whether it’s a grocery store or a TV or what have you
— to make sure that costs go down.  We talked about junk fees; we talk —
where he’s going to talk about these rebate as it relates to
Medicare.   
   
And Inflation Reduction Act is so important in that vein — right? — and
the things that it’s been able to do to lower costs.   
   
Look, as it relates to Bidenomics, the President is — I just announced
at the top of the briefing — he’s going to go to Milwaukee.  He’s going
to talk about Biden- — Bionomics, investing in America, what — what
Bidenomics has done for the American people coming out of the
pandemic.  
   
We can’t forget what happened when the President walked in.  We saw a —
literally the economy at a tailspin.  And so, the President has been
working every day to get the economy back on its feet and make sure that
we’re building a middle class from the bottom up, middle out.  And
that’s what you’ve seen him do.   
   
And the data shows — as you just mentioned in your question — inflation
is moderating.  And you see jobs created — more than 14 million jobs. 
Unemployment is at — under 4 percent.  All of those things is pied
\[sic\] up — is part of Bidenomics.   
   
And you will certainly hear the President talk more about that over the
next couple months as we finish — finish out the — certainly the year.  
   
Go ahead, Steven.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Question on Ukraine and then one on the
impeachment inquiry.  
   
On Ukraine, President Zelenskyy told Speaker Johnson that additional
U.S. funding wasn’t so urgent, that it could perhaps wait another month
or two.  The White House has been communicating this is a much more
urgent matter.  Can you explain the disconnect?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t think there is a disconnect.  We’ve said by
the end of the year, we would be in a place where we wouldn’t be able to
help Ukraine.  We would — the — we would be running out of funds.   
   
I talked about this.  I think Karen asked me a question about how much —
how much of the funding is left.  I talked about it being about a
billion dollars left.   
   
We are in a place where if we don’t get that supplemental, we will not
be able to help Ukraine in the way that we have for almost two years as
they are defending their country, defending their democracy, defending
against Putin’s aggression.   
   
And we’ve heard — you heard the Admiral talk about — lay into what Putin
said — said today and how he wants to basically wipe off the map
Ukraine, and we cannot allow that.  We cannot — we have to be part of
making sure that Ukraine is able to — able to fight for their
democracy.  
   
So, we have some funds left.  Not much.  And we really need that
supplemental.  That’s why we call it an emergency national security
supplemental, because we need it.  Ukraine needs it.  They need to
continue to defend their country and fight against tyranny.  
   
Q    Thanks.  On the impeachment inquiry.  The House of Representatives
voted last night to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry that
started in September.  For a lot of people at home who only view this in
very broad strokes, can you explain to people why the President
interacted with so many of his relatives’ foreign associates and why he
continues to deny any interaction?  How should people think about
this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let’s be very clear here.  And I talked about
this yesterday, and I’ll talk about it a little bit more.  And the
President put out a statement yesterday that was very clear.  
   
It’s — you know, what we’re seeing from House Republicans is wasted
time, and it is certainly a, you know, baseless political stunt.  That’s
what we’re seeing.   
   
And they’re leaving — House Republicans are leaving this week to go, you
know, enjoy a nice holiday — right? — as most Americans should.  But
where — what happened to the funding to Ukraine?  You just asked me
about Ukraine.  They haven’t been able to get that done.   
   
They haven’t been able to fix — help us fix what’s going on at the
border.  They haven’t been able to get that done.  They haven’t been
able to start a conversation on how we’re going to avert a shutdown in
January.  They haven’t been able to do that.  
   
And so, look, you know, there has been zero evidence — zero evidence. 
You can ask me about engagement and what the President has done with his
family in conversation, but there’s no evidence.  There’s —  
   
Q    Well, because it’s —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait, wait.  But there’s no evidence.  There is no
evidence that the President has done wrongdoing.  There’s none. 
Absolutely none.  None.   
   
And that is just a fact.  You’ve heard it from Republicans themselves. 
So, they are wasting their time.  Instead of doing the work of — for —
on behalf of the American people, they go after the President’s family. 
That’s —  
   
Q    So —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But that’s a waste of time.  
   
Q    Is there an easy way to counter the central message, though, that
the President interacted with associates and has been lying about it
since?  What is the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President is not lying about anything when it — as
it relates to what House Republicans are trying to do.  It is baseless,
it is a political stunt, and he has — it has not proven that the
President has done anything wrong — anything wrong.   
   
And so, they are wasting their time.  They are wasting the American
people’s time.  And what they should be doing is the things that I just
listed.  They’re going to go home, but they haven’t taken care of what
we need to make sure that we are helping Ukraine.  There’s going to be
potentially a shutdown next month.  They have done nothing — nothing to
avert that shutdown.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    A few things.  Just to follow up on — you mentioned the concerns of
the Hispanic Caucus and some other groups.  Have they now been contacted
by White House officials and —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ve been —  
   
Q    — brought in to the ongoing conversations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ve been — we’ve been in touch with them.  That’s I
— that’s what I can say is we have — we’ve heard their concerns.  We’ve
had conversations.  We’ve been in regular touch.  I’m not going to go
into details of the conversation.  
   
Q    A few other things.  You keep mentioning how the House has left
town.  Would the President consider postponing any Christmas vacation
plans of his own —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we’re —  
   
Q    — if there’s no deal on Ukraine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re hoping that a deal is done.  I can’t talk about
changes in the President’s schedule.  We still have a week left — right?
— before that happens.  We know that the conversation is going well. 
Right?  It’s going in the right direction, we believe.  We’re encouraged
by that.  
   
The President’s team was — was on the Hill yesterday and also today —
I’m sorry, also Tuesday.  And so, that’s encouraging.  That’s
encouraging.  And that’s what we’re going to focus on.   
   
I just don’t have anything — we don’t have anything to share on his —
the President’s schedule.  He’s going to go, as you know, to Milwaukee
on — on Wednesday; and on Tuesday, he’s going to go to the National
Cathedral to — to give — give some words on behalf of San- — Sandra Day
O’Connor.  
   
Q    And as we near the end of the year — just traditional presidential
things — should we anticipate a year-end news conference?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You guys just — he just did a press conference.  
   
Q    He had a co-star.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He had a co-star —   
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
Q    And he took two questions.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  (Laughter.)  He took two que- — no, he took
more than two questions.  There were four — there were — there were two
plus two.  
   
Q    For America.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, for American press.  
   
Look, guys, I —  
   
Q    We’re a needy bunch.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You said it; not I, Ed.  Look, he did a two-plus-two
yest- — on Tuesday — gosh, the week is going by really fast — on Tuesday
with President Zelenskyy.  You heard the President speak — speak very
passionately and important — in an important way about the way forward
with the foreign policy, how he wants to move, certainly wants to make
sure we continue to aid Ukraine.  
   
I don’t have anything else to add about an end-of-the-year press
conference.  But the President is going to travel, as you know, on
Wednesday.  You’re going to hear from him today.  And so, you’ll
continue to hear from him before the end of the year, certainly.  
   
Q    What about pardons and commutations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, that’s a good question.  I don’t have anything on
that.  But that is a good question.  I know that tends to happen.  
   
All right.  Okay.   Go ahead.  
   
Q    On —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Last question.  
   
Q    Just a follow-up on inflation.  Housing costs have continued to go
up significantly, even as we’ve seen other prices moderate.  I know
that, obviously, you’ve said there’s more to do, but what specifically
can the White House do policy-wise here to make it easier for people to
afford rent, much less ever have a hope of buying a home?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it’s a — it’s a good question.  And you’re right. 
There are Americans who are very much still having a very hard time as
it relates to housing, paying their bills.  And so, what we have done
is, as you know, early on — very early on in this administration, we put
forth a housing plan — affordability plan that we believe is going to
try — try to get some of these — some of these families to get over
those hurdles.  And we’re talking about thousands of families.  
   
And we still need to do a lot more work on this.  But we certainly have
put forth a plan to make sure that we address some of the concerns.  And
that’s why lowering costs — the announcement today, the announcements
that we’ve made on junk fees, the announcements that we have done — that
we have made on lowering costs when it comes to gas or eggs and products
like that and TVs are all important for Americans.  
   
But you are right, there’s still more work to be done.  The President
has said this.  We put forth, like I said, a plan to reduce mortgage
insurance premiums, for example, to make sure that — you know, that
student loan borrowers qualify for mortgages.  That’s really important
as well.  
   
And so, that — we have taken some steps on the federal level to ease
that — to ease that burden on — on American families.  
   
Q    Okay.  And I know you don’t tell the Fed what to do from here.  But
in terms of people’s perception of the economy, of Bidenomics, how much
of a — how much of a factor do you feel like interest rates — you know,
the Fed is — where the Fed is setting interest rates plays into that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — I’m going to be —  
   
Q    Would it help —   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — really careful because even speaking on that is
speaking on the Fed.  It is, as you know, an independent agency.  Going
to be super mindful on that.  They make their own monetary policies. 
So, I’m just not going to speak to that.  
   
But obviously, we are — we are — certainly understand that there’s more
work to be done in lowering costs, but I’m not going to — I’m not going
to speak to the Fed’s policy — monetary policy.  
   
Thanks, guys.
