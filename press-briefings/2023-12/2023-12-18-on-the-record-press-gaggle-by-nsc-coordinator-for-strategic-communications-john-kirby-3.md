12:34 P.M. EST  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Hey, everybody.  First, to Israel.  I think you know, on
Friday, before Jake left Israel, he was told by the government of Israel
that they had made the decision to open its border crossing at Kerem
Shalom for direct delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in
Gaza.   
   
This is a significant step and something, again, that we’ve been asking
Israel to do.  On Sunday, the crossing opened, and for the first time
since the 7th of October, assistance flowed directly from Israel to
Gaza.  Yesterday, almost 80 trucks went through Kerem Shalom.  So, in
total, between that and what went through out of Rafah, nearly 200
trucks entered Gaza yesterday.  
   
Since the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. has been working to get
humanitarian aid into Gaza to alleviate the suffering of innocent
Palestinians.  And those efforts obviously will continue.   
   
At the same time, of course we continue to urge Israel to do everything
possible to prevent civilian casualties and to conduct their operations
as surgically and as precisely as possible.  This is something that we
have and will continue to engage with them on.  You probably saw that
Secretary Austin was in the region — in Tel Aviv today, and delivered
that same message to Defense Minister Gallant and to other Israeli
officials that he met with.  And, of course, he made that clear in his
press conference afterward.   
   
If I could just briefly go to Russia-Ukraine.  If you hadn’t seen it, we
can get you — point you to a notification done by the Defense
Department’s Comptroller, Mike McCord, who told Congress today that we
have allocated the remaining funding that’s available to restock U.S.
supplies and to replace what we’re sending to Ukraine.  That account,
which is known as replenishment authority, that’s the process by which
the Department of Defense buys new weapons and equipment from American
manufacturers.  
   
As the President spoke about in his Oval Office address last month, the
Biden administration has used this replenishment authority that Congress
has authorized in prior Ukraine supplementals to jumpstart and to expand
production lines in dozens of states across the country where weapons
and equipment of all manner and type can be produced, and, of course,
for American stocks to replenish and replace what we are sending to
Ukraine.  And that all, of course, supports good-paying American jobs in
the process.  It also is helping strengthen the production lines and
strengthen our relationship with the defense industry across the
country.   
   
We are still planning one more aid package to Ukraine later this month. 
However, when that one is done, as the Comptroller, Mr. McCord, made
clear in his note to Congress today, we will have no more replenishment
authority available to us.  And we’re going to need Congress to act
without delay, as we have been saying.  As Mr. McCord wrote, quote,
“Doing so is in our clear national interest, and our assistance is
vitally needed so Ukraine can continue its fight for freedom.”  
   
So, all of this, we need to keep in mind too, is happening in the
context of what Mr. Putin continues to do.  I mean, just over the last
24 hours, launching dozens of drones and at least one cruise missile at
Ukrainian cities in basically what’s become a nightly barrage.  And, of
course, it’s all happening in the context of Russian troops trying to
put together a ground offensive in eastern Ukraine.  Now, they have not
been enormously successful in doing that offensive, and one of the
reasons is because the Ukrainians are well-armed and well-resourced and
are able to defend against these offensive moves.   
   
Ukraine still needs our help.  And it’s well past time for Congress to
act to stand up for freedom and democracy in defense of our own national
security interests, which are very much at play here.   
   
With that, let me take some questions.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Zeke with the
AP.  
   
Q    Thank you for doing this, John.  I was hoping you could give us an
update on Bill Burns’s conversations in Warsaw.  And what is the U.S.
pushing for in terms of another pause in fighting in order to secure
another hostage release?  
   
And then separately, after the incident last week with Israeli soldiers
killing three hostages, does the U.S. have any concerns about Israeli
rules of engagement on the ground in Gaza?  Thank you.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Zeke.  I will refer you to our colleagues at the CIA
to speak about the director’s travel.  I made a strong rule not to talk
about his travel or meetings that he might be having, so I’ll refer you
to them.   
   
On the — another hostage deal, we continue to work really hard to try to
get another deal in place, which would, of course, be accompanied by
another humanitarian pause and hopefully some additional humanitarian
assistance.  But we aren’t — I can’t say that we are at a point where
another deal is imminent.  We are working literally every day on this,
on the ground and back here in Washington.  In fact, one of the things
that Jake talked about when he was in the region just in the last few
days was exactly this: trying to see that — test out the possibilities
for how close we could be.  
   
Now, we understand that the negotiators are — not us, but the
negotiators that are in question here have had some conversations in the
last couple of days.  We hope that that becomes a fruitful discussion. 
But I can’t promise you a date certain where we could get another one in
place; just that we’re continuing to work it really, really hard.  
   
And then, on your ROE question, I would say a couple of things.  First
of all, I won’t talk about Israeli ROE any more than I would talk about
American ROE.  
   
That said, the IDF admitted that they made a mistake very, very soon
after they made the mistake.  And I have no doubt that they will do the
forensics on this to learn what happened and how to avoid it happening
again.  It’s tragic.  It’s sad.  And you can’t imagine that those IDF
soldiers who pulled that trigger and killed those hostages feel very
good about what they did.  Of course not.  It’s a traumatic event.   
   
And they’ll — like I said, they’ll have to do the forensics on this to
figure out what happened.   
   
I — the last thing I’ll say on this, Zeke, is that sometimes an event
like this, a tactical event, does require you to take a look at your
rules of engagement and maybe make adjustments.  Sometimes not. 
Sometimes the issue isn’t the rules of engagement.  Sometimes it’s just
the way they’re enforced or the interpretation of it by a unit on the
ground or by an individual soldier.  And that’s why doing the forensics
on this is going to be so important for them to kind of figure out is
there a systemic issue, i.e. the rules, or was this an individual issue
— misunderstanding, miscalculation, fog of war.  I mean, we just don’t
know.  We don’t have the details.  
   
But I think it would — I think we should be careful at this early stage,
and certainly from here, from Washington, to point the fingers at the
exact rules of engagement.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Steve with
Reuters.  
   
Q    Hey, John.  Could you update us on the negotiations to try to get a
border deal that would unlock the Ukraine and Israel aid?  They had some
talks over the weekend.  Do you see any progress being made?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I want to be careful that I’m not negotiating this in
public, but there have — there were active discussions over the weekend,
and we here at the White House are involved in those discussions.  And
as the President has said, it’s important to move this forward, and he
is willing to negotiate in good faith, and he is willing to make
compromises both on the policy front and on the border security
front.   
   
But I think, really, Steve, I probably need to leave it there lest I
negotiate this in public, and I don’t want to say anything that would
put those discussions at any risk or peril.  
   
Q    And could you just also tell us about efforts to build this
maritime coalition against the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, our work is continuing to strengthen and bolster that
— it’s called the Combined Maritime Forces.  It’s an existing maritime
force under the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain.  And what we’re trying to do is
strengthen, bolster it, and operationalize it in ways that perhaps it
hadn’t been operationalized prior to these Houthi attacks.   
   
Secretary Austin will be having meetings in the region, tomorrow, on
this very topic.  And I highly suspect that you guys will all hear a
little bit more from him tomorrow about what direction this has taken,
and he’ll probably be able to provide a few more specifics.  But
obviously, those meetings and those discussions have to occur first
before he can do that, and I certainly don’t want to get ahead of
him.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Hiba Nasr.  
   
Q    Thank you, Sam.  Thank you, John.  John, I want to ask you about
the northern borders with Lebanon.  I know now you are negotiating maybe
a truce.  But on the long run, on the long term, how do you foresee the
situation there?  Is there a return to October 6?  What’s the America —
what are you suggesting to have in place on Lebanon?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, first I’d say: The continued attacks across that
border are of concern to us.  We don’t want to see the conflict
widened.  We don’t want to see a northern front opened up.  We want to
keep this — we want to keep this conflict focused, as it rightly should
be, on Hamas in the wake of October 7th.  
   
And so we’re in active discussions with our Israeli counterparts about
the activities going on up there at the northern border.   
   
And again, obviously, Israel has a right to self-defense, of course. 
But we don’t want to see — what we don’t want to see is a full-on
conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.  And of course, the attacks that
have occurred on the Lebanese Armed Forces are also deeply concerning
since the Lebanese Armed Forces are not part and parcel of this
conflict, nor do they want to be.  
   
So, again, we’re watching it real closely, and we’re in active
discussions.  And I think I probably just need to leave it at that.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nathan with KAN.  
   
Q    Thanks so much for taking my question.  I’d like to know if, at
this point after the conversations of Jake Sullivan and Secretary Austin
in Israel, does the U.S. have a better understanding of how to overcome
the impasse regarding the day after, with Netanyahu reiterating again
over the weekend that he does not see any role for the Palestinian
Authority in the future governing of Gaza?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Do we have an answer for the day after?  Is that what you
asked?  
   
Q    Yes.  Or any idea how to overcome Israel’s reluctance to have the
PA participate in it.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, look, the prime minister can speak for himself, as he
has.  All I can do is tell you where we are.  And nothing has changed
about our view that the Palestinian people deserve a vote and a voice in
their future, that they deserve competent, accessible, transparent
governance that actually makes an effort to meet their needs and to help
them achieve their aspirations for peace and security and justice.   
   
We believe that the ultimate answer to that is a two-state solution.  We
know that that’s not something that’s going to get turned on here
anytime soon.  But we do believe in the interim, post-conflict Gaza,
that the Palestinian Authority, revamped and revitalized, should and
could have a significant role in determining what governance in Gaza
looks like and being a part of those discussions.  And as a matter of
fact, that’s one of the reasons why Jake went to Ramallah and met with
Mahmoud Abbas on that very topic, to talk about what the possibilities
are for that.   
   
We haven’t changed our mind on that.  Again, I can’t — I won’t speak to
the Israeli view of this.  I can just tell you President Biden’s view. 
We still believe that that’s the right way forward, not just for the
Palestinian people but for the Israeli people as well.  And we’re going
to continue to have those conversations and continue to work towards
those goals.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Gabe with NBC.  
   
Q    Hey, thank you. I know you previously said that you didn’t want to
get into every single incident that happens, but I bring this one up
just because of the worldwide condemnation, also now from Pope Francis. 
What’s the U.S.’s response to this deadly church shooting where a mother
and daughter were killed allegedly by Israeli sniper?   
   
That question first, and then I have a follow-up on Ukraine.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, obviously, we’ve been closely following these alarming
reports coming out of the church compound this weekend.  
   
Let me just, right off the bat, as I’ve said before: Every civilian
death is a tragedy.  We’ve been very clear that we believe every effort
possible must be made to prevent civilian casualties.  Unfortunately, it
appears that, in this case, a mother and a daughter lost their lives. 
And our hearts go out to the families who are grieving their loved
ones.  
   
We have raised our concerns about this particular incident with the
Israeli government and about the need for those who have injuries or
have been wounded to be able to be safely evacuated so they can receive
appropriate medical treatment.  
   
More broadly, of course, we are in touch and will stay in touch with the
U.N. and our Israeli authorities about the need for deconfliction
channels, if you will, that can be respected so that when Israel is
conducting military operations against Hamas, that it does not, in the
process of prosecuting those targets, endanger civilians that are trying
to shelter themselves or humanitarian workers.  
   
So the need for better deconfliction, quite frankly, has also been a
topic of our discussion in multiple channels, including between the
President and the Prime Minister.  And it was absolutely something that
Jake raised when he was out there on the ground.  And I fully anticipate
that it was also part of Secretary Austin’s conversations as well.  
   
Q    And a follow-up on that, John.  Is it fair to say that the U.S. is
frustrated with the deconfliction methods so far that Israel has had?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think we believe, as I said earlier, Gabe, that more can
be done.  Deconfliction, we’ve seen it for ourselves in places where we
try to find and use deconfliction channels.  It can be very useful in
reducing miscalculation, reducing misunderstanding, reducing mistakes. 
And so we’re going to continue to urge them to do more in that vein, in
the deconfliction vein.  
   
Q    And finally, just one point of clarification.  You mentioned
Ukraine.  At first, you started to say that — it sounded like — that the
U.S. was going to run out of money for Ukraine.  Then you said you
expected one more aid package later this month.  To be clear, how much
money is left for Ukraine?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would refer you to DOD for an exact figure, Gabe, but we
believe we’ve got enough, in terms of replenishment authority, for one
more aid package before the end of this month.  And I don’t know what
that — you know, again, I’d refer you to DOD.  I don’t think — quite
frankly, Gabe, I doubt they’re going to give you a heads-up, exclusive
look about what’s going to be in that package.  
   
But, I mean — but we’ve got enough for one good aid package.  And what —
exactly what’s in it and the total sum, I couldn’t tell you right now. 
I have not seen a draft of that package, but we think we’ve got one more
left in us.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to MJ  
with CNN.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Could you give us a sense of where things stand with
the efforts to restart the hostages talks, particularly with the CIA
director meeting with the Qatari prime minister and the head of the
Mossad?  Just, what is the aim there?  We reported last week that Hamas
was being unresponsive to the recent overtures to bring Hamas back to
the negotiating table, and I wondered whether you can say whether that
has changed in recent days too.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’m not going to talk about the CIA director’s travel
one way or the other.  I’m not going to confirm or deny anything when it
comes to his travel or meetings.  
   
I would just tell you: Jake clearly brought this up in the region and in
all his meetings, talking not only to the Israelis but to other
partners.  I know Brett McGurk and David Satterfield continue to work
this almost by the hour to see if we can’t get another pause in place
and another hostage deal executed.  
   
But as I said at the top here of the gaggle, I can’t report to you a
date certain or tell you in good faith that there is another deal that’s
imminent.  All I can do is assure you that we continue to work this
very, very hard and literally every day, and that includes, of course,
the discussions that Jake had when he was out in the region.  
   
Q    I mean, is there concern that, you know, time is sort of running
out?  We have the deaths of the three Israeli hostages.  There’s the
testing of — you know, flooding of Hamas tunnels.  You know, and the
President himself said you can’t say with certainty that some of these
tunnels wouldn’t have American hostages.  And obviously, you know,
there’s the fact that you’re learning more and more about what these
hostages are enduring while in captivity.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Of course, we’re concerned about the tyranny of the clock. 
I mean, every minute that passes is a minute that they shouldn’t be held
hostage, is a minute that they’re in harm’s way, a minute that they
could be tortured, raped, beaten, or denied basic medical care.  I mean,
we have to assume that these people are being held in horrific
conditions.  
   
And so, that’s why when I say we’re working it hour by hour, that’s not
hyperbole.  That’s true.  There’s not an hour of the day that goes by
where — that our team is not trying to see if we can get the two sides
back at the table to negotiate another pause.  
   
Again, I won’t and I absolutely refuse to negotiate in public and talk
about the parameters of that discussion lest I say something that
torpedoes the chances.  But we are absolutely mindful of the sense of
urgency here to get these people back with their families where they
belong, sort of in the aggregate, but also get them out of these
horrific conditions so that they can get the medical care that they’re
clearly going to need after being held hostage now for more than two
months.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Vivian with the
Wall Street Journal.  
   
Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks so much for doing this.  I wanted to go back to
something you said, John, a couple of days ago, where you talked about —
there was a question about violations of international law by the
Israelis in Gaza.  And you said that, as far as the U.S. has seen,
there’s not — you haven’t seen evidence yet of violations of
international law, and so you cannot make any assessments about those
violations.  
   
But a moment ago, you just talked about the sniper attack on the mother
and daughter in a church, and there have been other incidents not to —
you know, not also to mention the fact that there was an issue with
regard to rules of engagement with the hostages and things like that.  
   
And so, I was just wondering if you can talk us through a little bit
what kind of evidence you’re looking for.  I mean, flashback to a year
and a half ago in the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and
the administration was quite forward-leaning about accusing Russia of
violations of international law.   
   
I know that you’ll probably make some distinctions between the Russians
invading Ukraine and this, but I’m hoping you can actually talk us
through it, because it doesn’t — it’s hard to see the distinctions from
our side of things and understand why certain incidents are not at this
point raising concerns, at least — instead of you saying there’s no
evidence, at least to talk about any concerns that the administration
might have about violations of international law.  Thanks.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  What I said was we’re not going to adjudicate each and every
tactical event, and we’re not going to start doing that now, in terms of
being judge and jury over each and every individual event.  
   
And I think the question you’re referring to is one I got about the
death of journalists.  And I said we had no indication that they had
been deliberately targeted by the Israeli military.  
   
But I think Ukraine — and what Putin is doing is not an apt comparison
here.  Torture, rape, slaughter of civilians, the destruction of
civilian infrastructure, terrorizing an entire population — all of that
is baked into Putin’s war plan, because he knows.  And the ground —
what’s going on on the ground bears it out, that he can’t defeat Ukraine
purely from a conventional military perspective because Ukraine is
better armed, better command and control, better resourced.  So what’s
he do?  He bombs energy infrastructure and tries to kill innocent
civilians and try to break the will of the Ukrainian population.  And
it’s — we’re helping the Ukrainians document these war crimes by Russian
soldiers on Ukrainian soil.   
   
And it’s blatant.  It’s actually — it’s deliberate and it’s just baked
into their psyche on how to try to win this war, taking the fight right
to innocent people with rape, torture, and slaughter.   
   
And that is exactly the same approach that Hamas has chosen to execute
when they violated a ceasefire that was in place on the 6th of October
and paraglided into a concert and started slaughtering innocent people
that were there to listen to some music, and murdering parents in front
of their kids and vice versa.  That was deliberate —  
   
Q    But, John, I understand — sorry to interrupt here.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, no, let me — nope, let me —  
   
Q    I understand there’s no question about — there’s no question about
Hamas’s actions.  But we’re talking about Israel now, and you yourself
just talked about an attack on a woman and a daughter in a church.  And
so I’m just sort of wondering: At some point, you know, is there any
condemnation of the Israeli military for its (inaudible), instead of
just talking about an unfortunate occurrence that has happened?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The Israelis are not making the slaughter, torture, and rape
of civilians in Gaza a war aim.  It’s not baked into their plans. 
They’re not deliberately trying to kill civilians.  
   
Now, again, I’ve said it before, I’ll say it a hundred times again: The
right number of civilian casualties is zero.  We don’t want to see a
single innocent person hurt or killed as a result of this conflict.   
   
And as I said in my opening statement, and Secretary Austin said today,
we continue to urge the Israelis to be as careful, deliberate, surgical,
and cautious as possible when it comes to minimizing civilian
casualties.  We don’t want to see them, as Secretary Austin has said,
find themselves maybe with a tactical victory but a strategic defeat
because of the way they have gone about prosecuting their operations.  
   
As I’ve also said, with respect to this church issue, we are deeply
concerned about it; we have raised specific concerns about it with our
Israeli counterparts, and we’ll continue to do so.  But we haven’t seen
any evidence that the Israelis are making it an aim of war and a
tactical, operational necessity to go out and slaughter innocent
people.  
   
Now, it is happening that people are being killed, people are being
wounded.  We recognize that.  But it’s a far cry from saying it’s a part
of the war aims as it was for Putin, as it was for Hamas.  And that was
my main point.  
   
Q    Okay.  I’m sorry, I don’t want to — I don’t want to keep on pushing
you.  I just — intent is not necessarily necessary for a violation of
international law.  And that’s the point I’m getting at — is, you know,
at some point, is the administration going to raise this as a concern,
not just in terms of its tac- — its — you know, its tactics, but in
terms of something even bigger than that?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Vivian, we have raised our concerns about civilian
casualties.  I mean, every single time we talk about it, we talk about
our conversations with the Israelis and urging them to be more careful. 
And as I’ve said in this issue with the church, we raised that specific
incident with them as well.  And I mentioned it — you know, it was in my
topper today.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Yuna with Israel
12.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you for this.  Hamas just released in the last,
actually, few minutes a new video of three elderly hostages pleading for
their release.  You probably haven’t seen it yet.  But in general, any
comment about the tactic — this kind of psychological terror that
they’re using?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I haven’t seen that video, so I can’t validate it.  And I
want to be careful that I don’t comment on something I haven’t seen and
we haven’t been able to prove in terms of the veracity of it.  
   
This is an organization that has a reputation for being brutal when it
comes to people it captures and certainly people that they hold
hostage.  
   
If this bears out to be true, it’s just another example of their
depravity and their brutality against innocent life and completely
unacceptable.  And it’s another indication of why, you know, as a
democracy, Israel is and we will continue to urge them to abide by the
law of armed conflict, but they’re up against an organization which is
both a terrorist organization and a military organization that doesn’t
even pretend to abide by the law of armed conflict.  
   
But again, I can’t prove the veracity of the video.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to JJ with
Bloomberg.  
   
Q    Hi there.  Is there any reaction you can share to Japan’s Nippon
Steel buying U.S. Steel?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Hey, I’ve seen those reports, JJ, but I’m just not going to
be able to comment on a private sector action.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Niels with Roll
Call.  
   
Q    Thanks for doing the call.  I just wanted to see — a bit of a
logistics question — whether or not there’s any update on when the
President is going to sign the NDAA and if there’s anything we should be
looking for in terms of a signing statement about concerns about areas
where it may impede his powers as Commander-in-Chief.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would just tell you to stay tuned on that.  I don’t have
any announcements to make.  Certainly won’t get ahead of the President. 
But, you know, just stay tuned.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Anita with VOA.  
   
Q    Thank you so much for doing this, John.  I’ve got a domestic
question today.  Does the White House see words like “poisoning the
blood of our country” as a national security threat for the 45 million
foreign-born people who live in this country?  And what are you doing to
reassure and protect these people against these possibly dangerous
words?  And then, how is that playing into the immigration discussions
that are happening right now?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think you hopefully will forgive me for not weighing into
comments about campaign rhetoric.  That wouldn’t be appropriate for us
here at the National Security Council.   
   
All I can tell you is that we’re in good-faith negotiations with members
of Congress about border security and, of course, funding for Ukraine
and for Israel as a part of that.  And the President, you know, again,
on day one, issued an immigration reform proposal that Congress has not
acted on.  He is willing, as he has said he is, to engage in
negotiations and compromises on both the policy, policies of
immigration, as well as actual security measures.  He understands the
complexities of the issue and, again, is willing to engage folks on the
other side of the aisle on those issues.  And that’s where his focus is
going to be.  We’re not going to react to every comment made on the
campaign trail.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Suzanne with The
Cipher Brief.   
   
Q    Hi, thank you so much for doing this.  I’m wondering, given the
political complications when it comes to U.S. aid to Ukraine, is there a
plan B for Ukraine?  In other words, are there ways to speed up aid that
has already been approved?  And what about the role of the private
sector here?  Does the administration see the private sector as a force
multiplier?  Thank you.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We have, as I said, one more aid package left in us here
before our replenishment authority dries up.  And we think we would have
one more here by the end of the month.  And we need the supplemental
funding to be able to continue to support Ukraine.  And as we’ve said,
you know, by the end of the month, that dedicated funding for Ukraine is
not going to be there.   
   
And on your second question, I mean, the short answer is yes.  I mean,
the defense industry has been, and we anticipate will be, a significant
partner, not only assuming we can get the supplemental funding in
supporting Ukraine, but in supporting our own defense industrial health
and improving our own national security by keeping production lines
open, advancing the development of systems and the development of new
systems.  That will not only increase our ability to help Ukraine defend
itself and beat back the Russians on Ukrainian soil, but also help our
own national security by replenishing the shelves in our warehouses with
better and more advanced capabilities and systems.  
   
So they are very much a partner in this effort.  And Secretary Austin
and the Deputy Secretary, Kat Hicks, has been — they’ve been working
very, very hard on that exact issue, which is shoring up our
relationships with the defense industry and, I would also add,
participating in the meetings over at Commerce a week or so ago, when —
with Ukrainians, which was all about not only helping our defense
industrial base get a better grip on what the needs are going to be
going forward, but how they can work in partnership with Ukraine’s
defense industry so that post-conflict Ukraine can have as much — have
as resilient and as vibrant a defense industrial base as possible.  
   
So, it’s a long-winded answer, but yes, we absolutely see our defense
industry as a partner here.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you all.  I’m afraid that’s all the time we have
today.  But as always, if we weren’t able to get to you, feel free to
reach out to the NSC Press distro, and we will get back to you as soon
as we can.  Thanks.
