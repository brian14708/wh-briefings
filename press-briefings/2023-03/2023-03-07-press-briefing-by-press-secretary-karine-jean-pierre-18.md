James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:46 P.M. EST  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everyone.

Q    Good afternoon.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  A couple things at the top, and then we’ll get
started.  
   
I wanted to start today by addressing the announcement by Mexican
officials regarding the status of the four Americans attacked in
Mexico.  
   
We’re still working with Mexican officials to learn more and to have all
Americans returned to the United States.  President Biden has been kept
updated on this incident.  Senior members of the White House has — have
also been engaged.  
   
We extend our deepest condolences to their families and friends.  
   
For the sake of privacy and out of respect to the families, we are going
to refrain from further comment about those circumstances at this
time.  
   
I can confirm that U.S. officials are in touch with the families of the
individuals.  But, again, we will respect their privacy regarding our
conversations with them.  
   
We appreciate the hard work of the Justice Department and the FBI, DHS,
and DEA for their swift response to this awful incident and for their
continued collaboration with Mexican authorities.  
   
These U.S. agencies remain in close touch with their counterparts, and
we expect that they will share more as they can.  
   
Attacks on U.S. citizens are unacceptable, no matter where or under what
circums- — circumstances they happen.  
   
We will continue to work closely with the Mexican government to ensure
justice is done in this case.  
   
Since day one of this administration, we have been focused on disrupting
transnational criminal organizations, including Mexican drug cartels and
human strugglers — smugglers.  Pardon me.  
   
In the past few months, President Biden signed an executive order giving
the Department of Treasury expanded authorities to penalize cartel
organizations and those who control or enable them.  And we have imposed
powerful new sanctions against cartel organizations in recent weeks.  We
remain committed to applying the full weight of our efforts and
resources to counter them.  
   
Right now, our immediate concerns are for the safe return of our
citizens, the health and wellbeing of those who — who survived this
attack, and the support which must be rendered to the families of those
who — who do — who need it.  
   
Now I want to move on to the news that we put out this morning.  As you
know, President Biden put forward his plan to protect and strengthen
Medicare by extending it for another generation.  
   
The President’s Budget does this without cutting any benefits.  In fact,
he lowers costs for seniors with lower out-of-pocket costs for drugs, a
$2 cap on cost-sharing for generic drugs for chronic conditions, and
lower behavioral healthcare costs, as well.  
   
Instead of cutting benefits, as MAGA Republicans in Congress have
suggested, the President’s budget asks the wealthy to pay their fair
share and cuts subsidies to Big Pharma.

The President is pr- — is proposing to do the following: increase the
Medicare tax rate on income above $400,000; close loopholes in existing
Medicare taxes; and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices
for more prescription drugs.  
   
The President would not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000
a year, and he will not cut benefits for any seniors.  But he will make
sure Medicare is there for people who earned it through their work —
hard work.  
   
Also, as you saw this morning, we announced that President Biden and
First Lady Jill Biden will host President and First Lady of the Republic
of Korea for a state visit in the United States.  
   
The visit will include a state dinner, will be the second state visit of
the Biden administration — Biden-Harris administration.  
   
Under President Biden, we have taken the U.S.-ROK partnership to
unprecedented heights in a way that benefits our economies and our
people, and strengthens deterrence in Indo-Pacific region.  
   
For example, the ROK has invested tens of billions of dollars into the
United States.  These are investments that will bring our country — our
two countries even closer together, help strengthen our supply chains,
and give our economies a competitive edge.  
   
We have strengthened our defense and security partnerships bilateral to
advance — bilaterally to advance deterrence and peace across the
Indo-Pacific.  
   
And we’ve supported ROK and Japan as they’ve worked to increase
cooperation amongst each other, effectively strengthening the
U.S.-ROK-Japan trilateral partnership.  
   
The United States-ROK alliance is more than a military or security
partnerships.  It has grown into a truly global and future-oriented
alliance.  
   
Our countries also hold strong people-to-people ties.  The United States
is home to a large number of Americans with Korean heritage, and our
countries share more — many cultural interests, including in music,
television, and movies.  
   
This state visit will only strengthen our — deepen U.S.-ROK ties, and we
are looking forward to celebrating the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK
alliance here at the White House.

I also wanted to say a few words on the continued attacks that we are
seeing from Republican officials on women’s healthcare, like we have —
we saw today — earlier today.

Republican state legislators in Florida proposed, today, a bill that
would ban abortion before many women know if they are even pregnant,
virtually eliminating a woman’s right to make healthcare decisions about
her own body.

This ban would prevent not just the nearly 4 million Floridi- — Florida
women of reproductive age from accessing abortion care after six weeks,
but it would also impact the nearly 15 million women of reproductive age
who live in states across the South with abortion bans and would no
longer be able to rely on Florida as an option to access care.  
   
We know that these bans are already having a devastating impact on
women’s health.  In a case filed today in Texas, we unfortunately heard
devastating firsthand accounts of women’s lives almost lost after they
were denied the healthcare they needed.  Horrifying details of needless
pain.  All because of extreme efforts by Republican officials to take
away a woman’s ability to make her own healthcare decisions.  
   
Politicians like Governors DeSantis and Abbott espouse, quote, “freedom
for all,” unquote, while directly attacking the freedom to make one’s
own healthcare decisions. 

Their rhetoric doesn’t come without consequences here.  The stories told
today, in 2023, in the United States of America, are shameful and
completely unacceptable.  
   
Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, the President and the Vice
President believe women should be able to make healthcare decisions with
their own doctors and families, free from political interference. 
Period.

They are committed to protecting access to reproductive care and
continuing to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade
in federal law.

And finally, I want to say a few words today about the actual date of
the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, which is today.

As you all know, the President traveled to Selma on Sunday to
commemorate this important day so that history can’t be erased.  He
talked about how the continued fight for voting rights is integral to
delivering economic justice and civil rights for Black Americans across
the country.  
   
And today I wanted to highlight some of the historic gains the President
has made on racial equity.

Two years into this administration, the President has done the
following: brought Black unemployment to near-historic low; provided
almost $6 billion to HBCUs; lowered prescription drugs and energy costs
for seniors; nominated more Black women to federal courts than any —
than any President before him; cut Black child poverty in half; and this
administration is replacing lead pipes and delivering clean water across
America.  
   
There’s more work to be done.  And we understand, the President
understand that we need to continue fighting to finish the job.

With that, Colleen, you want to kick us off?

Q    Sure.  Thank you.  So the President said that his budget is going
to extend Medicare solvency for, I think, 25 years.  Can you walk us
through the math a little bit on how that would work?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m not going to — I’m not going to get into — dive
into the math here.  The President is going to lay out his budget, as
you know, on Thursday, which will be very detailed and transparent,
which is something that the President said he was going to do to make
sure that the American people see for themselves how the President sees
moving forward on the economy and doing it in a fiscally responsible
way.

As you know, you’ve heard me say many times, we welcome Republicans to
do the same — House Republicans to put forth their budget — and also in
a transparent way.

So I’m not going to go — I’m not going to break it down into specifics
here.  Again, it’ll be transparent, and you all will see it on Thursday.

But I’ll say more broadly, as it relates to Medicare and the
announcement that we made — we made today: As you know, Americans have
been paying into this particular program since their first job, some of
them since they were teenagers.  And elected officials — we believe, the
President believes — has a duty to ensure this lifes- — life- — lifeline
is available for generations to come.

And so we’re going to do this.  We’re going to make sure that rich pay
their fair share and by — cutting Big Pharma subsidies to lower costs
for seniors and ensure Medicare’s durability aren’t big ask.  And we
believe that this is an obligation.  This is an obligation that elected
officials have.

And, again, you’ll see more of the President’s budget on Thursday.

Q    On immigration: So, we’re hearing that this idea to detain families
in detention, again, is one of a lot of policies that are currently
under consideration as Title 42 restrictions are going to possibly end
on May 11.  So I wondered if you can rule out family detention or what
can you say about the idea that, you know, families may or may not be
detained — migrant families may or may not be detained at the border.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m not going to go in on rumors that are out there
or conversations that are happening at this time.   
   
The department, as you know — as you just noted, Colleen, the Department
of Homeland Security is certainly to — is certainly continuing to
prepare for the eventual lift of Title 42.  No decisions have been
made.   
   
But we’ve been very clear on how we’re looking — how the President wants
to move forward.  And he’s been clear from the start, from the beginning
of his administration: by putting forth a comprehensive immigration
reform.  And his approach has been making sure that we expand legal
pathways for asylum seekers, limiting illegal immigration, addressing
root causes, and also increasing border security.  That’s how the
President has seen the process moving forward.  That has been his
approach.   
   
And what he wants to do is build a system, build an immigration system
that is secure, that is orderly, and that is humane.  And that’s how
we’re going to move forward as we — as we, you know, look — look towards
Title 42 eventually lifting.  As you know, it’s going to be as soon as
May 11th.  And that’s going to be the President’s focus.  
   
Go ahead, Mary.  
   
Q    I understand no decisions have been made.  But, you know, the
President, shortly after he came to office, put an end to this policy of
detaining migrant families as a candidate.  He said, “We should not be
locking people up.”   
   
You aren’t ruling it out either.  So why is this even being considered
as a possible option now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not com- — I’m just not going to comment on
rumors that are out there.  I’m not saying it’s being considered.  I’m
not saying any —  
   
Q    But you’re not saying it’s not.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But I’m not saying it is, and I’m not saying it is
not.  I’m saying that I’m not going to speak to rumors.  There are
rumors out there.  Clearly, the Department of Homeland Security is
working through ways on how to move forward once Title 42 is lifted. 
I’m just not going to get into speculations.  I’m going to let them do
their work.   
   
And what I will say, and I just laid this out for Colleen: We have laid
out over and over and over again putting forth policies on how the
President sees the process moving forward.  Right?  He is going to use
the tools that he has before him to make sure that we deal with an
immigration system or we build an immigration system that’s, again,
safe, orderly, and humane.  
   
And we’ve increased — expanded legal pathways for immigration.  We have
tried to limit — worked very hard to limit illegal immigration into this
country by — also by making sure that the border was secure.   
   
Again, this is something that Republicans could work with us on.  He put
forward an immigration policy — a comprehensive immigration policy — on
day one.  But what we’re seeing on the other side is political stunts. 
That’s what they want to do.  We’re not looking to do political stunts;
we’re looking to deal with a real issue.   
   
Q    I imagine the President is looking for a way to tackle this issue
that is safe, orderly, and humane.  Is there ever an instance in which
he thinks detaining migrant families can be safe, orderly, and humane?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to get into — again, that’s diving
into speculation that out — that’s out there, conversation — rumored
conversations.   
   
What I can lay out to you is his approach.  And it’s been — we’ve been
very clear on our approach these past two years.   
   
Q    Is there — just one more.  Is there a hope here that by — that the
threat of family detention may be a deterrent?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, this is a rumored conversation that I’m just not
going to weigh in even by answering that question.  I’m just not going
to weigh into rumors that are out there.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    So, on the inflation question, Chair Powell has been testifying
today, has sent some very, very strong signals to the market that, you
know, rate increases could be coming.   
   
I realize you can’t speak about the Fed, but what is your sense about
the questions that they were getting about the role that corporate
profits have played in fueling inflation and whether that is, you know,
an important factor to consider?   
   
And what would you say about just the January data, you know, in terms
of waiting to see perhaps if there should be — if there would be — if
that data is confirmed?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I just want to be very careful.  You stated it, but
I have to state it from here that the Fed is independent, and we do not
comment on their policy.  So I want to be very mindful.   
   
The President believes that it’s important to give the Fed the space
needed to make decisions on monetary policy.  And so we’re going to do
that.  
   
As it relates to inflation, our economists have been very clear — view —
as you’re asking me about data, they view the recent inflation data — or
recent inflation, more specifically, and jobs data as well — as evidence
that the President’s economic plan is working.   
   
We’re seeing inflation starting to moderate.  Inflation has come down
than where it was almost a year ago.  If you look at it more globally
and where — you look where we were a year ago, we have seen inflation
moderate.  
   
And so — and this is happening while the President has continued to grow
the economy.  You’ve heard us say this many times: We’re an economy that
comes — that grows from the bottom up, middle out.   
   
And so, that’s what we’re focused on.  We’re focusing on what we can do
as well to lower costs for American families.  That’s what you’re going
to see from the President’s budget on March 9th.  And that’s how — what
you’re seeing from what we even announced today with Medicare, that is
what’s important to the President as well.  
   
As it relates to, you know, Chair Powell being — being –being on the
Hill, doing the hearing, I’m just not going to comment on any specifics
to that.   
   
Q    So your FCC nominee apparently has withdrawn their nomination.  Can
you confirm that that has happened?  And what is your take on why?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So just a couple of things we want to say on that.  We
appreciate Gigi Sohn’s candidacy for this important role.  She would
have brought tremendous ta- — intellect and experience, which is why the
President nominated her in the first place.   
   
We also appreciate her dedication to public service, her talent, and her
years of work as one of the nation’s leading public advocates on behalf
of American consumers and competition — with thanks to Chair Cantwell
and others for supporting the work of this nomination.   
   
With respect to future candidates, though — I know many people are going
to start asking me about that — we — we don’t have any updates to share
at this time.  But again, we appreciate her candidacy and — and — for
this important role.  
   
Q    And then, just one quick one on foreign policy.  There’s reports
out today that intelligence believes that a Ukrainian organization was
involved in the Nordstream Two sabotage.  Can you tell us whether you
think this was a subject that — did Chancellor Scholz and President
Biden discuss that when they met at the White House?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So what I can say is: Several — as you know, several
of the European partners — our European partners — Germany, Sweden and
Denmark — have opened investigations into what happened, and those
investigations are currently ongoing.  So I’m not going to get ahead of
them from here.   
   
Would refer you to the respective European countries for comments on
their own investigation.  I’m just not going to go beyond the readout
that we provided on Friday with the Chancellor’s visit here.  
   
Q    Just circling back to immigration quickly, there’s clearly a policy
process underway right now where the agencies that are lead on this are
considering options based on the lifting of Title 42.    
   
I guess my question is: Has the President been briefed on the
possibility of reinstating the migrant family detention policy?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any — any conversations to read out on
the President’s — the President being briefed specifically on family
detention.   
   
What I can say is — again, these are rumored conversations.  And as you
just said, Phil, there is continued conversations, policy discussions
occurring right now — as we’re speaking about the Department of Homeland
Security, clearly, which is taking the lead on this — on how to move
forward once Title 42 is lifted.  We’re going to let them do that
process and do that work.   
   
But the President’s approach, again, has been very, very clear.  You’ve
seen it over and over again.  You’ve heard him speak about it; you’ve
heard me speak about it.  We want to make sure that we’re expanding
legal pathways for asylum seekers, limiting illegal immigration,
addressing root causes, and increasing order and security.  And we —
border security, pardon me.   
   
And we want to do this as we build a system.  Our approach — our — our
approach is to build a system that is safe, that is orderly, and that is
humane, and that’s what you’re going to see from this President.   
   
Q    And then, on foreign policy.  Comments from Chinese officials over
the course of the last 48 hours.  Xi Jinping warning comprehensive —
we’re talking about a comprehensive “containment” and “suppression” by
the West, led by the U.S.  The foreign minister with very direct
comments today, warning of potential conflict and confrontation if the
U.S. continues on the, quote, “wrong path.”  
   
I’m wondering what your national security team or what the President
views as the intent of the very direct comments from these officials.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I can’t speak to the intent from Chinese
official.  What I can speak to is how we’re approaching this.  The
President’s approach to China has not changed.   
   
And, again, we’ve been very clear, we do not seek conflict, and we do
not want conflict.  What we’re seeking is competition, and we’ve been
very clear about that these past two years.   
   
The President will always defend American interests, as you all know,
but he has been clear we want — we need to keep open lines of
communication.  And we will manage this consequential — we see this as a
consequential relationship that we will — we will continue to manage. 
And the President, his team has been focused on doing just that.   
   
But I’m — I’m certainly not going to comment on the intent of Chinese
officials.  
   
Go ahead, Michael.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Back on the issue of Mexico and the four Americans
that were kidnapped there.  What is the administration’s message to
Americans who are currently in  
Mexico or planning to go there?  Should they continue with those plans? 
Or is it safe to go to Mexico?  What is the administration’s message to
those folks?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we — we take it very seriously when it comes to —
and have a commitment to provide U.S. citizens with clear, timely, and
reliable information about every country in the world so they can make
informed sta- — informed travel decisions.  As you all know, the State
Department is clearly a department that is focused on that and give that
information and do the travel advisory.   
   
And so when it comes to the travel advisory for this particular loca- —
area in Mexico, that remains at Level 4: “Do not travel due to crime and
kidnapping.”  We’ve been very clear about that.  The State Department,
again, has put that out.   
   
We urge Americans to read these alerts before traveling.  And — and so
we’ll leave it there.   
   
But, again, our commitment to this — we take this seriously to make sure
that we — we do everything that we can so that Americans understand, you
know, what is — what is safe and what to look out for as their travel —
or when — or when they’re in a specific country.  
   
Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Does this situation in Mexico indicate that the
U.S. needs to be doing more to tackle Mexican organized crime?  And if
so, what?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the President from — the President — or, I should
say, this administration from day one has made sure, as it relates to
the safety — I know some folks have asked if we are concerned about
these individuals actually coming and crossing the border and coming
into the U.S.   
   
So, you know, DHS screens and vets every individual encountered at the
border.  The President has secured record levels of funding for border
security and management, including 2,300 — 23- — I should say, 23,000
border officials, which is a historic amount of border officials to help
at — at — with the security process at the border.   
   
And we have stepped up coordination with government of Mexico to ensure
security along our shared border.  As you know, the President was
recently in Mexico City.  He met with — with AMLO to talk — that was one
of the conversations that were had, that was part of the agenda.   
   
And so we’re going to continue to do that — those coordination.  And —
and we’re going to continue to do everything that we can to secure the
border.  
   
Q    These individuals were reportedly going across the border to Mexico
for medical care.  There are a lot of Americans who cross the southern
border for medical care or for prescription drugs.  What is the advice
to those individuals?  Should they avoid doing that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m not going to speak specifically to — I know — I
know it’s ongoing.  I know there’s a lot of comments out there as to
what these four individuals were going to do.   
   
So I would say the federal law enforcement has been in touch — has been,
you know, doing — leading this investigation — clearly in touch with
family members.  And so I’m just going to be really careful on
commenting why they were crossing the border.  Those are privacy cons- —
private considerations.   
   
But, again, I just laid out moments ago, when Michael was asking me the
qu- — the question about the Americans in Mexico or thinking about
traveling to Mexico: The State Department puts out these alerts, has
been — has tried — tries very hard to communicate what’s going on — this
— their own safety — for their own safety in certain countries.  And I
would — I would make sure that if Americans are thinking about traveling
to Mexico, that they certainly heed the call from the State
Department.   
   
This particular area, as I just mentioned, is at Level 4, and so folks
need to be really careful.   
   
Q    And then, finally, one of your top spokespeok- — spokespeople we
learned today is stepping down.  She played a prominent role on the pla-
— past Biden campaign.  Should we take this as a sign that perhaps
she’ll be serving on a Biden re-election campaign?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  I certainly — as you know, I’m going to be
very careful from here speaking about a re-elect or 2024.  But I do want
to say some — some — some words about Remi.  
   
Remi is a — is a good friend.  I have gotten to know her very well over
the past three years.  As you know, she was on the campaign as — I think
you just mentioned that.  And the President said himself she is — she
has been an unfailing loyal fighter for him and for the team and — going
back to the campaign, even before it launched.  And we are very sad to
see her go.  She has a range of talents, as she possesses for a
communication professional, and she is one of a kind.   
   
And we are sadly going to miss Remi.  And we wish her the best.  And
there’s truly — truly no — no better colleague that I have gotten to
know these past three years.   
   
Q    But no words about her next steps?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  You would have to ask Remi.  I can’t speak
to her next steps.  What I can say is how wonderful she has been as a
friend and a colleague these past three years.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Governor Newsom in California announced that he
would halt state contracts with Walgreens over their decision to stop
dispensing abortion medicine — medication.  I’m wondering if that’s a
step the President would consider on a federal level.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I — you know, I’ll say this: Our focus right now
remains on continued access to medication that women and providers rely
on for abortion care and miscarriage management.  That’s always — that’s
what we have been very steadfast on.  That’s why the President issued
his recent presidential memorandum in January that aims to preserve
continued access to a safe drug that — and we’ll emphasize this again —
is used for miscarriage management and abortion.   
   
So we understand the concerns faced by pharmacies, which is why the
President’s memorandum emphasizes the administration’s readiness to
support patients, providers, and pharmacies who want to legally access
or provide this — this particular drug.   
   
So I do want to speak — to say one note about Walgreens: They clarified
its position on working toward providing this medication where it is
legal.  But I refer you to the companies of the — or the states for any
follow-up.   
   
Again, we are — we have a focus and to make sure that women have access
to important healthcare needs.  And the President is going to continue
to fight for this.  You’ve heard the Vice President over the last couple
of months also continuing to speak on this.  And that’s what you’re
going to hear from this administration.  
   
Q    The President — this announcement this morning on Medicare —
largely paid for that extension through an increase in payroll taxes on
those making over $400,000 a year.  Can we expect, since the President
has also made Social Security a key sort of plank of his economic plan,
that we should see a similar increase in Social Security taxes?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m not going to get into — we shared Medicare
today.  And we’ll shu- — we’ll share probably more parts of his budget
in the upcoming day or two.  Just not going to get into specifics on
that.   
   
But I will say the President’s commitment hasn’t changed.  What we see
right now is that, you know, the biggest threat to Social Security are
Republicans.  And you’ve heard them, you guys have covered them — what
congressional Republicans have said, their relentless drive to — to cut
these important programs for Americans, for — for our veterans, for our
— our — you know, our seniors.   
   
And so, again, we look forward to seeing the — to seeing the Republicans
share their plan with the American people since they have promised that
they’re going to put a budget forward.   
   
But I’m just not going to get ahead of the President.   
   
I’ll say this as well: You know, the President is also open to proposals
that extend Social Security trust fund — trust fund without cutting
Social Security benefits.  That is something that we have spoken to and
talked about.  So he’s open to that — those types of proposals.  But
again, his — his commitment to fighting for Social Security hasn’t
changed.  
   
Q    And then, one last one.  Secretary Raimondo suggested that banning
TikTok was a bad idea politically because you’d, quote, “literally lose
every voter under 35.”  The administration’s review of TikTok has been
going on for more than two years now, which is — which I think many
critics have said suggests some level of foot dragging is —  
   
Are these two things related?  Is the political concern what is
preventing the administration from taking action?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I mean, this is not about a political concern. 
This is about making sure that we do the right thing for the American
people.  But I — you know, again, we’re working with Congress to address
concerns posed by apps like TikTok.  I don’t have anything else to
share.   
   
I know there’s legislation that’s being thought about or going to be put
forward.  But we’re going to continue to work Congress on that.   
   
I just don’t have anything more to share.  We’ve been — I was asked this
question yesterday.  We’ve been very clear on where we stand on this
particular issue.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  On immigration, among the plans or the strategy
for border security, how much does deterrence work — and using
deterrence policies work into the strategy for the administration?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Can you say — can you say more?  
   
Q    I mean, a lot of administrations in the past have used deterrence
as part of their border security — border security strategy.  How much
is deterrence and sending a message and then using policies that would
deter migration going to be part of the administration’s policy moving
forward from Title 42 — after Title 42?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean, if you look at what the President has put
forward in the past — and, I mean, in the past several months with — you
know, since the beginning of this year, when he expanded the parolee
program, right?  That was a way to give an opportunity to folks who are
seeking asylum to find a way to get to apply or to come to the U.S. in a
— in a — in a legal — in a legal way.  Right?  When you think about what
we were able to do, how we expanded that parolee program for Nicaragua
and Cubans and Venezuela — Venezuelans and also Haiti — Haitians, it was
a way to provide an opportunity to do that.  Right?  So then —  
   
Q    But I’m talking about border security though.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, but I — but I’m — but that was a deterrence from
coming to the border and a way for them to stay at home and — and find a
way and use the app to come to — into the U.S. 

And so, that is a way — an incentive, an option, a path, if you will —
for them to use to — to — to figure out how can they — how can they do
this in a legal pathway.

So those are humane ways of doing this.  Those are ways of making sure
that we’re dealing with border security.

As far as, you know, the word “deterrence” and — and policies
specifically to that, like hard — hard policies specifically to that:
Look, the Presi- — the President has been very clear on his approach. 
He wants to make sure that we do this in an orderly way, a humane way,
and do it in a way that is — that still expands legal pathways but also
deals with illegal migration.

Don’t have anything more specifics on that — on the “deterrence”
language that you’re asking me about.

What we’re — what we’re going to do is put forth policies and use the
tools to do just that: to build that system, that border system that
was, by the way, decimated by the last — by the last administration.

Q    So, in terms of that, of the system being decimated, now you’ve had
two years to rebuild the system.  You’ve been working on the eventual
end of Title 42 since the beginning of the administration — working with
groups on a plan.  How confident should Americans be, come May, that the
system will work?  And that — how confident should they be that the —
the administration is prepared and the system won’t be overwhelmed?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just give you a few data points on what
we’ve been able to do — right? — which is migration from Honduras.  If
you look at migration from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, where
our root causes work is focused on, is down by 71 percent since 2021. 
That is the work that this administration has done.

I just talked about migration from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and
Haiti.  That is down by 90 — more than 95 percent since we expanded the
parole program.  That was just — parolee program — which was just a
month or two ago.  And that was, again, the President is using the tools
that he has in front of him to deal with a real issue. 

Again, Republicans are not doing anything.  They’re doing political
stunts.  And the President is actually taking action. 

Now, he put forth a piece of legislation on his first day in this
administration — a comprehensive immigration policy legislation.  We
would love to move that forward.  But until then, we have to use the
tools that we have in front of us to get this done.

Go ahead.

Q    Thank you.  Just following up on China.  Is the President concerned
that a cold war with China is veering into a hot war?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So the President, actually, was asked this recently,
and I’ll — I’ll — you know, I’ll let his words stand.  I think he was
asked this about a week or two ago.  So, won’t get ahead of the
President or won’t say more than what the President has stated.

Look, we have been very clear on our approach.  It’s not changed.  We
want an approach of — of competition, not conflict.  And we believe we
are more prepared to outcompete China and protect our national
security.  And that is because of the work that this President has done
from day one of this admini- — administration.

And if you look at many of our efforts towards China, there have been —
it’s been — it’s been pursued in a bipartisan fashion.

But I’m not going to — the President was literally asked this very
similar question, so I’ll — I’ll refer you to his comments.

But again, our approach to China has not changed.

Go ahead, Peter.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  So cartels kill Americans on this side of the
border with drugs, and now they’re killing Americans on the other side
of the border with guns.  Why is President Biden so comfortable with
cartels operating so close to the U.S.?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let’s be very clear.  Let me take on the drug
part here because — since you brought this up.

Because of the work that this President has done, because of what we’ve
done specifically on fentanyl at the border, it’s at historic lows —
historic levels that we have been able to record a number of personnel
working to secure the border because of what we’ve been able to do,
seizing that fentanyl.  We’ve done it in a historic way.  That’s because
of what this President has done. 

I just talked about 23,000 federal agents that have been able to be —
that we’ve been able to hire and put at the border to secure the border.

On top of that, historic sanctions going after traffickers and other
financiers are helping disrupt fentanyl supply chains throughout their
flow to the U.S. 

And we’ll — we — we’re really expanded access to treatments like — that
are saving lives, if you think about it, which prevent overdoses,
expanding as — as are fentanyl test strips.  And through the removal of
the X-Waiver, anyone registered to prescribe controlled medications can
now prescribe lifesaving medication to treat addiction.

So, again, we are seizing fentanyl at record historic levels because of
what the — because of the — of what the President has done to secure our
border.

And, look, we’ve also coordinated — made sure that we’re coordinated our
— our relationship with Mex- — with Mexico to deal with what we’re
seeing as it relates to violence, as relates to cartel.  That is
something — a relationship that we’ve continued to build with Mexico, an
incredibly important partner.  You saw that when he went down for the
summit in Mexico City.   
   
So, the President is dedicated to this and is doing the work that we’re
actually seeing at the border, again, when you — we think about
fentanyl.

Q    But to the violence aspect of it: Now Americans are being
slaughtered.  Would President Biden be taking the same approach if it
was al Qaeda or ISIS operating just across the border from an American
city?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President takes this very seriously.  He takes
this very seriously.  The FBI and other agencies have been on top of
this from day one.  And so that’s what he’s going to continue to do. 

When it comes to Americans’ lives and when it comes to their — the
safety of Americans, the President is always going to make sure that
that is a top priority.

Q    Would President Biden ever consider using the U.S. military to
disrupt cartel operations?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — I’m just not going to get into the military and
how it’s being used.

Go ahead.

Q    I want to go back to the question about the FCC nominee.  Gigi Sohn
has a statement to the Washington Post in which she says that her
nomination failed because of what she calls “unrelenting, dishonest, and
cruel attacks.”  She calls it “a sad day for our country…” when — “…and
our democracy when dominant industries, with assistance from unlimited
dark money, get to choose their regulators.”

Is that what’s happened here?  Is that why the nomination failed?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I can speak to is her candidacy and how important
it was for this — for this critical role that she was nominated for.

The President clearly nominated her because — and I said this — she was
— she was tremendously — she has tremendous intellect and experience. 
And we thought and we, you know, believed that she was — she would be a
— a great — a great — is a great candidate and would have been an
excellent political official in this role.

And so, it is, clearly, unfortunate.  We’re sad to see — to see this
happen. 

But again, we are very thankful to her dedication to public service, her
talent — and not just for this past year as she was going through the
process but also the last several years as a national public advocate on
behalf of American consumers.

Q    Let me ask you one more question since the President announced his
plans for the Medicare surtax today.  That number of $400,000 — in the
past, it’s referred to individuals.  Is that, going forward, the plan? 
Or is it — is it married couples filing jointly?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s — nothing has changed from where we have been in
the past.

Q    Okay, thanks.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    Just another follow-up on immigration.  Not asking about the
detaining migrant families at all or any rumors around that.  But just
given what we’ve seen from the White House in recent months, including
the new asylum rule, is this basically an acknowledgment that without
legislation from Congress, the policies that the President previously
opposed, he now thinks are necessary in conjunction with some of those
legal pathways that you mentioned?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let me just — there’s a couple of things that I
want to say about that.  A lot of people have compared what the
President is doing as either extending what Trump did or being very
Trump-like, and I just want to make sure that that is not — that is not
what is happening here.

What we saw in this last administration — the administration before us —
was a gutting of the immigration system.  That is what they led with,
and that’s what they did. 

And a couple of things that we had to fix in this administration these
last two years:

Trump tried to deport DREAMers; we went to court to protect them. 

Trump ripped babies from their mother’s arms; we’re reuniting those
children with their families, with 600 families reunited thus far. 

Trump funneled billions of dollars from military to build a useless
wall, and what we did is we stopped that wall construction and returned
the money to support military schools and also equipment.

 Trump banned asylum, forcing more people to try to enter unlawfully. 
We’ve expanded legal pathways for immigration, and unlawful migration is
down.  I just gave two pieces of data to show that.

Trump tore down America’s refugee system.  And what we are doing — we’re
rebuilding it and have a set of goal of resettling up to 125- — 125,000
refugees this year alone.

Trump cut off critical assistant to stabilize the Western Hemisphere,
and we restarted that assistance to help address the root cause —
causes, like economic collapse, that are driving people to flee.

Migration, again — and I mentioned this stat already — migration from
countries where — where we — we’re seeing root causes — where there —
our root causes work is focused — is focused down by 71 percent since
last year.

So, that is — so, that is what we have been able to do in this past two
years and how we have been able to try to fix something that the last
administration has decimated.

Q    But given the pieces that are still in use or have been revived, is
— is that sort of an acknowledgment that they are now necessary or
deemed necessary —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, absolutely not.

Q    — by this administration?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, absolutely not.  From day one, the President has
put forth a bill that would expand legal pathways for imm- — for
immigration, increased border security, making sure that we limit
illegal immigration.

The President is using the tools that are before him to try to deal with
an issue that we’re seeing here.

We have said over and over again: If Republicans in Congress would come
and work with us to deal with this issue, we can get it done, we can get
it fixed, instead of the political stunts that they’re doing.

Okay.  Go ahead, Nadia.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  Two questions on foreign policy.  In addition
to poisoning schoolgirls in Iran, now it’s been reported that
(inaudible) detention sites.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has
asked for an investigation by the U.N. and accountability.  What does
accountability look like from the White House?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let me just first say, we’ve seen these disturbing
reports — deeply disturbing reports and — that we’ve seen from your —
one of your colleagues here’s network.  And so what we want to say from
here is that we welcome the call from our Senate colleagues for the
U.N.’s independent international factfinding mission on Iran to
investigate. 

Unfortunately, the Iranian regime has a long history of engaging in such
practices to stifle dissent and exert control.  The cruel, violent
suppression of peaceful protests and abuse of protesters that the — that
CNN reported shows that Iran’s leadership fears its own people.   
   
The eyes of the world are on Iran.  The human rights abuses inflicted by
its government must not go without consequences.  
   
The hundreds of protesters already killed at the hands of Iranian state
authorities deserve — and their family should see this as well — is
justice.  The torture and mistreatment of political prisoners must
cease.  
   
The United States is standing with our partners and allies around the
world.  And we’ll continue to pursue accountability for anyone involved
in these abuses.  
   
Q    And, second, you released a readout of the President’s call with
the Sultan of Oman.  In the last paragraph, you said that he welcomed
the historical role (inaudible) of the — of Omanis in securing the
release of American hostages in Iran.  But does he refer to the previous
mediation, or are we talking about a fresh push to release the new — the
current hostages now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share about that.   
   
Anytime — as you know, anytime there is a — there are American hostages
held, we’re always very careful on speaking to any — the process.  We
want to be mindful for — for security reasons.  So I’m not going to go
beyond what the President laid out and — what we laid out in the readout
with — on this call today.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Does the administration feel the Mexican
government is doing enough to combat violence in its own country as well
as Americans who are visiting?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I can say is that we are working closely with the
Mexican government.  As you’ve seen, we’ve — we’ve — we’ve announced
coordination that we have with the Mexican government as it relates to
the violence and cartel.  We’ve announced that already.   
   
You’ve seen the President — both presidents, President AMLO and
President Biden, speak to this very recently in — in Mexico City.   
   
Don’t have anything else to share.  And so, I’ll just leave it there.  
   
Q    Would the administration support be designating cartels as
terrorist organizations, as some senators have —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just don’t have any policy or announcements to make
from here.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Last night, Tucker Carlson cherrypicked video
surveillance from the January 6th insurrection, severely downplaying the
events of that day.  He said the mob was orderly and meek and that they
were tourists instead of insurrectionists.  What’s your response to
Carlson and to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who granted him access to that
video?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Anybody who watched that video would strongly digree
\[sic\] — disagree.  Anybody who watched that video in a — with their
own eyes, in a real way, and saw what happened on that day would — would
disagree with what was just stated.   
   
The President has been very clear: January 6th was the worst attack on
our democracy since the Civil War.  And we should be focused on making
sure that never happens again.   
   
And so, we are certainly — we agree — I know Minority Leader and — and —
Senator Schumer have already said this, and would hope that keeping the
Capitol and Congress safe and secure remains congressional leaders’
number one goal.  And that should be our focus, and that should be what
should be considered here.   
   
And, again, it was one of the darkest days of our democracy.  And all
you have to do is watch those videos and see how horrific it was, see
how sad it was, see an attack on the Capitol, which should not be
happening in 2020.   
   
And we got to get down to the bottom of what happened.  Again, it was an
attack on our democracy.  And I’ll just leave it there.  
   
Q    So is Speaker McCarthy irresponsible for handing over the video?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I answered your question.  I answered your question.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  So, with the more direct language — I’m going to
ask you about China.  With the more direct language from the Chinese
president and the foreign minister, is there a concern that the
administration line that they want competition over conflict is seen as
weakness by the Chinese?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not sure how it’s seen as weakness when we are
more prepared to com- — outcompete China and protect the national
security, under this President and because of the — of the work that
he’s done.   
   
Q    Well, they — they had —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to keep going.  
   
Q    — the Chinese —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to keep going.  
   
Q    — but they had the spy —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to keep —  
   
Q    — the spy balloon.    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ve answered this question multiple times.  
   
Go ahead.    
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  On — on the White House considering reinstating
the family detention, advocates are already calling it shameful. 
Democrats on the Hill have called it unacceptable.  And a number of
Democrats and immigrant advocates are calling for the White House to
publicly deny those reports.  What’s your response to them?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  My response is these are rumored conversations that
I’m just not going to speak to.   
   
We’ve laid out very clearly over the past several months, over the last
two years, how — our approach to this — our approach to dealing with
immigration.   
   
Again, we’ve been very clear.  We ex- — we’re expanding legal pathways
for asylum seekers, limiting — eliminating illegal migration, addressing
root causes, and increasing border security.  That’s our approach.   
   
And we are — want to make sure that we’re building a immigration system
that is — that is orderly, that is safe and humane.  That is what the
President is — has been doing.  And that’s what he’s going to continue
to do.   
   
I’m certainly not going to, again, weigh in on any rumored conversations
from here.   
   
I’ll be back tomorrow, guys.  I’ll see you tomorrow.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.
