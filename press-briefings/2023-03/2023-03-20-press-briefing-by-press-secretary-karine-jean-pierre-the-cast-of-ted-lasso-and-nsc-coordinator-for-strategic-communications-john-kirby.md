James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:14 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh my gosh.  Hello.   
   
Q    Hello.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hello.  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  Hello.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I wonder why so many people are here today. 
(Laughter.)  
   
Q    I’m here for you.    
   
Q    Karine —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, right.  Right, you’re here for me.  
   
Q    Karine, before — before you begin —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no, no.  Nope.  That’s not — we’re not doing
this.  We’re not doing this.   
   
Q    I would like to request —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re not doing this.  We’re not doing this.   
   
Q    I would like to request that you call on everyone from across the
room.   
   
You’ve been discriminating against me and discriminating against some
people in the briefing room.   
   
Q    Sir!  
   
Q    And I’m saying that this is the U.S. —  
   
Q    Come on!  
   
Q    — this is not China —  
   
Q    Let her start.  
   
Q    — this is not Russia.   
   
Q    You’re being rude.   
   
Q    Let her start.   
   
Q    This is not Russia!  
   
Q    Be respectful.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    What you are doing, you are making a mockery of the First
Amendment.  
   
Q    Simon!  
   
Q    Decorum, please.  Decorum, please.   
   
Q    Let her start.  Respect her.  
   
Q    It’s been seven months.  You’ve not called on me.  
   
Q    Decorum, please.  
   
Q    You blow off my messages.  I’m saying that that’s not right. 
That’s not right.   
   
Q    Let her start the briefing!  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Fun times.  Welcome, guys.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    That’s not right.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Welcome.  Welcome to the press briefing room.  
   
Q    (Inaudible) you are trying to silence some people —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    — but this is not right.  
   
Q    Sir!  
   
Q    Sir, let it go.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Are you ready?  Are we going to behave?   
   
Q    Thank you.   
   
Q    It’s not about behaving —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  While many folks —  
   
Q    — I’m saying that it is to respect the First Amendment.  
   
Q    Decorum, please.  
   
Q    Simon!    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    Sorry to our guests.  We apologize.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, I apologize.   
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  It’s all good.  It’s all good.   
   
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, that’s all right.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I apologize.  
   
Okay, while many — while many folks here in the U.S. are focused on
March Madness or the World Baseball Classic — go Team USA tomorrow
night, by the way — we at the White House today are going to focus on
another sport, which is soccer — or football, as some of my guests might
say — (laughter) —  
   
MS. WADDINGHAM:  Thank you.  Football.  Thank you.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — specifically AFC Richmond.   
   
And I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the “Believe” ba- —
banners that we’re seeing around — that you all may be seeing around the
White House complex today.  
   
It is an honor — it is truly an honor to have Coach Lasso here with us
today.  (Laughter.)  
   
On a serious note though, because this is actually very serious for the
reasons that they are all here — Jason and his castmates — and there’s a
real message around mental health.  And they are meeting with the
President and the First Lady, as you all know, this afternoon on this
important topic.  
   
And as you know, the President has made mental health the centerpiece of
his Unity Agenda.  
   
And I know that Jason wants to share a few words.  And so, Coach Lasso,
the podium is yours.  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  I appreciate it.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And here you go.  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  Thank you.  Thank you.   
   
Yeah, I didn’t — I truly did not know it was going to be this when — on
the way here — (laughter) — until we were out here.  And so, thank you
for taking an interest.   
   
And I know you’re here for bigger reasons than us, but I just want to
say that on behalf of myself, everyone here with me today and the
numerous other folks that — that it takes to make our show, “Ted Lasso,”
it is sincerely an honor to visit the White House and to have the
opportunity to speak to the President and to the First Lady about the
importance of mental health.  
   
So, like, no matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter who
you voted for, we all — probably, I assume — we all know someone who has
— or have been that someone ourselves, actually — that’s struggled,
that’s felt isolated, that’s felt anxious, that has felt alone. 
Right?  
   
And it’s actually one of the many things that, believe it or not, that
we all have in common as human beings, right?  
   
And so, that means that we — it’s something that we can all, you know,
and should talk about with one another when we’re feeling that way or
when we recognize that in someone feeling that way.   
   
So, please, you know, we encourage everyone — and it’s a big theme of
the show — is, like, to check in with your — you know, your neighbor,
your coworker, your friends, your family, and ask how they’re doing and
listen sincerely.  You know?  I mean, you all ask questions for a
living, but you also listen for a living.  So, you know, who am I
preaching to?  The choir, that is.  Okay?  (Laughter.)   
   
And look — and while — look, while it’s easier said than done, I — we
also have to know that we shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help
ourselves.  And that does take a lot, especially when it’s something
that has such a negative stigma to it, such as mental health.  And it
doesn’t need to be that way.  
   
And if you can ask for that help from a professional, fantastic.  If it
needs to be a loved one, equally as good in a lot of ways, because it’s
— sometimes you just need to let that pressure — that pressure valve
release.  
   
The President is working on, and his — and his own team — although his
team is real; our team is make-believe.  (Laughter.)  Don’t think I
don’t know that.  Despite what the people that FIFA and EA will tell
you, we are actually a make-believe team.  (Laughter.)   
   
But, you know, they’re working very hard to make sure that the — that —
you know, that option is available to as many Americans as possible.  
   
Now, look, I know in this town a lot of folks don’t always agree —
right? — and don’t always feel heard, seen, listened to.  Yes?  But I
truly believe that we should all do our best to help take care of each
other.  That’s my own personal belief.  I think that’s something that
everybody up here on stage believes in.  That’s things we talk about in
the writers’ room and we talk about in the editing room and everything
in between.  
   
And just like — you know, you just want to emulate, you know, these
make-believe folks that we all play at AFC Richmond and the way they
take care of one another.  That is the wish fulfillment of the show,
aside from me playing coach and these guys being professional
footballers.  You know, that’s like — you know, that’s — that’s — that’s
a big part of the show.  (Laughter.)  
   
Now, I — I can’t help but take this opportunity to take at least one
question.  So, please, yeah.  
   
Q    So, you’re going to do better than 20th?  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  Ahhh — wait.  Hold on.  The — decorum, right?  That was
the word we were using?  Decorum.   
   
Yes, sir.  A familiar face.  Hi.   
   
MR. LANCE:  Trent Crimm.  (Laughter.)  Fake journalist.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  Yes, sir.  Yes, Trent.  Nice to see you.  
   
MR. LANCE:  How do you feel about Kansas City being one of the named
hosting cities for the 2026 World Cup?  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  Ooh, here I was hoping for a softball.  (Laughter.) 
Okay, you know what?  I’m very excited, truth — truth be told.  
   
Yeah, Kansas City is going to be one of these teams — I mean, I love
this town.  What I am genuinely worried about is once we get all these
folks from all over the world to come to Kansas City and see our city,
eat our food, meet our people, you’re going to have, you know, a lot of
folks that won’t want to move away.  That’s what I’m worried about. 
(Laughter.)  
   
That’s it for us.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right, see you
guys.   
   
Thank you sincerely so much for having us and putting up with us.  
   
Now on to greener pastures.  (Laughter.)  
   
All right, thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  All right, see you guys.  Absolutely.  
   
MS. WADDINGHAM:  Thank you so much.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.   
   
Q    Would you do a Biden impression?   
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  Excuse me?   
   
Q    You don’t have a little —  
   
Q    Your Joe Biden.   
   
Q    — Joe Biden impression for us?   
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  No, I think — they got the real one here now.  You know? 
(Laughter.)  Yeah.  No, I — I need fake teeth and, you know, and
injected with a lot more chutzpah to pull that off.  So, you now. 
Okay.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.   
   
Q    We just want to know if you’re going to do better than 20th.  
   
MR. SUDEIKIS:  Oh, I don’t know.  
   
I — yes.  Yes.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.   
   
Okay, I just got to say something before we start.  I know some folks
are probably going to leave the room.  
   
Q    Karine, one (inaudible).  You can’t keep — you can’t keep
discriminating against some people in the briefing room because you
don’t like them and you don’t like their questions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sir, you have a choice.   
   
Q    No, you’ve been —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You have a choice.   
   
Q    — discriminating against me —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You have a choice.  
   
Q    — and against a number of people —  
   
Q    Shhh —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  
   
Q    — in the briefing room.  And I’m saying that that’s not right. 
This is not China.  This is not Russia.  This is the United States.  
   
Q    Decorum!  
   
Q    This is the White House.  
   
Q    Come on.  
   
Q    Simon — Simon, the point is —    
   
Q    I think you should —  
   
Q    The point is you’re not letting her talk.  
   
Q    The rest of us are here too, pal.  
   
Q    It is based on (inaudible) —  
   
Q    You’re not letting her talk.     
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
Q    If you have grievances, you should bring them to her later.  
   
Q    I have done that.   
   
Q    Right now, this is —  
   
Q    I have done that!  
   
Q    — for the entire press corps.  
   
Q    All my emails have been ignored.  
   
Q    And the press corps is tired of dealing with this.   
   
Q    I’ve done that.  
   
Q    It isn’t about you, Simon.   
   
Q    Understand that you get questions all the time and you don’t
(inaudible) —  
   
Q    The point is —  
   
Q    — to sit here for eight months and being discriminated against. 
Understand that —   
   
Q    Take your legitimate questions —  
   
Q    — you’re in the front row.  And you feel comfortable, and you get
—  
   
Q    — to the Press Secretary at another time.   
   
Q    — to ask questions all the time.   
   
Q    But you have people in the back who don’t get any questions.   
   
Q    Don’t make assumptions about what the rest of us do.  Mind your
manners when you’re in here.  If you have a problem, you bring it up
afterwards  
   
But you are impinging on everybody in here who is only trying to do
their job.  
   
Sorry.  
   
Q    Okay, thank you.  I’m saying that you shouldn’t discriminate
against some people because you don’t agree with their question, you’re
offended —  
   
Q    You made your point.   
   
Q    — by their question.  
   
Q    You made your point.  
   
Q    You made your point.  
   
Q    We all heard it.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Guys, as you all know — many of you know,
this is the White House Press Briefing Room.  A historic room.  A room
that should have the decorum.  A room where folks should respect their
colleagues and respect the guests that are here.  
   
And I understand that there’s going to be give-and-take.  That’s the way
the press briefing has gone for — for decades before me.  And I will
always, always respect that.   
   
But what I will not — what I will not appreciate is disrespecting your
colleagues and disrespecting guests who are here to talk — who were here
to talk about an incredibly important issue, which is mental health.   
   
And what has just occurred this last 10, 15 minutes is unacceptable.  It
is reg- —  
   
Q    You’ve been discriminating against me.  You’ve been dis- —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It is unacceptable.   
   
Q    — against me for months.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’re going to — so we’re either going to continue
the briefing or we can just end the briefing right here.  
   
Q    No.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Well, then let’s go.  
   
Q    Let’s go.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Now, for my next guest, my colleague, John Kirby, is
joining me here today to talk about President Xi’s visit to Moscow and
take any questions that you may have.  
   
Again, another guest that should be respected in this room and allowed
to take questions from the front and from the back.  And that’s what we
do every day.  And that’s what we’re going to continue to do.  
   
Go ahead, Admiral.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Karine.  Afternoon, everybody.  
   
Q    Hello, John.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I do — thank you.  I do have a few things to get through. 
And I promised Karine I’d try to be as brief as I could, but there’s a —
there’s a lot going on.  So just please bear with me, and then I’ll be
happy to take as many questions as — as time will allow.  
   
Today, I think you — as you all know, President Xi is visiting Russia to
meet with President Putin.  Now, you also probably know that China has
already issued a 12-point plan for the conflict in Ukraine, which
includes an essent- — an essential point, and that’s respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.   
   
We encouraged President Xi to advocate for this exact essential key
point, which must include the withdrawal of Russian forces from
sovereign Ukrainian territory consistent with the U.N. Charter.   
   
The entire world would like to see this war end — especially the
Ukrainians themselves, who have put forward their own plan for a just
peace, which draws, again, on these same U.N. principles.  
   
And let’s remember, this war could actually end right now if Russia
would withdraw its troops from the country.   
   
We hope that President Xi will press President Putin to cease bombing
Ukrainian cities, hospitals, and schools; to halt the war crimes and
atrocities; and to withdraw all his troops.  
   
But we are concerned that, instead, China will reiterate calls for a
ceasefire that leaves Russian forces inside Ukraine sovereign
territory.  And any ceasefire that does not address the removal of
Russian forces from Ukraine would effectively ratify Russia’s illegal
conquests, enabling Russia to entrench its positions and then to restart
the war at a more advantageous time for them.  
   
This would — the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by
Russia, aided by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its
terms without any viable pathway to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity.  Any such attempt — any such attempt would
violate the U.N. Charter and defy the will of the 141 countries that
demanded, just weeks ago at the U.N. General Assembly, that Russia
immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine.  
   
Efforts to end this conflict must take Ukraine’s position into account. 
And so we encourage President Xi to play a constructive role by speaking
with President Zelenskyy, which he has not done since Russia launched
this invasion.  Because China, quite frankly, we believe, should hear
directly from the Ukrainians and not just from the Russians.  
   
And we encourage President Xi to press President Putin directly on the
need to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The
world and China’s neighbors will certainly be watching closely.  
   
I also have a few updates for you on Israel.  First, we welcome the
understandings reach- — reached in Sharm el-Sheikh yesterday between
senior political and security officials of Israel and the Palestinian
Authority.  This was the second meeting in this particular format
following the gathering that was in Aqaba three weeks ago, and it
included participation by senior officials from the United States, from
Egypt, and from Jordan.  
   
The parties held candid and constructive conversations on steps to
improve security and stability for Palestinians and Israelis and on
efforts to strengthen the economic stability of the Palestinian
people.   
   
Meetings at this level have not taken place in nearly 10 years.  And
they helped to build a critical foundation to deescalate tensions and
reduce violence.  And that’s what we want to see happen.  
   
We look forward to continuing these discussions as we enter the holy
month of Ramadan, of Passover, and Easter.  
   
Now, President Biden has also spoken, I think as you know, yesterday
with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  In that call, he welcomed the meeting in
Sharm el-Sheikh and reinforced the need for all sides to take urgent
collaborative steps to enhance security coordination, condemn all acts
of terrorism, and maintain the viability of a two-state solution.   
   
He also reiterated his unwavering commitment to Israel’s security and
our ongoing cooperation to counter all the threats posed by Iran — and
there are many.  
   
The President also stressed that democratic values have always been and
must remain a hallmark of U.S.-Israeli bilateral relations.  Democratic
societies are strengthened by genuine checks and balances, and
fundamental changes should be pursued with the broadest possible base of
popular support.  He offered his support for efforts underway to forge a
compromise on proposed judicial reforms consistent with those core
principles.  And we call on all Israeli leaders to reach such a
compromise without delay.  
   
On a separate topic: Earlier today, I think you saw the President issued
a statement welcoming the recovery and soon return of Jeff Woodke, a
U.S. citi- — a U.S. citizen who had been held hostage in Africa for more
than six years.  He is safe, and he is in the hands of the U.S.
government officials.  
   
As the President said in that statement not too long ago, we extend our
deepest appreciation to the Nigerien government for their help in
securing his release.  For more than six years, there has been a
multi-pronged effort dedicated to locating and recovering Jeff, which
was spearheaded by our military, our law enforcement, and our
intelligence community, working together with French support.  
   
Jeff, like other hostages and wrongful detainees, will be offered the
best medical care possible, of course, to include post-isolation
support.  After a full medical screening, he will be reunited with his
loved ones in the near future.   
   
I think you can understand why we’d ask you to please allow Jeff and his
family a little bit of privacy here as he adjusts to new surroundings
and to life moving forward and to coming back into American society.   
   
The Biden-Harris administration remains unwavering in our commitment to
bringing Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad home to
their loved ones.  And this is yet another example of the President’s
commitment in that regard.   
   
Lastly, I know it’s not lost on any of you that today is the 20th
anniversary of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Whatever one thinks about the
war and what started it, I can tell you two things.   
   
One, we’re looking ahead, and we’ve got a — a good collaboration, a good
partnership with Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces, who we continue to
partner with in an “enable, advise, and assist” role, because there’s
still a viable threat of ISIS there in Iraq and in Syria.   
   
And number two, the President and the First Lady remain absolutely
committed, as they always have been, to the men and women of America —
of our military, as well as across the interagency, who served, fought,
died, and suffered in Iraq.   
   
Some 4,399 troops did not make it home from the war.  More than 30,000
came home forever changed by wounds and injuries.   
   
And it’s not just them; it’s their families that continue to suffer,
that continue to sacrifice.  There’s 4,399 chairs at 4,399 dinner tables
that are empty.  And it’s important for us always to remember that and
never forget the bravery, the courage, the sacrifice that went into
fighting that war, again, regardless of how you feel about it.  
   
President Biden and the First Lady are going to commit — stay committed
to those — to those families going forward.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to — go ahead — start in the back.  Go
ahead.  Please start.  
   
Q    Yes, Karine.   
   
Q    Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Just on Russia.  First of all, Moscow has
indicated that they’ll put a pause on the grain deal by May 18th if the
U.S. doesn’t comply with some of their demands, which include putting
some banks back in the SWIFT system, resuming exports of agricultural
equipment.  What’s your reaction to that?  And what’s the plan B if they
do halt?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, first, I — we obviously welcome the extension.  It’s
for, I think, 60 days — not the 120 that I think we were — that
everybody was hoping for.  But a 60-day extension.  That’s a good
thing.   
   
In fact, over the weekend, I think two ships left with hundreds of
thousands of metric tons of corn.  And a lot of that corn, a lot of that
grain is heading for low- and middle-income countries that have been
suffering — no question — have been suffering since the beginning of
this war with food insecurity.   
   
So, it’s a good thing.  And we’re grateful for the work of Turkey, for
the U.N. to move forward with that.   
   
I don’t have any — and I won’t get into speculating about repercussions
one way or another.  We’re focused on now getting — now that this is
extended, making sure we get those ships loaded and get them out and get
them to places where they need to be.  That’s — that’s what — that’s
what the focus is.   
   
Q    And can you just remind us of your position on — you know,
doubtless there are going be conversations between President Xi and
Putin about assistance to Russia in Ukraine.  What is the U.S.’s
position on that?  And what if China does decide to aid Russia?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  All right, so on the — on the communications — hang on, I
just want to write this down so I don’t forget it.  
   
The — you’ve heard the President say this himself.  He wants to have
another conversation with President Xi, and he’ll do that.  And we’ll do
that at the most appropriate time.   
   
I don’t have a call in the schedule to speak to, but it’s important that
we keep those lines of communication open, particularly now when
tensions are so high.  That’s why we’re — you know, we still want to get
Secretary Blinken back to Beijing.  That visit was postponed; it wasn’t
canceled.  And we’re still hopeful that we can get that back on the cal-
— calendar.   
   
As a matter of fact, we’re having discussions with the PRC right now
about a potential visit by Secretary Yellen and Secretary Raimondo to go
over there and talk about economic issues.  So there’s that — that we’re
still working.   
   
So all — all of that — keeping those lines of communication open — are
still valuable.   
   
Now, you asked about lethal weapons and a provision of lethal weapons by
China.  We’ll see what they come out of this meeting talking about.  I
mean, we don’t know if there’s going to be some sort of arrangement.   
   
I would just tell you that we still don’t believe that China has taken
it off the table.  We still don’t believe and haven’t seen any
indication that they’re moving in that direction or they’ve made a
decision to provide or that they’re actually going to do that.  
   
We continue to believe it’s not in China’s best interest to do that, to
help Mr. Putin slaughter innocent Ukrainians.  It’s hard to believe that
they would think that that’s in their best interest.   
   
It would also run counter to what we’ve heard President Xi talk about in
terms of what his ultimate goal here is.  I think he put an op-ed out
today talking about sovereignty, territorial integrity, finding a
peaceful way to end this war that — providing lethal weapons would seem
to be inconsistent with that goal.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Alex.  Alex.   
   
Q    When is the right time for a ceasefire?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Alex.  Alex.  Go ahead.  Alex, go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Karine.  Admiral, do you all — are you
encouraged by progress — or seeming progress in Israel on the judicial
reforms?  It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his critics agree
on some key things but not others.  How do you assess the situation?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, we’re glad that they’re talking.  The President was —
was encouraged by the — the efforts by President Herzog to come up with
some alternatives.  We’re certainly going to let Israeli leaders speak
to the details of that.  This is for them to work out.   
   
But one of the messages that President Biden had when he spoke to the
Prime Minister yesterday was: It’s important for those efforts to be
fully explored and for compromises to be made, because the beauty of
democracy is, in fact, compromise.  And the strength of our — of both
our democracies is that we believe in checks and balances and also in a
consensus among the — the populace that — to make these changes,
whatever changes they are, to make them sustainable.  All that has to be
factored in.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Mary.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Just a couple follow-ups here.  You said that you haven’t
seen any confirmation that China has made a decision yet when it comes
to providing aid.  Why do you think China hasn’t made this decision
yet?  Do you think they’re waiting for this meeting today or —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Difficult to know.  It’s hard.  You know, we — I couldn’t
possibly get inside President Xi’s decision-making to see, you know,
what — what he’s thinking.   
   
China has, as you know, not condemned the war, but they haven’t provided
lethal weapons.  They haven’t participated in — in sanctions the way we
obviously would have preferred them to do.  They have — they have made
their own sovereign decisions.  And largely, at least tacitly, many of
those decisions have come down on the side of Russia here, including
buying into the Russian propaganda that this war is some sort of
existential threat to Russia and it’s the West or the U.S. and NATO
pushing Russia, which is — of course is nonsense.   
   
I can’t speak for President Xi and why he hasn’t moved in this
direction.  I would just reiterate here from the podium, what we’ve
reiterated to pr- — to Chinese officials privately: that we don’t think
it’s in their best interest, it’s not going to bring an end to this war
any faster, and, as I said earlier, it certainly appears inconsistent
with what President Xi has said publicly about what he wants to see
happen.   
   
Q    And on the phone call between President Biden and President Xi,
what is the holdup here?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It —  
   
Q    You all seem interested in talking.  Are the Chinese not
interested?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  There’s no holdup — no holdup at all.  We want to make sure
when we have this conversation it’s at the — at the appropriate time and
in the right context.   
   
President Xi has been kind of busy of late.  I mean, he had the People’s
Congress, which just ended; now he’s in Moscow.  So, look, when it’s the
right time and — for both leaders, we’ll get them on the phone.   
   
But just as importantly, to my first answer on this, we’re still trying
— you know, still interested in working towards getting Secretary
Blinken back to Beijing.  I mean, he was practically on the plane when
we had to pull that visit back and postpone it.   
   
And as I said, we’re having active discussions with the PRC right now
about the potential visit by Secretary Yellen and a — and one by
Secretary Raimondo.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, John.  On the — on the call yesterday with the Pres- —
Prime Minister Netanyahu, was — has there been any discussion within the
U.S. government of withholding potentially some military assistance to
Israel because of the — if these judicial reforms do proceed, there are
a number of instances around the world —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  One of the —  
   
Q    — where the U.S. holds — withholds military assistance for
democratic reasons or concerns (inaudible)?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  One of the — one of the main things that President Biden
stressed to Prime Minister Netanyahu was our ironclad support for
Israel’s security and that — that that’s going to continue.  We face
some common challenges in the region, not — not the least of which is
Iran.  That will continue.  
   
Q    And then, just on a different topic, the other NSC side — the
homeland security side, in light of some of the discussions regarding
protests surrounding the potential future indictment of the former
President.  You addressed this a little bit yesterday, but can you get —
has the White House been briefed on any security concerns or is involved
in any operational planning to ensure — investigating threats or
otherwise ensure homeland security?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware of any specific briefings or — or specific
threats.  
   
As I said yesterday, we — we always monitor this.  Even absent the
context of — of those comments, we’re constantly monitoring this — as
you would think we should, particularly in the wake of what happened on
January 6th.  But I’m not — I’m not tracking any individual or specific
threats or any specific or operational moves by — by the federal
government.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jeff.  And then we’ll go back.  
   
Q    Thanks.  John, does the President plan to invite Prime Minister
Netanyahu to Washington for a visit?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  There’s nothing on the schedule right now for that.  
   
Q    And more broadly, on the Russia question, is there another way to
look at President Xi’s visit other than a show of support for President
Putin?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think, clearly — look, take a couple steps back here.  I
mean, this is a relationship that has been burgeoning of late.  There
two countries have — have grown closer.  
   
It — but they are both countries that chafe and bristle at U.S.
leadership around the world, that chafe and bristle at this idea — I
know it’s — it sounds like a wonky term, but this rules-based order
inter- — this international rules-based order, which so many countries
helped to establish in the wake of World War Two.  
   
These two countries, they don’t like that much.  And they like to
challenge it.  And they — and in China’s case in particular, they
certainly would like to challenge U.S. leadership around the world.  And
in — in President Putin, President Xi sees a potential ally in that
effort.   
   
For President Putin, he sees in President Xi a lifeline of sorts for a
war that he’s conducting that has clearly not gone in the — anywhere
near the direction he wanted it to go and a military that is clearly
failing on the battlefield.  
   
So, it’s a bit of a marriage of convenience, I’d say, less than it is of
affection.  
   
And, again, we’ll — we’ll see where — we’ll see where this goes after
this — after this meeting.  But these are not two countries that have,
you know, decades-long experience working together and full trust and
confidence.  It’s a burgeoning of late based on America’s increasing
leadership around the world and trying to che- — and trying to check
that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Lalit.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask you about the comment of India protests
against — there was an attack on the Indian consulate in San Francisco
yesterday.  The doors were broken.  The windows were broken.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
Q    And graffiti was (inaudible) the wall.  Is the President aware
about it?  And I haven’t seen any action being taken by the San
Francisco police yet.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We — we certainly condemn that — that vandalism.  It’s just
absolutely unacceptable.  The State Department’s Diplomatic Security
Service is working with local authorities.  
   
I can’t speak for the San Francisco police, but I can say that the
Diplomatic Security Service is working with local authorities to
properly investigate.  And obviously, State Department is going to be
working, from an infrastructure perspective, to repair the damage.  But
it’s unacceptable.  
   
Q    Now that you have a U.S. ambassador to India confirmed by the
Senate, it has been around two years now that you didn’t have an
ambassador to India.  Can you look back and say how did it impacted your
ties with India not having an ambassador on the ground in Delhi?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It always helps if you have a Senate-confirmed ambassador in
a country, particularly one that’s so important, like India, to us in
the region and around the world.  
   
But we didn’t let that stop us.  President Biden has prioritized that
bilateral relationship.  And even though — without an ambassador, we —
we certainly had a very competent chargé there and a very competent
career staff in the embassy that were able to continue to advance our
foreign policy interests in this bilateral relationship and did so quite
effectively.  
   
But, obviously, having an ambassador is always important, and we look
forward to that — to having (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Way in the back, behind Alex.  
   
Q    Karine, thank you.  What is the administration doing specifically
to counter the growing Russia and China relationship?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  What we’re focused on is revitalizing our alliances and
partnerships around the world and advancing our foreign policy goals
around the world and in working to strengthen the foreign policy
objectives and the mutual security objectives that we share with so many
other countries.   
   
I mean, last week, on Monday, the President was in San Diego to unveil,
with Prime Minister Sunak and Prime Minister Albanese of Australia, this
AUKUS deal.  This is a — an opportunity now to help Australia get their
own nuclear-powered submarines.  That’s just one example.   
   
That’s what we’re focused on.  It’s not about — it’s not about
countering them; it’s about advancing our goals.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Peter.  
   
Q    Thanks.  John, Russia and China — it seems like this — these two
superpowers are teaming up now against the U.S.  Why did President Biden
let this happen?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Peter, these are two countries that have long chafed, as I
said to Jeff — long chafed at U.S. leadership around the world and — and
the network of alliances and partnerships that we have.  
   
This is not — this is not something that these two countries just cooked
up since President Biden got elected.  
   
Q    But — but he was —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It is something that they have been —  
   
Q– since he’s been President, he has talked tough.  He tried to pressure
Putin and Xi to act right or risk their standing on the world stage. 
Does he see now that they don’t care?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think if you ask a lot of Russians, they certainly care. 
I mean, this — their economy is — is barely being propped up by some
pretty radical measures by — by Mr. Putin.  Their military has been
roundly embarrassed inside Ukraine, and they continue to lose ground
there.   
   
And as for China, again, take a look at the way the President has really
revitalized and restored alliances and partnerships that were let go, if
not ridiculed, in the previous administration.  We have prioritized
them.   
   
And there’s no other nation around the world that has this alliance and
partnership network that we do.  Five of our seven treaty alliances are
in the Indo-Pacific.  And President Biden has priotor- — prioritized
each and every one of them.   
   
Q    Specific to these two leaders, though, do you think that Putin and
Xi fear President Biden?  
MR. KIRBY:  You’d have to ask them whether they fear or they not.  
   
Q    Should they?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It is not about fear.  It’s about President Biden advancing
our foreign policy goals around the world.  It’s about President Biden
revitalizing these alliances and partnerships.  It’s about President
Biden and what he’s doing to preserve our national security interests
around the world.  That’s what we’re focused on.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Welcome back.   
   
Q    Thank you.  It’s been a minute.  Has the President spoken to Jeff
Woodke or his family yet today?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t think there’s been any direct communication by the
President with respect to the family yet.  I mean, we’re just delighted
— this news just broke, as you know — we’re just delighted to be able to
get him back in our hands.  We’re going to make sure he gets the care he
needs.   
   
And I’m sure there’ll be appropriate communications at the right time. 
But as I said in my opening statement, we also — this is — I mean, six
years, and they just got word today.  We need to give the family a
little breathing space.  
   
Q    And — sorry, really quick — your reaction to President Putin
visiting Mariupol over the weekend?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, look, a couple of things there.  I mean, I certainly
won’t speak to his travel habits, but Mariupol is far from the
fighting.  It’s far from the frontlines.   
   
I hope he did get to see — I hope he did get to see the damage and the
destruction that his troops did to that city.  And I heard in the press
release that he was going to look at all the ways they rebuilding —
they’re rebuilding Mariupol.  Ha!  How about the fact that they
shouldn’t have to rebuild it because he shouldn’t have bombed —  
   
Sorry.  He shouldn’t have — yeah, I was going to use a word I shouldn’t
use here.  (Laughter.)  
   
So, I hope he got to see what his troops, his military, and his war did
to that city.  But we’ll — but we’ll let him speak to — to his — what he
came away from.   
   
I would also tell you that it’s clear that he knows — he has to know how
badly he’s doing inside Ukraine.  I mean, more than 50 percent of the
territory they took from Ukraine in the first weeks and months of the
war, the Ukrainians have already taken back.   
   
And the only real active fighting right now is around Bakhmut.  And here
we are on — what is it today, the 20th? — and Bakhmut is still not in
Russian hands.  Now, they’re fighting over it; the Ukrainians aren’t
giving up on it.   
   
And all the while, we are working to make sure — today, we’re announcing
another package of assistance — $350 million worth of assistance,
largely ammunition — to Ukraine.  
   
While all that’s going on, we’re working to make sure that Ukraine is
well suited and well postured to defend themselves in the weeks and
months ahead.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Phil.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, John.  Two quick follow-ups on China.  In
your description of the relationship between the two — “convenience, not
affection,” Russia viewing China as a “lifeline” — do you guys view
Russia, at this point, as a client state of China?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would say there’s — in that particular bilateral
relationship, they certainly are the junior partner.   
   
Q    And then, in terms of the lines of communication — the President
has talked about this; you’ve talked about it repeatedly — being
critical to the relationship — the bilateral relationship with China —
which lines are not currently open?  
   
There was reporting last month about the military — mil-to-mil lines
were not open; obviously, economic lines are open.  Seems like the
Secretary of State —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, we’re hoping to get the economic lines open.  The
military-to-military lines are not open.  And that’s — and that’s a
problem.   
   
That was, as you know, one of the things we were hoping Secretary
Blinken would get thawed for us, because they are frozen.  And, of
course, that trip didn’t happen yet, so those lines are still not
open.  
   
But, look, through diplomatic channels, we still have the ability to
speak with the Chinese.  And we are.  As I said, we’re working with them
on a potential trip by Secretaries Yellen and Raimondo.   
   
And as I said earlier, the President will absolutely speak with
President Xi at the appropriate time.  That’s still open.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hey, John, can you — thanks, Karine.  Can you talk more about the
effort to release Jeff Woodke?  Was the White House directly involved in
negotiations?  Were there any concessions?  What — what exactly changed
in the last little bit?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We were — our team here at the NSC was — was involved in
this.  Of course, Mr. Carstens, the Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs
over at the State Department, was keenly involved.  You saw that the
President personally thanked the FBI Hostage Fusion Cell for their work,
as well as just the work across the interagency; as I said in my opening
statement, the intelligence community, other diplomats as well.  There
was a lot — that was a team effort to get him out.   
   
There were no concessions made.  There were no swaps here.  This was
just hard, grueling, deliberate work by diplomats and other experts
directly with the — with the government of Niger to get him home.  And
hopefully he’ll — I mean, he’ll be home soon.  But we’re looking forward
to that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, a couple more —  
   
Q    Staying — staying on the continent, Kamala Harris goes to Africa
—  
   
MR. KIRBY:  She does.  
   
Q    — later this week.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  She does.  
   
Q    The First Lady has.  The Secretary of State has.  
   
I wonder what — you know, at the end of — Biden plans later this — this
year.  I wonder, at the end of the day, sort of, what message you hope
to send to those nations, to the continent.  
   
And is it a direct foil, a direct, you know — you know, to China — to
China’s role in the region?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  So, I — the message is the same that — that the President
delivered when we had the African Leaders Summit here in December.  And
that’s that Africa matters, the continent matters, and our relationships
across the continent all matter.   
   
And — and we work on those relationships one at a time, because every
country on the continent is different, has different needs and — and
different expectations of American leadership.   
   
And that’s why the President, at the end of that summit, assigned Mr.
Carson to be the Special Envoy for Implementation.   
   
And you’re seeing us now move out on that.  You mentioned the Vice
President’s trip.  The First Lady was just there.  I mean, we are
actively following through on the things we promised we would do at the
end of that Africa Leaders Summit.   
   
So this is very much about Africa — African leaders, African nations —
and not about anybody else.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Aurelia?  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  
   
Q    Can I ask you a follow-up question on Africa?  
   
Q    I have a question on India and China.  There is a report from U.S.
News saying that the U.S. provided intelligence to Indian military, and
that helped them repel a Chinese incursion that happened last year.  Can
you confirm that?  And does it mean that, you know, generally speaking,
there is more intelligence sharing with India?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, I can’t confirm that.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, James.  
   
Q    Karine, thank you.  Admiral, thank you.  Two questions focused on
China.  First, on the Xi-Putin visit, you and other senior officials
have been vocal in recent weeks about your insights into consideration
by the Chinese of providing some kind of direct or lethal assistance to
the Russians.  And that’s why you’ve issued your public warnings against
them doing that.   
   
One of the little-noted aspects of this relationship that I think is
important came back in September when Putin and Xi last met in
Uzbekistan.  And in his public comments, President Putin stated that
they were eager to address the concerns about the Ukraine war that the
Chinese had raised.   
   
So, I wonder if you have any insights into the nature of those Chinese
concerns and what they may have communicated to the Russians about
that.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I do not.  I don’t.  
   
Q    The second question is on the Chinese-brokered rapprochement
between Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Since that deal was announced, has the
United States been able to observe any changes in that relationship, in
its security implications for the region, et cetera?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think it’s too soon right now, James.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, two more.  Joey.  
   
Q    Yeah, thank you.  You said there were no concessions made for the
release of Mr. Woodke.  Does that mean there was no ransom payment at
all?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  That’s right.  That’s what that means.  
   
Q    And Secretary of State Blinken was in Niger last week.  Did he
negotiate at all for his release during that trip?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  He certainly had discussions with leaders that he met there
about Mr. Woodke, as you would expect him to.  
   
Q    And where is Mr. Woodke right now?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to get into the specifics of his location. 
He’s still on the continent, but he’s in U.S. — he’s with U.S.
government officials.  
   
Q    Okay, thanks.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Do you know if the Chinese government has
contacted Kyiv regarding its 12-point plan?  And what’s the Ukrainian
government reaction to the plan itself?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I certainly would refer you to comments that President
Zelenskyy has already made.  I’m not going to speak for him or his
administration.  
   
To the best of my knowledge, I know of no conversations between the
Chinese and Kyiv with respect to this so-called 12-point proposal.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Ed.  
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
Go ahead, Ed.  Go ahead, Ed.  
   
Q    Yeah, thank you.  Thank you, Karine.  Thank you.  So, we saw the
Chinse, as alluded to here, broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and
Iran.  And now the Chinese said they want to broker peace in Ukraine. 
What role would President Biden play in any negotiations with them?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  He’s already talked to that.  He’s already said very clearly
that when it comes to a negotiated settlement, if it comes to a
negotiated settlement — and I’ll say it again, no reason for it to; Mr.
Putin could just pull his troops out, be done — but if and when it comes
to that, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.   
   
And we will do — and the Ukrainians will find in us a strong and willing
partner to help President Zelenskyy if and when he’s ready to
negotiate.  
   
But the starting point for us has got to be him.  The Ukrainians have to
be heard.  Their perspectives have to be understood.  They have to have
a voice in this process.  
   
And so, it’s fine for the Chinese to go out there and say they want a
ceasefire.  We’d all like a — we’d all like to see the fighting stop. 
Who wouldn’t?   
   
But if it stops now, without any consideration of the Ukrainian side,
without any discussion between the Chinese and the Ukrainians, without
any accession by them to an idea of a ceasefire, it basically freezes in
place what Mr. Putin has been able to achieve on the ground inside
Ukraine.  It’s dwindling, but he still has occupied territory in
Ukraine.  And that’s just unacceptable.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Last question.  
   
Q    What’s the level of concern —  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Real quick.  What’s the level —  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Ed.  
   
Q    Just real quick.  What’s the level of concern about the growing
influence of China around the world then?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, we’re certainly mindful that China has tried to expand
their influence all around the world — in the Middle East, in Africa, in
Latin America.   
   
They can speak to their foreign policy goals should they wish to; I can
only speak to ours.  And our goals are not about countering or — or
being a block or an obstacle.  There’s no effort to contain here.  It’s
about advancing what President Biden believes are the appropriate
foreign policy goals for this country, for the American people, and for
the best interests of our allies and partners.  
   
And again, I go back to what I said before: No other nation in the world
— none — has the — a network of alliances and partnerships that the
United States does, has as many friends around the world as the United
States does who are interested in pursuing the same goals.  
   
Secretary Austin, just a week or so ago, held the 10th Ukraine Defense
Contact Group, more than 50 nations — again, more than 50 nations at
each and every one.   
   
And those are voluntary participation events.  It’s not like we’re
browbeating people to show up to agree to contribute to Ukraine.   
   
That’s — that’s the power of American convening leadership.  And you
don’t see that power out of either Russia or China.  These are two
countries who do not have that same network of friends and partners.   
   
And one of the reasons why that relation- — (Ms. Jean-Pierre begins to
call on next reporter) — sorry —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s okay.  (Laughs.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  He got me all — he got — he got me —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s in the zone.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, no, he got me all lathered up.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  He’s in the zone.  He’s in the zone.  
   
Q    You’re on a roll, man.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  You got me all lathered up now.  
   
But one of the reasons why you’re seeing that tightening relationship is
because they recognize that they don’t have that strong foundation of
international support for what they’re trying to do, which is basically
challenge American leadership around the world.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, last question.  You got the last
question.  
   
Q    Thank you very much.  The President travels to Ottawa this week,
and the past President had a difficult relationship with Prime Minister
Trudeau.  Does the United States feel that is — that episode is in the
past and — or does that relationship need tending with Canada and
Canada’s leadership?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’ll have more to say later in the week about the trip to
Canada.  The President is very excited about doing this — going up there
and really going to Ottawa for no other purpose than the bilateral
relationship.   
   
He has a terrific relationship with Prime Minister Trudeau — warm and
friendly and productive.   
   
There’s an awful lot on the — on the plate there, from — everywhere from
strengthening NORAD to climate change to, obviously, migration
challenges, economic, and trade.  I mean, there’s a bunch of things. 
We’ll have more to say later in the week.  But the President is very
excited about this.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, Admiral.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thank you.  Appreciate it, everybody.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
Okay, just a couple things, and then we’ll get going.   
   
As you all know, earlier this month, President Biden released his
budget, which will the following: invest in America; lower costs and cut
taxes for working families; protect and strengthen Social Security,
Medicare; and reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over a decade —
all while ensuring that no one making less than $400,000 per year pays a
penny more in new taxes.  
   
The day after the President released his budget, the House Freedom
Caucus released their MAGA budget proposal, which is a five-alarm fire
for hardworking families.  
   
Each day this week, we will zero in on how the MAGA budget proposal
would be a disaster by endangering public safety, raising costs for
families, shipping manufacturing jobs overseas and undermining American
workers, hurting seniors, and weakening national security and our
ability to outcompete China.  
   
Today, we’re showcasing how the MAGA budget proposal would endanger
public safety.  And here is how it will do that: make our border less
secure by eliminating funding for more than the 2,000 CBC agents and
officers; defund the police — not fund the police, but defund the police
by eliminating funding for 11,000 FBI personnel and 400 local law
enforcement positions; allow an additional 150,000 pounds of cocaine,
nearly 900 pounds of fentanyl, nearly 2,000 pounds of heroin into our
country; slash rail safety inspections leading to 11,000 fewer rail
safety inspections days next year alone; jeopardize our air safety by
shutting down air traffic control tower services at one third of all
U.S. airports.  
   
And that’s just the start of it.  That’s just the beginning.  So we look
forward to sharing more every day this week.  
   
One — one last thing, and then we’ll get started.  We send our best
wishes to everyone celebrating Nowruz across the United States and
around the world, from the Middle East, to Central and South Asia, and
to Europe.  
   
The Nowruz holiday brings loved ones together around the Haft-Sin table
to reflect on the year that has passed and renew hope for the year
ahead.  
   
This year comes at a difficult time for many families when people is —
when people — when the hope is needed more than ever — including for the
women of Iran, who are fighting for their human rights and fundamental
freedoms.  
   
The United States will continue to stand with the women of Iran and all
the citizens of Iran who are inspiring the world with their conviction
and their courage.  
   
And together with our partners, we will continue to hold Iranian
officials accountable for their attacks against their own people.  
   
With that, you want to kick us off, Zeke?  
   
Q    Yeah.  Thanks, Karine.  First, a moment of personal privilege
here.  
   
I just want to express our apologies in the press corps to the folks
watching at home for the display we saw earlier.  Our responsibility is
to them.  We’re here to ask questions on their behalf, to hold their
government accountable because they can’t all be here.  You know, this
isn’t about us.  
   
So, with that, for you: There were some calls over the weekend, last
couple of days, from small- and mid-size banks calling on the federal
government to insure deposits above $250,000.  Is that something the
President would be supportive of?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, don’t have any new announcement at this time for
you.   
   
And appreciate that, I should say.  I appreciate that.  I think the
American people appreciate that because that is an important message to
send to all of them who are watching.  
   
But as you know, right now, Zeke, our goal is to ensure the financial
system is stable. 

Q    The American people wants you to be fair, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That is their focus of Treas- — that is the focus of
Treasury and the bank regulators.  
   
And as you saw, due to our actions this week at the direction of the
President, Americans should be confident of their deposits.  We’ll be
there when they — when they need them.  
   
And — and so, again, that’s what our focus is going to be.  We don’t
have any new announcements at this time.  But clearly, we want to make
sure that our financial system is stable.  
   
Q    And just briefly on a different topic.  Congress has sent the
President the COVID origins bill.  Does he intend to sign that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I spoke to this last week.  We’re reviewing — we’re
certainly reviewing it.  I just don’t have anything to share on the
President signing the bill at this time or next actions.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  And I’ll join Zeke in what he said earlier.  
   
What does the White House make of former President Trump calling on
supporters to protest his potential indictment?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, it’s an ongoing investigation.  We do
not comment on any ongoing investigations from here.  We’ve been very
consistent on that.  So, certainly I’m not going to break that — kind of
break our protocol here, so I won’t — I won’t comment from here.  
   
Q    I’m not asking about the potential indictment itself.  I’m asking
about the former President calling on supporters to protest —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, that —  
   
Q    — the possibility that he might be indicted.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Understood.  Understood.  I wanted to say that at the
top.  
   
So, look, the President has been very clear when it comes to Americans
who want to — to protest: They should do it peacefully.  And that is
something that is incredibly important that the President has always
continued to say, but I don’t want to get into, you know, hypotheticals
from here.  And so, I’ll just leave it there.  
   
Q    There’s one other thing related to this that isn’t hypothetical,
because now House Republicans are requesting to speak with the Manhattan
district attorney, Alvin Bragg, about his ongoing investigation into
former President Trump.  Is that, in the view of the White House, a
proper use of federal taxpayer dollars to investigate or try to find out
what a local prosecutor is doing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m just not going to speak because that —
they’re un- — that is an underlying connection to — to the — to the
investigation.  Just not going to comment from here.  
   
Look, our — the President is going to continue to focus on what the
American people need, their priorities.  We’re going to continue to
focusing — to focus on lowering costs.  We’re going to continue to focus
on the President fighting for Medicare, Social Security, ACA.  That is
what the President is going to do.  
   
Look, if Republicans — and the President has said this over and over
again — if they — Republicans want to work with us in a bipartisan way
to deliver for the American people, to continue to build on the
successes that we have seen in the last two years when it comes to the
economic policy, building an economy from the bottom up, middle out,
he’s willing to have that conversation.  
   
Q    And we saw what the President proposed on Friday regarding changes
to how the FDIC oversees banks and executives at banks, specifically. 
Has he been in touch directly with any business leaders?  Or who was it
here at the White House that may have had conversations with Warren
Buffett, for example, about the banking crisis?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — so I’ve seen the reports of — on Warren Buffett
that you all have been reporting on.  Don’t — don’t have anything to
read out or to lay out on any conversation.  And so, I’ll just leave it
there.  
   
Q    And the President himself otherwise?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Just — just don’t have anything to read out on
conversations that the President may have had with anybody from the
business sector or outside of — outside of the — of the White House.  
   
What I can say is — and we’ve said this many times before — he has been
kept regularly updated by his economic team, by the Chief of Staff.  And
that continues.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Go ahead, Mary.  
   
Q    To put a — a follow-up on Ed’s question about the former
President’s message to his supporters.  You know, given what we’ve seen
in the past when the former President has urged his supporters to “take
our nation back,” are you concerned and worried as an administration
about the threat of violence?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we — we are always prepared; I can say that
from here.  I’m just not going to get into hypotheticals or any
potential scenarios.  But we are always preparing.  
   
Q    And on the issue of banking, there’s some reporting that Warren
Buffett has been in touch with the administration, you know, playing a
role in sort of helping to advise as you address the banking crisis. 
Can you confirm that?  Can you comment on any conversations with Warren
Buffett?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I — I think Ed just asked that question —  
   
Q    Oh, I’m so sorry.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — Mary.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Can you (inaudible) a little bit more?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I just don’t have anything for you at this time. 
I can confirm that — that I have not had a conversation with Warren
Buffett.  (Laughs.0  But, no, I just don’t have anything to read — to
read out at this time.  No problem.  
   
Q    Just following up on the broad question about banking, can you give
us a sense of next steps in this?  You’ve expressed confidence that the
banking system is strong, but there’s still some jitters out there.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Understood.  Look, the President has already called
for Congress to make it easier for regulators to do the following:
clawback compensation, impose civil — civil penalties, and ban
executives from working in the banking industry.  
   
He will also — going to call on Congress and bank ral- — regulators to
strengthen the rules for larger banks so this doesn’t happen again.

As you know — and I’ve said this many times before — in 2018, we saw
that the previous administration rolled back some of the tough
requirements put — put under — put in place under the Obama-Biden
administration.  And so — which was — which was put in place to
strengthen the financial system. 

So — so, the administration is — again, is going to actively look into
what regulations or laws should be strengthened to prevent this from
happening again. 

But, look, the actions that we saw this weekend, the actions that we
have seen over the past 10 days or so should give the American people
confidence that the — that, you know, depositors will have — their money
will be there when they need it. 

And so, again, we have done everything that we can to make sure that we
hold the — we hold the managers of these ba- — of these banks
accountable and — and that this does not affect and we don’t put on the
hook the taxpayers or the American people.

Q    Is the President worried or is the White House worried about the
politics of this, in terms of banks getting bailouts and average
Americans, so to say, not?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the President made a commitment to make sure
— and you heard — you heard, also, Secretary Yellen speak to this last
week — and ba- — making sure that they’re not put on the hook for this,
right?  Making sure that we make — that the investors, as I just
mentioned, the managers, are — you know, are held accountable. 

And so, the President has made decisive force- — and forceful actions to
strengthen, again, the public confidence in our banking system.  No
taxpayers’ money is being used or put at risk in — with these actions
that have been taken over the last 10 days or so.  And our banking
system remains sound. 

That is something that you heard from Secretary Yellen directly herself
just last week.  And this is all done because of the President’s
direction that he asked the regularly — the regulators to take a look at
it.  He asked the Treasury Department to take a look at it and make sure
that we make these decisive actions.

And, again, we just saw this — some decisive action this weekend.  And
so, we want to make sure — and we’re doing this to make sure that the
Americans are confident — American people are confident in the work that
this administration is trying to do to make sure that — that we meet the
demands, that resources for depositors are met.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Does the President believe that the actions of the
last 10 days, which have been fairly extraordinarily — extraordinary in
scale and scope, are enough?  That we’re past this, we’re through this,
the system is going to be good to go from here on out?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, when you think about the accountability that
the President put forth just on Friday, which focused on ensuring that
senior bank executives are held fully accountable, it builds on our work
to ensure key executives that — that ran Silicon Valley, for example —
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are removed and investors in
these two banks are — take their losses. 

But, again, Congress should act, should make it easier for regulators to
claw back those compensations that I mentioned, impose civil penalties,
and ban executives from working in the banking industry again. 

So, look, we — the President took the necessary actions to meet the
moment that we’re in now.  He believes that Congress co- — needs to
continue to act.  We’re going to continue to have those conversations. 

Of course, there are things that we can do without Congress, which is
what we’re seeing the regulators do.  But this is a — this is a
partnership.  This is — also, we have to do this in hand with Congress. 
So, of course, more should be done and can be done. 

Q    And then just one quick follow-up.  Should — do you guys view this
— you’ve said the issue of confidence several times, in terms of how
people are perceiving this right now.  Do you view this primarily as a
confidence issue, not a system issue or some bigger problem in terms of
the banking sector?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we want to make sure — I think it’s important —
the President believes, as President of the United States, as we’re
seeing what occurred these last, again, 10 days or so — I’ve lost count
— but — that Americans should have confidence.  Right?  They should have
confidence in the banking system.  They should have confidence in the
actions that the regulators have taken, that — again, at the direct- —
the direction of the President. 

And, as you asked me, “Should there be more work to be done?” 
Absolutely.  We should not let Congress off the hook.  They should take
actions in making sure that — moving forward, that our banking system
continues, that we’re doing what — taking the actions to make our banks
and banking system secure. 

So, again, more actions need to be taken, for sure.  The President has —
has taken actions to deal with the moment that we’re in. 

I’ve said this before: What we’re seeing with these — these banks are
distinct to those banks.  But — but we’re in a different place than we
were in 2008 because of — because of the — because of the regulations
that we saw fr- — in the Obama-Biden White House.  And so, that matters
as well.

Q    Thanks, Karine.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    To follow up on that, Karine, you said that there are things that
the White House or the administration can do without Congress.  Do you
have a timeline on this, on when the- — we’ll see that —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, no, it’s a —

Q    — will it be days or weeks or —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s a good question, JJ.  Look, we’re already seeing
some of that underway as regulators have taken action over the last few
— few years to reverse the last administration’s deregulation.  And that
is because of, again, the actions under this President.  And so, we’ve
seen that.  But again, we cannot take Congress off the hook.  And the
regulators are going to take — continue to do what the President asked
of them, again, these past two years. 

But again, Congress has to act.  We need to make sure that they do their
part in this as — as the President is ma- — taking actions to give the
American people confidence. 

Go ahead. 

Q    Does the President view Jerome Powell’s stewardship of these events
as at all a risk to his position as Chairman of the Federal Reserve?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, not at all.  The President has confidence in
Jerome Powell.

Go ahead.

Q    Shares of First Republic Bank have declined in recent days.  Is the
administration considering further steps to support that bank?  And do
those options include, potentially, the FDIC taking over the bank?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, that’s something for the FDIC to speak to. 
I’m not just — I’m not going to comment on any hypotheticals from here.

Q    And Senator Warren was on a number of Sunday shows yesterday.  She
has said the Federal Reserve should stop hiking interest rates in an
effort to control the high inflation, given the circumstances that we’re
in.   
   
What’s the President’s level of concern that another rate increase this
week could further weaken the banking industry and potentially threaten
some of these smaller and mid-size banks?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I understand the question.  As it relates to
the Federal Reserve, we’ve been very clear: They are independent.  They
will make — the President believes that.  The President has been very
clear on that.  And they are going to make their decision — their
monetary policy decision, as it relates to the interest rate, as it
relates to dealing with inflation, which are clearly both connected. 
But I’m just not going to — we’re not going to comment on that from
here.

Go ahead.  I haven’t called on you.

Q    How’s the — switching gears to climate a little bit.  How is the
White House dealing with the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change report that came out today?  Are there plans to change anything
that the administration is doing, or just carry on the programs and
plans you have right now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, have not spoken to our team about the reports.  We
would need to — to go back and — and get their assessment on — on the
report that you just mentioned that came out.  So, just don’t have
anything to share at this time.  But happy — happy to come back to you
on that.

Q    And in terms of preparations for any protests or rallies, what do
those preparations look like?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to get into any — any details from
here.  I think I answered this question just a little bit to your
colleague.  And I just said we’re al- — we’re always prepared.  But
certainly not going to get into hypotheticals.  
Go ahead.

Q    What’s happening with the Cuban baseball defector?  And are there
any concerns about how that might impact any relations with Cuba?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share at this time on that
question.

Go ahead.

Q    Thank you, Karine.  While we’ve been in here, there’s been a couple
of stories that have started to come out about the Economic Report of
the President.  I think there’s an AP story and a New York Times story. 
Do you have anything more to share on when that report is coming out and
any of the toplines from it?  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share at this time.  When
we’re ready, we certainly will share that with all of you. 

Okay, go ahead, Courtney.  Go ahead, Courtney.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  I wanted to ask you — state leaders are
campaigning for abortion access amendments to be put on the ballot in
2023 and 2024.  One example that’s gaining some steam is in Ohio.  Is
the administration doing anything to support this effort or tracking
those ballot initiatives, given that you —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Can you go back to what you said before you said
Ohio?  What — what did —

Q    Yeah.  Ballot initiatives.  There’s leaders that are trying to put
ballot initiatives for 2023 and ’24 for abortion access.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Abortion ac- —

Q    To expand abortion access.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  To abortion — expand —

Q    Kind of like what we saw in Kansas.  Gaining traction to do that in
other states.  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look — look, we — the President has been very clear
about what — especially the day that Roe was no longer the — the law of
the land — that we needed to do everything that was possible to make
sure that we protect women’s rights — women’s rights to healthcare.  And
he’s been very clear about that. 

I don’t have any specifics to say on those particular potential pieces
of legislation.  But, clearly, we welcome legislation that’s going to
support that, that’s going to support women having — being able to make
their own decisions on their healthcare. 

And it is shameful — it is shameful that we’re seeing extreme elected
officials out there talking — talking about national ban on abortion. 
And we’re going to continue to call that out. 

We should not be talking about taking away the freedoms of Americans
across the country, of women across the country.  And so, we’re going to
continue to be very clear about that. 

But, certainly, we would support legislation that helps expand the
access for women.

Q    And if you could provide an update on the case in Texas on
mifepristone.  I know that you’ve gotten that question a couple of times
about how you’re preparing.  We still don’t, obviously, have a court
order.  But can you provide an update for people who are listening who
are worried about this decision and how it might affect their care?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I want to be very careful.  It’s a — it’s a — as
you know, the decision has not happened.  It’s a — it’s an ongoing
litigat- — litigation.  But I’ve spoken at this podium before how
unprecedented if — if the decision, you know, were to ban a pill — this
has been around for more than two decades, that’s in more than 60
countries. 

But again, this is about the FDA’s authority to make it — its
independent, evidence-based decision on drugs. 

And so, those decisions on what medication can be used in our country
should not be determined in court, and they should be determined based
on their safety, science, and the data. 

And so, I want to be very clear.  But — so, we’ll wait.  We’ll await
steps here and speak on this once a decision has been made. 

But again, you know, the President is going to continue to be very vocal
when it comes to protecting women and their rights to choose for
themselves, for their own body, on — on how they want to proceed and
move forward with healthcare.

Q    Thanks.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Aurelia.

Q    Thank you so much.  Tomorrow, the President will take part in this
White House Conservation in Action Summit at the Department of Interior,
where he will — and I quote the guidance — “highlight
the…administration’s actions and historic investments” for the
environment and nature.  
   
But just a few days ago, he greenlighted the Willow project in Alaska,
so this — it looks like he’s sending conflicting signals here.   
   
So can you maybe elaborate on what his approach is on the environment
and what he’s telling especially young activists who protested the
Willow project?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I — you know, I would disagree with that.  As —
as we have said before, the step that the Department of Interior had ta-
— had taken was because of certain legal constraints.  So we have to
remember that.  These were le- — this was part of a legal kind of
decision, as I explained last week.  And tomorrow’s event is about
building on the President’s historic climate and conservation record,
which the President is very proud of. 

If you think about what the President has done — protected more lands
and waters in his first year than any President since JFK.  He — just
last week, he declared the entire U.S. Arctic Ocean off limits to new
oil and gas leasing.  And so — and the Interior Department also
announced it’s preparing new regulations to protect 13 million acres in
Alaska. 

And so, you know, the President is going to continue to fight for
climate — to protect our climate and take those actions.  He’s made the
largest-ever investments in conservation and restoration of our lands
and waters. 

And so, the President is very proud of his record, and he certainly will
never back down from it. 

Go ahead, Karen.

Q    Do you have any details of the Arts and Humanit- — Humanities Award
Ceremony tomorrow?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I do.  I do have some information to share with all of
you.  That’s the awards that are happening tomorrow. 

So — give me one second here. 

So, he’s going to — the President is going to host, in the East Room, a
ceremony at the White House to present the 2021 National Humanit- —
Humanities Medals and the 2021 National Medals of Arts.  First Lady Jill
Biden will attend the ceremony as well. 

We will have more on the recipients of the awards later today.  But
don’t have anything to preview.  But, certainly, we’ll have more to
share.  And this will be, I believe, the first one in this
administration in the past two years. 

Okay.  I’m trying — who have I not called on.

AIDE:  One more.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  One more?  (Laughs.)  Go ahead, Brian.

Q    Thanks a lot, Karine.  I wanted to ask about — President Trump is
going to give a rally in Waco, Texas.  This is the 30th anniversary of
the standoff between Branch Davidians and the FBI and the ATF in Waco. 
Is the Biden administration concerned about anti-government activity in
Waco around the rally?  Are there security concerns that President Trump
may use this anniversary to foment anti-government sentiment at that —
at that event?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, you know, I can’t speak to what the former
President is going to do or say.  What I — I’m not tracking any — any
security concerns.  So, don’t have anything more to share beyond that. 

All right, everybody.  I’ll see you tomorrow.  Thank you. 

Q    Thank you, Karine.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.

3:22 P.M. EDT
