title: "Background Press Call by a Senior Administration Official Previewing German\
  \ Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Visit to the White\_House"

Via Teleconference

5:04 P.M. EST  
   
MODERATOR:  Hi, everyone.  I hope everybody is having a good evening. 
Thanks so much for joining us on our background briefing on Chancellor
Olaf Scholz of Germany’s visit to the White House tomorrow.  
   
I just want to run through a couple of ground rules before we get going
here.  The call is going to be on background, attributable to a “senior
administration official.”  This call is not held under any embargo.   
   
Not for attribution, but for everyone’s awareness — for those on the
call, our speaker this evening is \[senior administration official\].  
   
And we don’t have a ton of time this evening, so I want us to jump right
in.  And with that, I will hand it over to \[senior administration
official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[Moderator\].  And hey,
everybody.  I know John Kirby did a full rundown on the Scholz visit at
the podium today.  So will be fairly limited in my opening comments, and
then happy to take a couple of questions.   
   
As everybody is tracking, tomorrow, President Biden is going to welcome
Chancellor Scholz of Germany to the White House.  Scholz was just here
over a year ago in February, and obviously a very different geopolitical
landscape that we are facing now than when he was first here.  He was
also here several weeks after he had been elected and taken office.   
   
And so, this meeting really is a good opportunity for the two leaders, a
year in, to take stock on the further deepening of our bilateral
cooperation over the last year.  And in particular, to assess where we
are with the war in Ukraine a year on.   
   
President Biden obviously had a good working relationship with
Chancellor Merkel when she came in, who he had known for many years, and
I think very quickly has developed a strong partnership with Chancellor
Scholz over the last year-plus that the Chancellor has been in
office.   
   
Last year, Chancellor Scholz and Germany, of course, had the
chairmanship of the G7, which ended up being a very pivotal, critical
time for the G7, given everything that we were seeing in Ukraine, and
also gave a lot of opportunities for the two leaders to engage over the
last year.   
   
So, they saw each other, of course, on the margins of the G7 summit in
Germany last summer.  They saw each other at a number of NATO summits
that we have had, as well as the G20 Summit in Bali.  And they have
spoken by phone regularly, including three times, I believe, in January,
focusing on security assistance and our continued coordination on
Ukraine.   
   
This visit, of course, comes as we have just marked the one-year
anniversary since Russia launched its brutal invasion of Ukraine.   
   
And as I mentioned, one of the overarching objectives for the President
heading into this conflict was to build and maintain transatlantic
unity, as well as broad international support.  And I think feels that
we have worked hand in hand with Germany, both bilaterally as well as
through the Quad, the Quint, the G7, in partnership with the EU, and
also within the NATO Alliance, as well as the Ukraine Defense Contact
Group.   
   
The meeting that the two leaders are having tomorrow is very much a
working visit.  We’re expecting it to be a one-hour meeting or so. 
There will likely be a significant one-on-one component, which I think
is a reflection of the close relationship between the two leaders and
the opportunity for the two of them to be able to have in-depth and
face-to-face conversations.   
   
Ukraine, I think, will be a major topic of conversation in this
meeting.  The President, of course, was just in Kyiv.  Chancellor Scholz
also had the opportunity to meet with the Zelenskyy in person, along
with President Macron, in Paris last month.  And so, this will be a good
opportunity for the leaders to be able to exchange notes on their recent
meetings with the Ukrainian President and their assessment of where
things stand in the war, one year on.   
   
We also anticipate that the leaders will touch base on a number of other
issues that are on our shared global agenda.  Both of them focused on
the upcoming NATO Summit that we’ll have in Vilnius in July, as well as
other global issues, including the challenges posed by the People’s
Republic of China.   
   
So very much looking forward to his visit, and very much expected to be
a productive conversation between the two.   
   
So let me leave it there, and I’m happy to take some questions.  
   
Q     Hi.  I wanted to see if you can talk some more about the concerns
that China could provide lethal aid to Russia and how that has provided
the impetus for the meeting tomorrow or — and how that might be a topic
of conversation for the meeting tomorrow.   
   
And also, you know, for a one-hour long meeting, you know, how long do
you think it will just be the two of them?  And where in the White House
do you expect them to meet?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks very much.  I — in terms of
where they expect to meet, I would assume that a significant portion of
the meeting will take place in the Oval Office.  
   
In terms of how much of that will be one-on-one versus an expanded
bilateral is going to be very much a decision made by the two leaders. 
So, hard for that to predict.   
   
In terms of China, it was not a driving focus for this meeting.  Like I
said, the overarching purpose of this meeting was a chance for the two
leaders to be able to coordinate specifically on Ukraine, as well as to
touch on a broader set of foreign policy challenges.  But I think it
certainly is possible, within the context of a conversation on Ukraine,
that the China aspect would come up.   
   
So far, we haven’t seen that — that China has provided lethal aid to
Russia — but obviously it’s very much a situation that we’re
tracking.   
   
Russia’s war in Ukraine has put China in a difficult position, and every
step that China takes toward Russia makes it harder for China with
Europe and with others around the world.  It’s a distraction for China
and a potential blow to their international relationships that they
don’t need or want.   
   
And we have been clear with China from the beginning about our concerns
and the implications of providing this kind of support to Russia.   
   
Chancellor Scholz spoke to his parliament earlier today and similarly
said publicly that he was very much cautioning against Chinese support
for Russia’s war in Ukraine and calling on Beijing to use its influence
with the Kremlin to encourage Moscow to withdraw from Ukrainian
territory.   
   
So, I think this is another aspect of our approach to Ukraine where
we’re aligned with the German view.  
   
Q     Hi, thank you so much for doing this, \[senior administration
official\].  I wonder if you can say a word about, you know, the — in
the run-up to the start of the war, the U.S. and the G7 allies and
others had a whole package of sanctions ready to go, basically, when the
war started.  And you’re — you know, obviously, you’ve been working
through subsequent packages of sanctions.  Are you doing similar prep
now to get ready for this possibility that, you know, there is evidence
that China is providing lethal aid to Russia?   
   
And can you tell us — you know, we understand that you are reaching out
to allies.  Can you just put some more color on that?  Like, you know,
will that be a significant — sort of preparing for a next load of
sanctions?  Is that a significant part of what will be discussed
tomorrow?  
   
But can you also say what other countries you had reached out to
specifically on that?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, so I’m not going to be able to
get into full detail about all of the conversations we’re having.  But
obviously, a situation that we’re tracking and obviously something that
we’re talking about, especially with our partners in Europe.  And as I
mentioned, I expect it will be something that the two leaders will
discuss tomorrow.  
   
In terms of your question on sanctions, you know, we’ve already taken
action against third-party actors who support Russia’s war against
Ukraine.  And we’ll continue to do so.   
   
And if you look at the recent G7 statement that came out on the
anniversary, that also made clear the commitment and the current action
of taking actions against third-country actors materially supporting
Russia’s war in Ukraine.   
   
So very much something that we’re engaging on diplomatically with our
partners and something that we’re already actively taking action on and
continuing to discuss.  
   
Q     Hi, thank you for taking my question.  So you mentioned about —
they’re going to talk about the challenge posed by China.  Does that
mean that President Biden will ask Germany to play a bigger role in the
Indo-Pacific region?  And with the announcement of providing arms sales
to Taiwan, the recent one, will that encourage — would you worry that —
or have concerns that China is going to use that as its excuse to
provide weapons to Russia as a revenge move?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, I’m not the China expert here at
the NSC, so I’m not going to get into the details of China and Taiwan
and some of the broader implications, and really can only reiterate what
I had said previously, which is that we’re going to continue to have
conversations with our allies and partners about the concerns that we
have.  
   
I think, very much welcome Chancellor Scholz and others who are
similarly conveying concerns to Beijing about supporting Russia’s war in
Ukraine; calling on Beijing to use their influence with the Kremlin to
encourage Moscow to withdraw from Ukrainian territory; and as all of the
leaders in the G7, Europe, of course, then, and including Japan, noted,
the fact that we are taking actions against third-country actors
materially supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine.   
   
So, assume that the conversation that they have will be very much along
those lines.  
   
Q     Hi, thank you so much for taking my question.  I just wondered,
are you expecting Chancellor Scholz to bring up Germany’s concerns about
the Inflation Reduction Act?  I mean, obviously, Germany is a big
automotive producer and Europe, in general, has been concerned about the
effects of that legislation on its auto sector.  And if they do bring it
up, is there anything that President Biden has to tell them about how
the U.S. is going to be addressing those concerns?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It’s certainly possible that Chancellor
Scholz will choose to raise the Inflation Reduction Act in their
meeting.  I think President Biden’s message is going to be along the
lines of what we have been saying and doing, which is continuing to
consult closely with our allies and partners on the implementation of
the IRA, as well as on European plans to further incentivize clean
energy development.   
   
I think our view very much is that the IRA’s benefits expand beyond the
U.S., in terms of helping drive down costs for clean technology, which
will help other nations go further and faster in building their own
clean energy economies.   
   
Our belief also very much is that energy security is national security,
and hope that other countries follow the U.S. lead and pass their own
IRAs.  And we want to coordinate with them as they do it.   
   
Chancellor Scholz, of course, is in coalition with the Green Party,
which has long been making the case on the importance of climate change,
and, I think, will welcome the increased U.S. focus on the climate
crisis and on taking active steps to try and address that crisis.   
   
We, of course, set up a task force with the European Union, and we’re
continuing to work through that process as well.  
   
Q     ZDF German TV.  Thank you very much for doing that, \[senior
administration official\].  Question: During the Munich Security
Conference, we heard from many Eastern European countries that they
would like Germany to play a bigger role in coordinating the efforts and
being their — I would say — advocate a little bit more.  Is that
something that the Biden administration would support and ask for in a
meeting with the Chancellor?  
   
And number two, if I may —  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sorry, just on that — playing a more
active role in being an advocate on what specifically?  
   
Q     Basically coordinating with the Eastern European countries within
NATO, specifically the Baltics and some other Eastern European
countries.  It’s a little bit difficult with Poland right now.  We heard
it specifically from the Baltic countries.   
   
And if I might add one more, which is: How eager are you to have Germany
have a national security strategy that it can work with?  We have been
waiting, I think, for this for more than a year now.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I — thanks for both of those.  I think
both of those questions are ultimately better directed against the
German government or to the German government rather than here.   
   
I, you know, on the question of the role that Germany is playing, in
terms of its neighbors, I will let Berlin speak to that.  Certainly,
we’ve had very good coordination with the Europeans generally, as well
as with Germany specifically, in response to the war in Ukraine.   
   
The President, of course, engaged with the B9 NATO eastern flank allies
during his meeting to Warsaw.   
   
And I think it’s going to be in everyone’s interest to continue this
close coordination, especially in the run-up to the Vilnius Summit.  And
obviously, it’s in our interest to have strong relations within all
countries in the alliance.   
   
And on Germany’s national security strategy, again, a decision for the
German government to make.  Obviously, sitting here in the U.S. National
Security Council, it’s a structure that has worked for us, but we’ll
defer to Germany for them to make their own decisions on their internal
bureaucratic processes.   
   
I will say that we’ve had excellent coordination throughout this
administration with the Chancellor’s government, including very regular
communications between us here at the National Security Council, the
Chancellery’s office, the two national security advisors are in regular
contact, as well as good communication between our foreign and defense
ministries as well, particularly on these Ukraine-related issues.  
   
Q     Thank you so much, \[Moderator\].  I really appreciate you giving
us the time to get an understanding of the visit.  My question to you
is: Will Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa be touched upon, given also the
fact that Germany has been ramping up to put together its own Africa
strategy?  So, if you could speak to that: Will the two leaders spend
some time to talk about this very important voting bloc at the U.N. and
other areas where they may have an overlapping interest on the region? 
Thanks, \[Moderator\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, as I said at the top, I suspect
that the bulk of the meeting is going to focus on Ukraine, just given
the outsized role that the Ukrainian conflict is playing in terms of
European security at the moment.  So, it’s a one-hour meeting, and I
think a lot of it will focus on Ukraine.   
   
As I also said, I think it is possible that the leaders will touch on
some other shared global foreign policy interests.  So, it is possible
that Ukraine — or that that Africa could come up in that context.  Hard
to — hard to say, but certainly possible that the leaders could touch on
that.  
   
Q     Hi, thank you for taking my call — my question, I’m sorry.  During
today’s White House briefing, John Kirby said that tomorrow there will
be an announcement that the U.S. is providing another round of
assistance for Ukraine.  I’m just wondering if you can provide or give
us some details.  You know, what kind of assistance are we talking
about?  Is it humanitarian assistance?  Are we talking about weapons? 
What exactly are we talking about here?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, I don’t have the exact transcript
of what John Kirby had said.  \[Moderator\], I don’t know if you’re
tracking that.   
   
We certainly have continued to roll out a series of security assistance
packages to Ukraine, as well as ongoing provision of economic and energy
and other types of assistance.   
   
So, I don’t know specifically what John Kirby was referring to, but I
think, in general, yes, we are continuing to provide security assistance
packages to Ukraine and have been continuing to announce them and roll
those out on a fairly regular basis.  
   
MODERATOR:  Michael, stay tuned for tomorrow.  As Kirby said, we’ll have
more detail.  More to come.  
   
Q     Hi.  Yeah, let — honestly, the other reporters pretty much asked
all the questions I was going to ask.  So let me just toss this one out
there: You folks gave Emmanuel Macron of France a steak dinner.  Why not
do the same for the German Chancellor?  Did that come up as a
possibility?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is very much a working visit.  You
know, there’s a — I’m not going to get into — to all of what is done or
is not done in terms of state visits.  I — this certainly is not
intended in any way as a commentary on the relationship that we have
with Germany.   
   
This is, in fact, the second time that the German Chancellor is going to
be in the White House in just a year.  And I’m hard pressed to think of
other leaders that have spent as much time here in the White House this
early in the administration or have spoken to the President as nearly
frequently as the two of them have.   
   
So both of the leaders wanted this to be a working-level meeting, wanted
it to be very much a “get down into the weeds” focus on the issues of
Ukraine.  And so, this is very much in keeping with both — what both of
the leaders were interested in having and what they thought was going to
be essential to get the necessary work done on our shared focus.
