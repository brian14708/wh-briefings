5:34 P.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Hi, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us on the call
this evening.  We’re going to talk a little bit about the Summit for
Democracy, which, as my colleagues here will preview, is a little bit
underway already.   
   
By joining this call, just a reminder, you’re agreeing to the terms of
the embargo for the call, which is until 5:00 a.m.  Eastern time
tomorrow.  We are going to heavily preview some announcements.   
   
For the awareness of those on the call but not for attribution, joining
us on the call tonight are \[senior administration official\], over from
the NSC side of things.  And on the DPC side of things, we have \[senior
administration official\].   
   
So, with that, I’m going to hand it over to \[senior administration
official\], who’s going to start with a few remarks, and then we’ll open
it up to questions.  Thanks.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks for that, \[Moderator\].  And
hi, everybody.  Thanks for joining and taking the time.   
   
As \[Moderator\] mentioned, really pleased to be with all of you to
discuss the second Summit for Democracy, which officially kicks off
bright and early tomorrow morning but, as \[Moderator\] said, has
already occasioned a pretty impressive series of events in Washington
and around the world.  And I’ll come back to that momentarily.  
   
But first, let me just say at the top why the U.S. government is holding
a Summit for Democracy for a second time around.   
   
As President Biden has said, we’re currently at an inflection point when
it comes to the future of democracy, both within the United States and
globally.   
   
When the President came into office, he said that a defining question at
this moment is whether democracies will continue to deliver for their
people in a rapidly changing world.  So that’s really what the summit is
about.  It’s about shining a spotlight on a critical issue of our time
and spurring action in line with the summit’s themes, which are
strengthening democratic resilience, promoting respect for human rights,
and advancing the fight against corruption so that, ultimately,
democracies can continue to deliver for their citizens and address the
world’s most pressing challenges.   
   
Now, a lot has happened in the 15 months since we held the first Summit
for Democracy.  The world has witnessed profound change, first by
emerging from a global pandemic and then also, of course, responding
decisively as Russia brutally invaded its neighbor Ukraine in violation
of the U.N. Charter.   
   
And our take is that the events of 2022 put in stark relief what
countless studies have already shown, that democratic government,
grounded in the rule of law and the will of the governed, remain, for
all its messiness and challenges, the best tool humanity has to unleash
human potential, maintain international peace and security, grow
prosperity, and uphold human dignity.   
   
And two years into the Biden administration, to borrow a phrase that the
President has mentioned multiple times, democracies have grown stronger,
not weaker, and autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.  In short,
democracy is proving its resilience.   
   
So that’s the context in which President Biden and his four co-hosts
from all corners of the world — the leaders of Costa Rica, the
Netherlands, Zambia, and the Republic of Korea — will officially kick
off the second Summit for Democracy in the morning.   
   
So, from there, let me just say a few things about what we expect the
President to announce tomorrow.  At the first Summit for Democracy,
President Biden launched what we called the Presidential Initiative for
Democratic Renewal, which committed just over $400 million in new
foreign assistance programs and policies in key areas like fighting
corruption, bolstering democratic reformers, supporting free and
independent media, advancing technology for democracy, and defending
free and fair elections.  And a number of these programs were pretty
innovative, whether they dealt with new ways to protect journalists from
slap lawsuits to how they helped partner governments deploy digital
technology.   
   
Tomorrow, President Biden will announce another major investment by the
U.S. government in the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal:
up to $690 million in additional funding.   
   
Additionally, as part of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic
Renewal, the U.S. will be making a series of announcements this week
about the steps we and our partners are taking to ensure that technology
works for and not against democracy.  That’s going to be a major theme
both of our agenda and of various initiatives that we announce.   
   
We led off yesterday when the President signed a new executive order on
the prohibition on use by the U.S. government of commercial spyware that
poses risks to national security.  And what the EO does is it
establishes this U.S. policy that the U.S. government will not make
operational use of commercial spyware that poses significant
counterintelligence or security risks to the U.S. government or
significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or foreign
person, including to abuse the human rights of journalists, activists,
or opposition political figures.   
   
Tomorrow and then in more depth on Thursday, in an event we’re going to
dedicate to our technology agenda, we’re going to announce the other
steps we’re taking to counter the misuse of technology and the rise of
digital authoritarianism as part of our broader tech agenda, from
bringing other countries on board to regulate their own use of
commercial spyware, to better protecting activists from cyber threats,
to working with partners to better integrate human rights criteria in
export control regimes.   
   
Turning to our schedule of events, while the formal summit, as I
mentioned, starts very early tomorrow morning, given the time zone
change with our Korean partners who will be leading off the first panel,
our civil society partners actually kicked us off yesterday with a
series of more than 50 events they organized tied to the overall themes
of the summit.   
   
And these events took place in Washington, but they also took place in
Nairobi and in Barcelona and in Timor-Leste and in over a dozen cities
around the world.   
   
And we really find it fitting that the week of a Summit for Democracy
began with our civil society partners sharing their perspectives on how
best to support and protect democracy worldwide.  As with the message
we’re sending with the four co-hosts in addition to the United States,
it’s important to note that this is a global aspiration.   
   
Then today, the U.S. government organized nine live and in-person
thematically focused events in Washington, demonstrating how the U.S.
with our international partners is leading progress in several areas
critical to democratic renewal.  And some of our senior-most department
and agency leaders headlined these events.   
   
So, for instance, Secretary Blinken hosted events on a just and lasting
peace in Ukraine and separately on the imperative of gender equality. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen hosted an event on the importance of the fight
against corruption.  And Deputy Commerce Secretary Graves led an event
with private sector companies who were making commitments to support
democracy as part of this process.   
   
Then tomorrow, President Biden will be joined in the morning at 6:00
a.m. by President Chaves of Costa Rica, Prime Minister Rutte of the
Netherlands, President Yoon of the Republic of Korea, and President
Hichilema of the Republic of Zambia in opening the formal summit.   
   
Each of the co-host countries will then, over the course of the day,
host a plenary session on a different theme that will include a number
of other leaders.  President Biden’s plenary will begin right around
11:30 a.m. tomorrow morning.   
   
Throughout the day, we’ll also have interventions from noteworthy
pro-democracy and human rights advocates who will have a chance to
address governmental leaders.  Among others, we’ll hear from Sviatlana
Tsikhanouskaya, the leader of the Democratic Opposition of Belarus;
Lesther Alemán, a recently released political prisoner from Nicaragua;
and Bryan Stevenson, the Executive Director of the Equal Justice
Initiative here in the U.S., to discuss domestic democracy issues.   
   
On Thursday, each summit co-host government will then host in its
capital an in-person gathering with representatives both from foreign
governments — mainly from their regions, but we’re also doing some
cross-regional pollination — and non-governmental actors.   
   
And so, what we think audiences will witness on March 30th, Thursday, is
pretty unique.  We’re going to have an ongoing summit in five locations
on the same day, more or less simultaneously, around the world.   
   
And as I mentioned before, the U.S.-hosted event on Thursday will focus
on advancing technology for democracy.   
   
Our foreign partners are going to focus their in-person events on March
30th on other thematic topics essential to the functioning of
representatives and accountable government.  So, the Costa Rican event
is going to focus on the role of youth in democratic systems.  The Dutch
event will focus on media freedom.  The South Korean event will focus on
the fight against corruption.  And the Zambian event will focus on free
and fair elections.   
   
And to each of these events, as a show of support, the U.S. government
is sending high-level delegations to each of our co-host partner
capitals.  And I’d be happy to go through those details if folks would
like.   
   
I’ll close just by saying one last word about one other announcement
we’ll be making tomorrow.  Beginning with the first summit in 2021, at
this point, we’ve brought together hundreds of leaders from governments,
civil society, the private sector committed to strengthening democratic
governance, protecting human rights, and advancing the fight against
corruption.   
   
Governments have made hundreds of commitments.  We will, in all
likelihood, hear about follow-through on those tomorrow and Thursday. 
NGOs have used the summit platform to expand their own work.  And
companies have taken action to improve democratic resilience through
their business practices.   
   
And the feedback we’ve gotten on all of this is that the work is ongoing
and that it can and should continue after the conclusion of this
summit.  We really think of this as much more of a process than two
defined meetings, although the meetings are important.   
   
And so, to that end, we’re really pleased to share that the Republic of
Korea has agreed to host a future third summit.  So, we just want to say
how thankful we are to our Korean partners for taking on that
responsibility, which will be officially announced tomorrow morning.   
   
So, with that, I will stop and take questions.   
   
Q    Hi, thank you for doing this.  One, I was just wondering if you
could put a little bit more layer — and I apologize if I missed it at
the top of the call — on the major $600-plus million announcement on
democratic renewal.  How will that money be spent?  
   
And then second, could you talk a little bit about how the U.S. — you
know, 15 months later after the first summit during the administration,
how you would rate progress on protecting and reviving democracy here
has been — and particularly, when the administration has been facing
some criticism on things like how they’ve countered, how they’ve reacted
on action in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, and even more recently in Israel? 
Thank you.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  Thanks, Aamer.  Good to talk to
you again.  So we’d be happy to send around — we’ve actually put out a
couple of factsheets on the Presidential Initiative for Democratic
Renewal both when we announced it back at the first summit in December,
and then we put out an update over the course of the interval between
the two summits.  So that’ll provide a lot of this detail.   
   
But as I mentioned, it’s divided, essentially, into five pillars.  One
is supporting free and independent media; two is combating corruption;
three is bolstering democratic reformers and supporting human rights;
fourth is advancing technology for democracy; and fifth is defending
free and fair elections. 

And so, under each one of those categories, departments and agencies,
primarily but not exclusively, the State Department and USAID, have
launched a number of new programmatic efforts.  And I will spare
everyone kind of ticking through them one by one; there are quite a
few.  But in all cases on the programming, these are new programs that
were essentially designed to update our foreign assistance in the
democracy, human rights, and governance space to address more modern
challenges.   
   
And so, the re-up is going to be significantly more than what we
announced in ‘21 and is going to continue to advance those ongoing
programs, which again are only in most cases about a year old at this
point.   
   
In addition to that, the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal
also contains policy initiatives.  And again, we can shoot the details
over to you, but a lot of what we’re doing the second time around,
beyond the big number around the foreign assistance programming, deals
with those policy areas.  And the one in particular where we really feel
like we’re leaning in is the Advancing Technology for Democracy agenda. 

So I mentioned the prohibition on use of commercial spyware.  We will
also make — we’ll have a little bit more to say about this tomorrow, but
a number of additional announcements around, essentially, a three-part
plan for our technology agenda: our affirmative case — what we’re
standing for by way of supporting technology that works for democracy;
then what we’re standing against, what we’re trying to counter — the
misuse of technology and rise of digital authoritarianism.  And then
third, we’ll have a series of announcements around looking forward in
terms of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. 

And that’s really what our thematic day on Thursday is going to be all
about.   
   
So I’ll move to your second question.  I mean, the issue around rating
progress is really a tough one, of course.  One can look at this from a
number of different ways. 

What I will say broadly in terms of the idea that we’re at a little bit
of an inflection point, credible external organizations like Freedom
House that document democracy and human rights around the world have
really identified that 2022 was something of a turning point. 

That doesn’t necessarily dictate the future, as we all know.  The whole
point of the Summit for Democracy process is to continue to work on this
topic and to shine a spotlight and to spur action.  But we do feel like
there’s a momentum shift, and we’re looking to capitalize on that.   
   
And I think to the point of your question, that has a lot to do with
U.S. foreign policy.  And I won’t get into the particulars on any one
bilateral relationship, but I think we can stand by our record when it
comes to raising human rights issues with competitors and adversaries
and security partners alike.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you.  I just — can you walk through — I see there’s a
video address by the Taiwan Minister of Digital Affairs.  Is Taiwan
participating — to what extent is Taiwan participating in the
summit/were they invited to participate in the summit?  This was
obviously a factor in the initial summit 15 months ago.  Thanks.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, Josh.  Yes, you’re
right.  Taiwan was invited back in — at the first summit in 2021 and has
remained actively engaged in the Summit for Democracy’s various
processes.  They were engaged in the — what we call our “focal group,”
which was a group of governments and other partners who continued to
plan in between the two summits and otherwise have demonstrated
continued commitment to strengthening democratic resilience at home and
abroad. 

So they were once again invited, and that was consistent with our
unofficial relationship and the United States’ One China policy, which
has not changed and remains guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the
Three Joint Communiqués, and the Six Assurances. 

And I’ll just close out by saying Taiwan has been invited to attend in a
manner that is consistent with our longstanding policy, which remains
unchanged and essentially will mirror the approach we took in 2021.   
   
Q    Yeah, hello?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, George, go ahead.   
   
Q    Yes, hi.  President Zelenskyy spoke at the first summit.  What is
his participation in this summit and how much does Ukraine’s fight for —
to keep its democracy overshadow or affect this summit?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks for that.  So President
Zelenskyy will speak again.  He is scheduled to speak in President
Biden’s plenary session tomorrow at 11:30 as one of the number of world
leaders.  And as you may have caught in my intro, we also held today an
event hosted by Secretary Blinken on parameters for a just and
sustainable peace in Ukraine that was attended by a number of foreign
ministers. 

So Ukraine, of course, a major geopolitical event over the course of the
last year, absolutely essential in terms of the bravery that the
Ukrainian government and people are showing in defending their democracy
from brutal aggression.  So it is very much a part of the second
summit.   
   
That said, we should be clear, the first summit was before Russia’s
renewed invasion of Ukraine, and that’s because democracy was under
stress in any number of different ways, both from external actors, of
course, as Russia’s invasion illustrates, but also there are, as we’re
all well aware, many domestic challenges, whether from the rise of
populist leaders or because of the impacts of technology and the
communication space and so on.  So there’s a lot to discuss outside of
the context of Ukraine as well.   
   
Q    Yes.  Just wanted to ask you about how the countries that were
invited this year that were not there last year or the last time around
were selected and, vice versa, some countries that were there before and
are no longer there.  Like, what was the criteria for the selection of
invited countries?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you for that question.  So just
to clarify one point before I get into the new invitations, there were
no invitations from the first summit that were rescinded for the second
summit.  So all those that were invited to the first summit were
extended an invitation the second time around.   
   
We did invite a handful of additional governments to the second summit
that did not receive an invitation to the first.  I’ll just mention
those quickly: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Liechtenstein, Cote d’Ivoire,
Gambia, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Honduras. 

And there’s a huge range of experience and depth of democratic
consolidation in those countries, obviously each a unique case.  But
what I’ll say by way of criteria for additions is we really see this as
a process by which to spur positive reform when it comes to the summit’s
themes of democratic renewal and respect for human rights and the fight
against corruption. 

There’s an incredibly broad swath of countries invited to participate in
this process, from those with deeply consolidated democracies all the
way through governments that have some democratic institutions and some
non-democratic institutions. 

But in all cases, what we’re looking for is positive will to move in the
right direction.  And we really want to use the summit itself and the
process to put wind in the sails of actors who are interested in
positive steps in this regard.  So there’s a story to be told for each
of the new additions in that regard.   
   
Q    Hey, thanks so much for doing this call.  You mentioned a
three-part agenda on what you’re standing for in terms of technology and
then a series of announcements on what you’re looking for in terms of
emerging technology.  I’m wondering if you might be able to offer any
substance on this call on what we can expect from those
announcements.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, I’ll say just a little bit more. 
And then, again, I think we’re going to do a call that’s going to go
into more depth on this tomorrow. 

I mentioned the executive order on commercial spyware.  Tomorrow, we are
going to also announce that we are entering into — or, we have a kind of
joint commitment on efforts to counter the proliferation and misuse of
commercial spyware with a handful — somewhere on the order of around ten
— different foreign partners who are committed to taking steps like what
we did through the executive order.   
   
Similarly, we will be announcing that we’ve come to the text of what
we’re calling “guiding principles” on how rights-respecting governments
should use surveillance technology, more broadly.  And so the idea here
is these technologies, of course, have lawful applications but have also
been shown to be heavily misused by authoritarian states, and so we want
to get states on the record in terms of promoting rules of the road for
their use.  
   
Then I’ll just mention one more in this regard.  At the first summit, we
launched something we called the Export Controls and Human Rights
Initiative, which is a process by which participating countries agree to
better integrate human rights criteria in their export control regimes. 

And at the first summit, we announced that we would work with partner
countries to develop a code of conduct.  And so there’s been a lot of
diplomatic spade work that’s gone into that process over the past year
or so, and we’ll be launching with a number of partners that code of
conduct to advance the conversation around how we can control those
sorts of tools.   
   
On the shaping emerging technologies front, we’ll also be making a few
announcements.  So, here at the White House, the Office of Science and
Technology Policy will be releasing its national strategy on advancing
privacy, preserving data sharing and analytics, and NIST, at the
Commerce Department, is going to launch a new resource center on
artificial intelligence for risk management purposes.

So, more to come on that and more tomorrow.   
   
Q    Got it, thank you.   
   
MODERATOR:  All right, that concludes our call this evening.  Thank you
all for your time.  Looking forward to talking more about this
tomorrow.  Take care.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, everyone.  
   
6:02 P.M. EDT
