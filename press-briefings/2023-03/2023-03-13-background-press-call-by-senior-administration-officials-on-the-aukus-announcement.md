Via Teleconference

MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Hi, everyone.  Sorry for the delay here.  We’re
making sure that everyone was able to join the call and hop on.   
   
Welcome to our briefing on the upcoming AUKUS announcement.  As a
reminder, today’s call is on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials,” and embargoed until tomorrow, Monday, March
13th, at 1:00 p.m. San Diego time and 4:00 p.m. D.C. time.  Again,
that’s Monday, March 13th at 1:00 p.m. San Diego time and 4:00 p.m. DC
time.   
   
For your awareness, not for your reporting, on the line today, we have
\[senior administration official\], \[senior administration official\],
and \[senior administration official\].  They’ll have some words at the
top, and then, of course, we’re happy to take your questions.   
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to you, \[senior administration
official\].   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, \[moderator\].  And good
morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us.  And again, sorry for the
little bit of delay.  So, we’ll just go quickly through some highlights,
and then we’re obviously welcome and hopeful to be able to answer some
of your questions.   
   
On Monday, at our naval base in San Diego, the President will host the
prime ministers of Australia and Great Britain for our next phase in our
AUKUS engagement.  And the President will share that just 18 months
after our original AUKUS announcement, and that’s two days before the
timeline we promised that we would report back, back in September
2021.   
   
We will announce we’ve identified the optimal pathway to provide
Australia with a conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarine.  It’s a
multi-phased approach that will deliver to Australia that capability far
more quickly than even we thought possible when we originally and
initially launched this partnership.  And it will result in all three
nations lifting their game in their respective submarine industrial
bases.  And it will involve a level of sensitive, sophisticated
technological cooperation that is almost without precedent.  It’s only
happened once with the United States and Great Britain, and that was 65
years ago.   
   
A year and a half ago, we announced AUKUS with two of our closest allies
to take on the threats of the 21st century, just as we did together in
the 20th century.  AUKUS’s primary objective is to uphold peace and
stability in the Indo-Pacific and to deter and defend against rapidly
evolving threats to the international order and system there.   
   
But frankly, it’s far more than simply a defense program.  It is
arguably the most prominent example of President Biden’s commitment to
invest in and modernize our alliances.  AUKUS builds upon the UK’s
relatively recent strategic engagement in the Indo-Pacific and ensures
it will be a lasting presence going forward and brings another European
partner into our engagement in Asia.  It makes Australia a major
contributor to Indo-Pacific security and stability, and it binds the
three of us together in ways almost unimaginable for the foreseeable
future.   
   
AUKUS, in many ways, headlines early achievement of President Biden’s
Indo-Pacific strategy for connecting allies in the Pacific and the
Atlantic to build collective capacity that leaves us all stronger and
more stable.   
   
The United States, Australia, and the UK have briefed our allies and
partners around the world, from Europe to Asia to the Pacific, on
tomorrow’s announcement, and we will carry forward AUKUS openly and
transparently.   
   
And, \[senior administration official\], over to you for some of the
specific details along, with \[senior administration official\] as
well.  Thank you, \[senior administration official\].   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  Before going through the optimal pathway, I want to
emphasize that President Biden has a long history of commitment to
non-proliferation, going back to his days as a senator.  And since day
one of this effort or consultation period, we have prioritized
non-proliferation.  We’ve kept the IAEA informed.  And, in fact, IAEA
Director General Grossi has complimented us publicly on our approach and
our transparency.  And AUKUS will adhere to the highest
non-proliferation standards.   
   
Now, on the optimal pathway, there are three phases in Australia’s
undersea capabilities.  And our combined deterrence posture to promote
security in the Indo-Pacific will increase with each phase.   
   
Here’s how it will work.  Phase one is already underway with
accelerating moves in the next few years.  U.S. and UK submarines will
visit ports in Australia and that will increase, starting this year.  In
fact, the USS Asheville is in Perth, Australia now for combined training
exercises.  Australian sailors will increasingly embed in U.S. and UK
submarine forces and nuclear power schools.  This has already started. 
And in the coming months, there’ll be Australian workers in our
shipyards.  And starting this year, Australia will be building up its
facilities and infrastructure to house Australia as well as U.S. and UK
submarines.   
   
Once Australia is ready, as early as 2027, we will establish a
rotational force of U.S. and UK submarines in Australia — what we’re
calling Submarine Rotational Forces West.  This rotational force will
help build Australia’s stewardship.  It will also bolster deterrence
with more U.S. and UK submarines forward in the Indo-Pacific.   
   
Now phase two will start in the early 2030s.  Once the Australians are
trained and ready, Australia will buy from the United States three
Virginia-class conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines with an
option to buy two more if needed.  This will help systematically grow
Australians’ capabilities and stewardship for nuclear-powered submarines
and it will help ensure that Australia does not experience any
capability gap when its current Collins-class diesel electric subs are
retired in the 2030s.  This means that Australia will have a potent
nuclear-powered submarine force in 2030s much earlier than many had
expected.   
   
And now, phase three starts in the late 2030s, with work to facilitate
it starting in the near term in the industrial base that \[senior
administration official\] will talk about.   
   
Australia’s long term submarine will be a state-of-the-art platform that
uses the best of U.S., UK, and Australian technologies.  It will be
known as SSN AUKUS.   
   
SSN AUKUS will be based on the United Kingdom design for its
next-generation nuclear-powered attack submarine, and it will
incorporate critical cutting-edge Virginia-class technologies from the
United States.   
   
SSN AUKUS will be built and deployed by both Australia and the UK.  The
United Kingdom intends to deliver its first SSN AUKUS domestically in
the late 2030s.  Australia intends to deliver the first SSN AUKUS built
in Australia to the Royal Australian Navy in the early 2040s.   
   
This is going to require significant improvements in industrial bases in
all three countries that \[senior administration official\] will talk
about.  We briefed Congress on this plan and see strong bipartisan
support.   
   
And now let me turn to \[senior administration official\] for some
additional comments.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thank you.  Good afternoon,
everyone.  As you all know, this is particularly exciting insofar as our
allies and our undersea capabilities are two unique advantages of the
United States.  And this is an extraordinary way to bring those together
to ensure Indo-Pacific security and stability and to deliver
deterrence.   
   
I would underscore that there has been unprecedented interagency
cooperation throughout these 18 months of dialogue, and Secretary Austin
has personally had his hand on the tiller in making this all come
together.   
   
As \[senior administration official\] briefly noted, across the U.S.
government, we’ve also seen enthusiasm on the whole from our Congress as
well.  And a lot of appreciation for the strategic benefit of this part
of AUKUS.   
   
And then, finally, on the submarine industrial base, as you all know,
the Biden administration made a substantial investment in that submarine
industrial base last year with, of course, the hardy support of
Congress.  You will see, as will be announced tomorrow, $4.6 billion
being advanced for production and for maintenance over the next five
years in our submarine industrial base.  And that would, of course, be
from the United States.   
   
I’d like to briefly turn to what Australia will do, because Australia
will also be contributing to our submarine industrial base, which is
another manifestation of just how serious and critical this effort is
that has been decided based on the principles of proportionality,
fairness, and transparency.  And I just want to underscore they will be
making a substantial contribution to the U.S. submarine industrial
base.   
   
With that, we look forward to your questions.   
   
Q    Hello.  I have two questions.  First, just want to double check on
the schedule that the new submarines will be built and delivered in the
late 2030s in United Kingdom and built and delivered to Australia in the
2040s.  Are those going to be actually built in those countries?  
   
And then, the other question I had was: Why move forward with Australia
buying the Virginia-class ones, as opposed to the original plan, which
was to make sure they built all of them themselves?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’ll take the first part of the second
question and let \[senior administration official\] do the first.   
   
So, just to be clear, when we started this process, we had no
preconceptions about where we would end up.  There was no clear
understanding about how we would devise or divine this program.  And it
is through working together — \[\[senior administration officials\] —
that we arrived at this integrated plan over 25 years that essentially
provides Australia with capacity, no gaps, and seeks to fulfill the
commitment that we laid out in September 2021.   
   
\[Senior administration official\]?   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  Chris, the buildout of the industrial base needed to
produce submarines in the UK and Australia will start soon and — because
it takes time to build out that industrial base and then to build
submarines.  
   
Yes, we expect that the first delivery of SSN AUKUS by the UK will be in
the late 2030s.  And because the Australians don’t have an existing
submarine industrial base, it will take them somewhat longer.  We expect
Australians will have first delivery in the early 2040s, and we expect
an ongoing trilateral cooperation on this submarine industrial base
effort.   
   
Q    And when you say “deliver,” that actually means produced in those
countries.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That’s right.  That’s right.  We expect
there to be components that each country provides.  But we’re talking
about the production and assembly of those submarines in the UK and in
Australia.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask, first, there’s some concern that the
U.S. doesn’t have the resources to be able to fulfill all the goals
you’ve just laid out, to fulfill the needs of the U.S. fleet as well as
your allies.   
   
And then what do you also say to the concerns raised about technological
sharing, that there are these restrictions on defense technology and
that it’s possibly slowing or could slow down this whole effort?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is \[senior administration
official\].  Let me, \[senior administration official\], take that
question.  The U.S. submarine industrial base is not where it should be
and the Department of Defense is putting forward significant additional
resources to lift the submarine industrial base.  They made an initial
request to Congress, which was approved last year.  And there’ll be
additional funds in this year’s budget.   
   
More will be needed and the Australians, will also contribute there. 
So, this is a generational opportunity to lift the submarine industrial
base for the U.S. and for the UK and to build one for Australia.   
   
On the tech-sharing front, we’re confident that we’ll be able to go
forward with this work on submarines with Australia and the UK,
including for one of the most sensitive technologies in the world — the
naval nuclear propulsion technology that we’ve shared with the UK since
1958.   
   
There are additional technologies that will be involved.  And the AUKUS
effort on advanced capabilities overall spans a wide range of those. 
And we are looking at what changes to our current export control
arrangements would be appropriate to ensure that we’re able to move at
the speed of relevance in our cooperation with the UK and Australia on
these areas.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is \[senior administration
official\].  I would just add that Russia’s aggressive war on Ukraine
has further underscored the need to invest in our defense industrial
base writ large and for our allies to do so as well.   
   
AUKUS is just a manifestation of the need to do so.  Moreover, on
technology sharing, of course, Australia is one of our very closest
allies.  They have stood next to us in no shortage of events, and we
feel very confident that they will take this unique capability in a
responsible fashion.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you all for taking our questions.  A quick clarification
and then a question.  On the Submarine Rotational Forces West, I was
just curious if that’s going to be U.S. and UK subs under the same
commander or if they would be operating separately just out of the same
base?  
   
And then my question is on the design effort to get to SSN AUKUS such
that production lines can get started for late 2030 deliveries.  Who
will be doing that design work and do you guys have any kind of timeline
as to when that’s going to start, when that would need to be matured —
that type of thing?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is \[senior administration
official\], Megan.  On the question of SRF West, U.S. and UK submarines
each will operate as sovereign assets of their respective countries
under the command of respectively American and British commanders.  We
do expect that there’ll be a significant degree of coordination in their
activities and this is a critical aspect of not just U.S. and UK
cooperation, but trilateral cooperation as we go forward.   
   
On the question of design, SSN AUKUS will leverage the design work that
the UK has been doing for a number of years on what they called SSNR,
which is going to be the replacement submarine after their
Astute-class.  The British are now going forward with SSN AUKUS rather
than SSNR, but the design work that they did will be useful and the
discussions about how to effectively integrate Virginia-class technology
into that have already begun and — with the result of the timeframe that
we talked about before for delivery at late 2030s for the UK, early
2040s for Australia of these submarines.   
   
Q    And just to clarify, are there any dates where the design would
have to be complete by X time so that the construction of the first boat
would begin a certain date? I mean, do you have that timing yet?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have estimates of that timing.  And
as the countries work together to develop this combined plan and take it
to the next stage, we’ll have more precise estimates in coming
months.   
   
Q    Okay, thank you.   
   
Q    Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask if there
is going to be another funding request to Congress and also how much
funding are you expecting from the Australians.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is \[senior administration
official\].  Look, as you know, we’ll be formally releasing the details
of the defense budget tomorrow.  And as I noted, you will see, I think,
a substantial request to continue investing in our submarine industrial
base.   
   
As you know, from our national defense strategy, our undersea
capabilities are a comparative advantage.  And I think both the
administration and Congress have really recognized the criticality of
making sure that we are continuing to invest in it.   
   
Regarding Australia’s contribution, I would just emphasize that it’s
going to be a substantial contribution.   
   
Q    Yes, thank you very much.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Just
to be blunt, is this program calibrated and these plans calibrated to
counter China’s exponentially growing military capabilities?  Thank
you.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Look, I’ll jump in here quickly and
then let \[senior administration official\] and \[senior administration
official\] jump in as well.   
   
So, look, each of our three countries have a clear determination to take
the necessary steps to maintain peace and stability going forward.  It’s
a mission that the United States and other allies and partners have
accepted for decades.  And we believe that it is increasingly being
challenged and under threat not only by developments in China, but other
countries like North Korea and Russia, which shares a Pacific engagement
as well.   
   
And so, for those countries that believe that this operating system in
the Indo-Pacific have been so essential to the peace and prosperity that
we’ve all enjoyed over the last 50 years, we believe that this is a
prudent and proper set of investments that will help to continue that
joint effort going into the future.  So, we think it is a responsible
step.  It is a joint step.  It’s been taken after much consultation, and
it is designed to address the increasing security challenges in the
Indo-Pacific.   
   
\[Senior administration official\]?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  I’ll just add what is perhaps obvious to everybody.  The
Australians acquiring and operating a conventionally armed
nuclear-powered submarine is a substantial upgrade to the capabilities
relative to their current diesel electric submarines.  And the purpose
of this, the fundamental purpose of this is to enhance deterrence in
support of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And relatedly — this is \[senior
administration official\] — I would just emphasize that we have seen
from this administration over the last few months some game-changing
defense posture initiatives with Japan and with Australia and most
recently with the Philippines that have really shown a number of allies
around the Indo-Pacific who are also enthusiastic about ensuring their
stability and security.   
   
Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  It’s a little similar to the
last one, just building that.  Just this week, Xi Jinping said in a
rather unusually public rhetoric — he talked about the all-around
“containment, encirclement, and suppression” of China.  Those are his
words.  How would you reassure him that substantially building up the
Australian Navy is not part of that containment and encirclement?  Or is
it? Thank you.    
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, look, I would simply point to you
that over the course of the last several years, we’ve seen a series of
steps from China.  We’ve seen stepped up activities and provocations in
the South China Sea and around Taiwan; more joint activities, naval air
exercises with Russia in the Pacific; challenges to India along its
border; wolf warrior diplomacy; economic warfare.  Remember, Australia
has been the subject of virtually undeclared economic and commercial
boycott now for almost five years.   
   
So, what we’ve seen is a series of provocative steps that China has
undertaken under the leadership of Xi Jinping over the last 5 to 10
years.   
   
And so, I would reject the idea that what allies and partners, all of
whom who have been committed to working constructively with China where
possible, are taking steps that are somehow designed to contain China. 
This is an attempt to defend and secure the operating system of the
Indo-Pacific.  I think it is responsible and clear.    
   
As you know, President Biden spoke directly at Bali when he met
President Xi.  The United States is determined to build a responsible,
stable relationship between the United States and China.  We will
continue to do that.  But we also believe that it will be necessary in
that process to build that dialogue on a strong, stable defense platform
and to do that with our allies and partners.   
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  That’s all the time we have.  Thanks everyone
for joining.   
   
As a reminder, today’s call is on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials,” and all the contents here are embargoed until
tomorrow, Monday, March 13th, at 1:00 pm San Diego time and 4:00 pm D.C.
