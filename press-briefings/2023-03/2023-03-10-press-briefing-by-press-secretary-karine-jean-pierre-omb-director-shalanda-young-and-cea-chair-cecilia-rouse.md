James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:46 P.M. EST    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, good afternoon, everybody.

Q    Good afternoon.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Happy Friday.

Q    Happy Friday.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We made it.   
   
Okay.  So, joining us today are two critical members of the President’s
economic team and Cabinet, CEA Chair Cecilia Rouse and OMB Director
Shalanda Young.  
   
They need no introduction and have joined us in the briefing room
before.  And so, I’m going to keep it short, but a couple things I do
want to say at the top about the two of them.  
   
Chair Rouse has led the Council of Advisers for two years as of Sunday. 
This is her third tour of duty at the White House, and she previously
served as dean of the Princeton School of Public and International
Affairs.  She is also the first Black Woman to be CEA Chair.  
   
Director Young has similarly led the Office of Management and Budget for
almost two years.  She previously served as the Clerk and Staff Director
for the House Appropriations Committee, and knows the Hill and
Appropriations as well as anyone — maybe better than most.  Shalanda is
the first Black woman to be OMB Director.  
   
You may be sensing a theme here.  (Laughter.)  Stick with me for a
second.   
   
But I do want to take a moment to note the historic nature of the moment
that you see in front of you right now.  All three of us are historic
firsts in our roles: the first Black women to serve as CEA Chair, OMB
Director, White House Press Secretary.  The first Black women, right in
front of you, for all of those three important, important key roles in
the administration.  
   
Now, that did not happen by accident.  It takes — it’s — it — it is
thanks to this President — President Biden’s leadership and commitment
to building an administration full of the best and the brightest.  And I
am so proud to be standing with two of the best and the brightest in
this administration.

So, with that, I will turn it over Director Young and also Chair Rouse.

DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Thank you.  How do you follow that?  (Laughter.)

Just to pile on just a little: I have to thank Cece Rouse.  This is
probably our last time getting to do this roadshow together.  And if
you’ve ever talked to Dr. Rouse, you know that she’s an economist
extraordinaire.  What — what you may not know is that, to many of us,
she is a colleague that will be hard to replace.  And I will miss our
working relationship. 

And I’m embarrassing her, because I did not tell her I would do this. 
(Laughter.)  But I think when you’ve been of service, you have — your
kids don’t see you a lot, it’s worth taking a minute just to say thank
you. 

And I know the President will have much more to say later.  But I, as a
colleague, just want to say thank you for your friendship.

And just in case you all didn’t see, the President rolled out his
budget, his third one on — (laughter) — yesterday.  And it’s built
around four key values.

First, giving families more breathing room.  What does that mean?  We’re
talking about lowering prescription drug costs, lowering healthcare
costs, lowering housing costs, lowering college costs, and lowering
childcare costs.  And if you have a child in daycare anywhere around
here, you will understand why families need that breathing room.

Second, the budget protects and strengthens Medicare and Social
Security, all while some congressional Republicans have threatened to
cut them.

The President has been crystal clear: These are more than programs; they
are promises to American seniors.  That’s why the budget extends the
life of Medicare trust fund by at least 25 years and rejects any effort
to cut Social Security benefits.  That is off the table, full stop.

Third, this budget invests in America: boosting American manufacturing,
making our communities safer, strengthening our national security,
cutting taxes for working families, and much more.  That’s the way you
grow an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

And fourth, this budget reduces the deficit.  Remember, this is not new
to this President.  He cut the deficit by $1.7 trillion his first two
years in office.  And the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the
deficit by hundreds of billions more.

This year’s budget will reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion dollars
over 10 years by asking the wealthy and big corporations to begin to pay
their fair share and by cutting wasteful spending on special interests. 
That includes by reforming our tax code to ensure no billionaire pays a
lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter in this country.  That’s
a clear contrast with congressional Republicans.

Look, they talk a lot about cutting deficits, but let’s get a few things
straight today.    Under the previous administration, they passed a $2
trillion unpaid-for tax cut that was skewed to the wealthy and big
corporations that absolutely exploded the deficit.  And over the past
few months, they pitched plans that would add an additional $3 trillion
to the deficit over 10 years.

Now, this morning, we get another proposal from the House Freedom
Caucus.  Let’s talk about what it says about what they value.

This is a plan that would have devastating consequences for our national
security, cut the legs out from the middle class, endanger community
safety, hurt our seniors, and cost manufacturing jobs.   
   
And here is the kicker: For all the talks of deficit reduction and
fiscal responsibility, this would reduce the deficit by zero dollars. 
Not a single penny.  Also tax cuts for the super wealthy can stay in
place.

So, the contrast here is pretty simple.  The President has laid out a
detailed budget that will lower costs for families, protect Medicare and
Social Security, and invest in America while reducing the deficit.  And
the very next day, congressional Republicans come out with a plan that
would sell the middle class out in order to protect tax breaks for
special interests and the super wealthy while doing absolutely nothing
to reduce the deficit.

That’s a debate we’re eager to have.

Thank you.

CHAIR ROUSE:  Thank you for having me here today.

So, I want to use my opportunity to talk about the President’s Fiscal
Year 2024 Budget that was released yesterday.  But I’ll spend a little
bit more time with the new jobs data that came in earlier this morning
and the look ahead.

So, first, I’ll start with the budget.  This budget builds on the solid
economic gains of the first two years of this administration. 

The challenges faced by the American economy during the last time —
these last two years have been extraordinary.  The dual human tragedies
of COVID-19 and Russia’s unprovoked war against Ukraine continue to
reverberate through every facet of our country.

Nevertheless, the U.S. economy has remained resilient.  The United
States ended 2022 with an economy that was 5 percent bigger in real
terms than it was just before the pandemic, the strongest three-year
performance of any G7 economy.

Further, this morning, we learned that the employment rose by —
employment rose by 311,000 jobs in Jan- — in February and that the labor
force participation rate among prime-aged Americans rose 0.4 percentage
points in January.  It has not been as high since 2008.

At the same time, we know that inflation remains too high.  However,
even there, we see signs of easing as annual inflation, as measured by
the CPI, has fallen for seven months in a row.  We’ll receive updated
data on that on Tuesday.

Taken together, these data are consistent with a robust recovery, one
that has put us on a solid position to conu- — continue on a path
forward towards sustainable growth that is more broadly shared.

So, the President’s 2024 budget builds on this growth in two very
important ways.

First, this budget is fiscally responsible, as Director Young just
outlined.

Second, the budget takes steps to further support our workforce and
invest in human capital, with policies such as paid leave and childcare
that both increase our economic capacity and help to make it easier for
workers to actually go to work and balance their responsibilities.

So, finally, a word about our budget forecast.   So, we finalized our
forecast last November.  Since then, data have become available,
including today.  And some of those data from — from 2022 and even
earlier have been revised for technical reasons.

So, with every new release and revision of technical data, we’ve learned
something new about the economy and have also revised our view of it. 
We’ve continued to learn a lot about just how convention- —
unconventional this recovery has been.

So, if I — I think that if — if you had told most conventional macro
economists last June that we were about to get seven straight months of
annual inflation reduction, they would have told us that the
unemployment rate would have to rise over that time.

Instead, we’ve seen that the unemployment rate in February was the same
as it was last June and the labor force participation rate is 0.3
percentage points higher.

I mention this to underscore that we’re in unprecedented times.  And if
we were producing our Troika forecast today, we’d incorporate new data
and information from the past few months.

As I’ve emphasized repeatedly, we’re confident we’ll get back to steady
and stable growth.  However, the road there will continue to be a bumpy
one.

But let me end where I began.  The strength of our recovery has put us
on solid ground to weather economic shocks, and the President’s 2024
budget presents a fiscally fair and responsible approach to continue the
progress we’ve made so far to invest in America and meet our future
challenges.   
   
Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  We’ll take a couple questions.

Go ahead, Mary.

Q    Just wondering if we can get your reaction to the failure of
Silicon Valley Bank and whether you’re concerned that other banks may
fail as well.

CHAIR ROUSE:  So — sure.  So, the most important thing that I will say
here is that our Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Yellen, is closely
tracking the developments with S- — the Silicon Valley Bank.

What I will emphasize as well is that our banking system is in — is in a
fundamentally different place than it was, you know, a decade ago, and
that the reforms that were put into place back then really provide the
kind of resilience that we’d like to see.

So, we have every faith in our regulators, and we can see that today. 
But Secretary Yellen is closely tracking.

Q    And one more on that same topic.  You know, the government
obviously insures up to $250,000.  But this bank served a lot of tech
companies that obviously had a lot more money in — stored with them. 
So, how concerned are you that we could see a ripple effect just
throughout this specific sector?

CHAIR ROUSE:  So, two things.  One, I’ll refer you to the FDIC for how
they plan — intend to handle — we know they’re insured up to 250- — and
how they’ll handle those with balances above that.

And the second, I just want to re-emphasize that we are in a
fundamentally different position that — you know, with the reforms of
the global financial crisis of 2007, 2008, we’ve put in place stress
tests and other tools that our regulators have to provide more
resilience to our banking system.

So, you know, Secretary Yellen is watching this closely.  Our regulators
— we have every faith that they will be as well.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.

Q    One for each of you, if you don’t mind.  (Laughter.)  
   
CHAIR ROUSE:  (Inaudible.)   
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Which one?  Which one, Phil?  
   
Q    Director Young, you’re not escaping me today.  We got approps to
talk about.

But, first, just to follow up on Mary’s question.  I think one thing
that’s different in the wake of 2008, despite everything that’s been put
into place in the wake of Dodd-Frank, is interest rate risk is at a
level right now that perhaps banks haven’t been dealing with for a very
long time.

Do you feel comfortable that the banking industry writ large is both
cognizant of the risk and prepared for it in a different way than maybe
SVB was?

CHAIR ROUSE:  So, what I would say is that our banking system has —
understands these kinds of heightened risks, and that I have full faith
and confidence in our regulators.

You know, Secretary Yellen has been in conversation with our regulators,
with the Federal Reserve, with the Office of the Comptroller so that
they can be monitoring the situation.  And they are very acutely aware
of these risks, more than we are, and we have full faith and confidence
that they — they will be tracking.  They have better tools than they had
in 2008, and the banking sector has more resilience.   
   
Q    And then, Director Young, you mentioned the House Freedom Caucus
proposal.  Look, I know you guys were able to reach a deal on approps in
December.  If this is a baseline that House Republicans, which now
control the chamber, are working off of, where do you see overlap here? 
And I’m not talking necessarily about debt ceiling.  I’m talking about
further-on fiscal negotiations that need to happen.  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  I think it’s a good question.  The first step is: This
is why we do budgets.  This is why we put it in black and white, so the
American people can look at what the President values, what Congress
values.  And we owe it to them to lay that out clearly.  That’s why this
President has been actually pretty strong about “show us your plan,” and
it’s not just a talking point.   
   
This is why we have a budget process, because it is important that
people see what you mean.  It’s easy to say “spending cuts.”  What does
that mean?  Well, at least some Republicans have told us what that
means.  
   
Before today, we heard defense was off the table.  This says defense is
on the table.  So I think they have to figure out if this is the plan
for all of them.  Is this a few members?  We don’t know.   
   
That’s why the House budget process — they have to come up with a plan. 
They have to show if this is a plan that the majority of their
conference can stand behind.   
   
Because right now, the plan we have in front of us by some of them would
cut critical programs when we talk about non-defense spending: education
— Department of Education; Title I, IDA — bipartisan programs;
transportation; housing vouchers.  Where are people supposed to live
with the housing supply crunch?  Our national defense, while we are
supporting Ukraine, while we’re supposed to be countering China.  Those
are real key, stark differences.   
   
And, Phil, I think we’re in the point of the program where we both have
to lay those out and make the case for the American people.  And that’s
what we’re doing.  And the rubber hits the road in the appropriations
process.   
   
And we’ll see if they can pass those bills that live by the outline that
the Freedom Caucus has put out today.  It’ll be interesting to see.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Steven.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Director, if you could explain the President’s thinking
and his commitment going forward to ensuring the continued solvency of
Social Security.  His budget yesterday does not advance any plan to
adjust the payroll tax for wealthier individuals.  You say in the
document that he’s interested in working with Congress.  Can you explain
whether that means that he hopes for a deal this year or in this
Congress?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  So, the deal is, this President will not accept benefit
cuts.  You talk to someone like my 94-and-a-half-year-old grandmother in
South Louisiana.  You call and tell her — because I’m not — that some
people in D.C., after she has spent about 40, 50 years working in this
country, that some people want to cut benefits that she has paid into
and earned her whole life.  What this budget says is this President is
not interested in that conversation.  And his budget says: not on his
watch.   
   
So, in contrast — I would say, in contrast, we have people who want to
cut it.  And we think the existential crisis for Social Security is
making sure that our American seniors know this President is going to
stand behind them.   
   
Q    But, if I can just follow up, I mean, the — the thinking is that
Social Security only has about 12 more years of solvency left.  This
seems like a good opportunity — isn’t it? — with a divided government,
for the President to make a proposal and hope for a compromise?  He
doesn’t seem to be interested in doing that.  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Well, you assume the debate is from cutting no benefits
and moving forward.  We’re trying to protect the benefits that are there
now.  I wish we were at the point of the debate where we could sit down
and come up with proposals to extend.   
   
Unfortunately, it is clear that some people want to go backwards.  We’re
saying: This President, which he has said over and over, will not accept
benefit cu- — benefit cuts in the Social Security program.   
   
So you’re assuming all players are starting from the same place. 
They’re not.   
   
So this President has been very clear.  His position is we will protect
Social Security.   
   
Q    But the President is not making a proposal here to extend the
solvency of Social Security.  He’s proposing not to accept any benefit
cuts.  But the Republican leaders say they’re not proposing benefit
cuts.   
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Who are you going to listen to?  You’re going to listen
to the Freedom Caucus who put out something different than what other
people have been saying?  
   
What we’ve said is — one thing — Monday, one thing is said; Tuesday,
another thing said.  We’ll know if that is an ironclad commitment.  We
hope it is.  But until we see a plan, excuse us for wanting to see it in
black and white, and see that it’s supported by the majority of the
conference.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nancy.  
   
Q    Thanks.  Just following up on that.  In the budget, you did spend a
lot of time talking about your proposals for Medicare, expressing
concern about Medicare solvency and claiming that the proposals that
you’re making will extend Medicare for another 25 years or so.  So why
no proposal for extending Social Security’s solvency, which is almost as
dire.   
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  So — well, one, thanks for bringing up Medicare. 
You’re right; we do have a proposal that would extend the life by at
least 25 years.  And we hope our friends on the Hill will take us up on
those proposals.   
   
And I’ve been very clear and the President has: We believe the greatest
existential threat to Social Security today is those who want to cut
it.  So, our position, his position is that is not on the table, not on
his watch.  And that’s what this budget says.   
   
Q    So will the President have a proposal in the future for extending
Social Security’s lifeline so that people like your grandmother will be
able to get their full benefits come 10, 15, 20 years from now?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  I hope she’s with us — (laughter) — that long.  I
really do.   
   
But what this President will do is make sure he is a backstop and will
stop attacks on the program for people who want to cut it.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Kristen.  
   
Q    I wanted to follow up on that.  But about Medicare, the proposal to
keep Medicare solvent includes increasing taxes, which is something that
Republicans have called a nonstarter.   
   
So, given that, where are the conversations happening about keeping
Medicare solvent, given that it is dire and expected to run out in a
matter of years as well — the trust funds?  
   
CHAIR ROUSE:  So, remember, the budget writ large — this is a start of a
conversation.  This is a —  
   
Q    Republicans say it’s dead on arrival, though.  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  So, budgets — this is — this is the President’s job. 
His job is — and Congress told all Presidents: Send us a budget.  Show
us what you would do, what you value.  This President has done that.   
   
Now, it was — it was his choice to put forward proposals that extended
Medicare, and he’ll work with anyone who wants to work with him to do
that.   
   
Look, the net income tax was always supposed to go to Medicare.  We’re
correcting something that should have happened a long time ago.   
   
Are we asking those making over $400,000 to pay more?  We are — to
extend.  And it has a dual benefit.  It not only extends the trust fund
life, it helps us reduce the deficit.   
   
So, we think it’s a good proposal, and we hope people take us up on
it.   
   
Q    I wanted to follow up with you on the debt limit.  The President
has been very clear he’s not going to negotiate over increasing the debt
limit.  Will there be a parallel negotiation, though, with
Republicans?   
   
In other words, would he agree to sign something that raises the debt
limit unilaterally and then simultaneously have negotiations about
potential cuts, which I understand you’re still waiting to see the
details of?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Yeah, I’ve really tried in 20 years not to deal in
hypotheticals in this town.  That is a good way to get oneself in
trouble.  And I’ve been in a lot of funding debates over the years; they
end differently every year.  But guess what?  They happen every year.   
   
So, I know there’s a lot more rhetoric around it with a new House
majority, but we just work together and beyond — and most critics
thought we could not find a path in a bipartisan basis in December, and
we did.  
   
Q    But is this a possibility, though?  I understand you don’t want to
lock yourself into a parallel — into a hypothetical.  But is it a
possibility that you would have parallel negotiations?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  I will say we talk — Democrats and Republicans — every
year.  That is the only way to get government spending bills done.  So
that happens every year, and we expect it to happen this year.   
   
Q    Can I ask you one more on SVB?  It is the 19th-largest bank in the
U.S.  It went down in about 40 hours.  What do you say to Americans who
have real concerns today about their hard-earned savings and money?  
   
CHAIR ROUSE:  Yeah, absolutely.  And this is why we have the FDIC and
other safeguards in place in our banking system.   And what I would say
to them is that our Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Yellen; the
bank regulators; those who will provide the guardrails and our
safeguarding are closely watching and are prepared to use the tools that
they need.  
   
The FDIC stepped in very quickly here.  And that’s what they were doing
is protecting the deposits of those up to $250,000.  And then they have
a way to unwind the rest.   
   
So, I will refer you to the FDIC.  I will refer you to Treasury that is
monitoring the developments in the system.   
   
But what I will say to it is our banking system is far more resilient
than it was in 2008.  We learned a lot.  We’ve got better tools
specifically so that we can protect that the important investments of
(inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ve got to take some from the back, and then we’ll
come back.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I have one for each of you.  Picking up on that,
you said you had full faith and confidence in our regulators. 
Regulators are those that work for the government.  Do you have the full
faith and confidence in the banking system writ large?  
   
CHAIR ROUSE:  Our banking system is fundamentally different because of
the changes that we put in place in 2008.  For example, they have to
hold more capital, they undergo stress tests.   
   
So we know that we had to build more resilience into our banking system,
which allows it to withstand these kinds of shocks.  So I do have faith
that we have the tools to — for this sector and for our regulators to be
able to absorb.   
   
But, you know, this is what we know today.  But we do know that our
banking system is in a fundamentally different place.  
   
Q    No worries about the contagion effect?  
   
CHAIR ROUSE:  Again, we put in guardrails, which — and our regulators
have much more visibility into the banking sector than they did a decade
ago.  
   
Q    And then, for Director Young: There have been a lot of talk in this
room over the last — this week and then last week as well, about Mexico
and how to deal with cartels, transnational trafficking, et cetera.   
   
There was additional money thrown into the budget — 800 million dollars’
worth — for ICE and CBP, more agents along the border, more money to
take on fentanyl, et cetera.  Is it enough — is this an acknowledgement
from the President that more needs to be done along the southern border
and more needs to be done taking on these cartels?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Look, the President has been clear.  He has asked the
Secretary of Homeland Security to let me know, let him know what is
needed.  And that’s why we’re putting forth a robust request in fiscal
year ‘24.   
   
But you’re right.  In December, the President told Congress, “I need
more than I originally asked of you months before.”  And Congress gave
us about half of what he asked for.   
   
So, we have to ask: If we’re all concerned about border security, are
you going to resource the men and women at the border to do their
job?   
   
So we did not get everything we asked for in December.  We’re going to
try again with this budget.  We’re asking for about $880 million more in
CBP. 

We’re asking for $4.7 billion in a contingency fund, acknowledging
migration patterns change.  So, we’re going to have triggers.  If
encounters hit a certain level, we’ll access more money.  We think
that’s the responsible way to fund this. 

So, we’re going to ask for the resources we need.  And we continue to
assess.  And we will let Congress know, like we did last year, if that
situation changes.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Ed.

Q    So, I’m going to ask about the other thing today, the jobs report,
if I could.  (Laughter.)  So, the average hourly wages in the jobs
report is up 4.6 percent.  The CPI inflation is 6.4 percent.  That — its
— inflation has been outpacing wages for about a year and a half.  When
can Americans expect that to reverse — relief from that?

CHAIR ROUSE:  So, we did see that on an annual basis — we saw some wage
— the nominal wages went up slower than what we expect.  We don’t have
the CPI report for this month, but based on what we had in January.  But
I will highlight that real wages in January were higher than they were
seven months ago. 

So we understand that inflation needs to come down.  It’s why it’s the
President’s highest priority.  We just got the Blue Chip forecast — it
was just released today from Blue Chip forecasters.  They were expecting
inflation to be easing to about 3.2 percent at the end of this year. 

We know that that is why it’s so important for the Federal Reserve to
have the independence.  It is why the President is focused on lowering
costs in his budget through the Inflation Reduction Act for Americans
when it comes to healthcare, when it comes to childcare, when it comes
to higher education.

But we are expecting to see this economy con- — you know, with the — the
labor market is robust.  We’re expecting to see inflation ease over the
year.  There may be bumps along the way, however.  We know that we can’t
focus on any one month, but that — that is what most forecasters are
expecting.

Q    And on jobs, real quick.  On jobs, manufacturing lost 4,000 jobs. 
With the focus on manufacturing here, what happened?

CHAIR ROUSE:  So, again, it — so, yes, but we had one month, and we
don’t like to focus on any one month.  And if we look at the
manufacturing growth overall, they’re higher today than they were almost
two years ago.  We’ve seen more manufacturing growth in the last two
years than we have in previous recovery cycles.  What — again, I want to
emphasize it’s really important not to over-focus on any one month of
data.   
   
But if we go back to the President’s policies, if we look at the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the — the CHIPS and Science Act, those
are — even the Inflation Reduction Act, in terms of the investments in
the green energy transition: All of those are going to bring the kind of
manufacturing jobs that we know are so important to both rebuilding the
infrastructure in this country, which we — which is very important for
building our economic growth, building our economic capacity, and will
offer those kind of manufacturing jobs, which are so important for a lot
of American workers, especially those without a college degree.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Phil.

Q    Thank you.  I have two questions for Director Young.  The first is:
For the Pentagon, the President is requesting $842 billion.  That’s a
3.2 increase — 3.2 percent increase from last year, but inflation is at
6 percent currently.  So, how is that not a cut in real terms?

DIRECTOR YOUNG:  So, remember, it matters what we spend the resources
on.  This defense budget was built on the National Defense Strategy.  As
you can imagine, we tend to get from Congress a lot of things that this
administration did not prioritize.

So, frankly, we had room in the base in which to prioritize to make sure
we we’re taking care of the highest priority items for our national
defense.  So, that is the basic answer. 

It is about: Look under the hood.  We believe we have the resources, as
I mentioned, to counter China in Defense and State Department and
USAID.  And it’s the right level for doing the right thing. 

We don’t say — I know people like to compare percentages from
non-defense and defense.  It’s about what the right level is to achieve
what we’re trying to achieve.  So we worked in lockstep with the
Department of Defense to make sure we were funding the top priorities
around the globe.  
Q    And then, you have said today and the President has also said on
numerous occasions, that cuts to Social Security are off the table.  I’m
wondering, though, for folks who are planning on retirement after 2035,
when the Congressional Research Service estimates that that program
could be approaching insolvency — you know, for folks who are expecting
to retire, you know, in the next decades ahead, is — what is the
President’s message to them?  Can they rely on this program?  Will it be
around for them after they pay into it?

DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Remember, it takes — it’s going to take bipartisanship
in order to deal with the longer-term issues here.  And right now,
unfortunately, the debate is centered around the current benefits in the
program. 

We have some — maybe it’s not the case, but we’ll see when their budget
comes out.  But we have some who have said they want to cut Social
Security.  That is why this President, in his budget, made very clear
that he is not going to allow that to happen on his watch.  And that’s
full stop. 

But absolutely, if people want to accept that as a reality and talk
about further proposals, we’re happy to engage in that.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Just a couple more.

Q    Can I go back to Silicon Valley Bank for a second?  There’s the CEO
— I believe Y Combinator — that has hundreds of its portfolio companies
tied to the bank.  And the CEO said that this is a, quote, “extinct-” —
“extinction-level event” for startups if regulators and lawmakers don’t
act quickly to give it some liquidity.  So, I’m wondering if the
administration believes right now whether that kind of intervention is
needed.

I don’t know if I’m supposed to say the word “bailout,” but — (laughs) —
but what is the — what is the White House thinking on that?  
CHAIR ROUSE:  What I would say is that Secretary Yellen is closely
tracking, she’s closely in touch with the Chair Powell, with the FDIC,
with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 

And so, they are assessing the situation.  They understand the
importance of the stability within our financial sector.  That is what
their job is.  And they have the tools that they need to ensure that we
maintain stability in the financial sector.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Francesca.  Just two more.

Q    The President proposed 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave as
part of his budget.  What percentage of wages does he intend to
replace?  And how does he plan to pay for the proposed program?  
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  So, thank you for that.  When we talk about the
President reducing the deficit by over $3 trillion, it assumes the
investments in paid leave, it assumes the investment in childcare. 

We believe that when we reform the tax code and ask the wealthiest in
this country and large corporations to pay what nurses and firefighters
pay in this country, that we can do things like paid leave.  So, those
programs are already baked in.   
   
So, our deficit projections — when we say $3 trillion, it assumes that
we have paid for a 12-week paid leave policy.  So, we think we can do
those investments fiscally responsible by ensuring that we have fairness
in the tax code.

Q    But given that, in the past, lawmakers have discussed this for a
very long time, they all — many Republicans and Democrats have said that
they believe in a paid leave program but what they can’t figure out is
how to pay for it.  Why not put forward a specific measure in this
plan?  
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Look, we are happy to talk about how to mix and match
tax proposals and spending proposals.  I think the important thing to
know is, in the budget, we’ve laid out several revenue sources, several
tax policies.  And, you know, absolutely, if — if some of the proposals
get mixed and matched with certain things, we’re open to that. 

I think the key thing to leave here with is: We’ve put a suite of
proposals forward that have enough revenue — more than enough — to do
paid leave and the other proposals that the President has put forward. 
Because this President, rather than talk about fiscal responsibility,
has actually put forward budgets that say we should pay for what we
spend — and, as matter of fact, we should pay for what we spend and
reduce the deficit at the same time.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jeff.

Q    Great, thanks.  First, for Dr. Rouse, with regard to the jobs
numbers today.  Are you concerned that rising interest rates is going to
torpedo the progress in the labor market and that there’s a disconnect
between how the Fed looks at this and how the White House looks at
this?  
CHAIR ROUSE:  So, what I would say is this —

Q    Please speak in the microphone.

CHAIR ROUSE:  Oh, sorry.  This jobs report — yeah, that does sound
different — (laughter) — this jobs report reflects that we have an
economy that remains resilient.   
   
And the President respects the independence of the Fed and understands
they have a dual mandate.  So, their dual mandate is both price
stability and maximum employment.  So, I have full faith that they are
focused on those two goals. 

What I will say is that the resilience that we see in this labor market
is — defies expectations of traditional macro economists.  And so, we
are — you know, it’s not foregone that we have to see, you know, a big
spike in unemployment in order to bring down inflation. 

As I mentioned before, I don’t think any macro economist would have
expected we would have seen the easing over the past seven months that
we’ve seen without seeing some give in the unemployment — in the labor
market.

So, you know, we fully expect that — we know there will be bumps along
the way.  But we fully expect that we will see a transition to an
economy that is more stable and where there’s more sustainable growth. 

And, you know, our forecast, the forecasts of private invest- — for- —
private forecasters suggest that inflation should come down meaningfully
over the course of this year and we’ll eventually get back to a more
stable situation.

Q    Do you think rates are too high?

CHAIR ROUSE:  So, what I would say is that we see an economy that is
quite resilient —

Q    That’s not answering the question.  (Laughter.)

CHAIR ROUSE:  — and we still see — but we also understand that inflation
is too high.   
   
So the Federal Reserve has to take the actions it needs to take.  And
so, we have the confidence that they will do that while also trying to
achieve that soft or soft-ish landing, which suggests that they will try
to maintain momentum in the labor market, in particular, but in the
economy while bringing inflation under control.   
   
Q    Just very briefly for Director Young.  You’ve been asked multiple
times about the future of Social Security, and most of your answers have
focused on Republicans wanting to cut benefits now.   
   
Keeping that context in mind, will the President make a proposal at some
time during his administration to help ensure that Social Security will
exist for people who are retiring, as was already asked, in 10 years?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  So, the President has supported proposals that would
extend Social Security.  He has not walked away from those proposals.   
   
I’ll remind everyone this is the fiscal year ‘24 budget.  It is one
year.  That does not mean that every policy that the President and then
candidate supports will be reflected in one budget year.  And he
absolutely has supported policies that would extend Social Security.   
   
Right now, unfortunately, we believe the — the thing he has to protect
against most is those who want to cut it.   
   
So, you’re right.  This is about a contrast.  And we’re starting from a
place of having to protect Social Security.  So that is what is
reflected here.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Peter.  
   
Q    Director Young, do you think there is any wasteful government
spending?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Peter, this is why we have $1.6 billion to go after
fraud, mostly in the unemployment insurance area.  You’ve probably heard
the White House talk about this proposal.  It ensures — you’ve heard the
President talk about making sure IGs stay on the beat; that is a
difference from the last administration, who fired some of our IGs. 
They go after wasteful spending and are very helpful pointing out to us
and Congress what wasteful spending is.   
   
That is why you see that proposal to make sure that we go after fraud
and waste in government programs and after crime syndicates who are
abusing programs that should be there for those Americans who need it.  
   
Q    So no — the criticism from Republicans in Congress is that this
budget just makes the government too big.  You don’t think so?  
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  We would not have a $1.6 billion proposal to go after
fraud and waste and crime syndicates if we didn’t think that there was
some reform and cops on the beat, like the IGs, needed.   
   
So, I did not say that.  I said we have a proposal in which to go after
it.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you so
much.   
   
DIRECTOR YOUNG:  Thank you.   
   
CHAIR ROUSE:  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  I have a couple things at the top, and then we
can go into questions.   
   
So, as you all know — and, I guess, you guys all saw — President Biden
is meeting with President Ursula von der Leyen of the European
Commission, which is happening currently as we’re standing here — as I’m
standing here and you all are standing — sitting there.   
   
Transatlantic economic issues — (laughter) — I tried to be a little bit
more smooth about that.  It was not smooth.   
   
Okay.  Transatlantic economies — economic issues will be the central
focus of the meeting, including our Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s
Green Deal Industrial Plan.  We also expect them to discuss our
continued partnership to support Ukraine and the Windsor Framework.  
   
Coming out of the meeting this afternoon, we hope to be able to begin
negotiations on a targeted critical minerals agreement and a dialogue on
subsidy transparency.   
   
We also hope to be able to jointly commit to a deadline for finalizing
negotiations on the Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and
Aluminum.  
   
We announced yesterday, as you all saw, that the President and the First
Lady are going to — are looking forward to and going to be headed to
Ottawa, Canada, on March 23rd to the 24th.  
   
And so, President Biden will reaffirm the United States’ commitment to
the U- — to the U.S.-Canada partnership and promote our shared security,
shared prosperity, and shared values.  
   
While there, President Biden will meet with Prime Minister Trudeau. 
They’ll discuss a wide range of topics, including defense cooperation,
strengthening our supply chain resilience, our efforts to combat climate
changes, as well as regional and global challenges like supporting
Ukraine, addressing irregular migration, and combatting the synthetic
opioid crisis.  
   
While there, President Biden will also address the Canadian
parliament.  
   
And as you all know, we will have more to share as we get closer to the
travel dates.  
   
One thing that I wanted to share or speak to this afternoon is basically
what we have seen this past — this past couple of weeks.  So I just want
to take a step back a moment and really call out the shameful, hateful,
and dangerous attacks that we have been seeing on the LGBTQI community
as we’ve seen this week, as I said, and also last week.  
   
Look, it started with a speaker at a conservative conference calling for
the eradication of transgender people, language that not a single
national Republican leader has condemned.   
   
In Iowa and Tennessee, Republicans are now calling for legislation to
attack gay marriage and protections for same-sex couples.  
   
In Florida — just Florida alone — Republicans introduced 20 bills — 20
bills — on a single day to roll back the rights of LGBTQ community.   
   
One of those bills would give the state the right to remove kids from
their parents just because that kid is transgender.  And just think
about that.  Just think about a kid who is sitting at home in this
community who is listening and hearing elected officials talking about
how they want to take away their rights or how they want to even
threaten their parents with felony charges for seeking healthcare for
their children.   
   
These kids are sitting at home having to listen to people, who are
supposed to protect them and their freedom, saying these horrific, ugly,
despicable things.   
   
So, so far this year, we have seen more than 450 anti-LGBTQ bills
introduced at the state level — you’ve heard me say that before —
amounting to a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills in our country’s
history.  
   
Guys, today is day 70.  It is day 70 of 2023.  
   
The same leaders that tout freedom apparently don’t extend their love
for freedom if they disagree with who you are, who you love, or how you
parent.  It’s government overreach at its worst, taking away rights from
the vulnerable, all to distract from a deeply unpopular agenda that
caters to the ultra-rich.  
   
As the President has made clear time and — time and time again — you
have heard him say this not just as President, but also as Vice
President, also as — as a senator throughout his career — he believes
that everyone in this country should live with the safety and dignity —
with the safety and dignity.  
   
There is no asterisk over the word “freedom” in this country.  We will
not hesitate to call out this behavior.  If I have to do this or we have
to do this or the President has to do this every week, we will.   
   
And I’ll just re- — I’ll just say what the President has said over and
over again when it comes to LGBTQ community, when it comes to vulnerable
comminutes across the country that are constantly being attacked: We
have their back.  The President has their back.  And that will
continue.  
   
So, now the week ahead.   
   
This evening, the President will travel to Wilmington, Delaware.  
   
On Sunday, the President will return to the White House.  
   
On Monday, the President will travel to San Diego, California, to meet
with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister
Sunak of the United Kingdom and discuss the Australia, United Kingdom,
United States Partnership, also known as AUKUS.  The President will also
participate in bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Sunak and also
with Prime Minister Albanese.  
   
On Tuesday, the President will travel to Monterey Park, California.  The
President will discuss his efforts to reduce gun violence.  Then the
President will travel to Las Veg- — Las Vegas.  
   
On Wednesday, the President will discuss his plan to lower prescription
drug costs.  In the evening, the President will return to the White
House from Las Vegas.  
   
We will have more to share on St. Patrick’s Day, one of the President’s
favorite holidays, in the days ahead.  (Laughter.)  As you all know, it
will be a lot to celebrate on March 17th.  
   
With that, Seung Min, do you want to kick us off?  
   
Q    I have two quick questions.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.  
   
Q    Will the President sign the legislation that would declassify
information about the origins of COVID?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I know that it was just passed — if I
remember — if I’m remembering correctly, it was just passed out of the
House today.  Right?  
   
Q    Correct.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’re taking a look at the bill.  We have continued
to share information, as I’ve mentioned many times before, with members
of Congress.   
   
And as you know, the first few months of the President’s administration,
he — he — when he came into office, he directed the intelligence
community to dec- — declassify information assessing COVID origins and
to make that report public to — to Americans people — to the American
people, because we know and he understands how important it is to get to
the bottom of COVID ornges \[sic\] — we will — origins.  
   
We will continue to use every tool to figure out what happened here,
while also protecting classified information.   
   
Again, we’re going to take a look at the bill.  I just don’t have
anything to share on how we’re going to move forward at this time.  
   
Q    But the Senate also passed it unanimously.  So why would President
Biden not — something that literally —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re —  
   
Q    — got no opposition in Congress?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I totally understand.  It is the right of the
President of the United States to look at the legislation that are —
that is going to be coming before him.  And we’ll have more to share.  
   
Q    And one quick question — clarification request on what he said
earlier today.  He was asked about Saudi Arabia and Iran reestablishing
diplomatic relations.  And he said, “The better the relations between
Israel and their Arab neighbors, the better for everybody.”  Can you
just clarify what he meant?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as it relates to Iran and Saudi Arabia, we
are — we are aware of the reports and would certainly refer you to the
Saudis as they are — clearly, came together with this plan.  And they
will give — provide more details.   
   
But generally speaking, to your question: Look, we welcome any efforts
to help end the war in Yemen and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East
region.  That is one of the reasons why the President — you saw him
travel in — over the summer to have those conversations.  
   
De-escalation and diplomacy, together with deterrence, are key pillars
of the policy that the President — that President Biden put out —
outlined during his — his visit in July in the region.   
   
So, again, de-escalation of tension in the Middle East clearly is a
priority, and he welcomes that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Still on the Saudi-Iran deal.  You and other
officials have often said that the JCPOA is just not a focus right now
for the administration.  Is this still the case in light of the
Chinese-brokered deal that renews ties between Saudi and Iran?   
   
And should China be able to expand the Saudi-Iran deal to bring Iran to
return to JCPOA, would the administration support that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So our opposition, as we have stated the last couple
of months, as it relates to JCPOA, has not changed.  It is not our focus
right now.  It is not on the agenda.   
   
And I’ll just leave it there.   
   
We’ve been pretty consistent on that.  And so that hasn’t changed.  
   
Q    Okay.  And a follow-up on Seung Min’s question.  Did the President
just misheard the question?  I — I’m still confused with your
explanation.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, there’s no confusion.  I just laid out how we
feel about — how we feel about the de-escalating tensions in the Middle
East.  We’ve been very clear about that.  The President laid out his
plan, as it — during his trip — the pillars of the policy during his
trip in July.  It’s just — that hasn’t changed.  And that still
stands.   
   
Go ahead, Kristen.  
   
Q    Karine, thanks.  I just want to emphasize: There’s high interest in
knowing if he will find a bill to declassify the origins.  So do you
think you’ll get an answer by the end of the day?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — we’re —  
   
Q    Is that something —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re going to look at the bill.  I can’t give a
timeline.  That’s something that — our team here has to take a look at
the bill that has been pres- — that has, as you know, has been — gone
through Congress, and just take a look at it and we’ll get back to you
all.   
   
I don’t have a timeline on that.  
   
Q    Okay.  I want to follow up on the comments you made at the top. 
And you highlighted Florida as one of the places in which LGBTQI rights
are under attack.  
   
Today, Ron DeSantis — Governor Ron DeSantis said that “Florida is where
woke goes to die.”  He also said of the COVID response, “We were right,
and they were wrong,” in reference to this administration in the past.  
   
One, can you respond to any of that?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, can — say — can you say the first one again? 
The first question.   
   
Q    So, can you respond to Governor Ron DeSantis, in Iowa today, who
said, “Florida is where woke goes to die.”

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, here’s what I have to say.  When Republicans —
extreme Republicans, these MAGA Republicans — don’t agree with an issue
or with policy, they don’t bring forth something that’s going to either
have a — a good-faith conversation.  They go to this conversation of
“woke.”  But that is not actually policy.

That — what they — what that turns into is hate.  What it turns into is
despi- — despicable policy.  And it’s just not the way we’re going to
move forward.   
   
This is not protecting freedoms.  This is not having a good-faith
conversation on how we can move the country forward.  This is about
attacking — talking about attacking young kids and their parents because
of how they view themselves, because of how they see themselves, because
of how they want to live.  Kids and their parents.

What does that have to do with anything about being woke?  That is just
hate.  And it is aw- — it is shameful.  It is shameful.  And we’re going
to call it out.

And like I said, the President is going to continue to say we have the
back of the — of that community or any vulnerable community.

Q    And do you have any response to him in saying, “We were right, and
they were wrong”?  Obviously, Florida, one of the states that lifted
COVID restrictions on the earlier side.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just remind you all — and you guys wrote
about this very early on in the administration: When this President
walked in to this administration, thousands of people were dying of
COVID.  The last administration did not put forward a comprehensive plan
on how we were going to deal with COVID, on how we were going to have
shots in arms.

This President, along with Democrats in Congress, passed the American
Rescue Plan, which actually helped turn the — the economy back on,
because the economy was tanking; grow the economy so that we didn’t
leave anybody behind; got people shots in arms; made sure that vaccines
were available for free to the American people, making sure that more
than 200 million people got vaccines — became fully vaccinated.

That’s what this President did.  This is how he moved forward to make
sure that we’re — we’re sitting — all of you guys are sitting here or
standing here, and we’re able to sit next to each other.  Most of us —
majority of us don’t have masks on.  Many of us are — we are able to —
who have kids, our kids are back at school.

When we came into this administration, schools were closed, small
businesses were shutting down. 

So, you know, we just talked about the budget — the President’s budget
plan, about his values — what he sees the value for the American
people.  This is what we’re talking about.  We’re talking about how
we’re going to deliver for the American people.

Q    And very quickly, Karine, on one more topic.  Democrats now are
joining the calls for President Biden to go to East Palestine.  He has
said he plans to go.  What are the plans for him to go?  Why hasn’t he
gone yet?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ve been asked this question multiple times, as
you know, Kristen.   
   
Look, the President, when — when the chemical spill happened on February
3rd, you saw the federal government act right away.  Within hours, you
saw the EPA on the ground, DOT was on the ground, and the President made
sure that we responded on the federal level so that the people of East
Palestine were made whole again.

I don’t have a — I don’t have a trip to announce at this time.  Again,
this has been a priority for the President.  He’s been updated very
regularly.  He’s spoken to the governors of Pennsylvania, the governor
of Ohio.  His team has been on the ground multiple times.  You’ve seen
the EPA dir- — director — Administrator go down to — go down to the — to
see the community, to see it for himself what has occurred.  That — he’s
been there about three times.   
   
And you’ve seen multiple agencies on the ground also making sure that we
make the community whole again, and also holding to account Norfolk
Suffolk \[sic\].

Q    Understood.  But now —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Southern, pardon me.

Q    — all of th- — now that all of that is in place, Democrats are
saying it’s time for him to get down there.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And he said, when he was asked the question, that he
will be there.

Q    Will it happen (inaudible)?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a timeline for you.  The President
answered this question directly when he was asked a couple of days, and
he said he’s looking forward to go down — going down.  Just don’t have a
timeline to share. 

Go ahead, Tam.

Q    Yeah, thank you.  Do you have any update on when a decision will be
announced on the Willow project?  And can you confirm that the President
was participating in conversations on the project this week?  How
actively involved has he been?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I think I confirmed — I don’t know, earlier this
week, that he had discussions with the delegations of Ala- — in Alaska. 
So, I did confirm that he has had those conversation. 

Look, as I said also on — on that day, that this process is led by the
Department of Interior.  They’re the ones who make the decision — the
Secretary of Interior — so I would point you, for any specifics or
timeline or details on that, to Interior.

Go ahead, Tyler.

Q    Hi.  I know that Chair Rouse said that Secretary Yellen is actively
engaged in the Silicon Valley Bank issue.  I’m wondering: Has the
President been briefed on this?  Has he talked to Secretary Yellen? 
What is his involvement today?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s a good question.  I haven’t had a chance to —
to speak to the President.  Just — as you know, this has been reoccur- —
occurring over the last couple of hours.

What I can say for sure — and certainly, I’m going to let the economist
who was in front of you all speak to this — let her words sit — but I’ll
just follow up and say Treasury is certainly tracking this rec- — recent
developments and remains in touch with regulators.

And so, for any specifics or details on that, certainly, I would refer
you to Department of Treasury.  Just — this has been developing over the
last couple of hours.  I just haven’t had a chance to speak to him about
it.

Q    And then one quick follow-up.  I know two of my colleagues asked
about this.  I think the reason that there’s confusion about the
President’s comments earlier today is because he was asked about a
relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and he brought up Israel. 
Obviously, Israel is a neighboring country, but it’s not a party to this
new arrangement.  Did the President just mishear the question?  Did you
have a chance to ask him?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have to be very honest: I didn’t hear the question
that was posed to him, and I didn’t hear how he answered it.  So I would
need to hear it for myself before I can give you an answer.

What I can say to you is what — more broadly, how we see the
relationship and how important it is to de- — deescalate in the — in the
region at this time and in the Middle East.   
   
And so that’s why the President — one of the reasons that — one of the
things that was on the President’s agenda was just that when he went in
July — he went to Israel, as you know; he went to Saudi Arabia, as you
know.  And it was important — it was an important trip to have.

I just have to go back and see exactly what he said.  I just want to
make sure I say it the ri- — I respond to you in the right way.

But what I can speak to is, more broadly, how he sees this
relationship.  
Q    And just one last quick one.  Obviously, on Monday, he’s going, as
you said to California, in connection with the AUKUS deal.  This was
something that particularly upset the French when it was announced
months ago.  I’m wondering if the President plans any outreach.  I know
he recently spoke with Macron —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I was going to say he rec- — rec- — yeah.

Q    — but ahead of this or after this event, if there’s anything he
might do there?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it’s a good question.  As you know, he spoke to
President Macron just last week.  I don’t have any — any future or
upcoming conversations to be had around this trip.

Q    Do you know if AUKUS was brought up on that call?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know we had a readout.  I just don’t — outside of
that, I don’t know if — I don’t have anything else to share.  
Okay.  Go ahead, Phil.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  One of my colleagues had a pretty extraordinary
interview with an Iranian — or a U.S. citizen that’s been held in Iran
now for several years, appealing to the President for his help in
securing his release.   
   
I’m wondering if the President is aware of that interview happening from
inside the Evin prison, and also if he’s willing to meet with the Namazi
family in the wake of the plea from Siamak Namazi.  
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I can say that we — look, we don’t have any
meetings to preview at this time or today, but I can confirm that senior
officials from both the White House and also the State Department meet
and consult regularly with the Namazi family, and we will continue to do
so until this unacceptable detention ends and Siamak is reunited with
his family.

That is certainly the President’s commitment and our commitment here.

Q    All right.  Thanks, Karine.  I think you got a —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Great.  Thanks, everybody.

Q    Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hopefully, I’ll see you guys on the trip.  If not,
next week.  
   
Q    Do you have an update on McConnell?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have an update (inaudible).  
   
Q    Have a great weekend.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You too.
