Aboard Air Force One  
En Route San Diego, California

2:24 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  I got a quick thing at the top, and then
I’ll hand it over to Jake.   
   
So, good afternoon, everyone.  As you all know, we’re headed to San
Diego, California, where the President will meet with — with Prime
Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Sunak of the
United Kingdom and discuss the Australia, United Kingdom, United States
— or AUKUS — partnership.  
   
National Security Advisor — as you’ll see, standing to my right — is
here to talk a little bit about the AUKUS announcement coming today and
take any of your questions.  
   
Before I turn it over to Jake: This morning, we announced that the Vice
President will travel to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia from March 25th to
April 2nd to strengthen our partnership throughout Africa and advance
shared efforts on security and economic prosperity.   
   
Building on our progress at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, which
President Biden hosted on — in December, the Vice President will expand
access to the digital economy, support climate adaptation, and
strengthen business ties.  She will also discuss our commitment to
democracy, economic growth, food security, and managing the efforts of
Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine, as well as engage with young leaders,
business representatives, and members of the African diaspora.   
   
Now I’ll turn it over to Jake Sullivan.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Thanks, Karine.  I know you guys have all participated in
various background briefings and other seminars and advanced graduate
courses on the ins and outs of AUKUS.  So, since you all have your
degrees in AUKUS, I’ll be brief.  
   
I’ll just say that we’re excited to be on our way to San Diego to meet
with Prime Minister Sunak and Prime Minister Albanese to formally
announce the — what we’re calling the optimal pathway, the pathway that
will make AUKUS a reality.   
   
When the leaders met virtually in September of 2021, they committed to
work out the details of the AUKUS submarine partnership within 18
months.  And that was September 15th of 2021; it’s now March 13th of
2023.  We’re two days ahead of schedule.  So, we will humbly accept all
of your congratulations and positive vibes for that.   
   
But — but, in all seriousness, the fact that we have done this in 18
months — this amount of ambition, this amount of detail — to have a
multi-phase approach to deliver on the promise of AUKUS reflects not
only an enormous amount of hard work, but leader-level engagement to
make this a priority and to ensure that the right level of resources,
attention, and commitment were there to deliver.  
   
What the leaders will lay out in a trilateral meeting today and then for
the public is a multi-phase process that begins over the next few years
and begins immediately with the training of Australian sailors,
engineers, technicians, and other personnel to be able to take on the
responsibility and stewardship of nuclear propulsion.   
   
And a few years down the line in the 2020s, you’ll start to see the
regular rotational deployment of U.S. and UK subs in Australia.   
   
And a few years after that, in the early 2030s, the delivery of three
Virginia-class subs from the United States to Australia over the course
of the 2030s, with the possibility of going up to five if that is
needed.   
   
And then, the final phase will be the not just design and development,
but the actual deployment of a new boat — a new conventionally armed
nuclear-powered submarine, the SSN-AUKUS, which will be built with a UK
hull and American technology, with significant investments in all three
industrial bases: the U.S. industrial base, the UK industrial base, and
the Australian industrial base.   
   
And I would reinforce that for that Virginia-class sale to Australia,
the Australians are not only paying for those boats, they are also
making a proportional contribution to the U.S. submarine industrial base
— to lift it so that we can accelerate the production and accelerate the
ongoing maintenance of Virginia-class submarines over the course of the
years ahead.   
   
Just taking a step back, what AUKUS represents is a larger long-term
investment by the United States in core alliances in the Indo-Pacific
and also the actual concrete reflection of President Biden’s strategy of
linking allies in the Atlantic with allies in the Pacific.  And it also
reflects his commitment to ensuring that there is burden-sharing among
our allies, as we’ve seen in the way that Europe has stepped up in the
war in Ukraine, as we’ve seen how Japan has stepped up with its defense
budget.   
   
Here, too, we’re seeing other partners step up and shoulder their share
of the burden not just financially and in terms of resources, but in
terms of actual capability to bring to bear to safeguard security and
stability.   
   
Final point I would make is: The United States has played a historic
role in the Indo-Pacific of helping safeguard security and stability to
the benefit of all countries in the me- — in the region.  And I mean all
countries.   
   
And the United States believes that working closely with its allies and
partners to ensure that we have the requisite capabilities for the next
50 years, as AUKUS will deliver, will help us continue to serve that
important stabilizing role to help continue to safeguard peace and
stability in this vital region of the world.  And you’ll hear that
message from the President directly today.  
   
The President will also have the opportunity to meet bilaterally with
each of Prime Minister Sunak and Prime Minister Albanese to cover a wide
range of issues, obviously beyond just the submarines.  And he’ll look
forward to the full agenda involved in — in those two sessions as
well.   
   
And, with that, I’d be happy to take your questions.   
   
Q    So, Jake, you didn’t mention China in your opening remarks here. 
What message does the further development of AUKUS send to China about
the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, about countering China’s
own growing capabilities in the region?  
   
And are there any concerns that this — about Australia’s, sort of,
commercial warming of ties with Beijing over the last several months? 
Is this — is the President going to raise that with Prime Minister
Albanese to, sort of, urge more caution in, sort of, restoring economic
ties between Australia and China?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  AUKUS represents, for Australia, not just a long-term
investment in nuclear-powered submarines, but a long-term investment in
its alliance with the United States of America.   
   
This is a decades-long — maybe a century-long commitment.  And it
reinforces the fundamental view, we believe, in Canberra that the United
States and Australia, standing shoulder to shoulder for the purposes of
safeguarding peace and stability — not to provoke, not to go try to
fight wars, but rather to deter conflict and to promote peace and
stability — that Australia is stepping up to make that bet.   
   
So, we have, in fact, the opposite of concerns about the orientation of
Australia right now.  We think today is going to be a reflection and
celebration of the deep investment our two countries are making in one
another for the long term.   
   
And oftentimes, when we talk about the long term, we talk about the next
several years.  In this case, we’re talking about the next several
decades.  
   
Then, with respect to the PRC: In my opening comments, I made the
fundamental point that President Biden is going make today, which is
that the United States has played a historic role over decades in the
Indo-Pacific to help ensure peace and stability, to ensure that there
would not be the repeat of major-power conflict that we saw in decades
past.  
   
That was not an inevitability.  That was not a foregone conclusion. 
That was the result of the United States helping to build and safeguard
an operating system that has worked to the benefit of all countries,
including ASEAN, the Pacific Islands and, yes, the PRC.   
   
And so, AUKUS represents a look forward coming off of that look
backward, meaning that continuing to invest in these kinds of
capabilities over the coming decades will help us continue to play that
role alongside key allies and partners that we have played for the last
several decades.   
   
That’s the message he’s going to communicate today.  It’s not directed
at any one country.  It is an affirmative message and agenda to all the
countries in the region and, frankly, to the wider world as well.  
   
Q    I have a follow-up on that, Jake.  I have a follow-up on that.  And
we’ve seen President Xi make more moves on the world stage.  He’s going
to Russia again, calling Zelenskyy, getting involved in Saudi Arabia and
Iran.  How are you guys interpreting his moves?  And also, how would you
define the U.S.-China relationship right now?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, when it comes to the report on President Xi
potentially calling President Zelenskyy, we have been encouraging
President Xi to reach out to President Zelenskyy because we believe that
the PRC and President Xi himself should hear directly the Ukrainian
perspective and not just the Russian perspective on this.  So, we have,
in fact, advocated to Beijing that that connection take place; we’ve
done so publicly, and we’ve done so privately to the PRC.  
   
We have spoken with our Ukrainian counterparts.  Today, I saw the news
accounts.  They have not yet actually gotten any confirmation that there
will be a telephone call or a video conference.  We hope there will be. 
That would be a good thing because it would potentially bring more
balance and perspective to the way that the PRC is approaching this. 
And we hope it would continue to dissuade them from choosing to provide
lethal assistance to Russia, which is obviously something that we have
warned about.  
   
With respect to the recent understanding that was reached between Iran
and Saudi Arabia and Beijing, as John Kirby said on Friday, this is
something that we think is a positive, insofar as it promotes a goal the
United States has been promoting in the region, which is de-escalation,
a reduction in tensions.  That’s a good thing.   
   
And we were in close touch with Saudi Arabia as they were approaching
and engaging in those talks.  And they were keeping us apprised of their
progress along the way.  So, from our perspective, even as we put a lot
of muscle into — diplomatic muscle into trying to help promote
de-escalation, as with the Yemen truce, having other countries like
China promote de-escalation is not fundamentally averse to U.S.
interests.  Frankly, it’s, in a way, rowing in the same direction.   
   
And we — we’re not in a position, of course, to be a mediator between
Saudi Arabia and Iran, given our relationship with those two countries. 
We never have been and we aren’t today in such a position.   
   
In terms of the U.S.-China relationship, I would just say that President
Biden laid out his vision for this following his meeting with President
Xi in Bali.  It’s a relationship where we believe there is competition
and we welcome that competition, but there is no need for conflict. 
There is no need for confrontation.  There is no need for a new Cold
War.  And we will look to work with China in areas where it’s in our
mutual interest and the wider world’s interest to do so.   
   
That fundamental set of premises and propositions that President Biden
laid out in Bali remain operative for us today.  And, you know, it’s
remains to be seen whether Beijing is prepared to continue down the
course that our two leaders said then, but we think that would be in
everyone’s best interest.  
   
Q    I mean, you talk about “competition not conflict” over and over
again, but there’s been a lot of rhetoric in both China and the U.S. in
recent months that — that, kind of, looks in the direction of conflict. 
There’s been a lot of different tension points in recent months.  And
I’m wondering, first of all: Are you concerned that this big new
military agreement announcement today possibly adds to that?  And
secondly, what is the administration doing at this point to get back to
the competition conversation?  And are you concerned about, especially
as it comes to U.S., the increased hawkish rhetoric about China?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Just in terms of the announcement today, we have been
transparent, predictable, clear, principled in how we’ve approached
AUKUS from the beginning.  This is not an announcement we’re springing
all of the sudden out of nowhere at this moment.  This is an
announcement that has been literally 18 months or 17 months and 29 days
in the making.   
   
And we have, in fact, consulted closely with allies and partners and
countries throughout the Indo-Pacific on it, and we have directly
engaged with China to explain to them what AUKUS is and what it is
not.   
   
So, we feel very comfortable with the way that we have approached the
AUKUS partnership, because we think it is actually a model for how a
country can be transparent and predictable in trying to contribute to
peace and security and to safeguard that peace and security in the
Indo-Pacific.   
   
In terms of the rhetoric, a lot of the rhetoric you’re referring to has
come from voices, of course, not within the U.S. administration.  That
is obviously a part of being in a democracy.   
   
President Biden sets the terms of this relationship, but he sets the
tone for this relationship for the U.S. government.  And you’ve heard
him speak directly to it in a clear and consistent and principled way,
and we’ll continue to do that.   
   
Q    When do you expect that President Biden will speak to President Xi
again?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we have said that when the National People’s Congress
comes to a close, as it now has, and Chinese leadership returns to
Beijing and then all of these new officials take their new seats —
because, of course, you now have a new set of figures in substantial
leadership positions — we would expect President Biden and President Xi
to have a conversation.   
   
So, at some point in the coming period — I can’t give you a date,
because there’s no date set — but President Biden has indicated his
willingness to have a telephone conversation with President Xi once
they’re back and in stride coming off of the National People’s
Congress.  
   
Q    Jake, is there a gap in communications with China related to
military affairs?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, we don’t have the kind of stable, steady,
predictable, uninterrupted military-to-military communications channels
that we think would be responsible and most effective for ensuring that
there is no miscalculation, no accident, no mistake, no possibility for
unintended escalation.  We would like to see that.   
   
But we do have plenty of channels to engage in senior levels with the
PRC to be able to ensure that we’re communicating each other’s
understanding, intentions, priorities, and that we’re reaching a decent
understanding with one another.   
   
Q    And just to clarify, you said you — the U.S. has spoken to China
recently about the AUKUS deal or was this way back in 2021 when it was
first announced?  I’m just trying to get a sense of it — if you all have
speak to them —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  We’ve spoken with them along the way.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The subject of AUKUS has been — has featured in
conversations between U.S. and China officials over the last 18 months. 
But we are specifically briefing them about this announcement so that
they understand the terms of this.  
   
Q    And do you feel like they understand — they don’t see it as an
escalatory action in — or —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I can’t speak to how they see it.  All I can speak
to is how we have approached the issue, how we have been transparent and
clear and straightforward —  
   
Q    Jake?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  — all along the way on the issue.  
   
Q    Sorry.  On President Xi’s visit to Moscow and what you just laid
out on the lethal aid, we haven’t heard much from the administration on
this since the Munich Security Conference.  Do you think calling them
out publicly then sort of sufficiently deterred them?  Or what’s the
status of what you’re seeing on that right now?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I can’t characterize that — what their intentions are,
what their decision-making process is.  All I can tell you is that we
have not yet seen the transfer of lethal assistance of the weapons from
China to Russia for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, but it’s
something that we’re vigilant about and continuing to watch
carefully.    
   
And as I personally said before, we think it would be a big mistake for
China to do that because Russia is using those weapons to kill civilians
and commit war crimes.  And China should want nothing to do with
that.    
   
Q    Are you worried that a Putin-Xi summit is raising that likelihood
of them actually making that decision?

MR. SULLIVAN:  It’s something that we will watch for.  Obviously, Russia
has its own interests in trying to pull other countries into this
conflict if it can, but our position is the same whether or not they
meet.   
   
It would not be in China’s interests, from our perspective, for them to
supply weapons to Russia for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, but
that’s a sovereign decision China will have to make for itself.  
   
Q    There were some reports out of Iran about a possible prisoner swap
between the U.S. and Iran.  The NSC has sort of shot down those reports,
but I wonder if you’d give us an overall assessment of where that may
stand at this point.  
   
MR. SULLIVCAN:  There’s no deal.   And the last thing that we want to do
is give false hope to families that have been waiting for a long time
for their loved ones to come home.  So, all we can do is be as
straightforward as possible.   And there is no deal at this time.    
   
We continue to engage the Iranians to try to get the unjustly detained
Americans home as soon as humanly possible, but I just can’t predict
when that will be.  
   
Q    Do you expect the global banking system to come up, particularly
with Prime Minister Sunak, in his one-on-ones today?

MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m not sure.  I presume that President Biden will share
with Prime Minister Sunak the steps that he has just taken.  Prime
Minister Sunak obviously is reading about them, probably watching them
on — on television.  But he’ll have the chance to share it in person,
and — and Prime Minister Sunak can share his perspective as well.    
   
But — but President Biden feels confident about the steps that he’s
taken.    
   
Q    One more on NATO.  You met with the Finnish President last week —
last — last week, yes.  What’s the path forward for their NATO
membership?  And do you — are you confident this can be secured by the
summit this summer?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I believe there is no reason it can’t be secured by the —
by the summit this summer for both Finland and for Sweden.  And we will
remain in close touch not just with the Finns and the Swedes, but with
the Turks.    
   
I will be meeting with my Turkish counterpart, the Turkish national
security advisor, tomorrow in Washington, and we’ll have the chance to
talk about this issue, as well as about 127 other issues that are, you
know, relevant to the U.S.-Turkey relationship.    
   
Q    Is he in Washington?  Jake, is he in Washington?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I don’t know if he’s there today, but I’m seeing him
there tomorrow.    
   
Q    Can we just get your reaction briefly to — the North Korean
submarine-launched ballistic missile tests, I guess, today — today, our
— their time; yesterday, our time.  Does it represent a new capability
and what are the level of U.S. concerns here?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  The North Koreans first tested a submarine-launched
missile capability in 2016.  They’ve been refining it.  They’ve been
trying different iterations of it.  Over the course of the past 24
hours, you’ve seen them announce the launch of two missiles out of a
submarine.   
   
We’re still studying it, making an assessment of what it means in terms
of their capabilities.  But, of course, we’re not going to let any steps
North Korea take deter us or constrain us from the actions that we feel
are necessary to safeguard stability on the Korean Peninsula.   
   
Q    The Saudi government is starting its own airline or starting an
airline, and they want to buy a bunch of Boeing jets.  Is that something
the U.S. government has been involved in?  Are you part of those
discussions?  And do you think it would be a good thing for the U.S.
economy if all — all those jets were purchased?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I think it would be a very good thing if the Saudi
airline purchased Boeing.  But I’ll leave it at that for now until they
make an announcement.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
Q    Can I ask — Kevin McCarthy is going to meet the Taiwanese President
in the U.S. instead of going to Taipei.  Do you think this is a good
idea and sort of prevents what we saw as a fallout when Speaker Pelosi —
then-Speaker Pelosi went to Taipei?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ve seen reports of this, but I haven’t seen anything
officially announced, so I will reserve comment.  
   
Q    He’s confirmed it off the record that he — he has those plans.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I — I will reserve comment until we hear from the
Taiwan government — or from the Taiwan authorities how they want to
proceed.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jake.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, Jake.   
   
All right, I just have one more thing at the top.  My ears are — my ears
need to pop.  Okay.    
   
Okay.  So, since we’re headed out to San Diego, I just wanted to say a
couple of things that — one of them is that we are — we are closely
monitoring the heavy rain and flooding in California, including the
breach of the Pajaro River Levee, as the state prepares for the impacts
of another atmospheric river over the next few days.  
   
The President issued an emergency declaration for the state of
California on Friday and spoke to — spoke with Governor Newsom as well
over the weekend.  
   
FEMA continues to coordinate with both California and Nevada as well to
address these — their needs.   
   
FEMA has deployed Incident Management Assistance Teams to the California
Emergency Operations Center and has established an incident support base
in California to prepare and stage supplies.   
   
The Army Corps of Engineers has also been delivering sandbags to
California, and Urban Search and Research — sorry, Urban Search and
Rescue teams remain on standby to support if needed.   
   
And we will continue to keep you all updated on these efforts.  Just
wanted to — since we’re headed out there, I wanted to give you all a
little bit of what we’ve been doing over the last couple of days.  
   
With that, Zeke, you want to kick us off?  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  On the banking intervention taking over — taken
yesterday on the part of the administration, does the — the President
today said he wanted stronger rules — strengthened rules on the banking
system.  What exactly is he proposing?   
   
And does the need for that action last night prove that the 2008, 2009
reforms failed in their efforts to prevent the emergence of new
too-big-to-fail banks, because these banks were deemed by the government
to be too big to fail?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say this: The President’s economic team right
now is focused.  And you heard from him directly on destabilizing the
financial — on stabilizing, pardon me, the financial system and
protecting depositors, including small businesses and workers while
avoiding costs to taxpayers.   
   
And so, the Fed also took temporary actions to provide the market with
certainty that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their
— all of their depositors.  And the Treasury Department remains in close
touch with regulators to work together on next steps.   
   
The President also said it is important for us to look into what —
exactly what happened, and so that’s something that clearly the
regulators and the State — the Treasury is going to continue to do.  
   
As far as 2008, look, the President’s — the President said the actions
that have been taken should — should give Americans confidence.  That’s
in- — incredibly important.  That’s — should be a message that was taken
from the President this morning.  And so, that is clearly important of
the banking system so that they know the banking system is safe and
their deposits will be there when they need — when they need them.   
   
Overall, the banking system is far more resilient and on better
foundation than before the financial crisis.  Again, this is not the
two- — this is not 2008.   
   
The Obama admin- — Obama-Biden administration put in place tough
requirements to — to ensure banks have more capital and sufficient
liquid assets, depositors have more protection for their deposits, and
regulators have the tools to supervise larger institution and deal with
disruption.   
   
So, the Fed has taken, again, temporary actions to assure banks have the
ability to meet the needs of all depositors.  And like the President
said, Congress and the banking regulators, like I said, should — should
strengthen the rules for — for banks to protect American jobs and small
businesses.   
   
And so, we’re going to — we also need to learn what else — just kind of
look into what else.  
   
Q    What are those rules —  
   
Q    Republicans are saying this is a bailout.  Is that — how —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, this is not a bailout.   
   
Q    — would you respond to that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, this is not 2008 at all.  The funds — the funds
are from fees on banks and not taxpayers.  So this is very different
than what we saw in 2008.  
   
Q    How do you prevent bankers at SVB from getting bonuses,
potentially?  And is that something that you’re looking into preventing
formally?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’ve seen those.  We’ve certainly have — we’re
looking into that, I can say.  And that’s something that — clearly,
we’ve seen the reports on that today.   
   
There’s a couple of things I want to add to that.  Give me one
second.   
   
And so, again, he said this morning — and I just repeated this a couple
of times: We need to figure out the full — the full accounting of what
happened and why so that those responsible can be held accountable.  So
that’s something that you heard from the President.  
   
And the management of these banks are already been — or will be fired. 
So that’s the second thing.  
   
And investors in the bank will not be protected and will take massive
losses.   
   
So — so, I don’t want to comment on enforcement.  That’s not something
that we’ll do from here.  And so, just going to leave it there.  But
clearly, that is something that we’re looking into.   
   
Q    And can you give a just general tick-tock of how all this went down
this weekend?  I mean, the President was in Delaware.  Did he get — was
he briefed?  Was there a sort of big decision meeting or anything like
that you can share?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I can you a little bit of a timeline there.   
   
So, look, the President was briefed regularly by his Chief of Staff Jeff
Zients and NEC Director Lael Brainard, starting Friday morning and over
the weekend into Sunday evening, leading — leading to his action to
speak to the American people this morning.   
   
He was updated by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, along with Zients and
Lael Brainard, on Sunday afternoon.   
   
As you know, the President — Biden has spoke, as I just mentioned at the
top, with Governor Newsom on Saturday about efforts to address the
situation.  So he had that conversation on Saturday.   
   
And the President stayed in regular contact with other senior staff
throughout the weekend, as is the case every day.  And he’s continue —
continuing paying close attention to what’s occurring today after he
made his announcement today.   
   
Q    So given —  
   
Q    So the government —  
   
Q    — given the massive bill, how do you reassure taxpayers they aren’t
going to be on the hook for this money?  And how do you keep the
Americans’ confidence in the banking system?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, first of all, the President speaking to this this
morning, I think, is incredibly important, hearing from the President on
this issue.   
   
The FDIC is using the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is funded by fees
not — not on banks, not taxpayers.  The DIF — the Deposit Insurance Fund
— is more than enough to cover any Silicon Valley Bank and Signature
Bank deposits that cannot be paid using funds from the banks or the sale
of their assets.   
   
This means no matter what amount of DIF funding is needed to cover SVB
and Signature deposits, it will not come from the taxpayer dollars.  And
so, that is something that we are — we are making sure that the — the
American people understand — again, giving them that confidence that
this is not 2008.  This is very different.  
   
Q    But on that — on that decision, with these two banks, the President
has made an announcement that all deposits in the banks are going to be
guaranteed and backed by the federal government.  Is that setting a
precedent going forward that that will be the guarantee if any other
bank fails?  Or at a certain point, does it go back to the $250,000 FDIC
level?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, two things.  On the — on the precedent, look, I’m
not going to — I’m not going to comment on other institutions.  We’re
just focusing on what we have.  Today, our focus is, again, stabilizing
the financial systems, protecting depositors, including small businesses
and workers.  Treasury and the bank regulators continue to monitor the
broader system.  
   
And I know you’re asking about the cap — that 250K cap.  So, just a
couple of things there.  You know, this weekend’s actions were about,
again, stabilizing the situation that we’re currently seeing with these
two banks.  We — there were multiple announcements yesterday, including
a temporary, <s>non</s> \[new\] Fed program, which will help ensure
banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their dep- —
depositors.  And that will help prevent banks from getting a — from
getting into this situation.  
   
So, that’s how we’re seeing that piece as well.  
   
Q    But so, how do you then justify — if you’re insuring for Silicon
Valley Bank, how do you justify if a Midwestern bank fails, then not
doing the same for, you know, people who might have less money
invested?  
   
And then, also, how concerned are you guys that this will spread beyond
just this one bank?  With all the tech layoffs and all that, the tech
sector is being hit really hard, is there concern this is going to
spread broader than that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, overall, you know, again, we’re trying —
right now, the actions that we’re take — we’re taking is to stabilize
the financial system and protecting the depositors, including small
businesses and workers.  So that’s what you’re seeing — that’s what
you’re seeing from the actions today.   
   
But overall, the banking system is far more resilient and on a better
foundation than before the financial crisis, and I think that’s
important to remember.  This is not 2008.  And so, that’s why the
President took these actions.   
   
Again, this is not going to be on the taxpayers.  This is the — this is
going to be part of the — the insurance funds that the banks pay into. 
So, just want to make sure that we’re keeping that clear.   
   
And so, the President, again, spoke to the American people to continue
to give that confidence.  
   
Q    Can I ask a non-bank question?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.   
   
Q    The event — the gun reform event tomorrow.  Could you talk a little
bit about that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, I have something for you here.  So — so we’ll
have more to share a little bit later today.  
   
The President will speak about his continued efforts to reduce gun
violence devastating American communities like Monterey Park, where, as
you all know, 11 people were killed and 9 others injured in January.  
   
And, you know, too many lives are — have been — have been taken by gun
violence.  There are too many empty chairs at the kitchen table that we
have see- — that we — you all reported over and over again.   
   
The President, as you know, has taken some actions — executive actions
to deal with this issue — to deal with gun violence in America,
including the historic piece of legislation that he signed that is on —
on gun violence.  Something that we hadn’t seen — the first one in a
generation — in 30 years.   
   
But he believes we need to do more.  So, you’ll hear him talk about
that.  You’ll hear him call — talk — call on Congress to take action and
not to stop where he stopped, that we need to continue.  
   
But again, the President took executive — really, some historic
executive actions in his first two years of the administration, and it
is now far along — it’s taken too long for Congress to take — to take
action on — on commonsense gun law reforms, including requiring
background checks on all gun sales, banning — banning assault weapons
and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun
manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on the streets.   
   
And so, we owe this to the lives that have been lost, the families who
have lost their loved ones.  Again, sitting around the kitchen table and
missing that — missing their loved one who was — who taken by gun
violence.  
   
Q    You mentioned the flooding at the beginning.  Is there any
consideration or conversation about adapting this trip, since the
President is out in California, to address it?  Or is — or is it too
soon to think about that?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, there is no change to his trip.  As I mentioned,
he’s spoken to Gavin Newsom, the governor — I believe, on Friday — as I
mentioned at the top.  And we are ready.  The federal government is al-
— already assisting the state of California, and we’re ready to do
anything else that might be needed of us.  So —  
   
Q    Do any senior administration officials have exposure in the SVB
Bank — SVB — like, debacle?  Do they have large deposits in the bank
that you’re aware of?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That — that’s — I’m not aware of that.   
   
Anything else?  
   
Q    Do you have any update on if and when the President will sign the
COVID intel bill?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have anything — don’t have anything to share on
the schedule on when he’s going to be signing that.  
   
Q    And the ESG veto — any sense of when that’s coming?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have anything on that just yet.  No timeline on
when the President is going to sign — going to —  
   
Q    And on SVB —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — going to sign that.  
   
Q    — can you say if the President reached out to any outside experts
or Barney Frank or others over the weekend to talk about all this?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, when I spoke to him earlier today, he did said
that — he did say that he spoke to economists.  He clearly spoke to his
senior staff, stayed in touch with the Treasury Secretary and his NEC
director.   
   
So, he was fully engaged in this over the weekend and really is going to
continue to stay very zeroed in and focused on this.   
   
He understands how important this is for the American people, but he did
have outside conversations with economists.  That’s something that he
shared he wanted all of you to know as well.   
   
Q    Can you share the economists that he spoke with?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I didn’t — I don’t have names to share.  
   
But — but, again, this is — the reason I’m sharing this is he wanted — I
want you to know that he was fully engaged this weekend, since Friday
morning, very much in touch with his senior staff, many — well, very
much in touch with the Treasury Secretary and — and also just making
sure that, again, taxpayers are not fitting the bill for this, that we
came up with a plan to make sure that — you know, that these banks are
held accountable.   
   
And, look, we have to — we have to look into exactly what happened.  But
in the meantime, the — the banks are going to be held accountable.   
   
There’s funds that have been put into place because of 2008, because
what — of what the Biden — Biden — Obama-Biden administration was able
to do.  This is — again, this is not 2008, because of the actions that
that administration took.  And so, we’re just going to move forward with
that.  
   
Q    And just to circle back on Zeke’s first question, can you point to
any specific new regulations that — that the President would be looking
at?  Or is he looking at specifically walking back the rollback of
Dodd-Frank that we saw?  Or just any specifics you could offer would be
helpful or a timeline for when we might know more specifics.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, as I was stating earlier, after the
2008 financial crisis, the Obama-Biden administration put into place
tough requirements on banks to make sure that the crisis would not
happen again.   
   
But, unfortunately, as you all know, in <s>2008</s> \[2018\], the last
administration rolled back some of those tough requirements.  And so, as
you saw this morning and you heard from the President, he called on both
Congress and bank regulators to strengthen the rules to make it less
likely that this kind of bank failure can happen again, to protect
American jobs, small businesses.   
   
So, we’re going to actively have those conversations, work on this, and
have conversations with experts and regulators.   
   
We need to review what happened exactly to further determine what the
changes are needed to make it less likely to happen again.  But we have
to get a — we have to get an accounting of exactly what happened so we
can know how to move forward.   
   
Q    And how long do you think it will take to review it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a timeline on this.  Just know that the
President and his team is — is — this is a priority for them.  And we’re
certainly going to continue to look into what exactly happened and how
do we — how do we respond and work with Congress on this as well.  
   
Q    There’s a couple of fundraisers on this trip.  What should we read
into —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  A couple of what?  
   
Q    Fundraisers on the trip.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh.  
   
Q    What should we read into that about —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the — to the DNC on any
fundraisers that the President will be doing on this trip.  
   
Q    And then, why is Natalie Biden on the trip?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Natalie Biden is on — as you know, the President’s
family tends to travel with him — right? — pretty often.  So that’s not
uncommon.   
   
Natalie is on spring break.  And so, she joined her — she wanted to
spend time with her Pop.  So, she joined her Pop on this trip.   
   
Q    Karine, on that question: When members of the President’s family
travel with him when he’s on official business and they don’t
necessarily have a role, does the President or members of his family
reimburse the federal government for their travel expenses?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, that’s — that’s a good question.  I would have to
look into how it works for members of the President’s family.  I
actually don’t know.  But I would look into that and get back to you.  I
actually don’t know how that works.  You might know better than I.  I
would have to look into that.  
   
Anything else?   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Okay.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks.
