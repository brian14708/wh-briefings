James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:13 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hey.  Good afternoon, everyone.   
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Happy Tuesday.  
   
So, my colleague, Admiral John Kirby, is here today to answer any
questions on — about the President — President Putin and President Xi
meeting in Moscow today.  And so — and any other questions that you may
all have on foreign policy, he’ll be happy to take them.  
   
Kirby, the podium is yours.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thank you so much.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No problem.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Good afternoon, everybody.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I know there’s — I know there’s been a lot of interest
around the meeting between President Xi and President Putin in Moscow
today, so we’ll get at that.  I just wanted to stop by and be available
to you for that.  
   
Before I do, I do want to quickly speak to the joint statement between
the PRC and Russia that they put out today on deepening their
cooperation, including on Ukraine.  
   
On Ukraine, I would note that the two sides just said, quote, “The
purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter must be observed, and
international law must be respected.”  Well, we agree.  
   
Following the U.N. Charter would mean that Russia should withdraw from
all the territory inside Ukraine, the territory of another member state
of the U.N. — a member that it has invaded.  
   
The U.N. Charter enshrines the principles of respect for the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine.  
   
And they also said, quote, parties — “The parties call for the cessation
of all steps that contribute to escalation of tension and the
prolongation of hostilities.”  We agree.  One way to stop the
hostilities is to pull Russian troops out of Ukraine.   
   
But short of that, Mr. Putin could stop bombing hospitals, could stop
bombing schools.  He could stop launching Iranian drones into civilian
infrastructure.  He could stop the forcible deportation of young kids —
thousands of them — putting them in filtration camps inside other places
inside Ukraine but also inside Russia.  He could stop reducing cities
like Bakhmut to bricks — to piles of bricks.  That is a way to stop the
prolongation of hostilities.  
   
So, now, if China wants to play a constructive role here in this
conflict, then they ought to press Russia to pull its troops out of
Ukraine and Ukrainian sovereign territory.  They should urge President
Putin to cease bombing cities, hospitals, and schools; to stop the war
crimes and the atrocities; and end the war today.  It could happen right
now.  
   
Now, with that, I’ll take some questions.  
   
Q    The statement also says, “The Russian side speaks  
positively of China’s objective and impartial position on the Ukraine
issue.”  Do you see China as having an impartial position on this?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  No.  We don’t.  
   
Q    How do you interpret the statement then?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, certainly I’m not going to do a book review on their
statement.  They can do that.  They can speak to their words.  
   
But I don’t think you can reasonably look at China as impartial in any
way.  They haven’t condemned this in — this invasion.  They haven’t
stopped buying Russian oil and Russian energy.  
   
President Xi saw fit to fly all the way to Moscow, hasn’t talked once
the President Zelenskyy, hasn’t visited Ukraine, hasn’t bothered to
avail himself of the Ukrainian objective.  And he and his regime keeps
parroting the Russian propaganda that this is somehow a war of the West
on Russia, that it’s some sort of existential threat to Mr. Putin. 
That’s just a bunch of malarkey.  Ukraine posed no threat to anybody,
let alone Russia.  
   
So, no, it can’t be seen that Russia is impartial.  
   
Now, look, if — if he’s willing to talk to President Zelenskyy and
willing to get the other side and — and we — you know, if any future
potential negotiation can incorporate Ukrainian views and perspectives
and can be achieved and pursued with Ukraine — as President Biden said,
“Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” — if that’s the direction, then
that’s something that could be seen as impartial.  But I just don’t
think right now that they can be seen that way.  
   
Q    And lastly, are we watching a budding alliance between China and
Russia here?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think you’ve seen over years now these two countries going
— growing closer together.  Peter asked a question similar to that
yesterday.  
   
I wouldn’t go so far to call it an alliance.  Yesterday I called it a
“marriage of convenience,” because that’s what I think it is.  
   
In President Putin and Russia, President Xi sees  
a counterweight to American influence and NATO influence certainly on
the continent and elsewhere around the world.   
   
In President Xi, President Putin sees a potential backer here.  This is
a man who doesn’t have a whole lot of friends on the international
stage; they can count them on one hand mostly.  And he really needs and
wants President Xi’s support for what he’s trying to do, because he’s
running through — he’s blowing through inventory.  He’s blowing through
manpower.  His military is getting embarrassed constantly.  They’ve lost
greater than 50 percent of the territory that they took in the first few
months of this war.  He needs help from President Xi, and that’s what
this visit was all about.  
   
Now, whether it results in anything, we’ll see.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, MJ.  
   
Q    John, two questions for you.  Is the U.S. aware if there has now
been an official request from Putin to Xi for lethal aid to be used in
Ukraine?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I can only go by what we’ve seen them say today, which
obviously was not part of their — at least part of the readout and part
of the statements they put out today.  
   
I will tell you what I said yesterday and remains true: We don’t think
that China is taking it off the table, but they haven’t moved in that
direction.  We’ve seen no indication that they’re about to or — or
fixing to provide lethal weapons.  
   
Q    Okay.  And my second question: The President considers Vladimir
Putin to be a war criminal.  I’m just wondering what it means to
President Biden that Putin calls Xi Jinping a friend.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I don’t think we’re overly exercised about  
that comment.  I mean, these are — it wasn’t that long ago, MJ, where
they were talking about a relationship without limits — right? —
partnership without limits.  So, we’re not going to get all hot and
bothered about the use of “friends.”   
   
What we’ve seen is these are two countries that are growing closer
together, that see in each other useful purposes for pushing back, as I
said yesterday, for chafing and bristling at a rules-based order around
the world.  They want to change the rules of that game.  In fact, they
would love nothing better — both countries — to see the rest of the
world play by their rules rather than the ones that — that are enshrined
in the U.N. Charter and what everybody else is — is following.   
   
So that’s what’s going on here.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Just — John, to clarify one thing, because this is what Steve asked
you — it is regarding the statement.  “The Russian side speaks
positively of China’s objective and impartial position on the Ukraine
issue.”  Is the view of this government that China is no longer
impartial or is not impartial when it comes to this matter?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We never said — we never said China was an impartial
participant here.  
   
Q    Does that — and does this statement — does this meeting improve or
make it more difficult for President Biden to ever meet again with
President Xi, at least anytime soon —   
   
MR. KIRBY:  President Biden —  
   
Q    — to discuss this and other issues?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The President wants to keep the lines of communication open
with China.  Nothing has changed about that.  And as I said yesterday,
at the appropriate time we’ll pursue another conversation with President
Xi.  
   
Q    And in a semi-related matter, the president of Taiwan has now
announced their plans to come to the United States briefly and then head
to Central America.  Are there any plans for any U.S. officials to meet
with the president of Taiwan when they’re in the United States?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  This is — as you know, these are called “transits.”  Not
uncommon.  President Tsai has done it six times.  Every single Taiwan
president in recent memory has done this.  It is unofficial and personal
in nature in terms of travel.  So we would let them speak to their
agenda to — to who they want to meet with and — and on what timeline.   
   
It is not uncommon for — in previous transits for there to be
discussions with — with U.S. officials and with members of Congress. 
But again, I’m not going to get ahead.  This is really for Taiwan to
speak to.  
   
Q    So, maybe?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  This is for Taiwan to speak to.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, John.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you, Admiral.  On the idea of Russia
seeking weapons and munitions, can you give us an assessment right now
as to where things stand in terms of their weapons stockpile — Russia’s
weapons stockpile?  And what sort of help are they getting at this
moment from places like Iran and North Korea?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, we know that they have a burgeoning defense
relationship with Iran.  We already know that they — Iran has provided
several hundred drones.  And we have every reason to suspect that that
sort of transaction will continue.   
   
I don’t have any specific shipments to speak to today.  But we know that
this relationship from a defense perspective, of those two countries, is
— is getting sharper.  I came to the podium and talked about that.  And
that’s a worry not just for the people of Ukraine.  It’s a worry for the
people of the Middle East and Iran that can avail itself of Russian
military capabilities, would make it more lethal and more dangerous in
the region.  
   
We did talk about the — the fact that we had evidence that North Korea
was shipping, at the very least, artillery shells to the Wagner Group. 
We still believe that — that that occurred.  I don’t have any additional
shipments of things to speak to.   
   
But again, I think it speaks volumes to your question about inventory. 
And I — I couldn’t give you a rundown of Russian inventory on any given
type of system, but they have gone through thousands of missiles and,
most likely, millions of artillery shells.  They have lost, easily, tens
of thousands of troops and probably north of 100,000 in terms of killed
and wounded.  
   
So this has not been a fight that Mr. Putin has had without cost to his
country and to his coffers.  And so, he continually wants to reach out
for more help internationally.  That’s what we’re seeing with Iran. 
It’s what we saw with North Korea.  And there’s no question that’s what
— that’s what we’re seeing in his interest in talking to President
Xi.   
   
But we know that this — we know this war has had an effect on his
inventory.  And we also know, Jonathan, that the sanctions and export
controls have had an effect on him, particularly when it comes to cruise
missiles — that his ability to restock cruise missiles out of the
inventory has been curtailed by the fact that he can’t get the — some of
the microelectronics because of the — the economic steps that this
administration has taken to — to kind of curb his war-making machine.   
   
So, this — this is a guy — you know, for all the ballyhoo going to
Mariupol, I mean, this is a guy who — who has to know that his military
is way underperforming and — and overspending in terms of its ability —
its resource ability.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Justin, and then I’ll go to the back.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I wanted to follow on Ed’s last question.  You guys have
obviously made this concerted effort to, ahead of the visit of the
Taiwanese president, sort of downplay it as not uncommon, not intended
as sort of a provocation.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not downplaying.  It’s true.  It’s not uncommon.  They —
they have happened before.  It’s not about downplaying.  It’s about
being factual.   
   
Q    All right.  Well, there has been this sort of concerted effort, and
I’m — my question is that if — does that not sort of tacitly acknowledge
concern within the administration that China may overreact or — I assume
you think this is an overreaction to this visit.  And I was wondering if
you can play out, to some extent, what that level of concern is and how
the U.S. would react if we see, you know, a “Pelosi redux” and — and how
to interpret this.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  There’s no reason for China to overreact.  Heck, there’s no
reason for them to react.  I mean, this is something that — that, as I
said, is commonplace and has happened before, will likely happen again. 
It’s personal.  It’s unofficial.  There should be no reason for Beijing
to — to react in any way to this.  Again, business as usual here.  And
we did think it was important to provide that context in light of Mr.
Xi’s visit to — to Moscow and all the media attention that that is
getting, as well as in the context of — of how they reacted to Speaker
Pelosi is no apologies there at all.   
   
We felt that that — this was important context to be out there.  And so,
we — we put it out there.   
   
Q    But is it because you are concerned about the Chinese reaction?   
   
I — it’s one thing to say, “Yeah, we hope they don’t react in any way.” 
It’s another to be like, “They really shouldn’t react.”  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We just felt it was important to put it in proper context.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks a lot, Karine.  Right over here, John.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    Yeah.  It’s a big room.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I have to keep up with her fingers (inaudible).  
   
Q    The — the war in Ukraine has been going on for over a year now.  Is
it the U.S. position that during the course of all of that time, that
China has not provided any lethal weaponry to Russia?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We have seen that, through some Chinese companies, there —
there may have been dual-use items that have gone, but we haven’t seen
any confirmation or indication that the Chinese have provided lethal
weapons, lethal capabilities to the Russian Ministry of Defense
throughout this conflict.  They have not done that.   
   
And obviously, as I said yesterday, we don’t think it’s in their best
interest to do that.  And quite frankly, it would be inconsistent with
so many of the things that President Xi has said that he wants to see as
a result of this war in Ukraine, including their statements today.   
   
Q    Why do you think that’s the case?  Why do you think that they have
not done that yet?  And do you think it has a lot to do with what
President Biden has told President Xi, what EU leaders have told
President Xi?  And that is: If they do so, they risk major sanctions
being placed upon them by not only the U.S., but also by the EU — their
two largest trading partners.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I certainly can’t speak for President Xi.  That’s well
beyond my writ.   
   
What I would say is we have communicated privately to the Chinese.  And
you’ve heard Secretary Blinken talk about this.  We’ve also said it
publicly that — that such a move would — would certainly involve
consequences.   
   
But more importantly, we believe — and we’ve said this too — that — that
this shouldn’t be seen by the Chinese as something that’s in their best
interest to help Mr. Putin slaughter more innocent Ukrainians, to —
what’s the word they use? — the escalation of tension and prolongation
of hostilities.  Well, that’s one way to do that.   
   
And, again, if — if we’re taking them at their word of what they want to
see happen, it’s hard to square the circle between that — that statement
— and the provision of lethal weapons.   
   
So, we don’t believe it’s in their best interest — a country like China
that has a very powerful economy and — and does have influence around
the world — to want to see that — that influence stained by helping Mr.
Putin murder more Ukrainians.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Brian, in the back.  
   
Q    Thanks.  John, I guess, the — over here.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Thanks.  
   
Q    Follow-up to that question: Is there any indication that the
visitation by Xi to Putin could lead to a de-escalation?  Have you all
seen anything that the statement that they put out about the escalation,
in fact, was a warning to Russia?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We’re still working our way through the language here, so I
don’t want to get into a deep analysis.  But coming out of what we’ve
seen today, we haven’t seen anything that they’ve said, they’ve put
forward, that — that gives us hope that this war is going to end anytime
soon.   
   
As a matter of fact, Mr. Putin said something to the effect today — or
his spokesman, Peskov, I think, said something to the effect today that
— that they’re willing to negotiate but it’s the West and Ukraine that
is refusing, which, of course, is absolutely false.   
   
So, we’ve seen no — I don’t think the meeting today gives us great
expectations that the war is going to end anytime soon.   
   
Q    And then, as a quick follow-up of that, is there any indication
that we would be willing to talk with — or let me put it another way. 
Is there any indication that Russia is showing any signs that they would
back off at any point in time? Are they still, you know, guns blazing?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No sign at all that Mr. Putin is changing his calculus.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Peter.  
   
Q    Thank you.  John, about the bill President Biden signed yesterday:
He says he will declassify COVID origins intel except info that would
harm national security.  Is there a bigger national security threat than
something that killed 1.1 million people —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  Yeah, I’ve seen —  
   
Q    — in this country?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’ve seen some of the commentary on your network about
this.   
   
The President obviously has to balance transparency with national
security, Peter.  Of course, he does.  
   
When coming into office, ordered the declassification of what the DNI
had on COVID origins, ordered the entire intelligence community, and
added the Department of Energy to that list at —  
   
Q    Then where is it?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Hey, let me finish my answer.  
   
Q    If we’re talking about the beginning of his term —  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Added the Department of Energy and the National Labs.  Told
them to keep studying it.   
   
We have kept Congress informed.  Some of that has to be in a classified
way right now.   
   
But it’s always a balance between the public’s right to know — right —
not need, but right — and our obligation to protect national
security.   
   
So, one should not read into that statement that he’s, sort of, laying a
foundation here to be overly secretive.  He believes strongly that we’ve
got to find the roots in the origins of COVID so that we can prevent a
future pandemic.  
   
And through his actions — just judge him on what he’s done through his
actions — he’s proven that he’s willing to be as transparent as possible
with the American people because he believes that’s important.  
   
Q    Then does the White House hope that the lab leak theory is not
true?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We don’t have a hope one way or the other, Peter.  What we
want is the ground truth, wherever that takes us — wherever the science
takes you, wherever the facts takes you.   
   
President Biden wants to know so that he can help work with the
scientific community to prevent a future pandemic.  We’re not — there’s
no thumb on the scale here, Peter.  It’s not about not wanting a certain
outcome.  We just want the best possible outcome that we can get.  
   
Q    Okay.  And just quickly, about the meeting today — the Xi-Putin
meeting.  In November, when President Biden met with Xi, he said, “I
want to make sure that every country abides by the international rules
of the road.”  Does he think China is abiding by the international rules
of the road?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  In some cases, we have significant concerns about China’s
behavior, particularly their coercive and aggressive behavior, for
instance, in the South China Sea and pursuing false maritime claims;
concerns about intellectual theft and some trade practices.   
   
And the President has been very open and honest about that, and he was
when they met in Bali.  
   
But there are other areas where we believe there’s room for cooperation
with China, and we want to be able to pursue that too.  But in order to
do that, Peter, you got to keep those lines of communication open.  You
got to have that ability to talk, particularly when things are tense
like they are right now.  And that’s what the President wants to get
back to.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, Kirby.  In that joint statement today,
Russia and China warned against the war transitioning to a, quote,
“uncontrollable phase.”  Ukraine is preparing a counteroffensive.  Does
the U.S. see that part of the joint statement from Russia and China as a
specific warning to Ukraine and the West?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It’s difficult to know what they mean by an “uncontrollable
phase.”  Certainly, we noted that language ourselves.  I can’t tell you
for sure that we know exactly what they’re referring to.  
   
I will not — I will not speak ever about future operations, particularly
for the Ukrainians.  That’s for them to speak to, and I wouldn’t get
ahead of anything that they might or might not do.  
   
We do know that President Putin is making plans to go back on the
offense.  I mean, he’s already — he’s got Wagner continuing to throw
literally human flesh into Bakh- — Bakhmut to try to — to take that
town.  And we have every expectation that he’s going to plan for other
offensive operations as the weather gets better.  
   
What we want to make sure we’re doing — and we just announced another
package yesterday — is that Ukraine is ready to defend themselves
against those offensive operations and, if they choose to, be able to
conduct offensive operations of their own.  
   
Q    And to follow on that potential Ukrainian offensive, does Xi’s
support for Putin increase the stakes of any potential Ukrainian
offensive?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  It would depend on what that support looked like.  I mean,
does his visit to Moscow?  I think it’s hard to get to — I think it’s
hard to square that circle just by going to Moscow and proclaiming that
they’re dear friends.  
   
But if — but if the — if the tangible support changes, certainly if it
changes in a lethal way, then obviously that would be additive to
Russian military capabilities, which of course would — we would all have
to take seriously.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  And, John, thanks for doing this on
back-to-back days.  
   
Today marks the 100th day of the eco-protests along the Lachin Corridor
in the Karabakh region between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  So I’ve got two
questions on that.  
   
First of all, what is the administration’s position on the ongoing
conflict?  And does the U.S. view the presence of 2,000 Russian soldiers
in the Karabakh region as a cause for concern?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I would just — broadly speaking, what we’ve  
said before is we — we urge all sides here to deescalate.  We don’t want
to see any of this violence, and we want to see all sides take — take
appropriate steps to deescalate the tension and to — and to stop the
violence.  
   
But beyond that, I’m really not prepared to go today.  
   
Q    And what about the Russian troop presence in that region?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not prepared to go beyond that today.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Emily.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, Kirby.  I wanted to ask about the upcoming
trip to Canada and what does the President plan to bring up?  Is he
prepared to talk about the problems that Canadians are having at the
northern border?  But is he also concerned that Canada is behind on its
contributions to NATO, especially as the war in Ukraine goes on?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think we’re going to have more to talk about tomorrow on
this, so I don’t want to get too far ahead of where we are.  Canada, as
you know, is not only a neighbor to the north but a NATO Ally.  And the
President and Prime Minister Trudeau have a terrific relationship.  He’s
looking forward to getting up there.  
   
There are a range of issues that you can imagine they’ll talk about —
everything from NORAD and modernization of NORAD capabilities, as well
as, of course, I think, the military security and national security
issues writ large, migration concerns, climate change.  There’ll be
certainly issues of trade to discuss.  There’s a lot.  But I think we’ll
have more to say about that tomorrow.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Karine.  Mr. Kirby — Annie Linksey of the
Wall Street Journal.  Yesterday, when you were here, you were asked
about Harris — Vice President Harris’s trip to Africa, and you said that
it’s a trip that’s about Africa.  But it’s also a part of the country —
or part of the world where the Chinese have been investing billions upon
billions of dollars.  And can you talk at all about whether countering
that influence is important at all to the administration?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Our focus on the continent is, as I said yesterday, about
the continent.  We’re mindful, of course, of Chinese efforts to improve
and deepen their involvement in Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere
around the world.   
   
And one of the things that came out of the African Leaders Summit was a
growing recognition that we perceived by African leaders that they’re
beginning to realize that China is not really their friend.  They get
these loans — high interest, can’t pay them.  China says “Hey, bill is
coming due.  So I guess I’m going to take this and this and this from
you.”  And that’s starting to happen across the continent.   
   
And African leaders are beginning to see that China’s interests in the
region are purely selfish, as opposed to the United States.   
   
We are truly committed to trying to help our African friends deal with a
spate of challenges — food insecurity, energy insecurity — both of
which, by the way, have been drastically exacerbated by this war in
Ukraine, by Mr. Putin, contrary to what Foreign Minister Lavrov would
say; counterterrorism, where we are still partnering with some of our
African partners to go after terrorist networks; climate change.  I
could go on and on.  
   
And that’s why the President, coming out of that summit, assigned
Johnnie Carson as the implementer.  An implementer.  A guy whose whole
job is to go out and take all the things we talked about in the summit
and make it true.   
   
And part of that, of course, is going to be principal-level travel.  And
the Vice President will be having discussions with African leaders on
all those issues when she travels, and she’s very much looking forward
to that.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Anita.  
   
Q    I have a follow-up on the Africa trip.  In countering China’s
influence on the continent, is the Vice President going to take on some
of the human rights issues that are present in Ghana, Tanzania, and in
Zambia?  Because that’s something that we know that China does not do as
a matter of policy.  How is she going to negotiate that difficult
position?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  The Vice President will, of course, raise human rights
concerns everywhere she goes.  That’s — that’s part and parcel of
American leadership around the world.  We’re not afraid.  
   
And, in fact, it’s a sign of — of how much we care about other nations
and partnerships that we are able and willing to have those kinds of
conversations.  
   
So, of course — of course, she will raise human rights concerns
appropriately everywhere she goes.  
   
Q    Privately or publicly?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I won’t get ahead of the Vice President’s meetings or how
she’s going to couch this.  But, of course, that’s part and parcel of
every conversation that we have with foreign leaders around the world. 
It has to be.  
   
Q    And can I follow up on something you just said about China’s
ability to be impartial?  You just said if China can truly be impartial
and Ukraine is on board for talks.  Is that something that the U.S.
would support if Ukraine were interested in trying to broker talks?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.  If President
Zelenskyy — if there’s a path put forward that President Zelenskyy can
get behind and he believes will help lead to a “just peace,” as he
refers to it, then he’ll find no better friend in that effort than the
United States.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Mr. Kirby —  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  Hi, John.  
   
Q    — over 10 months, not a single opportunity is given —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait.  Hold on a second.  That’s — this is not how it
works.  
   
Q    Mr. Kirby, I have attended your dozen press conferences.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s not — this is not —  
   
Q    Not one opportunity —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This is not how it works, sir.  This is not how it
works.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Hi, John.  Today, the Ugandan Parliament voted in favor of
anti-homosexuality bill and is set to host a summit soon with other
African nations on potentially passing other bills across the
continent.  It’s my understanding that Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield
spoke to the Ugandan president about this bill.  
   
I — I ask this question because I — sources tell me that Russia may be
playing a major role in the influence of this larger anti-LGBTQ movement
and is using it as a wedge between the U.S. and Africa.  
   
Considering the U.S. is currently engaging with Africa on other issues,
is this a concern for the U.S.?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Oh, of course it is.  I mean, and — and President Biden has
been nothing but consistent about his belief — foundational belief in
human rights.  And LGBTQ+ rights are human rights.   
   
And we — again, back to the earlier question — are never going shy away
or be bashful about speaking up for those rights and for — for
individuals to live as they deem fit, as they want to live.  And that’s
something that’s a core part of our foreign policy, and it will remain
so.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, in the back.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    To follow up on what you said yesterday on the — on Iraq and the
anniversary, is there a message for the — some of us who were actually
there and remember — to the families; the 4,000 (inaudible) that lost
their lives, the 35,000 injured, and the two — two and a half million
that served?  
   
And then, second, Japan is hosting the upcoming G7 in Hiroshima.  The
Japanese Prime Minister is currently in Ukraine.  This is a big step for
Japan.  Are there some ways that Japan — Japan hosts — Japan hosts the
largest number of U.S. military in the world.  And as a partner, what
role do you think they can play, especially with the upcoming summit, to
be part of the partnership moving forward?  
   
And then, finally, the Japanese is the biggest partner.  They’ve never
had an interview with the President yet.  So hopefully, before the
summit, if that can be worked out.   
   
Thank you.   
   
Q    Maybe before the end of the briefing.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I will defer to — to Karine on issues of interviews with the
President.  That’s — that’s — that’s your job, not mine.  
   
Look, on your second issue, I think you saw Mr. Sullivan put out a short
tweet about this.  We welcome the Prime Minister’s visit to Kyiv.  It’s
another example of just how strongly Japan is standing up with the rest
of the international community to support Ukraine.   
   
And, certainly, as a close ally of the United States, we’re very
appreciative of all the things that Japan continues to do — not just in
supporting Ukraine, but in promoting security and stability in the
Indo-Pacific.   
   
I mean, they have rewritten their national security strategy.  They have
taken a more assertive role in terms of sec- — security operations.  And
all that’s — all that’s to the good, and we’re very grateful for
that.   
   
I know I have — I don’t know that I have more than I can say than — than
yesterday for — some of you, I’m sure, maybe covered the war and saw
more of combat than — than you probably care to remember.   
   
And, of course, we know, as I said yesterday, so many families here in
the United States are still living with the war.  The war is not over
for them.  And we all need to — we all need to keep that in mind.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nadia.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I also — I also have an Africa question.  President
Putin said that he will write off debt for African countries with over
$20 billion, which is a substantial amount of money.  And he said that
Russia will meet this commitment to provide them with food supply and
energy, et cetera.  
   
Do you think this is — comes in the equation of the Russia-Ukraine war
and trying to sway Ukraine over the vote, especially in the U.N.?  
   
And do you think the U.S. is doing enough to counter Russia’s influence
— not just China, but Russia’s influence?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think this is a cynical effort by Mr. Putin to try to
convince nations in Africa that — that the West is the reason for their
food insecurity and further energy insecurity.   
   
And if I was any leader in Africa, I would take anything that President
Putin says about assurances of financial, economic, or energy assistance
with a huge grain of salt.   
   
I mean, it is Mr. Putin’s war that has contributed to the food
insecurity on the continent.  It’s his war that has contributed to the
energy insecurity on the continent.   
   
And he might like to gloss over that and send Foreign Minister Lavrov on
field trips all over Africa to say that it’s the West’s fault or it’s
the United States’ fault, but it’s not.  It has — it can be tied
directly —  
   
Now, it’s also due to drought, climate change, eco- — and, you know,
even domestic instability.  I don’t want to overstate other factors
here.   
   
But make no mistake, his war in Ukraine is having these kinds of effects
on the African continent.  And if he’s serious about addressing it, if
he’s serious about winning over African audiences, about making things
better, rather than throwing out false promises of — of loan relief, he
ought to just pull his troops out of Ukraine.  Then, if there’s no war,
energy and food insecurity would be a lot less worrisome for
everybody.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Way in the back.  Way in the back.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, John.   
   
MR. KIRBY:  There.  Thanks.  
   
Q    Way in the back.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Appreciate it.  
   
Q    The bill that the President signed yesterday on COVID origins, it
calls for the declassification within 90 days.  Can you give us a better
sense as to when that information will actually be declassified?  Are we
talking about days, weeks, months?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I can’t give you a date certain right now.  I mean, he just
signed this yesterday.  We’re mindful of what the legislation says in
terms of the 90-day time- — timeframe.   
   
We’ll work on this as diligently as we have been working on it, and
we’ll be fully transparent with the American people — again,
appropriately to our own national security concerns.  But I couldn’t
give you a date certain on the calendar.  
   
Q    When it’s out there, people will be able to see it for themselves
and form their own opinion.  At this point, has the President formed an
opinion as to what he thinks happened — he think happened?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, he has not, nor would he.  Why would he?  He wouldn’t
form an opinion before he has access to, you know, more and more
intelligence about — about what happened.   
   
I’ll tell you what he has formed an opinion on.  And that is that it’s
important that we get to the roots of it so that we can prevent another
pandemic and that — that scientific research labs, who do important
work, also know that they need to be as accountable and transparent as
they can be with the research that they’re conducting.  
   
That, he has formed a strong opinion on.  But he’s made no conclusions,
nor would he, until — until more information is available.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And a couple more.  All the way in the back.   
   
Q    Karine, there are journalists on this side as well.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All the way in the back.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Owen.  
   
Q    I’m a journalist for 22 years, Karine.   
   
Q    Thank you, Admiral.  Appreciate it.  In the back here.  Thank
you.  
   
Q    This is so unfair.  
   
Q    If I may —  
   
Q    Mr. Kirby did not ignore me —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Owen.  
   
Q    — once when he was in the State Department.  
   
Q    If I may turn your attention to Nicaragua, sir.    
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re being disrespectful to your colleagues.  
   
Q    I don’t mean to.  But —  
   
Q    Nicaragua —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, you are.  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Owen.  
   
Q    Okay.  Nicaragua is my —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The floor is yours.  
   
Q    — is my question.  Okay.  So, you may know that Daniel Ortega
recently threw into prison Bishop Rolando Álvarez — well-known,
well-respected bishop throughout the world.  But in Nicaragua, that’s
where he was — he (inaudible) bishop.  
   
He was thrown in prison for 26 years on trumped-up charges.  The
question: One, are you aware of any efforts the U.S. is making to free
Rolando Álvarez, the bishop?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m going to — I’m going to have to take the question and
get back to you, sir.  I’m not tracking that particular case.   
   
Q    Okay.  And, two, would you have — would the Biden administration
have any message for the Ortega regime that continues to persecute
Catholics in that country?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  We have been clear and consistent with nations all over the
world about the — the importance of religious freedom and proper human
rights and civil rights for not only their citizens but certainly for
ours as they travel abroad.   
   
But I don’t have anything more specific on that.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, two more.  SV, way in the back.  
   
Q    Yeah, thanks.  Admiral, you talked about how Russia’s forces are
going through ammunition, going through personnel.  We’ve seen reports
about them increasing the draft to get more soldiers.  At what point do
they start ru- — do they start running out of ammunition?  I mean, do
you have an assessment on how long they can continue what they’re doing
before either someone resupplies them or they’re — they have to
(inaudible)?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I think you can see in his own efforts — right? — to hire
Wagner and — for Wagner and Mr. Prigozhin actually bragging about going
to prisons and getting more — more convicts.   
   
I think you can see it in what they’re doing in Bakhmut.   
   
I think you can see it in their outreach to Iran and now trying to forge
some sort of transactional relationship where Iran actually gets access
to Russian military capabilities.  
   
I can see the outreach to North Korea for artillery.   
   
And, of course, this meeting in Moscow — which, make no mistake, Mr.
Putin was hoping would lead to additional support from — from China.  
   
You can see it in what Mr. Putin is doing.  The fact that he goes to
Mariupol on the eve of President Xi’s visit, what is that other than
trying to cast some sort of signal that — that he’s large and in charge
there and that President Xi should take note of that?  
   
You can see in what Mr. Putin is doing that he knows he’s having
resource difficulties because of what he’s blown through over the last
year, in terms of actual ammunition and missiles, the tanks and aircraft
he’s lost, and absolutely the — the soldiers that he has literally
thrown into a meat grinder and continues to do so.  
   
By his own actions, you can see very well that he knows that he’s got
shortage issues, and he’s trying to overcome them.   
   
And that’s another reason why, quite frankly, we don’t want to see a
ceasefire right now.  Because a ceasefire right now, freezing the lines
where they are, basically gives him the time and space he needs to try
to re-equip, to re-man, to make up for the — that resource
expenditure.   
   
Q    Can you quantify the ammunition issue, or do you choose not to in
front of the world?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  I choose not to in front of the world.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Last question.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Two, if I may.  On this U.S. claim to have intelligence
that China has been considering providing lethal aid to the Russians,
and without expecting you to divulge classified information here, can
you at least say that you have any insights or some window onto what
kind of lethal aid the Chinese have been considering providing?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  No, I’m not going to go there, James.  
   
Q    You don’t know?   
   
MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to go there.   
   
Q    And my second question.  I want to draw on your long experience in
the Navy and in the national security apparatus.  You’ve served — I
don’t know how many administrations.  How many administrations?  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Well, over the course of my entire Navy career?  
   
Q    Everything.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  Oh, gosh.  I don’t know.  Six or seven, probably.   
   
Q    So, I wonder if you could share with us any observations you might
have as to the current Commander-in-Chief and whether you observe
anything distinct or unique about how he approaches the central business
of the presidency, which is decision-making.  
   
MR. KIRBY:  James, I don’t know that that’s a fair question for me.  I’m
just the — I’m just the guy talking for the NSC up here.   
   
But, look, I didn’t — I didn’t know the President before I — I took this
job.  But I’ve since got a chance to get to know him.  And I’ll tell
you, his fine feel and touch, particularly on issues of foreign policy
and national security, is very, very distinct.   
   
And he asks great questions.  There’s not a single engagement that I’ve
ever had with him where he wasn’t pushing and pressing and wanting more
detail and wanting a deeper level of context.   
   
He thinks these things through carefully.  And I can tell you — this I
know for sure, certainly, because of my job at the Pentagon, too, before
I came here — that when it comes to putting America’s men and women in
uniform in harm’s way, you won’t find another Commander-in-Chief who
thinks more carefully, deliberately, and consciously about that than
President Biden.   
   
Thanks, everybody.  Appreciate it.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.   
   
Q    Thanks, John.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks.  Thanks, Admiral.   
   
Okay.  I know folks have to gather at, like, 4:15.  So, we’ll try to do
this super quick.   
   
As you just heard from the President earlier this afternoon, this
administration is taking historic action to protect our nation’s most
cherished landscapes.   
   
Today, President Biden established two new national monuments: the Avi
Kwa Ame National Monument in Nevada, also known as the “Spirit
Mountain,” and the Castner Range National Mountain in Texas — Monument,
pardon me — Monument in Texas.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Together, these new monuments protect our over half a
million acres of public lands that honor a Tribal site and our military
veterans.   
   
In addition, the President directed the Secretary of Commerce to
consider initiating a new National Marine Sanctuary designation to
protect all U.S. waters around the Pacific Remote Islands.  
   
These actions continue to deliver on the most ambitious land and water
conservation agenda in American history.  In his first year in office,
President Biden has protected more lands and waters than any President
since JFK.  Over the last two years, he has secured the largest
investment in climate, environmental justice, and conservation ever. 
And he has put the entire U.S. Arctic Ocean off limits to new oil and
gas development.   
   
President Biden’s aggressive climate agenda could not come — could not
come at a more important time.  
   
Yesterday, the United Nations issued a sobering report on the state of
our climate, underscoring the critical importance of President Biden’s
Climate Leadership at home and also abroad.  
   
Now, remember, when President Biden came into office, he talked about
how climate change was one of the most important crises that we needed
to address.  And that’s what you’ve seen from him over the last two
years.  
   
He rejoined the Paris Agreement and rallied more than 100 countries to
join the Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions.  He secured
the most ambitious climate legislation, which has sparked a clean energy
manufacturing and jobs boom here at home while accelerating the jo- —
the global clean energy race abroad.  
   
He put the United States back on track to reach its clean energy goals,
reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reaching net
zero goals.  
   
And on the President’s watch, u- — EV sales has tripled and domestic
solar capacity is on track to increase five times by next year.  
   
But here’s the thing: MAGA House Republicans want to reverse that
progress.  They want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which is
helping Americans save on solar panels, electric vehicles,
energy-efficient windows, and so much more.  And the extreme MAGA
Freedom Caucus is proposing draconian budget cuts that will raise costs
for hu- — for hardworking families.  
   
The House Republican proposal will increase healthcare premiums by an
average of 800 bucks per year for nearly 15 million Americans; eliminate
Pell Grants altogether for 80,000 students, and reduce the maximum Pell
Grant by nearly $1,000 for — for the remaining 6.6 million students; cut
childcare access — access for 100,000 children; cut vital nutrition
assistance for 1.2 million women, infants, and children.   
   
And as we said yesterday, the MAGA Republicans’ proposal will be a
five-alarm fire for hardworking families.  
   
While President Biden is focused on giving those families more breathing
room, MAGA congressional Republicans will — would increase costs and
worsen inflation.  
   
And, with that — hello, Josh.  
   
Q    Hi, how are you, Karine?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good to see you.  
   
Q    Happy Tuesday.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Happy Tuesday indeed.  
   
Q    Two questions.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.

Q    Today, Treasury Secretary Yellen said the federal  
government could step in to protect depositors at banks if there is a
risk of contagion.  What does the administration think about that risk
of contagion?  Is that about fundamentals in the economy or the
psychology of the markets?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you mentioned, Secretary Yellen was at the
American Bankers Association, and she delivered remarks early this
morning.  And as she said — I just want to quote her for a second: “The
federal government delivered…decisive and forceful actions to strengthen
public confidence in the U.S. banking system and protect…American
economy.”   
   
And that’s what you’ve seen from this administration about almost two
weeks ago when they stepped in, when — when we saw this — the — this
crisis happening.  
   
But our focus has been very clear, the President’s focus on this has
been very clear, which is strengthening and — strengthening the banking
system and protecting depositors.  That has been what has been at the
forefront of the minds of the federal regulators and also the Department
of Sec- — Department of Treasury.  
   
And there’s evidence our actions are indeed working.  They’re restoring
confidence in the safety of deposits.  Treasury has said — has seen
deposit flows stabilized, which is incredibly important, in regional and
also small banks, in some cases, mostly — mostly reversed.   
   
And so that has been the focus of this administration for the past
10-plus days.  
   
Q    And then, secondly, the Los Angeles School District, the
second-largest in the country, is shut down for a three-day strike. 
Should school staff be paid more money?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — and, you know, we’ve talked about this
before.  We respect the process and employ- –employees’ right to engage
in protected concerted activities.  That is something you hear the
President talk about how he supports the collective bargaining process. 
And that is something that he will continue to do.  
   
We urge both sides to work in good faith toward a mutually acceptable
solution so that there can be a quick resolution and the kids and school
employees can get back to where they want to be, which is in schools,
especially the kids.   
   
And we, the President — as you’ve heard him say, this is incredibly
important to him, making sure that kids get — go back to school and get
their education.  
   
Go ahead, Steve.  
   
Q    To follow up on Josh’s first question, can you insure all deposits
in the U.S. banking system?  And do you need legislation for that?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, there are many things — and I have talked
about this — that — well, let me step back.  
   
You know, the President and the administration, they took quick — quick
action when — when this happened a couple of days ago.   
   
And, of course, there’s things that Congress can do.  We’ve talked about
how the President has already called for Congress to make it easier for
regulators to claw back compensation, impose civil penalties, and ban
executives from working in the banking industry.  So that’s something
that we’ve asked for.  
   
But as I was mentioning a moment ago, there are quite a bit that we can
do without Congress.  And this is what you have asked — we’ve — the
President has asked regulators to do in the last two years: to take
actions over — over the last few years — to reverse the last
administration’s deregulation, which we know happened back in 2018,
after the Oba- — Obama-Biden administration put in stronger —
strengthening those — strengthening regulations back after — after what
we saw in 2008.  
   
So, look, we don’t want to let Congress off the hook.  We want Congress
to continue to — to certainly — to take action.  And so, we’re going to
call on them to do just that.  
   
Q    Karine, I know the — this White House doesn’t weigh in on the Fed’s
policy deliberations, so not asking you to do that.  But just in the
bigger picture, can you give us a sense of how the White House is
watching Jerome Powell’s statement tomorrow, as well as the interest
rate decision that is coming?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I just want to be very, very careful here.  I’m
just going to go back to what we have said many times.  The Fed — the
Fed is indeed independent.  We want to give them the space to make those
monetary decisions.  And I’m just not — I don’t want to get ahead of
that.  I don’t even want to — I don’t even want to give any thought to
what they might — what Jerome Powell might say tomorrow.  I just want to
be really, really mindful and careful here.   
   
Q    Just totally different topic.  Does President Biden believe that it
is appropriate for a person who is indicted to run for office?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — nice way to ask, MJ.  Very clever.   
   
So I’m going to be, again, really careful for here — from here as it
relates to any upcoming elections.  And specifically, I’m assuming
you’re — you’re talking about the 2024 election.  We just — I’m just not
going to give any analysis, any foresight, any — any type of — kind of
decision or thoughts on that because we are covered by the Hatch Act. 
So not going to speak to politics.  And I’m just going to leave for —
leave it there.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  Has the President seen the video that seems to
show the moments during and after Irvo Otieno was — died while in law
enforcement custody at Virginia Central State Hospital?  Has he been
briefed on this?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, we’ve seen — we’ve definitely seen the reports. 
I know the President has been tracking this.  Look, I said this last
week when I was asked by TheGrio, by — I believe by April Ryan.  Our
hearts certainly go to — go out to the family on this devastating —
devastating event that occurred.  The President is indeed — he saw the
reports.  We’ve been paying attention to reports.   We’re just going to
be incredibly mindful on speaking on this as there’s a current
investigation.  
   
Q    And has he been in touch with the Otieno family?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have a call.  We don’t have a call to
preview or to speak to at this time.  But clearly, this is — it was
devastating, again, what we saw.  And our hearts go out to the family.  
   
Go ahead, Justin.  
   
Q    Thanks.  I just wanted to follow up on Steve’s question.  In — in
your answer, you highlighted the President’s past actions, said Congress
shouldn’t be off the hook, but you today and yesterday avoided talking
about what, if any, unilateral actions that the President is considering
going forward to sort of stabilize the financial system.   
   
And I’m wondering what the strategy is there, especially after we saw
this sort of robust response a little over a week ago.  Is it because
you think the crisis is over, that you’re worried that talking about
what you’re talking about could — could fuel the panic?  Is it that you
want to set a precedent ahead of the debt ceiling fight of not really
entertaining unorthodox solutions?  Is it a combination of those three
things?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — no, totally understand the question.   
   
Look, when it comes to specifics about the debt ceiling and — and — and
all of those things, that’s something that Treasury, certainly, and the
Secretary has spoken to this many times.   
   
I would say that, and I will quote her here, “The actions we have
taken…” — this is from the Secretary, “…to protect depositors and the
stability of the banking system have not affected the X-date for the
debt limit.”  So just want to reiterate that from — from the
Secretary.   
   
Look, you know, as — as it — you know, if we’re worried about unorthodox
interventions?  No, we’re not.  We’re going to use every tool that we
have to make sure that the American people have the confidence.  That’s
what we’ve been trying to work through these last almost two weeks — is
that making sure that they feel that their deposits will be safe and
will be there when they need it.  And that’s what’s important in the
actions and what the President has asked the regulators to do and also
the Treasury Department to do.  
   
Q    So it’s fair to say that those conversations are ongoing, but — but
you don’t necessarily want to detail them because of conf- — that
confidence issue?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I mean, this is something that lives in the
Treasury Department.  This is something that they have been tasked with,
as it relates to dealing with this issue that we have seen.  That —
that’s the directive that the President has given the Secretary and the
regulators.  So that lives there.  So that’s something that I would —
that’s why I’m referring you to them.   
   
But we’re going to do everything that we can to use the tools that are
given to us to make sure that — again, that the American people feel
confidence.  And they should, right?  That’s kind of what you heard from
the Secretary today — that we see a stabilizing, that the banking — the
banking system is resilient.  And a lot of that is because of the work
that this President has done.   
   
I know you’ve — you’ve — you’ve mentioned the current things that he’s
doing, but let’s not forget what occurred in the Obama-Biden
administration and how they were able to strengthen that — the
regulations.  And so that work will continue.  And — but again, we can’t
let Congress off the hook.  They have to take some actions as well.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, go ahead.  (Laughs.)  Yes.  
   
Q    We know that Chicago, Atlanta, and New York City are in the running
for the Democratic convention.  And ultimately, the decision is up to
President Biden.  What are the factors he’s looking for?  And will the
host city be announced before the President makes the second-term
announcement official?  Or is the timing not related?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, so first, let me say — let me answer your — your
last question first, which is the President has said many times that he
intends to run.  I’m not going to go beyond that.  That is for the
President to decide, clearly.   
   
And, look, that question that you just asked me is a — is a political
question that lives with — with the DNC, the — the Democratic National
Committee.  So, that — I would refer you to — to them.   
   
But, you know, all of — all of us are probably tracking that a decision
hasn’t been made on that front.  Again, that’s for the DNC to decide. 
But just like many of you — all of you here, we will all find out at the
same time which city gets chosen.  I just can’t speak to this — to that
from here.  
   
Q    I wasn’t asking about the DNC.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, okay.  
   
Q    I was asking because the DNC does the vetting and the  site
selection, but then they give a recommendation to the President, who is
the decider.  Just like when the primary happened, the news came out
from him.  So that’s why I’m asking you a little bit more how this may
work out.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, the President is the leader of the Democratic
Party.  But from here, I cannot talk about politics, so that’s why I’m
referring you to the DNC.  
   
Go ahead, Alex.  
   
Q    Karine, San Francisco just held a hearing on reparations for
decades of — of institutional racism.  And,  
you know, other cities and states are considering, you know, paneling
similar commissions.  D.C. is one of them.  Where does this
administration stand on reparations for slavery and segregation and
similar historic wrongs, specifically pertaining to Black Americans?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we understand that there’s a legislation on
the Hill currently on this — on the study of represe- — of reparations,
pardon me.  And we think Congress is the — the appropriate venue for
considera- — consideration on such action.  And so we’re going to leave
it there for Congress to decide, to let them go through their process
that they’re taking at this moment.   
   
But I would — I would lay out and speak to what the President has done
over the last two years.  When he came into office, he talked about the
different crises that this country is dealing with, and one of them was
racial equity and racial equality, and fighting for that, for — for
communities like the Black community.

And one of the things that he did right away — straight away in the
beginning of his administration — is he signed an executive order that —
that made sure that across the — across the govern- — government, that
we had an approach that dealt with inequality, that we had — that made
sure that — that — that political appointees in — in those agencies put
that in — put that equality lens as they were moving forward with
dealing with policy. 

And so, that’s — that’s important in really getting to the root of that
issue.  Clearly, that’s on the federal level.  And — and just last
month, he issued a second order reaffirming the administration’s
commitment to deliver on that equity. 

So, the President has shown his commitment.  He’s spoken to this issue
that — that, in particular, this Black commu- — the Black community has
to deal with for generations upon generations. 

So, he is going to continue to lift that up.  But as it relates to the
legislation, we — we want to leave that in the hands of Congress.

Go ahead, Courtney.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  I wanted to ask about the Supreme Court.  The
American Bar Association, last month, passed a resolution urging the
Supreme Court justices to agree to an ethics code, given how
consequential their decisions have been over the last year.  And there
are bills in Congress considering this.  What’s the President’s position
on a mandatory code of ethics for the highest court?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m just not going to speak to that from here.  I
— that is something for SCOTUS to work through and to speak to.  I’m
just not going to make a comment from here about that.

Q    Thank you.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Steven.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  On Friday, the President — when the Taoiseach was
here, the President said he looked forward to going to Ireland to
celebrate the Good Friday Agreement.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes.

Q    The actual anniversary is less than three weeks away.  Can you give
us a sense of where things are in the planning for this trip and when we
might get a formal announcement on it?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s a good question.  And so — you know, I don’t have
anything more to share — any plans to go to Northern Ireland and the
Republic to acknowledge the anniversary of the Good Friday Accord.   
   
The President said he looks forward to doing that.  But we’re still in
process of hammering out what — what those details will be.  And as soon
as we have more information, we’ll — we’ll certainly share that,
understanding that that’s three weeks away.  But as the President said,
he’s looking forward to it.

Hi —

Q    Thanks, Karine.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Are you new — you’re new to the room?

Q    Yes.  Allie Raffa with NBC.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nice to meet you.

Q    Nice to meet you, too. 

Earlier this month, President Biden said he spoke with the family of
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell after his fall.  Has the
President spoken directly with Leader McConnell since then?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have any — any conversations to read out at this
time.  Yes, the President called the family of Leader — Leader
McConnell, clearly, wishing him a speedy recovery, which we continue to
do.  Just don’t have anything beyond what we — what we laid out a couple
weeks ago.

Okay.  Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  I wanted to ask you about some comments by the
President of Mexico, who’s been very critical of the administration
recently.  Just today, he suggested that the U.S. had blown up the Nord
Stream pipeline, suggested the administration was trying to derail
Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 election.  And then, recently, he said
that fentanyl is a U.S. problem, not a Mexican problem. 

This, of course, is — comes just a couple of months after the two
leaders met in Mexico City.  I’m wondering what this says about
U.S.-Mexico relations — how you go forward when he’s — you know, when
he’s saying these kinds of things?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, you said a couple things that I want to
address.  Clearly, the first two are not true.  And — and so, I’m just
going to put that on the record. 

As it relates to the fentanyl, this is — this is not a U.S. problem,
it’s a global one.  The trafficking of illicit drugs is causing a
societal — societal damage, needless death and suffering — and not just
here, but also in Mexico. 

And so, you know, we want to be really mindful about that.  Dr. Liz
Sherwood-Randall recently — the President’s Homeland Security Advisor
and other high-level U.S. delegation, they went — they were in Mexico,
and they — they discussed concrete opportunities to detect and dis- —
and disrupt and prosecute those who manufacture and traffic fentanyl. 
And that is a conversation — a delegation that went to Mexico to have
this conversation. 

And so, you know, just want to be really clear about that.  Because that
is something that — when we think about fentanyl, it’s something that is
affecting many communities. 

Look, we see our relationship with Mexico a vital one, an important
one.  They are a close neighbor.

As you just mentioned, the President was just recently in Mexico City in
January to do the summit, not just with the President of Mexico, but
also the Prime Minister of Canada.  You saw them; they had a very good —
a very good summit.  You know, good discussion bilaterally when they had
that opportunity during the summit. 

And so, we’re going to try and continue to grow — to grow that
relationship.  But, you know, I’m certainly going to speak out and make
sure we correct the record on some of the things that have just been
said.

Go ahead, Molly.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  You spoke about that sobering U.N. climate report
earlier.  Has the President read the reports, been briefed on the
report?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s a good question.  I would have to ask to see if
the President has been briefed on the report.  I don’t have an answer
for you at this time.

Q    You also talked about, you know, the steps this administration has
taken on the issue of climate change.  But this report indicates that
what’s being done so far is not enough to, you know, avert these
catastrophic temperatures.  Does the administration feel that enough
action can be taken in time to avert the Earth from reaching this?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s — it’s a great question.  And what I will say to
that is: This is why the President has made climate change — tackling
climate change a priority.  And this is why he has done more on climate
change and protecting the climate and reversing — trying to reverse the
damage that we have seen.  He’s made that a priority, and he’s taken
more actions than any other President.  The re- — his record speaks for
that. 

There’s always more work that needs to be done.  And so, the President
is going to continue to focus on — on all the things that we can do to
deal with this issue.

At the top, I laid out the different — the different — the different
actions the President has taken.  And clearly, we’re going to continue
to — to move forward. 

But again, yes, does more work to — need to be done?  Absolutely.  And
that’s why the President has made this a priority.  One of the crises
that he mentioned — one of the four crises that he mentioned when he
walked into this administration and took action right away. 

And so, that’s going to continue.  He’s never going to back down.

AIDE:  Karine, we have to wrap.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have to wrap?  Okay, last question.

Q    On the climate announcements today, Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo
put out a statement saying that they were not consulted on the Avi Kwa
Ame site and that he opposes it being designated as a national
monument.  Did the White House consult the governor?  And if not, why
not?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have any meetings to work — to talk
through or — or conversations.

So, look, I mean, this is something that I was saying before.  This is a
President that has taken an aggressive stand on climate and made this a
priority. 

This is the most engaged — when you think about the engagement that
we’ve seen on this issue, is — is important because there’s still much
more that needs to be done to tackle this climate crisis.  And so, we’re
going to continue to do the work. 

I can’t speak to any conversation that has been had with the governor. 
But I can say that the President is taking — taking his — taking —
tackling the climate crisis as a — as a priority.   
   
And we’re doing — we’re doing the work like no other President has
done.  And so, we’re going to continue — continue to move forward in
doing that.

Q    Does the President usually consult governors on these kinds of
decisions?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President and — and his Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs, which deals with governors and deals with
mayors and also local elected officials, is in constant communications
with — with a — with — to your question, with governors.  I just don’t
have a readout to give you on that particular conversation or
engagement. 

All right, everybody.  I’ll see you tomorrow.

Q    Thanks, Karine.
