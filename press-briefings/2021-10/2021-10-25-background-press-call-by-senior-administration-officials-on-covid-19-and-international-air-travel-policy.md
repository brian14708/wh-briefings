Via Teleconference

12:43 P.M. EDT  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Hey, everybody.  This is Kevin.  Happy Monday.  Thank you
for joining us, and apologies for the delay.  A reminder — I just sent
an email that you got the factsheet.  The factsheet and this call are
going to be embargoed now until 2:00 p.m., not 1:00 p.m.  So, making
sure that everybody is tracking 2:00 p.m.   
   
As a reminder, this will be attributed to “senior administration
officials.”  On the call today, we have remarks from \[senior
administration officials\].  Also on the line for the Q&A portion is
\[senior administration official\], as well as \[senior administration
official\].   
   
And with that, I will hand it over to \[senior administration
official\].   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, and thanks for being with us
today.   
   
So, as we recently announced, starting November 8th, we are moving to a
new vaccination-based international travel system.   
   
Today, we’re taking an important step forward in operationalizing this
new system as it relates to international air travel by releasing a
series of documents that will help airlines and travelers get ready for
November 8th and ensure a smooth transition to the new system.  
   
Stepping back, as we laid out last month, under this new international
air travel system,  
   
These are strict safety protocols that follow the science and public
health to enhance the safety of Americans here at home and the safety of
international air travel.  
   
The documents we’re releasing today provide both airlines and
international travelers with detailed information on these safety
protocols.  The documents will include a Presidential Proclamation that
establishes the new vaccination requirement; CDC orders on vaccination,
testing, and contact tracing that lay out the details of the new, safer
system for international air travel; and technical instructions for
airlines to help them implement these new requirements.  
   
So, let me turn to \[senior administration official\] for some key
aspects of the vaccination and testing requirements, and then I’ll say a
little after \[senior administration official\], before we turn it over
to questions.  
   
\[Senior administration official\], over to you.  
   
     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, \[senior administration
official\].  Appreciate that.  
   
So, today, CDC has issued three orders to implement the Presidential
Proclamation in accordance with appropriate public health protocols to
ensure the safety of international air travel.   
   
These orders include operational details, putting in place stringent and
consistent global international travel policy that is guided by public
health.  
   
The first order is a vaccination requirement for non-citizens who are
not immigrants.  On November 8th, air travelers to the United States who
are non-citizens and who are not immigrants will be required to be fully
vaccinated and to provide proof of their vaccination status prior to
flying to the United States.   
   
The airlines will verify vaccination status in the same way they have
been and will continue to do with the proof of a pre-departure negative
test result.  
   
For purposes of entry into the United States, vaccines will be accepted
that include the FDA approved or authorized and WHO Emergency Use Listed
vaccines.  
   
There will be very limited exceptions to the vaccination requirements
for non-citizens who are not immigrants.  CDC has determined the very
narrow list of exemptions, including children under 18 and those
countries with less than a 10 percent total vaccination rate due to lack
of availability of vaccines.  
   
The next order after the vaccination order is an amendment to the
testing requirement for all air travelers to the United States,
regardless of citizenship.  
   
Fully vaccinated air passengers entering the United States
internationally, regardless of citizenship, will continue to be required
to show a pre-departure negative COVID test taken within three days of
travel prior to boarding.  
   
For those vaccinated persons, they will be required to show proof of
vaccination to qualify for this three-day testing window.  
   
However, for unvaccinated air passengers, including unvaccinated U.S.
citizens and lawful permanent residents, the rules will now require a
test within one day of departure to the United States.  
   
Children under two years old do not need to test.  There are also
accommodations for people who have a documented recovery from COVID-19
in the past 90 days with respect to the testing requirement.   
   
The third and final order is for the collection of contact information. 
Air passengers to the United States will also be required to provide
basic, valid contact information to airlines before boarding flights to
the United States.   
   
This will allow airlines to better coordinate with public health
agencies, to share information when needed, to keep the public safe and
informed, and strengthen their ability to rapidly identify and contact
people in the United States who may have been exposed to a communicable
disease, such as COVID-19.   
   
In addition to these orders, all travelers need to plan ahead before
travel.  Follow all airline and destination requirements, including mask
wearing, proof of vaccination, testing, or quarantine.  U.S. travelers
will need to be prepared to show proof of a negative test before they’re
able to travel to the United States and should make arrangements for
testing in advance of travel if possible.   
   
Vaccinated U.S. travelers will need to carry and provide proof of their
vaccination to the airlines to qualify for the three-day testing
window.  Otherwise, a one-day test will be required.   
   
The best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of new
variants is to act quickly to reduce the spread of infection through
vaccination, layered with the additional mitigation measures — including
vaccination for everyone who is eligible — and timely and effective case
detection through testing, contact tracing, public health follow-up for
all international travelers. 

Thanks.  \[Senior administration official\], back to you.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Let me just — let me just
summarize a few things before we open up to questions.  
   
So, airlines will now, after today, have the information they need to
operationalize the new international air travel system starting on
November 8th.  We have taken the deliberate steps of giving this time to
ensure implementation goes as smoothly as possible, particularly with
something this wide-ranging.   
   
As with anything of this scale, there may be moments where travelers
have issues or questions in the first few weeks of implementation.  And
over the next two weeks, we will work across the federal government,
with our airline partners, with the travel and tourism industry to
communicate these new requirements to travelers.  And we encourage
travelers to pay close attention, as my colleague said, to information
that their airlines are putting out on the steps they should be taking
to prepare for travel.  
   
We’ll also soon be sharing additional implementation details on our
vaccination-based international travel system for the land border.  And
those will be coming soon.   
   
As previously announced, the land border requirements will be similar to
the air travel, with foreign national travelers to the U.S. for
nonessential reasons, like tourism, required to be fully vaccinated
starting on November 8th.   
   
We understand the importance of international travel and are committed
to ensuring a smooth transition to the new system on November 8th.   
   
With that, let’s open it up to a few questions, Kevin.   
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks, \[senior administration officials\].  Just a
reminder for anybody that joined late: The embargo now is 2:00 p.m.
Eastern, and this is attributable to “senior administration
officials.”   
   
We have time for a few questions.  First question, let’s go to Zolan at
New York Times.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thanks so much for having this call and taking my
question.  I’m hoping to get some more details on the exemptions for
travel to the United States.  Will children under 18 pretty much broadly
be exempted from entering?   
   
Also, can you elaborate a little bit on some of the — I think there’s an
exemption for those with medical conditions as well — what those might
be; as well as whether you’re considering any exemptions for travelers
from low-vaccinated countries, for those who might just not have access
to a vaccine.   
   
Thanks.  
   
     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Those are great questions. 
\[Senior administration official\], do you want to take that one?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, sure.  So, great questions.  Thank
you, Zolan.  And, in fact, you hit the three highlights that I was going
to mention.   
   
So, with regards to children under 18: Yes, they will have an exemption
from the vaccination requirement.  And that is exactly due to the reason
you mentioned.  In many circumstances, children are not yet eligible for
vaccines or not yet eligible for the vaccines that are authorized on
this combined list of FDA and WHO EUL vaccines.  So, with regard to
children: Yes, that exemption applies.  
   
With regard to other exemptions: In fact, yes, we fully are aware that
the global distribution and availability of vaccines varies widely, and
so there will be exemptions specifically for countries that have
insufficient vaccines to have persons fully vaccinated.   
   
In general, WHO provides a regularly updated list of countries in which
the fully vaccinated population of those countries is under 10 — is
under what that percentage is.  And for those for whom that coverage
level is under 10 percent of the entire population, they will fall into
this exemption category in terms of availability.  
   
And so, I think that — those cover both the children and the exemptions
by availability, and there are others that you will see in the specifics
of the Procs that are more granular in nature.  But that’s the
highlight.  
   
I believe I — did I cover your question?  
   
Q    Was there also for medical?  For medical (inaudible).  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, there’s medical contraindication
exemptions as well for those that have severe anaphylactic allergic
reactions to a prior COVID vaccine.  And these will be specified both in
the specific vaccination order as well as in our technical instructions
that help clarify the implementation.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And let me just add, \[senior
administration official\] — I think that’s great.  Let me add one thing,
which is that — while we have set a number of exemptions and they will
be in the documents, this will represent a very, very small number of
actual travelers to the U.S.  So, these have been crafted to be
narrow.   
   
And then even in the low vaccine availability countries, people will
also need to have a compelling reason to come here.  So, it’s just not
they’re coming here for any reason; they need to have a specific,
compelling reason.  So, tourist visas will not qualify for that.  
   
So, I just wanted to be clear about the narrowness of these
exemptions.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, next question.  Let’s go to Dave Shepherdson at
Reuters.   
   
Q    Sorry, I was on mute.  Thank you for doing this call.  Just to
follow up on the last question: Can you tell us how many countries will
be on that low vaccination list initially?  At what point will those
countries come off the list?  Is there a certain percentage figure that
will trigger their treatment as like every other country?  
   
And have you given any indication to or any thought about expanding the
list of vaccines you’ll accept to vaccines not covered by the WHO? 
Obviously, there are hundreds of millions of people in places like India
and Russia and elsewhere that have been vaccinated with other vaccines
not on the list.  Is there any chance you would expand to any of
those?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Thanks for your questions,
Dave.  Yes, so the current list that the countries that would be
eligible under the 10 percent threshold is about 50 countries.  The
vaccination coverage data is uniformly maintained and available through
WHO on a regular basis.  And we will commit to reviewing the vaccination
coverage information and redefining that list on — I believe it’s about
a quarterly interval, but regularly along the process so that that
information can be passed along and be updated.  
   
This is all a dynamic process, including the process by which WHO and
their SAGE committee look at the WHO list of vaccines that meet certain
standards.  And we’ve picked the U.S. FDA list and the WHO list because
they go through an internationally recognized standardization process
that’s easy to define.  
   
And so, at this point in time, that’s how we’ve framed the vaccines, but
we’re well aware that WHO and SAGE are continuing to look at their EUL
lists on a regular basis.  And specifically, some of the vaccines you
mentioned are going to be under review as the data on performance of
those vaccines becomes available in a regulatory process.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  Thank you.  Next question, let’s go to Kiran Stacey at the
Financial Times.  
   
Q    Hi, guys.  Can you hear me?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFIAL:  Yep.  
   
Q    Apologies.  Thanks for doing the call.  I just wanted to check if
there were any concerns about allowing people in who’ve been vaccinated
with either Sinopharm or Sinovac, given the lack of research into how
those vaccines are coping with the Delta variant.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, so your point is well taken, and
the idea of figuring out the vaccine effectiveness with regard to the
emergence of variants — Delta or otherwise — is a really important
question and process.   
   
I want to remind folks that even with regard to the Delta variant,
vaccines, you know, have been designed to reduce severe disease,
hospitalization, and death as their primary endpoint.   
   
Some of the concerns that are raised about breakthrough infections —
fortunately, what we have seen is, even when persons that are fully
vaccinated breakthrough with infection, one is, that’s much less common;
and two, the protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and
death holds.   
   
And so, I think these are the kinds of considerations that are taken
into account in the WHO EUL process and in the SAGE process — is very
careful assessment against endpoints.   
   
And by and large, we have to appreciate that preventing people from
getting sick, hospitalized, and dying of COVID is a top, top priority. 
Everything we can do to incentivize that process reduces the amount of
virus that’s circulating, reduces the morbidity and mortality for those
individuals, and actually reduces the strain on healthcare systems to
cope with the disease of COVID.   
   
So, that’s how we’ve addressed this issue.  Over.  
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, we have time for a couple more questions.  Let’s
go to Janet Rodriguez at Univision.  
   
Q    Hi, thank you very much for doing this.  Just one point of
clarification: The one-day rule for vaccination will only apply to
unvaccinated U.S. citizens and LPRs, correct?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No.  The one-day rule applies to all —
so the testing order modifications apply to all incoming passengers,
regardless of citizenship and regardless of visa.   
   
What we see is, essentially, a bifurcated pathway: If you’re fully
vaccinated, the ability to test up to three days prior, whereas
unvaccinated persons need to show that negative test immediately
prior.  
   
And a lot of this is derived from what we’ve learned about Delta variant
and other variants, which can be both more contagious and have a more
rapid onset.  So that window of time is shortened for those that are
unvaccinated, whether — regardless of citizenship.  
   
Q    Regardless.  Thank you for clarifying that.  It wasn’t clear on the
factsheet.   
   
And the second question is: You said in the next couple of days we’ll
get some guidance for the land travel.  Are we expecting for those
guidances to mirror basically what you’ve said today?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Senior administration official\], do
you want to do that one?  I don’t want to prejudge any (inaudible).  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, absolutely.  We are following the
exact same CDC guidelines.  CBP is working to finalize the procedures
that will be used at the land port of entries.  And we should get that
out in the next couple days.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Last question.  Let’s go to Leslie Josephs at
NBC.  
   
Q    Hi, everyone.  Thanks for taking my question.  On the checking of
the vaccine requirements by airlines, is this something that can be done
digitally?  I know United Airlines, you could upload your vax card.  Or
is this something that has to be done in person?   
   
And the reason I’m asking is because a lot of foreign airlines, even
some other airlines, use contract workers in other countries.  Are those
workers going to have to be kind of informed on what to look for?  Any
detail on that?  And can you also just repeat the 10 percent for
exemptions?  Is that just for children — for minors or everybody getting
an exemption?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, Leslie, good questions.  Let me
take the second one first.  So, for children — for children under 18,
there’s a uniform exemption from that vaccination requirement
recognizing the lower regulatory authorization as well as availability
for vaccinations in children writ large.   
   
The proof of vaccination — your first question — is: We will accept —
and this will be very clearly defined in the vaccination order and in
the technical instructions — we will accept digital certificates as long
as those are mapped against the same U.S. requirements.   
   
And we’ve worked a long time with our — with various airlines and
partner governments to look at those alignment of requirements.   
   
So, digital certificate will be accepted and, as well, the opportunity
to present a paper CDC vaccination card — for example, for those that
are not part of a digital certificate program — that also meets our
requirements will be acceptable.   
   
So, as you brought up the United Airlines, and there are many which
allow uploading your vaccine credentials in advance.  And that also
includes, for several of these places, uploading, you know, a copy of
your — of your paper certificate.  They may be rechecked at the — at the
time of boarding to validate and verify the credentials against the
identity of the passenger.  But both a digital format and a paper format
will be accepted, provided they meet all the specifications in our order
and technical instructions.  
   
Over.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you very much.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  \[Senior administration official\], do
you want to — I know you’ve been doing a lot of conversations with the
airlines.  Do you want to add anything?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Certainly.  My colleague covered it
well.  I would just say that, you know, I think as the process goes on,
initially there may be things that are more manual in nature and perhaps
more paper.  But as carriers are able to bring online more digital
systems, we probably will see the use of those types of systems
increase.   
   
But we want to provide flexibility to ensure that both passengers who
have paper or digital presentations of their vaccination documentation
as well as the carrier’s ability — the airline’s ability to, you know,
be able to validate and ingest that information would be, you know,
flexible.   
   
So, that’s why you see that ability, as my colleague depicted, to be
able to do either.  But we do expect that will mature in the coming
months.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  And I would just add to what my
colleagues said: There’s another reason we announced this policy on
September 20th.  We’re putting out all of these documents with two weeks
before implementation day just to give airlines and travelers plenty of
time to get used to this new system.  
   
MR. MUNOZ:  All right, that is it.  As a reminder, this is embargoed
until 2:00 p.m.  And please reach out with any questions.  And thanks,
everybody.   
   
1:05 P.M. EDT
