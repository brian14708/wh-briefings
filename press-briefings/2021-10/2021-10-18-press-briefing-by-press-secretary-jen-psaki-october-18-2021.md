title: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, October 18, 2021

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:15 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Okay, I have a update for all
of you on some of the President’s outreach and engagement as it relates
to Build Back Better and his legislative agenda.  
   
He spent the weekend continuing his deep engagement on behalf of his
economic growth agenda for the middle class, speaking with members who
represent the full spectrum of views of Hill Democrats about the pathway
forward on both his human infrastructure and physical infrastructure
plans.  
   
He spoke, as I think some of you reported, this morning with
Representative Jayapal at the White House, and will have a number of
additional conversations by phone with members of both chambers and —
who also run the gamut in terms of their views — as we proceed through
the course of the afternoon.  
   
Tomorrow, he will host two different meetings with House members here at
the White House: one with moderates and one with progressive members.  
   
We’re encouraged at the accele- — by the accelerated pace of talks and
are eager to get this done to meet the urgent needs of families who have
been contending with high costs, outdated physical infrastructure, the
increasingly devastating threat of climate change, and a tax system that
gives special treatment to the rich and corporations at the expense of
middle-class families no matter how hard they work.  
   
As you also saw, we also announced this morning that, on Wednesday, the
President will travel to Scranton, Pennsylvania — going back home, some
might say — to continue to rally support for his Bipartisan
Infrastructure Deal and Build Back Better Agenda.  
   
There continues to be strong, broad agreement in Congress and among
Americans of all stripes — political stripes — about the values at the
core of the President’s agenda: ensuring our economy works for the
middle class, not just those at the top.  
   
Alex, why don’t you kick us off.  
   
Q  Two foreign and one on nominations. To start, can you update us on
the status of the U.S. and Canadian missionaries that were kidnapped in
Haiti over the weekend? What’s been the U.S. involvement in tracking
them down? Has the President been briefed on this? And is there any
update on, sort of, their status?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. The President has been briefed and is receiving regular
updates on what the State Department and the FBI are doing to bring
these individuals home safely.  
   
The FBI is part of a coordinated U.S. government effort to get the U.S.
citizens involved to safety. Due to operational considerations, we’re
not going to go into too much detail on that, but can confirm their
engagement.  
   
And the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince is coordinating with local
authorities and providing assistance to the families to resolve the
situation.  
   
We can’t get into too many — too many details, I should say, about the
individuals and their identities because of Privacy Act waiver
considerations.  
   
Q  And then, can you comment on reports that China tested at
nuclear-capable hypersonic missile over the summer to the surprise of
U.S. officials? Are these accurate? And do these raise concerns about
China’s nuclear capabilities?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I know General — Secretary Austin, I should say, was
asked this question this morning and addressed it, but I’m not going to
comment on the specific report.  
   
I can say and would echo what he said, which is, generally speaking,
we’ve made clear our concerns about the military capabilities that the
PRC continues to pursue. And we have been consistent in our approach
with China: We welcome stiff competition, but we not — we do not want
that competition to veer into conflict. And that is certainly what we
convey privately as well.  
   
Q  And then, on nominees, the Biden administration, at this point, has a
smaller percentage of nominees confirmed than his recent predecessors.
What do you make of this? Who is to blame? I mean, is this the fault of
the Senate or is this in part because you have been focused on the COVID
response and the Build Back Better Agenda? And is there a concern that
this will affect government at this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We are concerned about the obstruction of our nominees. And
while we have made progress over the course of the last several months —
back to the transition, even, of putting forward qualified nominees to
serve in key and vital positions across government — there has been —
there have been unprecedented delays, obstruction, holds on qualified
individuals from Republicans in the Senate.  
   
What is also true, if you look historically — and we can get you some
numbers on this after the briefing to give you — to give this to you in
more data specifics — is that many of our nominees — a huge number of
our nominees pass with overwhelming majorities of Democrats and
Republicans. They can be voted through by unanimous consent; you don’t
need to use all of the hours on the floor to get it done.  
   
Yet, there has been, time after time, obstruction that has prevented
qualified nominees from being in vital positions, whether it’s in the
national security roles; in the Defense Department; the State
Department, where we’ve seen ambassadors held for weeks and months, at
times; or even our economic nominees, who are unquestionably qualified
but have been unable to move forward and serve in these positions.  
   
So, I would say the blame is clear. It is frustrating. It is something
that we wish would move forward more quickly. And there is historical
precedent, of course, of moving these forward through a more — a faster
process.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. I just want to see if you can elaborate a little bit on
something you just said: that you’re encouraged by the accelerated pace
of talks on infrastructure. What changed? Is there something that’s
different now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: The President is certainly feeling an urgency to move things
forward, to get things done. I think you’ve seen that urgency echoed by
members on the Hill who agree that time is not unending here. And we are
eager to move forward with a unified path to deliver for the American
people.  
   
Q  Does the sense of urgency have anything to do with the President’s
trip coming up in just a matter of eight working days? Does he feel the
need to get this wrapped before he leaves?  
   
MS. PSAKI: The good news is that there are phones and video conference
capabilities overseas for every President and individuals, so I’m not
here to set new deadlines or timelines.  
   
But it is also true that we have been at this for some time. The
President proposed these plans back in the spring. We have been — he has
participated in dozens and dozens of calls, of meetings, of engagements
with members to hear their viewpoints, to understand where they’re
coming from, to reach consensus.  
   
And we are at a point where we feel an urgency to move things forward,
and the pickup of meetings is a reflection of that.  
   
Q  Just quickly, on voting rights, I just wanted to get your reaction to
the president of the NAACP, who’s on the record saying that the
administration’s lack of urgency on this issue is, quote, “appalling.”
He says that “the lack of priority on this issue… will be the undoing of
the legacy for this President.”  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say that the lack of urgency in Congress, in
the Senate among Republicans in protecting people’s fundamental right to
vote is also frustrating to the President and to this administration.  
   
The United States Senate needs to act to protect the sacred right to
vote, which is under unrelenting assault — no question. We agree with
leaders from the NAACP and other — other activists who have expressed
that concern. It’s under unprecedented assault by proponents of the Big
Lie and Republican legislatures — state legislatures across the country.
It is urgent.  
   
Senate Democrats have been working hard to draft legislation that, I
would note, includes traditionally bipartisan provisions: protecting
people’s fundamental right, making it easier and more accessible to
vote.  
   
I’d also note the President will be engaging with — in a couple of
calls, in addition to these Build Back Better calls — with members,
which we’ll provide a readout to all of you on this afternoon who —
about the voting rights legislation that will be put forward.  
   
But I would say that, right now, the question for us — and I bet you we
share this view with a number of civil rights leaders — is for Senate
Republicans and what kind of leaders they want to be. Are they going to
play a role in making it easier and more accessible to vote? Are they
going to protect this fundamental right? Or are they going to continue
to be obstreperous — to use a word the President has used in the past —
and put Democrats in a position where there’s no alternative but to find
another path forward?  
   
So, it’s really up to them. These are bipartisan proposals that have had
bipartisan support. We’re talking about people’s fundamental rights.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Does the President feel the need to mediate the current war of words
between Senators Manchin and Sanders we’ve seen play out?  
   
MS. PSAKI: To mediate the war of words? I would say the President has
been in touch with both senators — not to mediate words, but to better
understand the path forward and what is — what are priorities to each of
them. And he will continue to play that role.  
   
Q  And then, two quick ones on policy. You know, Senator Manchin has
been pretty clear about his position or opposition to a clean energy
standard for a while now, publicly. Presumably, that’s given your team
time to try and figure out workarounds to that. Does the President still
believe he can meet his emissions goals if a Clean Energy Standard or
CEPP is not in his final proposal?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, President Biden has been clear about what he supports.
A hundred percent clean power by 2035 is a goal he committed to over a
year ago, as you all know — it’s why, I think, you’re asking about it —
and he remains committed to it.  
   
The good news is there are a range of good ideas and proposals out there
from members of Congress about how this legislation can help meet that
goal. And there’s no question in our minds there’s important debating
right now happening about what the components of the climate proposals
will be in these packages; that this — these packages will have a
historic impact in addressing our climate crisis.  
   
I’d also note —  
   
Q  (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI: Can I say one more thing?  
   
Q  Yeah.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’d also note that the President also has not waited for
legislation. He has led the shift toward electric vehicles — there are
components in these packages that also will help move that forward;
phased-out super pollutants like HFCs to greatly reduce emissions; made
across-government investments in clean energy, like offshore wind and
solar; made historic commitments to use every lever at his disposal to
advance environmental justice and spur economic opportunity.  
   
So, it is absolutely pivotal that these pieces of legislation have
climate components — and they will — to address the climate crisis. But
he has also not waited for that; he’s also taken actions of his own
accord.  
   
Q  And then, one more. The — one of the critical payfors in the package
is tax enforcement. And I know you’ve discussed this a couple times in
the last couple weeks. But given the scale of the ramp-up we’ve seen
from the banking industry and opposition to the proposal you’ve laid
out, what’s the sense from the White House in terms of the pushback
against that or if they’re concerned about the future of that
proposal?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, it should not be lost on anyone that the latest
opposition to these proposals and the biggest ad spending against them
is from biggest banks who simply do not want to be bothered by
additional reporting on inflows and outflows. That should not be lost.  
   
We can certainly get you the numbers, or it’s publicly available out
there, on how much money is being spent and how vocal this opposition
is. I would note that the top 1 percent is responsible for $163 billion
a year in owed but unpaid taxes.  
   
So, this proposal we’re talking about is about preventing high-income
individuals who are not typical wage earners, meaning they don’t get
paid through standard payroll — W-2s.  
   
The vast, vast majority — I think it’s something like 97 percent — of
wage earners are paying the taxes they owe. We’re not talking about that
here. We’re talking about the highest-income individuals — 1 percent —
who are responsible for $163 billion a year in owed but unpaid taxes.  
   
There are discussions — active discussions, I would note — with Senator
Wyden and others in Congress about how to ensure this is absolutely
targeted at those who evade tax obligations, including on the cap and
potential exemptions.  
   
But let’s be clear what this is about: It’s about big banks deciding to
protect wealthiest Americans that get away with not paying the taxes
they owe by fighting this commonsense solution, and we want to be clear
about that.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Yeah, I wanted to ask you about Moderna and the, kind of, (inaudible)
that there — that exists on production levels. What is the Biden
administration doing to sort of lean on this company? And I — you know,
Kessler has talked about using the tools that are available. Are you
going to use the Defense Production Act? And how soon could that happen,
and how quickly could that get production going?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any new actions to preview for you, but what I
can — and I think what you were alluding to, but for others who didn’t
see, Dr. Kensler \[sic\] did — Kessler did not mince words in his
expression of what Moderna should be doing here, which is sharing their
know-how with other parts of the world in order to increase capacity and
production — something that we definitely support.  
   
So, the process of technology transfers, as you know, involves teaching
other — another company how to make a vaccine that takes specialized
scientists and transferring intellectual property. We absolutely want
that to happen, but my understanding is also that the U.S. government
does not have the ability to compel Moderna to take certain actions. But
it is something we support, we want to happen, and Dr. Kessler has been
quite vocal about it as well.  
   
Q  Is the President going to get involved in this discussion in any way
in terms of maybe reaching out to the CEO? You said conversations with
other CEOs, of course.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have anything to preview on that front. I think there
had been some questions, which is why I said — I mentioned that we don’t
have the legal ability to compel. That doesn’t change regardless of
who’s having the conversation, but certainly we have not — we have been
pretty crystal clear about what we’d like to see happen here.  
   
Q  And let me just follow up on that. The Defense Production Act does
give you certain tools. Have you ruled out using it in this case?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not here to announce, preview, or rule out anything, but
just to convey that our position continues to be that we would like to
see them share their know-how to address this global pandemic.  
   
Q  Can I just ask on the nominations question?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  You mentioned the economic nominees too.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  To what extent does it hurt you that you don’t have key Treasury
nominees in place to help you as you’re addressing these questions that
we’re discussing now in terms of the economic impact of the measures
that are in the legislation?  
   
MS. PSAKI: You mean in implementing measures when — once they’re passed
into law?  
   
Q  Right. I mean, you know, you don’t have the assistant secretary for
legisla- — you know, legislative affairs. You don’t —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Right.  
   
Q  You know, there are certain people for — you know, for policy. You
know, the sort of key policymakers at Treasury who would be advising
Secretary Yellen are not in place. I mean, you know, is that — does it
hurt you in your effort to move forward?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, Andrea, I think there’s no question, first, that there
are career employees in every agency, including the Department of
Treasury, who have vast experience and play vital roles at this moment
in time.  
   
It is also true that the preference of any President is to have the
individuals they’ve nominated — qualified individuals who have
unquestionable credentials — serving in these roles. That is the
preference. That does make things easier, and that is what we would like
to see moving forward.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. There is a mask requirement inside D.C. restaurants,
yet President Biden and the First Lady were not wearing masks while
walking around a D.C. restaurant on Saturday. Why?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think what you’re referring to is a photo of them
walking out of a restaurant after they had eaten, masks in hand, where
they had not yet put them back on yet.  
   
So, I would say: Of course, there are moments when we all don’t put
masks back on as quickly as we should, but I don’t think we should lose
— miss — lose the forest through the trees here in that our objective
here is to get more people vaccinated; make sure that schools and
companies around the country can put in place requirements to save more
lives and keep people safer; and, you know, not overly focus on moments
in time that don’t reflect overarching policy.  
   
Q  It was not just exiting the restaurant, though. He was walking
through the restaurant with no mask on. There is a carveout for people
under two or people who are actively eating or drinking. So I’m just
curious why the President was doing this.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think I just addressed it, Peter.  
   
Q  Okay. Why did the President break his promise not to enter into any
decisions about what cases the Justice Department should bring and not
bring?  
   
MS. PSAKI: How did he break his promise?  
   
Q  Well, he was asked if the DOJ should prosecute people who defied
January 6th committee subpoenas, and he did not say, “I will let the
Justice Department decide.” He said, “Yes.”  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, let me reiterate — and I put out a statement also on
Friday night to this — on this, where I conveyed clearly that, one, the
President continues to believe that January 6th was one of the darkest
days in our democracy. He also continues to believe that the Department
of Justice has the purview and the independence to make decisions about
prosecutions. And that is — continues to be his view, and that it
continues to be how he is — he will govern.  
   
Q  You say that that is his view, but that is not what he said.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I just conveyed what his view is, and that is also how he has
operated, how he has governed, and how he will continue to govern. And I
think that’s what’s important for people to watch.  
   
Q  So then what’s changed since last year when he said, “I will not do
what this President” — former President Trump — “does and use the
Justice Department as my vehicle to insist that something happened”?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, since you give me the opportunity here, President —
former President Trump used his office to incite an insurrection. He put
political pressure on senior DOJ officials to propagate lies about the
election to the point where they threatened to resign en masse. I think
there’s hardly a comparison there.  
   
Q  But the — he said — President Biden said, “The Justice Department in
my administration will be totally independent of me.” And he said he
would not enter into any decision about what cases the agency would
bring and not bring. How is that not exactly —  
   
MS. PSAKI: And he — and he has not —  
   
Q  — what he’s doing?  
   
MS. PSAKI: — and he will not. And criminal prosecutions —  
   
Q  Somebody asked him about prosecutions and he said —  
   
MS. PSAKI: — are their sole purview.  
   
Q  — he wants it to happen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Criminal prosecutions are the sole purview of the Department
of Justice. That is the President’s position. That is what he’ll — he
nominated the Attorney General to operate under. That is exactly what
the Attorney General is doing. And those are the actions that people can
watch from this administration.  
   
Q  As the public reflects on the life of Colin Powell and his public
service, people are also now aware that he had a breakthrough case of
COVID in addition to cancer and had some vulnerabilities. Because he was
fully vaccinated and got COVID that took his life, any concerns about
how that will be interpreted publicly? Or how does that affect the
message from the White House about the importance of vaccinations?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, as people saw in the statement issued by the President
— a very personal statement about his personal relationship — this is
obviously a heartbreaking tragedy for the country and one the President
is feeling personally.  
   
There are extremely rare cases of deaths or hospitalizations among fully
vaccinated individuals. That has been the case even before the death of
Colin Powell, especially among people — older people over a certain age
and people who have underlying health issues or people who are battling
other diseases. That has been the case.  
   
It is also the case — and this is important for people to know and
understand — that there — who are concerned — that an unvaccinated
person has a more than 10 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19
compared to a fully vaccinated person. So there’s no question that
vaccination, that taking precautions can save lives. It is — and it is
still true. And this raised that — certainly the death of Colin Powell —
that underlying health issues, fighting other diseases is something that
can lead to greater risk.  
   
Q  And the administration, on issue of the Texas abortion law, is
seeking a redress from the U.S. Supreme Court. Can you speak to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, as we’ve spoken to a few times, including in statements
from the President, he continues to believe that Roe v. Wade is — should
be — is the law of the land. He supports efforts to codify Roe v. Wade,
and he is going to fight efforts — obviously, the Department of Justice
will be in the lead on that — against efforts to prevent women from
having access to fundamental rights that they should have to protect
their own health and make decisions about their own health.  
   
Go ahead, Weijia.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. Just a couple of follow-ups and then —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  — a couple of questions on Haiti. Is there anything you can share
about the President’s last interaction with General Powell, whether they
spoke on the phone, in person?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah. That’s a good question, Weijia. Let me — I — I didn’t —
I should have asked that question; I haven’t. So let me see if I can get
some more color for all of you on that.  
   
Q  Thank you. And then, to follow up on what Peter was asking: Just to
be clear, does the President believe people who defy subpoenas should be
criminally prosecuted or not?  
   
MS. PSAKI: It’s up to the purview of the Department of Justice to make
that decision.  
   
Q  Okay. When he was asked that very question on Friday, he said yes.
Did he — does he stand by that answer?  
   
MS. PSAKI: He believes it’s an independent decision that should be made
by the Department of Justice, and they’ll make that decision.  
   
Q  Okay. And then, on Haiti, is the President considering sending in the
U.S. military to help rescue the Americans who were kidnapped?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I would really point you at the Department of Defense to
speak to that and to my colleague over there, John Kirby.  
   
But again, where our efforts right now are focused are with officials on
the ground, including from the FBI, working closely with our diplomatic
team and the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, who’s coordinating with
local authorities, providing assistance to the families, and also
working to get the U.S. citizens involved to safety.  
   
But I don’t have any additional details at this point.  
   
Q  And then just —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Oh, go ahead.  
   
Q  — given the kidnappings, will the administration reconsider using
Title 42 specifically to deport Haitians, given that it illustrates how
dangerous the situation is there?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think there’s a couple of things to unpack here that
are very important for people to understand.  
   
One, Title 42 is used — as you know, but just for everybody — across the
board, no matter what country you’re coming from. There are about 90,000
people who — where Title 42 was applied in August. The vast, vast, vast
overwhelming majority of those people were not from Haiti. But we apply
Title 42, because we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, across the
board.  
   
I would say that, in this case, one thing to note is that we know that
the efforts to kidnap people, to seek ransom are prominent in places
like Haiti — not the only place — but they are targeted toward U.S.
citizens, people who are presumed to have the funding and ability to pay
those ransoms.  
   
That’s one of the reasons why we put out — the State Department put out
a warning in August. It’s something we have seen rise since 2019. But
that is a different issue than sending people of Haitian origin back to
Haiti and something that’s evaluated at TPS — it’s not what you asked
about — but something that’s evaluated by the Department of Homeland
Security and the State Department.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.

Q  Thanks. I wanted to ask about another marker that Senator Manchin has
kind of put out, which is that he wants to cap the Child Tax Credit to
families making under $60,000 a year and add a work requirement.  
   
I know that you’ve said previously that the White House is okay with
some means testing of these programs and you don’t want to negotiate
from the podium. That being said, this represents what would be a pretty
dramatic scaling back of what’s been a signature part of the President’s
legislative accomplishments so far and something that he and the Vice
President have touted pretty publicly.  
   
So, to echo Phil’s question on climate in some way: Is this within the
realm of possibility? How do you guys react to Senator Manchin kind of
throwing down this marker?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I’m not going to react directly to Senator Manchin’s
point of view because that’s not particularly advantageous at this point
in the negotiations.  
   
But I will say the President proposed an extension in the Child Tax
Credit because he feels that it is something that can not only help
families make ends meet, it can help bring more women back into the
workforce, and it is a vital part of his proposed packages.  
   
He has also, in the past, supported and continues to be open to
supporting what can be called “means testing” or can be called “caps on
income.” And there are ranges of — a range being discussed, but I’m not
going to speak to it further than that.  
   
Q  OPEC failed to meet its output targets for September. You have sort
of spoken about, with some amount of pride, that the White House was
able to get those enhanced production levels, and now we’re seeing that
they’re not hitting them. I know that you’re not a member of OPEC, but
we also know —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Not me personally and not the United States. Neither one.  
   
Q  Either. (Laughter.) Unless you have vast oil reserves that we’re not
aware of. (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI: No. That would be a very interesting part of my bio.
(Laughter.) I’m not.  
   
Q  But the U.S. obviously can exert —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  — sort of major influence here. So, with having missed this mark, are
you trying to do more? Can you do more?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We are continuing to press, through member countries — member
countries of OPEC, even as we are not a member — to address the supply
issue and work to address it here as well.  
   
I would also note that what we’re also working to address is more of a
logistics issue of how we are moving supply around the country, which
means there are shortages in some places and not others, and that’s
something that we are also working to address.  
   
We are certainly well aware of the impact on any increase in gasoline
prices or any costs on the American people, and we’re going to use —
continue to use every lever at our disposal.  
   
It is not a short-term option, of course, but I’d also remind everyone
that we — that our NEC director sent a letter to the FTC about looking
into price gouging, something that we will continue to press — or
they’ve said they would take up and they will — they will, of course, be
the lead on that, but that’s something we also watch closely.  
   
Q  And just a last quick one: Can you kind of flesh out the thinking
behind the President’s travel schedule? I mean, not to dismiss the great
state of Connecticut or even Scranton — a place that obviously holds
some nostalgic value for the President — but you’ve been pretty clear
that the sticking points at this point are West Virginia and Arizona. We
saw it play out with Bernie Sanders that Joe Manchin doesn’t necessarily
like people coming into West Virginia and telling them what they think
that they should do.  
   
But why doesn’t the President focus more of his attention on those
states, particularly with his travels, as he tries to make the case for
his agenda?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, as you’ve watched the President’s travel, what he’s
trying to do — it is that we are in a national media environment, I
would say; we do have a press pool made up of many of you, who come with
us to Connecticut or Pennsylvania, who can raise and elevate the issues
that the President is talking about and why they’re of importance to the
American people, and raise questions, of course, as you want to raise
them.  
   
So, the President had planned, of course, to go to recognize the
incredible service of his longtime friend, former Senator Chris Dodd,
and the opening of a center at the University of Connecticut, and also
felt it was an opportunity to elevate the issue of childcare and the
issue of the shortage of childcare centers, the cost of childcare.  
   
And that’s something — yes, it applies to people in Connecticut, where
people are paying 25 percent of their income on childcare, a much higher
percentage than people should be paying. But that is something that
parents and communities can relate to across the country, whether or not
it’s a swing state, or whether or not it’s a state where votes are
questioned.  
   
And Pennsylvania is certainly a state, as you know, close to the
President’s heart, but one where he has the opportunity to elevate some
components of his Build Back Better Agenda, of the infrastructure
package, to explain to the public why these are important issues he’s
fighting for.  
   
So, it’s — I think it’s all through the prism of what’s most
constructive, but we recognize people like what’s in there, they don’t
know what’s in there, and he’s going to be out there doing more of it.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Sort of a broad thematic question. You’ve spoken of the urgency the
President feels toward his Build Back Better Agenda and voting rights.
To people in the country who believe that the administration is not
strongly enough pushing for immigration reform, what’s this White
House’s message to those people who are now directing their criticism
toward the President directly and saying he’s responsible for the fact
that, nine months in, we haven’t seen action on these matters? And how
does the President internalize that criticism? Does he feel it’s
misdirected towards him?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, look, the President knows that when you’re President of
the United States and you’re sitting behind the — sitting in the Oval
Office, behind the Resolute Desk or whatever desk you choose, that the
buck stops with you.  
   
He also knows, having served 36 years in the Senate, that you need
partnership in Congress to get bills passed, and that’s the only way to
make permanent change happen.  
   
So, while he has taken action — executive actions — in a lot of these
areas to put in place positive change — whether it’s voting rights,
whether it’s doing more to have a more humane immigration system — in
order to have fundamental change that is going to make people’s lives
better, that is going to fix broken systems, you need Congress to act.
That’s how our system is set up, historically.  
   
We’ve seen on immigration, of course, two attempts to move things
through the parliamentarian. The President’s support in legislation,
support — has supported those efforts, and he’s going to continue to
work with Congress to get that done.  
   
And on voting rights — again, I’d reiterate what I said a few minutes
ago: You know, the President is going to be engaged with Democrats and a
range of members about the vote that’s happening this week. It is
something he believes is a fundamental right. And his view is this
question is really now on Republicans and what part — role they’re going
to play in history. And that’s what he would tell people.  
   
Q  But I guess my question is: Does he feel that the criticism of him is
unfair?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t think he has the luxury of analyzing the fairness or
unfairness of criticism.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks. I know that we mentioned climate earlier — talked about
climate earlier. I was wondering, though, when it comes to the Clean
Energy Performance Plan, if that is not in this — in the Build Back
Better plan reconciliation bill — if that is not in there, how can the
U.S. meet the climate goals that the President has set out?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I’m not going to speculate what’s in or out as the
negotiations are continuing. What I alluded to earlier is the fact that
there are a range of climate ideas and proposals that are out there,
both from what the President has proposed and also other ideas proposed
by members of Congress — Democrats in Congress — about how to help
address the climate crisis.  
   
And there’s no question that whatever lands in the bill, it will be a
historic — have a historic impact in addressing the climate crisis.  
   
But I also touched on a number of the steps that he’s taken through his
own executive actions and leadership to address the climate crisis. And
we are — we remain confident about our ability to meet the goal.  
   
Q  And, I guess, so, this White House feels like — and I’m not — I
understand you can’t say what’s in or out of the bill, but you feel like
you can meet your climate goals without a clean energy plan for power.
You feel like that is possible. And can you explain how that would be
done?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Again, there’s a range of proposals out there. As these
proposals move forward, we’ll have — continue to have a discussion about
this. But we are confident that this pa- — these packages will have an
enormous impact on addressing the climate crisis.  
   
There are a range of ideas out there that have a great deal of support
in Congress to do exactly that, and there are also a range — but I’m not
going to outline those from here while these negotiations are ongoing.
But we remain confident in our ability to reach our goal.  
   
Q  Can I ask you just quickly, like when it comes to the idea of the
means testing — you know, talking to a lot of experts on inequity and
economic inequality, one of the concerns that they have with means
testing is that you could lock in some of this inequality that the White
House has said it is so concerned about, and that they feel like means
testing really can lock out people who really need help and really not
allow the changes that this White House has said are needed.  
   
How does the White House respond to that when people say that means
testing is not the way to deal with these type of economic inequalities
and inequities?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, means testing, I think, always has a bad connotation.
And what we’re really talking about here is a cap on income. So, we’re
talking about targeting and focusing the President’s proposals, in some
areas, on people who need help the most, under a certain income, and not
providing this aid, assistance — whatever it may be — to people who are
in higher income brackets, who may not need that assistance.  
   
So, it is actually about protecting, saving, ensuring that assistance
and that tax cuts and that, you know, a little bit more breathing room
is given to the people who need it and not the people who need it
less.  
   
Q  But does that put more administrative burden on how these programs
are implemented when you do means testing?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not sure what you mean by that.  
   
Q  Administrative burden at — in that you have to prove —  
   
MS. PSAKI: On whom?  
   
Q  People have to prove that they don’t make money or that they don’t
make enough money, or they have to prove that they’re working, et
cetera. So that puts a burden on those who people have to make those —  
   
MS. PSAKI: But we’re talking about people filing taxes — and it’s based
on what their income is typically. That’s something they would already
do.  
   
And they ben- — would benefit from a range of programs, as they already
have since the President took office — whether it’s the Child Tax
Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, other proposals that — we’re talking
about targeting it at the people who need help the most — not additional
proof, but targeting it at certain income levels.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. Just two quick questions. The first: You had alluded
a minute ago to the press pool traveling with the President to
Connecticut and, later this week, Scranton.  
   
In a week and a half, he’s going to the Vatican. And I wonder if the
White House can commit to that meeting with the Pope, which is a
historic meeting, being public or that the press pool will have access
to that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would first say that when we visit another country,
often it is the conditions or the — of what that country or what that
entity proposes. And we always work for more access. We always fight for
more access as we travel around the world, as you know.  
   
In terms of the specific press access for the Vatican, I don’t have any
updates for you on that.  
   
Q  Okay. And secondly, there’s been a couple questions from my
colleagues about Senator Manchin and markers that he has laid down,
which he has done publicly.  
   
Senator Sinema, who is also a crucial person in this dialogue, has done
—  
   
MS. PSAKI: All members are crucial, I think they’d argue.  
   
Q  Sure. She’s done a little bit less of that publicly.  
   
There’s been some consternation as to what her wishes and demands are in
this. Does the White House have a good understanding of that? And if so,
is it sharing that with congressional Democrats?  
   
MS. PSAKI: There are a range of conversations happening behind the
scenes. I’ll let these senators outline their proposals, what they
support and don’t support, themselves.  
   
Q  But on the White House side, do you guys know what she’s wanting to
be in or out of the bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Again, we’ll let them all speak for themselves. I’m not going
to confirm or give more details from here on their positions.  
   
Q  So, DHS announced that they’re bolstering their intelligence to
better gather information to monitor and predict migrants coming from
South America and Central America. Why is this happening now? And why
wasn’t it in place already? It’s — you know, this is something —  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not actually sure what you’re referring to. I’d have to
dig into it further. Is it a specific program or —  
   
Q  Um, yeah — so, NBC News reported earlier today that, you know,
they’re building an intelligence-gathering, sort of, cell, which DHS has
confirmed to me as well that they are doing, and — you know, to help
better monitor and predict migrants that are coming that could help DHS
get resources to the border if they see migrants coming.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.  
   
Q  You know, it could also help with messaging to combat whatever
messaging that is happening in that country. I guess, what kind of
spurred that? And what are the goals for that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think the Department of Homeland Security would really have
all the details on this. I’m happy to check with them or connect you
with the right person over there for more details, but it’s really under
their purview.  
   
Q  And one question —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  I guess, with this kind of bolstering of intelligence — especially,
you know, in South America, where we saw many of the Haitian migrants
coming from — I guess, how does this affect, you know, the White House,
the Biden administration’s goal to address root causes, which has been
mostly focused in Central America?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, let me take — let me get more details on this exact
program, and we can talk more about it tomorrow or offline or what have
you. And I can connect you to someone at DHS, too.  
   
Q  Okay. Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, Karen.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. The President was asked Friday night by ABC if he
supported term limits for the Supreme Court, and he said, “No.” He has
said that before. He talked about that during the campaign season. But
that appears to be the area in that draft report materials last week
that has, you know, agreement — bipartisan agreement. Why is he ruling
that out now before getting the final report in a couple weeks?  
   
MS. PSAKI: As you know, he hasn’t reviewed the final report, which,
again, is an assessment; it’s not recommendations. Obviously, you all
have seen the draft out there, and there was a public — a public meeting
on Friday to discuss.  
   
So, I think it’s more a reflection that his position hasn’t changed; he
hasn’t reviewed the report yet. And I’m sure when he does, we’ll have
more to say.  
   
Q  But if he’s indicating publicly now that he doesn’t support — he said
just, “No”; a one-word answer — that he doesn’t support the proposal
that does have the most widespread and bipartisan support, as stated by
that committee, is the takeaway now that any changes to the Court are
not likely to happen?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think the takeaway should be he hasn’t reviewed the report
or the assessment from the Supreme Court committee, and that is
consistent with what his position has been in the past.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. Does the White House have any reaction to a report of
two airstrikes today on Tigray in Northern Ethiopia?  
   
And also, last week, the President received the first African leader at
the White House: the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta. What was — what
were the major achievements? And who is the next African to visit the
White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I know the President enjoyed his meeting with President
Kenyatta. We made a significant announcement as it relates COVID
vaccines that we are going to be donating to Africa and the African
Union through the course of that meeting.  
   
I don’t have anything to preview in terms of a next meeting.  
   
Go ahead, Francesca.  
   
Q  Do you have any reaction to the airstrike on Ethiopia?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I will get you something after the briefing.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. I have a couple for you.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  So, another comment the President made on Friday was that he was
convinced that the spending legislation was going to get done, but
they’re not going to get the $3.5 trillion. “We’ll get less than that,
but we’re going to get it.” And then he said, “And we’re going to come
back and get the rest.” End quote.  
   
What did he mean by “we’re going to come back and get the rest”? Does he
mean another reconciliation bill next year? What did he mean by that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: He wasn’t giving a — predicting a legislative vehicle. I
think what he was conveying is: We all know this is less than $3.5
\[trillion\]. There are discussions and negotiations in Congress about
what that will look like. And things that are not included in here, he
will continue to fight for in the future.  
   
Q  Okay. And you mentioned a bunch of meetings that the President is
having —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  — virtual or calls.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  We saw him go up to Capitol Hill. Has he given any consideration to
Terry McAuliffe’s recommendation that you just sit all of the leading
lawmakers in a room and say, “You can’t leave until you get a deal
done”?  
   
MS. PSAKI: He’s — the President has been doing this a while — 36 years
in the Senate — with all due respect for the recommendations of anyone
outside. And he’s going to continue to work with Democratic leadership
about having the kinds of meetings and engagements that will help move
this across the finish line.  
   
Q  And lastly, on his schedule, do you expect that he will campaign in
Virginia for Terry McAuliffe before he leaves for Europe this month?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any scheduling updates today.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. Two questions. Your administration has said multiple
times that its commitment to Taiwan is rock solid.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.  
   
Q  So, given this rock-solid commitment, what is the President’s stance
on letting the Taiwan Mission here officially change its name to the
Taiwan Representative Office?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I would point you to the State Department.  
   
Q  And just one more. Rahm Emanuel’s confirmation hearing to be the next
U.S. Ambassador to Japan is Wednesday. If confirmed, what is the
President hoping that Rahm Emanuel will bring to the table when it comes
to strengthening U.S.-Japan ties?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think he’s hoping that he will bring his commitment to
public service and broad experience in policymaking to have a strong
position in Japan from the United States.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. You were asked earlier in the briefing about whether
this urgency to get to a deal was driven by the President’s travel
schedule. I want to go at it from a different way —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  — because there is sort of one — at least one real deadline, October
31st, as it relates to the surface transportation bill that’s been a
sort of informal marker for leadership.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.  
   
Q  Can you rule out that the President would cancel or postpone the trip
if it’s necessary to have — if there are votes scheduled around that
time, in order to work the vote?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think you can all fully plan for the President to be
traveling to Rome and Glasgow on his scheduled trip.  
   
Q  Has he given any direction to congressional leadership — because he
would want to be, presumably, here for a vote — to schedule any votes
accordingly to try get it done before his departure or to wait until
afterward?  
   
MS. PSAKI: There are a range of ways to sign legislation into law even
if the President is not here.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Thanks, everyone.
