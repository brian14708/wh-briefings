title: Background Press Call on the Virtual Counter-Ransomware Initiative Meeting
---
 
Via Teleconference

(October 12, 2021)

12:31 P.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR: Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining. We’re going to
be discussing today the virtual Counter-Ransomware Initiative meetings
that are being facilitated by the White House National Security Council
this Wednesday and Thursday.  
   
The call will be on background, attributable to “senior administration
officials,” and the contents will be embargoed until tomorrow,
Wednesday, October 13th, 5:00 a.m. Eastern.  
   
For your awareness and not for reporting, joining us is \[senior
administration official\]. \[Senior administration official\] will give
some brief remarks at the top, and then we’re going to turn it over to
your questions.  
   
With that, I’ll turn it over to \[senior administration official\].  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you so much. Good afternoon,
everybody. Thank you for joining us today.  
   
So, I wanted to give a brief preview of the virtual Counter-Ransomware
Initiative meeting taking place at the White House tomorrow and
Thursday.  
   
The initiative builds on President Biden’s leadership to rally allies
and partners to counter the shared threat of ransomware. It builds on
our own domestic efforts as well — significant efforts, as you saw, on
the recent Treasury designation and other efforts we have underway.  
   
But focusing on President Biden’s international efforts: In June, the
President and G7 leaders agreed on the importance of the international
community working together to ensure that critical infrastructure is
resilient against this threat, that malicious cyberactivity is
investigated and prosecuted, and that we bolster our collective cyber
defenses. In addition, noting that states address the criminal activity
taking place from within their borders.  
   
At NATO, President Biden and leaders endorsed a new cyber defense policy
to ensure the NATO Alliance is resilient against malicious cyberactivity
perpetrated by state and non-state actors, including disruptive
ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure.  
   
And finally, as you know, we’ve worked with allies and partners to hold
nation-states accountable for malicious cyberactivity as evidenced by,
really, the broadest international support we had ever in our
attributions for Russia and China’s malicious cyber activities in the
last few months.  
   
So, now onto tomorrow and Thursday’s meeting specifically. So, we’re
hosting — we’re facilitating a virtual meeting. It’ll be joined by
ministers and senior officials from over 30 countries and the European
Union to accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware.  
   
The Counter-Ransomware Initiative will meet over two days, and
participants will cover everything from efforts to improve national
resilience, to experiences addressing the misuse of virtual currency to
launder ransom payments, our respective efforts to disrupt and prosecute
ransomware criminals, and diplomacy as a tool to counter ransomware.  
   
The work is organized in six sessions. The first meeting is a plenary
and is open to press and observers. All the subsequent discussions are
restricted to invited participants to allow for frank, open dialogue.  
   
We expect participants will speak to four areas in greater detail. And
those are, as I mentioned, national resilience, countering illicit
finance, disruption and other law enforcement efforts, and diplomacy.  
   
I should note two things: While the United States is facilitating this
meeting, we don’t view this solely as a U.S. initiative. Indeed, we’re
leading internationally — bringing other countries together.  
   
Many governments have been indispensable in organizing the meeting, and
four countries in particular have volunteered to lead and organize
specific thematic discussions: India for resilience, Australia for
disruption, the UK for virtual currency, and Germany for diplomacy.  
   
In addition, I want to note that we see this meeting as the first of
many conversations among the international partners participating this
week and beyond.  
   
We’ll have more to say on Thursday regarding takeaways from the
discussions, but I want to give a brief laydown of U.S. ransomware
efforts — a four-part strategy that we have here, run by the White
House, to coordinate a whole-of-government effort.  
   
First: disrupt ransomware infrastructure and actors. We’re bringing the
full weight of U.S. government capabilities to disrupt ransomware
actors, networks, financial infrastructure, and other facilitators. Some
examples that I can share publicly were, as I noted, DOJ recovering
colonial ransom and Treasury’s SUEX designation recently.  
   
The second part of our strategy: bolstering resilience to withstand
ransomware attacks. Even as we work to disrupt criminal ransomware
networks, we also have to address our own vulnerabilities so we’re not
easy targets. Some examples of what the government has done: the ICS
initiative focusing on control systems and TSA’s recent security
directives mandating cybersecurity across pipelines and other
transportation networks.  
   
You also recall \[our\] letter, where \[we\] called on the private
sector to step up and do their part independently to modernize their
defenses and invest to ensure the resilience of their networks is
adequate to meet the threat.  
   
Third, we’re addressing the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom
payments. We’re leveraging existing and acquiring new capabilities to
trace and interdict ransomware proceeds.  
   
Finally, leveraging international cooperation to disrupt the ransomware
ecosystem and address safe harbors for ransomware criminals.  
   
And really, this event over the next two days is exhibit A of how we’re
working with international partners to disrupt ransomware networks, to
improve partner capacity for detecting and responding to such activity
within their own borders, including imposing consequences on the
perpetrators, and holding accountable states that allow criminals to
operate from within their jurisdictions.  
   
So, with that, I’ll take your questions.  
   
Q  Thank you for hosting this call. Can you tell us what the 30
countries are and also what you are hoping to get out of this two-day
meeting by the end of Thursday? Any particular agreement or deliverable?
Anything specific or concrete?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Absolutely. So, first, we’ll be joined
by ministers and representatives from the following countries:
Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic,
Estonia, the EU, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,
Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland,
the Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden,
Switzerland, Ukraine, the UAE, and the UK.  
   
And I think that list of countries highlights just how pernicious and
transnational and global the ransomware threat has been in the different
countries from all different parts of the world who will be
participating.  
   
And to your point regarding concrete: Absolutely, I won’t preview it at
this time. There’s been a lot of very good preparatory discussions,
particularly around the four panels I mentioned to you. I’ll be hosting
the final plenary, which is when we’ll summarize the discussions in the
four panels and outline very key next steps. And we’ll be happy to
discuss that more on Thursday, following the event.  
   
Q  Hi, thanks for doing the call. One question I had was that Victoria
Nuland, the senior State Department official, is in Russia this week to
meet with her Russian counterparts, and I’m wondering if cybersecurity,
and particularly the administration’s message on cracking down on
ransomware groups within Russia, is a message that she’s delivered and
has been received by the Russians.  
   
And then, secondly, I wonder if you can address the elephant in the room
in that Russia not being part of these talks, for a number of reasons —
but how are you going to lean on U.S. allies and countries that are more
in Russia’s neighborhood to try to crack down on cyber criminals that
may be in that region? Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. So, yes, Toria is traveling, and
cybersecurity is always one of the topics we engage with
internationally. I won’t go into more details regarding our discussions,
as, you know, diplomacy is always best done in private.  
   
With regard to the countries who are participating, there’s a host of
reasons that, you know, particular countries were invited to
participate, including scheduling restrictions, availability of
partners, and logistical considerations.  
   
But most importantly, this is not our first international engagement; it
won’t be our last. And the countries that are participating are not our
only valued partners. We look forward to future engagements and
collaboration with these and other countries as we expand and accelerate
cooperation on this important topic.  
   
We will continue to lead in this area, and we will continue to lead
internationally in this area.  
   
And then, with regard to Russia: So, I think, as you know, the
U.S.-Kremlin Experts Group, which is led by the White House, was
established by President Biden and President Putin, so the U.S. engages
directly with Russia on this — on the issue of ransomware. The President
has been very clear about marshaling the resources of all the
departments and agencies to counter ransomware and address the four-part
strategy I talked about.  
   
We do look to the Russian government to address ransomware criminal
activity coming from actors within Russia. I can report that we’ve had,
in the Experts Group, frank and professional exchanges in which we’ve
communicated those expectations. We’ve also shared information with
Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from its
territory.  
   
We’ve seen some steps by the Russian government and are looking to see
follow-up actions. And broader international cooperation is an important
line of effort because these are transnational criminal organizations
and they leverage global infrastructure money laundering networks to
carry out their attacks.  
   
So, working with our international partners is also something we are
doing in parallel to our diplomatic efforts to ensure we can disrupt the
ransomware ecosystem, the actors, and the, frankly, illicit use of
virtual currency that really drives this — drives the growth of
ransomware.  
   
Q  Hey, thanks for doing this. One simple logistical one and then one
follow-up one on (inaudible).  
   
First of all, what’s the format for the call? You know, is it Zoom? Is
it Microsoft Teams? Is there a special, you know, international
government tool that we’ve never heard of?  
   
And then, secondly, I just want to clarify the invitation process here.
You’re saying Russia was not invited to be part of the U.S.’s — this
initial summit because there’s this other kind of channel open with
Russia — do I understand that correctly?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, first, I won’t speak — I’m not going
to speak to the logistical way we’re going do it. It’s a routine
commercial technology that’s bringing individuals together.  
   
And as I said, a host of factors went into the planning of a virtual,
international meeting of this size to include scheduling restrictions,
availability of partners, and logistical considerations. And there will
be opportunities for other groups of partners to join us as well.  
     
The headline, folks, should really be around U.S. government leading and
bringing countries together to fight ransomware effectively.  
   
And as you can imagine, with as many time zones and the complexity of
bringing this many countries together, some could, some couldn’t play.
The important part is that we’re starting on this journey, really
building on the work that the President previously did in the G7 and at
NATO.  
   
Q  Hi. Thank you for doing the call. So, first, just as a clarification,
you said, “We’ve seen some steps by the Russian government. We’re
looking to see follow-up actions.” Can you just identify what those
steps were that you’re referring to?  
   
And then, secondly, we’ve talked about Russia, but North Korea is
obviously a big player in ransomware just to support the operations of
their government. And if Russia is at least nominally, you know,
susceptible to various geopolitical pressure as part of the
international economic system, North Korea is really, really much less
susceptible — I think most people would agree. So, can you talk about
how this meeting fits into your strategy for applying pressure on North
Korea, which obviously has different incentives and motivations here
than Russia?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks. On the first part, I won’t go
into more detail on the initial steps that we’ve seen taken. I noted
that we’ve had very candid and direct discussions. And in the context of
those discussions, we’ve seen those steps by the Russian government, and
we’re looking to see follow-up actions.  
   
With regard to North Korea, you’re making a really excellent — and I
also just, you know, would note, to the point on that, that we initially
— sorry, I just — there was a key point I wanted to note to you — that,
you know, ransomware focuses on our citizens and businesses, and as a
result, the best insights regarding ransomware attacks often comes from
private sector entities who monitor public and private networks.  
   
So, I just want to flag, you know, a recent kind of note and tweet that
a respected private sector entity — Kevin Mandia of FireEye — did, where
he noted a lull from several high-profile actors and a reduction in
activities in some of the most impactful ransomware groups they’ve
responded to in the last — you know, in the last few months.  
   
We won’t speculate from here why that is, but I just did want to flag
that as we’re watching that closely as we continue to execute the
administration’s counter-ransomware strategy.  
   
And to your question on North Korea, that is why we’re putting such a
focus on the four-part strategy I talked about, right? Because while we
can work to try to shape actors — you know, as you’ve said, North Korea
is famously difficult in that way — what we do control is ourselves.  
   
So, that is why we have, A, called on the private sector to make the
investments to improve cybersecurity. The President announced in his
executive order that the federal government will actually start
practicing what we preach in making significant improvements in our own
cybersecurity. We’ve put a real focus on disrupting ransomware actors
and networks, whether that’s the work coming out of DOJ, whether that’s
the work of Treasury with the first-ever designation.  
   
A huge amount of work went into that first-ever designation because
virtual currency is a new area, and the very strong anti-money
laundering and other rules that we have in place globally on fiat
currencies are not yet in place all around the world.  
   
So, we really are in our own way both saying we’re going to enforce
these and work with partners around the world on that, as well as, as I
noted, you know, leverage international cooperation to disrupt the
ransomware ecosystem, as in this case — right? — facilitating a meeting
with 32 other countries to discuss these four areas to really coordinate
our fight against ransomware.  
   
Q  Thank you so much \[senior administration official\]. So — sorry, did
you say that Russia was indeed invited at least, but they just were not
able to make it this time?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Russia is not participating at this
time, but we have a separate channel in which we’re actively discussing
ransomware with Russia.  
   
Q  Hey, good afternoon. Sorry, \[senior administration official\], just
to clarify: I understand that Russia isn’t participating, but can you
definitively say whether they’re invited or not to participate?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: In this first round of discussions, we
did not invite the Russians to participate for a host of reasons,
including various constraints. However, as I noted, we are having active
discussions with the Russians. But in this particular forum, they were
not invited to participate, but that doesn’t preclude future
opportunities for them to participate as we do further sessions like
these.  
   
Q  Sure. One quick follow-up, if I may. Do you see a long-term
successful strategy to combat ransomware coming out of these sessions if
the Russian government doesn’t participate in the future, or does it
require their involvement, do you think?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, two-part. One is: I am very hopeful
and really excited about this international coalition work.  
   
I can honestly say, as we started extending invitations and as we’ve
talked to — as I’ve talked with my counterparts around the world; as my
amazing team, who pulled this event together, has talked to their
counterparts around the world, the eagerness to participate, the
eagerness to learn, the eagerness to help other countries build capacity
in areas like virtual currency tracing and areas like disruption to
share information around law enforcement, intelligence, financial
facilitators has just been huge.  
   
Everybody has been suffering from ransomware, and I just — I’m really
excited about what this will kick off. And I’m really excited about, as
I noted — right? — the four countries who raised their hand and said,
“We want to lead panels.”  
   
It’s often that you have — you know, people have good ideas; it’s less
often that folks raise their hand and say, “I really believe in this; I
want to lead.”  
   
So, truly exciting, and I look forward to sharing with you all on
Thursday, you know, more details on, as Ellen asked early on, next
steps.  
   
To your point: Clearly, you know, there are — Russia plays a role
because of a number of criminal actors who are, you know, operating from
Russia. And that is the reason that President Biden established with his
counterpart — with President Putin — a dedicated channel for us to have
very focused and candid discussions. And that’s why I noted to you that
we’ve had several and they continue.  
   
And we’ve shared information regarding specific criminal actors within
Russia, and Russia has taken initial steps. So, we are seeing and we
will look to see follow-on in that area as well.  
   
MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. With that, that was our last question.
If we did not get to your question, please feel free to reach out to me
directly, and we’ll make sure to get back to you.  
   
As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to “senior
administration officials.” And the contents of the call are embargoed
until tomorrow, Wednesday, October 13th, 5:00 a.m. Eastern.  
   
Thanks, everyone, for your time. Bye.
