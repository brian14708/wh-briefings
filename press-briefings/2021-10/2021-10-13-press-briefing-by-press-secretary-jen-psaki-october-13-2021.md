1:35 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. Okay. All right. Just a few items at the top,
and I have a bit of a hard out shortly after 2:00. I’m — I’ll be
upstairs for people who have follow-up questions, but we’ll try to get
to as many as possible.  
   
So, I just wanted to recap just a few of the announcements made today on
supply chains. It’s a huge announcement, so I wanted to make sure
everybody was following it very closely.  
   
Thanks to the President’s executive order in February, the launch of the
Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force in June, and the appointment of a
dedicated port envoy in August, public and private sector leaders took
another important step in coming together today to speed up the shipment
of goods throughout the country by moving towards 24/7 operations.  
   
Today, the Port of Los Angeles is expanding to 24/7 operations, which
means it has nearly doubled the hours that cargo will be able to move
out of its docks. This follows the same commitment from the Port of Long
Beach a few weeks ago.  
   
The International Longshore and Warehouse Union has announced its
members will work those extra shifts, adding needed capacity to clear
existing backlogs.  
   
Large companies are announcing they will use those expanded hours to
move more cargo off the docks so ships can come to shore faster.
Walmart, UPS, FedEx, Samsung, Home Depot, and Target are using more
off-peak and nighttime hours to increase throughput.  
   
These commitments will move more goods faster, including toys — just in
case you were wondering — appliances — my kids are — and furniture that
Americans purchased online or at their local small businesses and parts
that are sent to U.S. factories for our workers to assemble into
products, which will strengthen the resiliency of our supply chains.  
   
It was inevitable, as we’ve talked about a bit in here, that our — a lot
our economic challenges — that there would be economic challenges coming
out of the pandemic. That is why President Biden has been just as
focused on this as he has on the other challenges which he addressed in
the American Rescue Plan.  
   
These commitments are critical. And, obviously, we’re going to continue
to build on it from here.  
   
I also wanted to note that, earlier today, the President Biden signed
H.R. 2278, a bill which gives federal designation to the 1,300-mile
September 11th National Memorial Trail. The multi-use trail symbolizes
resiliency and character while linking the World Trade Center, the
Pentagon, and the Flight 93 Memorial.  
   
As the bill notes, this is “a trail of remembrance to honor the fallen”
and “keep their memories alive,” and is “a celebration of our nation’s
resilience and perseverance since September 11th.”  
   
Finally, I wanted to note that the FDA issued guidance for the food
industry that provides voluntary, short-term sodium reduction targets in
a wide variety of processed, packaged, and restaurant foods.  
   
On average, Americans consume 50 percent more sodium than recommended,
which is linked to high blood pressure and increased risk of heart
disease and stroke. And we believe that today’s action will lead to a 12
percent reduction in average sodium intake over the next two and a half
years, making this a critical step forward.  
   
Josh, why don’t you kick us off?  
   
Q  Great. Thanks, Jen. Two quick subjects. First, with today’s consumer
prices report and President Biden’s pending choice about leadership at
the Federal Reserve, how patient is this administration with inflation
consistently running above the Fed’s 2 percent target?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, as you know, Josh, from following this closely, we
obviously defer to the Federal Reserve and their projections and
official targets, which they make regularly.  
   
I would note that we’ve seen a decrease over the course of time, and
that is still evident, if you look month to month, with the data that
came out this morning. So, between the second quarter and third quarter
of this year, monthly inflation increases have actually decelerated by
50 percent. And just to give you more specific data points, it was
around 0.8 percent, and then it went down 0.4 percent. Hence, 50
percent.  
   
So, we think this decrease reflects the view of the Federal Reserve
continues to be — and many Wall Street forecasters, which continue to
predict — project that inflation is expected to continue to decelerate
in 2022 and beyond, as we come out of the pandemic.  
   
So, it’s not about patience to us. We certainly understood and knew that
when we were coming in — when the President was coming into office, and
he was coming in at a time where we needed to turn the economy back on,
where he was coming in at a time where unemployment was high, where
wages were down, demand was down — which, as you know, you have — once
you build up — when demand increases that can re- — result in an
increase in prices — that, over time, as the economy’s turning back on,
we’d see some of these transitory effects.  
   
That’s what we — that’s what’s been predicted. That’s what we are — have
been planning for. And, of course, next year, we expect it to come down
as outside forecasters are projecting.  
   
Q  Gotcha. Secondly, Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe
told AP that he was frustrated by the delay in passing infrastructure,
saying, quote, “They all got to get their act together and vote.” What
does President Biden believe he can do to make talks move faster and
show verifiable progress for Democrats who are seeking office right
now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, time is not unlimited, Josh, and certainly the
President and our entire senior team is continuing to press all members
about the need to move forward and to find a way to unify around a
package that can deliver results to the American people.  
   
It is certainly notable that, of course, former Governor McAuliffe may
or may not — he has an election coming up and so his timeline may be a
little pressed by that. Doesn’t take an outside political analyst to
tell you that.  
   
But certainly, the President would like to move forward. He’s pressing
members to move forward. He’s been very engaged over the last several
days, as he has been throughout, as have members of our senior team. And
as I said at the — at the outset, time is not unlimited.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. On the supply-chain issue, Secretary Buttigieg is saying
that there may be challenges for last-minute shoppers. I’m among them.
Secretary Yellen says, “There \[could\] be isolated shortages of goods…
in the coming months.” So, can you give us a realistic breakdown of what
Americans could be facing on these shortages come the holiday season?
What are we talking about?  
   
MS. PSAKI: For shipment of goods —  
   
Q  Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI: — which I assume is what you’re asking about?  
   
Q  Yes, yes.    
   
MS. PSAKI: So, the reason that the President has been working so hard
for months — long before the last few weeks — to address supply-chain
issues is because he knows — he knew they were multifaceted and that
they were impacting a lot of different industries.  
   
I know you’re asking about shipments and the shipment and movement of
goods. And obviously, the announcement today related to the ports is a
reflection of action taken by the President, by this administration to —
to have an immediate impact. Obviously, there’s more that we will
continue to press to be done as we’re looking to increase the shipment
of goods moving more quickly. That’s one of the — one of the bottlenecks
in the supply chain that will help address those concerns people have.  
   
Look, we — I can’t make a prediction from you — for you that we’re going
to solve every issue tomorrow and next week; we’re not. We’re coming out
of an economic crisis caused by a pandemic. But what we are doing is
working to — using every tool at our disposal to ease the impact on the
American people, ease the impact on families as we look to the holidays,
but certainly beyond that.  
   
Q  But should Americans expect that this will get worse before it gets
better?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to make a prediction of that from here. We know
there are a number of issues that impact the supply chain. And I don’t
want to make a prediction because it’s not just one issue.  
   
Certainly, increasing the capacity at courts — at ports, not courts — at
ports and increasing the number of hours will have a positive impact.
There’s no question about that.  
   
But there are other issues that impact the global supply chain,
including the pandemic — something that we are working 24 hours a day to
help address around the world. That’s impacted manufacturing some
countries, manufacturing of goods in some places, and reducing the
supply in some places. That’s one of the factors too. We’re also working
to address that.  
   
It’s not just one issue. But certainly, we’re going to use every lever
at our disposal to address it, to make it — to address the bottlenecks
as quickly as we can.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Let me ask that in a slightly similar but different way.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  Based on everything being announced today —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  — can this administration guarantee that holiday packages will arrive
on time?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We are not the Postal Service or UPS or FedEx; we cannot
guarantee. What we can do is use every lever at the federal government
disposal to reduce delays, to ensure that we are addressing bottlenecks
in the system, including ports and the need for them to be open longer
hours so that goods can arrive. And we can continue to press not only
workers and unions, but also companies to take as many steps as they can
to reduce these delays.  
   
Q  And on the companies’ aspect to this: There’s just a few lines about
what exactly Walmart is committing to today. They’re increasing “use of
nighttime hours significantly and projects they could increase
throughput by as much as 50 percent over the next several weeks.”    
   
This is a company that was frequently maligned during the Democratic
presidential primary as paying workers pretty bad wages in the view of
those that were running. Did the administration seek any assurances from
Walmart that these changes won’t affect their store workers or that
there might be some kind of either pay raise or other labor assurances
for those that are going to have to work these extra hours?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think you’re very familiar, Ed, with where the President
stands on the minimum wage. The fact that it’s long overdue to increase
the minimum wage is something that he has been quite vocal about for a
range of companies.  
   
It is also true that we recognize that families, people across the
country are purchasing, whether they’re toys or gifts or just household
goods from a range of suppliers, including Walmart. And we are working
to ease the burden on them at the same time.  
   
But we are not taking our foot off the gas pedal of pressing for an
increase in the minimum wage for — and for companies to do the right
thing.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. You guys have had this task force since June. There was
the executive order back in February. You’ve been talking about how the
President has been on top of this for months, but it seemed to get a lot
worse before it’s gotten better — and often pointing to the pandemic as
being a contributing factor. We’ve been in the pandemic for a year and a
half now. So, why did it take until today to get these kinds of
commitments that we’re seeing from the various groups that are here with
the President today?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I will say that we have had — and maybe everybody
wasn’t here for this — but we have had the chairs of our Supply Chain
Task Force in here at least twice to provide updates on the work that is
— been ongoing on — under this administration.  
   
One of those issues has certainly been ensuring that there aren’t
bottlenecks at ports, but there are a lot of other issues that we’ve
been working to address in the global supply chain.  
   
One of them has certainly been the increase in the vulnerabilities in
our food system. It’s something that we’ve seen impact some communities
across the country and impact the price of goods sometimes when people
go to the grocery store. That’s one of the reasons the President pressed
for more competition, why Secretary of — Secretary Vilsack has been
focused on this as one of his primary issues, one of the reasons we
announced the Food Supply Chain Loan Guarantee program.  
   
And I would certainly say that, over the course of the last several
months, when people go to the grocery store and they’re trying to buy a
pound — or two pounds, five pounds; however big their family is — of
meat, that’s an issue that has been impacting them nearly every single
day.  
   
We also know that there are issues in the supply chain as it relates to
housing and the cost of housing across the country. That’s one of the
reasons the President has been so focused and the Supply Chain Task
Force has been focused — and there’s money, also, in some of his
proposals he’s signed into law to address that issue to reduce the cost
of lumber and make sure that that is available so that new build — new
houses can be built and we can address the housing shortage and address
housing prices.  
   
So, I would say, for average people sitting at home, they’re not focused
just on the port. Of course they are; they’re focused on getting their
goods. But they’re focused on the cost of goods. They’re focused on how
much meat costs. They’re focused on what their checkbook looks like.  
   
And we’ve been working to address each of those issues in the supply
chain from the beginning of this administration.  
   
Q  A lot of the remedies you guys have come up with are going to take
some time to actually have an impact. I mean, expediting commercial
driver licenses for truck drivers; you know, getting ports to 24/7
hours. This is going to potentially take some time.  
   
Is there any consideration that the President would declare a national
emergency, have the military help with this kind of thing, or get money
from the National Defense Fund to try to help these companies that are
now having to work overtime hours with labor shortages?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we are continuing to press and look for ways that we
can address the bottlenecks in the supply chain, and this is an
important and vital step. We want to, of course, give the time to
implement it, to your point, but we will continue to look for any
additional steps we can take to ease the burden on families across the
country.  
   
Q  And then, if the President has also pointed to this situation as a
good reason to pass the bipartisan hard infrastructure bill, why then
did he not push for a vote on that bill when he had a chance a couple of
weeks ago so that this time could be truncated a little bit?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, because you need the majority of people in Congress to
vote for something in order to sign it into law. And also because, as it
relates to addressing a range of issues in our economy — as much as
wages are up and unemployment are down, we — unemployment is down — we
also recognize there are longer-term issues we want to address,
including inflation.  
   
And that is something — while it is going to come down next year, and
those are their predictions — the Build Back Better agenda, the
President’s economic agenda will help bring that down. That is what 17
Nobel laureates have told us and have told all of you. So, he wants his
entire agenda passed, and that’s what he thinks will be good for the
economy long term.  
   
And you, of course, need the majority of votes in both Congresses to get
that done.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  In sort of a summary of this: You know, Presidents get blame or
credit for a whole range of things that they may not have direct control
over.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  Is there a sense in the White House here that the President could be
blamed for a frustrating holiday season or shopping season if these
goods don’t flow? Is that an active concern that’s motivating some of
these steps?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, Kelly, what’s motivating some of these steps
is the President wants to get — ensure the American people are able to
order goods, they’re able to get toys delivered to their home, they’re
able to go to the grocery store and be able to afford meat and any goods
that they want.  
   
He understands and we all understand that daily cost — as much as wages
have gone up, as much as unemployment has gone down, as much as a lot of
progress has been made on the economy — he understands these are issues
that are impacting people in their day-to-day lives.  
   
I also — in response to an earlier question, you know, we can’t
overpromise here. And I’m not going to do that from here because there
are a lot of issues in the global supply chain. We knew that from the
first day. That’s why he set up this task force. That’s why this has
been a top priority. And we’ve been attacking those issues one by one,
because we know they have different challenges and different
solutions.  
   
Q  Any update yet on the President signing the debt ceiling
legislation?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We’re just — as soon as it comes to the White House, the
President will sign it. And we’ll — we’ll keep you up to date.  
   
As you all know, but for others who may not be following as — or haven’t
followed this as closely — it can take some time to process. But as soon
as it gets here, we’ll sign it and we’ll let all of you know.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. Can you tell us anything about the conversation with
President Biden and Senator McConnell last week — what they spoke about?
And also, could you clarify how many times they’ve spoken directly since
he took office?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m just not going to detail that further from here. He has
known Senator McConnell for a long time. He does believe there are areas
they can agree and can work together, and he’s going to continue to seek
opportunities to do that.  
   
Q  Also, today — there’s some reporting today that Senator Sinema says
she has directly communicated to the White House what she is and is not
willing to do in these negotiations. Is that accurate? And if so, can
you give us any sense of where — what your understanding is of where she
is, in particular on prescription drug prices?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We’ll let her speak to her position on that particular issue.
I will note that lowering the cost of prescription drugs is something
the President is deeply committed to and the vast majority of the
American people would like to see happen.  
   
It makes sense for Medicare to be able to negotiate the price of
prescription drugs. That’s why he proposed it and put it in this
package, but I’ll let her speak to her position —  
   
Q  But has she been in direct contact with the White House on this? Is
that accurate?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We have — of course. We’ve been in consistent contact with
Senator Sinema from a high level. Of course, as you know, the President
has spoken with her and met with her a number of times. She’s been in
touch with senior members of our White House team. And we’re working
with her, we’re working with Senator Manchin, we’re working with a range
of Democrats to move this legislation forward.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you. Reuters is reporting that the administration is in touch
with oil and gas producers about how to bring down rising fuel costs. I
was wondering if you could say which companies and if you’ve asked them
to increase production, and, if so, how they responded.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m actually not aware of any contact with oil and gas
companies around this particular issue.  
   
Q  There’s other reporting that suggests that administration officials,
including Secretary Granholm, Vilsack, and Blinken met last night to
discuss rising fuel prices. I was wondering if you could confirm those
names and also what are the options that they were discussing.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we are very well aware for a range of issues — and we
should talk about those — that the American people are, of course,
impacted by rising prices of gas in some parts of the country — not all
— and also looking ahead to the winter season and looking at natural gas
supply out there. Maybe they don’t look at it exactly through that
prism, but I would say we do.  
   
And so, of course, the President has asked his economic team, as they do
on any range of issues impacting the public, to continue to discuss what
the options are that we can take to address the shortages.  
   
Now, we know that some of the issue here is supply as a result of the
pandemic. And there’s a natural gas shortage around the world, hence the
need for the United States to continue to export natural gas.  
   
There are a range of, of course, options that we can look into to help
address, but I’m not in a position yet to outline anything more we can —
any additional steps we can take.  
   
Q  Could you say if the administration has a preferred oil price per
barrel?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to outline that from here.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Is there any concern in the White House that the embrace of the Fed’s
use of transitory at best makes your job more complicated, month over
month, to explain what’s going on with inflation; at worst could be
misleading for folks who don’t necessarily get that “transitory” may
mean a year or longer?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, the way we view it is that it’s important to preserve
the independence of the Federal Reserve, and that can give the American
people and the markets confidence in what their projections and their
predictions are. And that’s long been — long been how these issues have
been approached throughout history. And we think that’s important to
continue that trend.  
   
Transitory — I guess I — I don’t have an assessment of how many people
know exactly what that means or what that means to them. We know that
what the Federal Reserve and Wall Street economists and others are
projecting is that the rate of inflation will come down next year.  
   
What that means is that, as people have seen these increase in goods —
an increase in some costs of goods over the course of the last year or
so as the economy is turning back on and, as I would note, we were
turning from a period of time where the unemployment rate was high,
people didn’t have a lot of excess money in wages to spend on goods, so
naturally the demand has come up over the course of the last year — that
that is — the projection is it’s coming down.  
   
So, I wouldn’t say it’s complicated as for — for us. We look at things
over the long term. And we know that if the American people, businesses,
the markets can rely on the independence of the Federal Reserve, that’s
good for the economy and good for our — the integrity of that.  
   
Q  I think — to put a finer point on it, I just mean that, you know, you
— everyone is saying transitory in February and March.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  I understand the nuance and the economics of what’s going on here,
but —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yes, I know you do, but —  
   
Q  — but when the deceleration is happening slower perhaps than people
expected a few months ago, and people are still paying 10 or 15 or 20
percent more for meat, and they’re saying, “Why was it supposed to be
transitory three months ago, four months ago, and we’re still here?,”
does that make things more difficult to explain as to why that’s the
case?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, it requires us explaining — and through working with
all of you as well — that the cost of meat is also related to
competition and the small number of large meat producers who have a
dominance over the market; and the fact that a lot of these issues are
not as simple as a one-sentence explanation; and that different
industries have different issues in the supply chains — different issues
that are causing some increases in prices.  
   
And also because we all understand the American people are not looking
at cost-to-cost comparisons from this year to two years ago; they’re
looking at cost-to-cost comparisons to their checkbooks from 8 months
ago or 12 months ago. And even though, factually, if you look back to
two years ago, things may be comparative, that’s not how people look at
things.  
   
So, our objective here is to tackle each of these issues with the
approach that we think will help address it in the shortest term.  
   
Q  And just one more on supply chains: To what degree has the work of
the task force kind of underscored just how limited the options may be
for the federal government dealing with a global, economic, first time
coming out of a once-in-a-century pandemic type of situation right
now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah. Well, I think there are some realities about an economy
turning back on and moving from a period where there was low demand,
where there was not the production of goods, even of a range of supplies
the American people are looking for — that as it’s turning back on and
as demand has increased as it did, that there would be ups and downs.
And that’s what we’re experiencing right now.  
   
And our hope and our intention is to continue to implement policies that
will help address this over the long term and ensure that we can address
inflation over the long term, which is exactly what the President’s
agenda will do.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. On the issue of wages: Has the President given up on the
idea of the $15 minimum wage, or is that something he still intends to
pursue? And if so, when?  
MS. PSAKI: Absolutely. He wants to increase the minimum wage to $15 an
hour. He remains committed.  
   
As you know, it was in an earlier package and then was not approved by
the parliamentarian, but it is something that he’s still absolutely
committed to increasing. He thinks it’s long overdue.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. I have two questions. The first is just on the rules
around the employer mandates or around vaccinations.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. The OSHA — OSHA regulations?  
   
Q  Yes, the OSHA regulations, sorry, getting to the White House today —
or yesterday — and kind of what’s next, how long you think it will take
for the White House to review since this is an emergency situation and
has been framed as such.  
   
And then how long it would take to implement — like, sort of, what’s the
timeframe for this actually happening now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. So, we don’t always typically pay attention to the OIRA
process, which is understandable. But what’s happened right now is OSHA
— Occupational Safety and Health Administration — they are over- — they
produ- — they created these regulations. They worked — they’ve been
working expeditiously to develop an Emergency Temporary Standard that
covers employers with a hundred or more employees — so that’s, of
course, what you’re referring to, but just to get us up to speed here —
to ensure workers who are fully vaccinated or undergo weekly testing to
protect employee — undergo weekly testing or are fully vaccinated to
protect employees.  
   
So, as part of the regulatory review process, what happened yesterday is
the agency submitted the initial text of the Emergency Temporary
Standard to the Office of Management and Budget. And now what happens is
that it will be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget — OIRA,
which is a division of the Office of Management and Budget that does
regulatory reviews.  
   
We don’t, as a prac- — as a longstanding practice, comment on the
timeline of how long that takes because we want to allow that process to
happen. But, you know, it should be an indication that it’s there and
now it is being reviewed. And once it is finalized and through the OIRA
process and review, it will be posted publicly in the Federal Register
and you will all have access to every detail of it.  
   
Q  Okay. One other question on a different subject. The World Bank and
IMF are having their annual meetings just, you know, down the street
from here right now. And there’s obviously a lot of questions around the
leadership there. Does President Biden have confidence in the leadership
of the IMF and the World Bank, given the questions about the integrity
of each institution? And is he concerned about China’s growing influence
at the international financial institution where the U.S. is still the
biggest contributor?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I believe the Treasury Department did — did express
concern about a report that was recently issued. So I’d certai- —
certainly point you to that. Otherwise, the President does have co- —
continues to have confidence.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  The President’s commission on the review of the Supreme Court — the
suggestion of reforms — is said to be wrapping up its work this week.
Has — have the commission chairs presented their findings to the
President yet? Has he had a chance to review them in advance of what we
expect will be some sort of public report?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Right. So here’s where this stands. This is a day of
processes in the government; how fun.  
   
So, the commission will release the draft preliminary discussion
materials tomorrow, which is their timeline or their de- — was their
deadline, and they will meet that — meet that timeline.  
   
These have not been submitted to the White House for edits or feedback,
and their release will be followed by a public meeting of the commission
on Friday. They will then form their final report and submit it to the
President in mid-November. So that is the process that will transpire
from here.  
   
And like we’ve said previously, our objective here is to allow for this
process, made up of a diverse range of experts and voices, to move
forward and represent different viewpoints. And we’re not going to
comment on it — or the President wouldn’t comment on it until a report
is final and he has the chance to review it at that period of time.  
   
If I may, let me just remind people of what they are looking at so that
when you see this preliminary discussion materials released, you will
know what you’re looking for. The Commission on Supreme Court is a group
of about 30 members representing a wide spectrum of different
viewpoints. Its mission was to evaluate a number of questions that have
prompted calls for reform in a different — in a number of different
areas, and, importantly, it will analyze both arguments in favor and
against such proposals.  
   
So, the topics they’re examining include the origins of the reform
debate, the Court’s role in the constitutional system, the length of
service and turnover of the justices on the Court, the membership and
size of the Court, and the Court’s case-selection rules and practices.  
   
And that’s what they’ll be looking at, which will be reflected in the
preliminary discussion materials.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you so much. On these new land border crossing rules, what
happens if fully vaccinated people present themselves for asylum at an
official port of entry? Will they be allowed to ask for asylum and begin
their immigration proceedings?  
   
MS. PSAKI: This is — the Title 19, different from Title 42. So, Title 19
applies to individuals who have the proper documentation to come into
the United States. It would be a different process. And Title 42, as you
know, remains in place.  
   
Q  And then on — the Kenyan President is meeting with President Biden
tomorrow. They’re going to talk about, quote, “a need to bring
transparency and accountability to domestic and international financial
systems,” which is rich, considering the revelations in the Pandora
Papers that the Kenyan President owned a whole network of offshore
companies. How do you square that with the fact that he’s kind of a
poster boy for that behavior?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, the President has a range of meetings diplomatically
with leaders where he has shared interests of the United States and
their country, and may also have areas where there’s disagreement. And
the President has been quite vocal, as you all know, about the
inequities in the international system — financial system and also
domestically. That’s part of his —  
   
Q  But —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Let me finish my answer. There is — that’s why he’s proposed
what he’s proposed domestically. He’s made no secret of that. And
certainly, that’s something he would convey as applicable. But that
doesn’t mean you don’t meet with people you have disagreements on. And
—  
   
Q  Will he push him on it at least?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I — that — his view on this has been quite clear, and I don’t
think he will hold back. But I would remem- — I would remind you: We
have a range of interests in working with Kenya and working with them on
issues in Africa, in the region, and that will be the primary focus of
the meeting.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay, last ones. Last one, Karen.  
   
Q  Thanks. The White House told governors yesterday to be ready in early
November to start vaccinating kids ages 5 through 11. There was a poll
in September from the Kaiser Family Foundation that said a third of
parents are going to do this right away; 32 percent of parents said they
wanted to wait and see.  
   
You guys have been doing this now for nine months to try and encourage
adults to get vaccinated. What do you do the same to encourage parents
to get their kids vaccinated? And what has to be done different —
differently, given this unique age group? What are the concerns there?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we certainly understand. You’re a parent; I’m a parent.
Parents are going to want to go and ask their doctor questions; ask the
pedia- — their pediatrician questions; better understand the safety, the
efficacy of the vaccine.  
   
Yes, of course, it wouldn’t be available until it’s fully through the
gold-standard FDA approval process, but we know that. We understand
that.  
   
What we will be doing is, of course — knock on wood — when this is
approved — you know, empowering local medical experts, pediatricians,
doctors who can speak to this who can answer questions as they have
them. We’ll be encouraging people to speak to their doctors.  
   
I’m sure, as we get closer — if we get to that point — we will have more
to say about how we’ll be communicating with parents and meeting them
where they are.  
   
Thanks, everyone.
