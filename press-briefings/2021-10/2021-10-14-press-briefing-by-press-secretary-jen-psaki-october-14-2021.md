James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

3:42 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Hi, everyone.  All right.  Hello.  Hello.  Okay, just a
couple of items for you at the top.   
   
Today we learned that last week’s initial unemployment claims fell to
another pre-pandemic low, down below 300,000 for the first time in
almost 20 months.  The four-week average similarly fell to a new low,
down nearly 60 percent from when President Biden took office.  
   
This is a testament to the progress we’ve made on the economy, thanks to
President Biden’s success in getting Americans vaccinated and getting
economic relief to the middle class.  
   
The week before the President took office — just to give you a few fr- —
points of reference — jobless claims were at nearly 900,000; now they’re
down to 293,000.  We’ve created nearly 5 million jobs in eight months. 
That’s 600,000 new jobs every month, on average — 10 times the rate we
inherited.  Growth is up.  Wages are up.  And our unemployment rate is
down below 5 percent — 18 months faster than forecasters predicted
earlier this year.  
   
We know there is still more work to do, as we’ve been talking about in
here over the last several days and weeks.  America is facing the same
challenges on supply chains that most other developed countries are
facing as well.  But thanks to the work of this administration, we’re
leading the world in our recovery and we’re in a year of unprecedented
growth.   
   
Also, just one announcement about today that I think you saw already,
but just in case: Today, during President Biden’s meeting with President
Kenyatta of Kenya, he announced a historic, one-time donation of over 17
million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the African Union, on top
of the 50 million doses we have already donated to the African Union. 
This donation complements the African Union’s own groundbreaking
regional procurement of J&J — Johnson & Johnson — via the African
Vaccine Acquisition Trust.  All 17 million doses of J&J are available
for delivery immediately and will be delivered to the African Union in
the coming weeks.  
   
One other — two other just scheduling notes and one little pr- — one
scheduling, one preview for tomorrow: President Biden — I think you may
have seen this, but just in case — is honor- — will be — is honored to
be speaking this Saturday at the 40th Annual National Police Officers’
Memorial Service, which recognizes the 491 members of law enforcement
who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2019 and 2020.   
   
It’s particularly poignant that this memorial is being held at the U.S.
Capitol where, nine months ago, we saw the incredible bravery of the
members of the U.S. Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police Department,
and other law enforcement agencies who helped protect the Constitution
and what the President — on what the President called the citad- — and
what the President called “the citadel of our democracy” in one of the
darkest days — on one of the darkest days in our modern history.   
   
We also recognize the important role law enforcement has played on the
frontlines of the pandemic and the fight against the spike in gun crime
over the last year and a half.  The President has delivered additional
money, as you know, through the Rescue Plan, to support law enforcement
agencies that have been hit hard during this period and has long been an
advocate of additional resources to bolter \[sic\] effect- — bolster
effective accountable community policing.   
   
Also wanted to just note: As you know, tomorrow, the President is headed
to Connecticut.  He will visit a childcare center in Hartford, where he
will deliver remarks highlighting the need for investments in childcare,
in preschool that provide a lifetime of benefits for children, help
parents work, and support equitable economic growth.   
   
The United States currently ranked 35th out of 37 countries tracked by
the OECD in public investment in child — children from birth to five as
a percentage of GDP.  And only about half of three- and four-year-olds
in the United States are enrolled in early childhood education, compared
to more than 90 percent of children in advanced countries like Germany,
France, the United Kingdom, and even Latvia — I shouldn’t say “even
Latvia” — Latvia as well.   
   
The average annual cost of a childcare center for a toddler in Hartford
is $16,000.  And a typical four-person household in the state would need
to spend more than 26 percent of their income for childcare for two
young children each year.   
   
The President’s Build Back Better Agenda would ensure parents earning up
to 150 percent of the state’s median income pay no more than 7 percent
of their income on childcare, and the lowest-income families will
receive childcare for free.   
   
After visiting the child center, he will join former Senator Chris Dodd
— a longtime friend; members of the Connecticut congressional
delegation; Governor Ned Lamont; the president of UConn; and students,
faculty, and staff to mark the dedication of The Dodd Center for Human
Rights at the University of Connecticut.   
   
Sorry, a few things at the top.  Go ahead, Josh.  
   
Q    No worries.  Thanks, Jen.  Two things.  John Kerry told AP that it
hurts his efforts to get global agreements on climate change without a
deal at home.  Would President Biden be a credible messenger on the
international stage in two weeks without a clear path for his agenda
here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely.  And here’s why: What the President has clearly
done is prioritize climate and investment in climate — pushing for
climate legislation, taking executive actions on climate — in order to
ma- — take real action here at home domestically — something that we
need to do that we were on pause for the last four years over — and also
to send a message to the world that this is a top priority for him. 
It’s something he takes very seriously.   
   
The world watches closely, of course.  They know that we’re working
through our legislative agenda, that we’re trying to get these things
across the finish line.  And I think that indicates the President’s
clear commitment and will enable him to have a strong seat at the table
— regain the United States’ seat at the table.  
   
Q    And then, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he plans for a
vote next week to try and advance the voting rights bill.  Given that
that vote is coming up, what additional steps does the President plan to
take on voting rights?  And should the vote fail, what efforts is this
administration willing to make?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Josh, the — ensuring that voting rights legislation
becomes law remains a top priority to the President.  We absolutely have
to do it; we must do it.  It’s not an option not to do it.   
   
The President, of course, has talked with members of Congress about his
commitment to this, and he’s asked the Vice President — actually agreed
with the Vice President on her asking that she should run point and lead
the effort to get voting rights — make voting rights a reality across
the country.  You’ve seen her take a number of actions on this front.   
   
So I expect the President will continue to be engaged over the course of
the coming days, and he will continue to advocate for the need to get
this done to protect our democracy and protect people’s fundamental
rights.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Jen, you’ve got about 10,000 John Deere workers on strike, a number
of other strikes going on.  How concerned are you about the impact this
might have on the economy or the supply chain?  And do you have any
plans to intervene?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, we, of course, are not going to speak to any
individual ongoing — potential individual labor actions, as you know, as
a standard.   
   
But I will note that the President and the Vice President often say and
— that this is the most pro-union administration in history, and they
will continue to govern and lead with that in mind.  And they both feel
that strongly supporting unions, the ability of workers to organize if
they so choose, collective bargaining and the right to strike, which is
one part of collective bargaining, are fundamental rights.   
   
It’s also the responsibility of management and the union to bargain with
each other and resolve their differences.  That’s a part of why unions
are around and the role they play.  
   
We also know that in healthy economies, employees \[employers\] must
compete for workers, and we’re seeing that.  And as unemployment drops,
our economy is shifting to a labor market where workers have more
bargaining power.  Ultimately, that’s a good thing for workers to have
more bargaining power and be able to choose more.  That means workers
can push for higher wages and more dignity and respect in the
workplace.   
   
So, this has long been a fundamental value for the President — something
he’ll continue to support broadly across the country.  
   
Q    And secondly, how much longer are you willing to wait for the
budget talks to reach some sort of conclusion?  Are you — is there a
sense of impatience here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I wouldn’t put it in those terms.  But what I would say is
that the President is eager to get things done for the American people
and to deliver on what he’s promised.  And so, as I said yesterday, the
time for negotiations is not unending.  
   
And we’re eager to move forward.  We’re eager to deliver on what he
promised to the American people, which will result in addressing some of
the issues I touched on earlier: making childcare more affordable;
making universal pre-K a reality; addressing the climate crisis; making
sure people have — kids have clean drinking water, broadband is
accessible.  We’re repairing roads, rails, and bridges across the
country.  We’re eager to act.  I wouldn’t say it’s impatience; I would
say it’s an interest in moving forward.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Is it the President’s position that those who defy
congressional subpoenas related to January 6th should face prosecution
from the Justice Department?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, Kaitlan, I know that that has been raised as an issue,
of course, by what we’ve seen happen in Congress.  It’s the purview of
the Department of Justice to determine if there would be a criminal
referral — a criminal — any criminal decisions, so — and they handle
exclusively those decisions, so I’d point you to them.  
   
Q    But does he think those who defy these congressional subpoenas —
that are related to something that he thinks is so important that he is
not going to assert executive privilege, as his predecessor has
requested — that they should face consequences for defying the
subpoenas?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, again, Kaitlan, I think why you’re asking this
question is because it’s been raised by the Selec- — by the committee —
the January 6th Select Committee — about criminal actions or criminal
referral.  That’s something that is between them and the Department of
Justice, an independent agency that would make any of those decisions.  
   
Q    And citing the upcoming election for governor in Virginia, Senator
Mark Warner said he thinks the House needs to go ahead and vote on the
hard infrastructure bill so Democrats can have a win on the table to run
on.  Does the President agree with that sentiment?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  The President wants to get both pieces of legislation
passed.  That requires having the majority of votes in Congress to get
that done, and that’s what he’s working to get across the finish line.  
   
Q    Is there any other response to Senator Warner?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Nope.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  I’m going to follow up on a couple that Steve
asked.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    But he asked about the concern at the White House about these
strikes and the potential impact on the economy.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Is there a worry right now — as we’re seeing this happening in
different parts of the country, different industries — that this could
have a significant impact?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have not heard that expressed by our economic team at this
point.  I’m happy to check with them and see if that’s a concern they
have.  
   
Q    And on the timing of negotiations, talking about the patience
issue, the White House announced the President’s trip to Europe at the
end of this month.  Nancy Pelosi has set an October 31st deadline to get
the infrastructure package passed.  Does the President expect that
negotiations will be completed by the time he leaves for that trip at
the end of the month?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to set new timelines here.  I will reiterate
that we don’t feel that the time is unending, and we feel it’s time to
move forward with negotiations, move to a point — place where we have a
unified package, but I’m not going to set a new timeline today.  
   
Q    Can the President leave for that trip if negotiations are still
going on on Capitol Hill and at the White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Again, I’m not going to set a new timeline today. 
Obviously, we want to move this forward as quickly as possible.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  And following up on the questions about January
6th: I know you’ve spoken to the decision by the White House Counsel’s
Office to tell the Archives to hand over those documents.  Has there
been any concern or conversation about what might happen one day when
the shoe is on the other foot and if another administration or the other
party comes in and says there’s an extraordinary circumstance and they
want to hand over documents that were deemed privileged by the Biden
administration?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can assure you, Ed, that this President has no intention
to lead an insurrection on our nation’s Capitol.  
   
Q    I anticipated that would be your answer almost word for word.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, good.  
   
Q    But part of — I mean, you can understand that you’re opening,
potentially, a Pandora’s box here by setting this precedent.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Actually, we don’t — we don’t see it that way.  I understand
why you’re asking this question.  We talked about this a little bit last
week as well.   
   
I think it is ultimately important for people to understand and remember
that January 6th was an incredibly dark day — one of the darkest days in
our democracy.  There was an insurrection on our nation’s Capitol.  
   
What we’re talking about here is getting to the bottom of that. 
Shouldn’t everybody want to get to the bottom of that?  Democrats,
Republicans, people who have no political affiliation whatsoever.   
   
I will reiterate that we’re going to assess and review, as is standard
in the process, the documents and any efforts to exert executive
privilege on a case-by-case basis.  And we’ll provide you updates on
those as those processes proceed.  And we will continue, as it relates
to executive privilege for other issues, to evaluate that on a
case-by-case basis, as every White House has in the past.  
   
But I think if you look back at past Presidents, Democratic and
Republican, there isn’t really a precedent for what we’re talking about
with the select committee and what they’re trying to get to the bottom
of.  And the uniqueness of that, I think, is important context.  
   
Q    On the issue of negotiating with Congress on the President’s
agenda, the negotiating timetable isn’t open-ended.  Is there anything
new you can say about what the President himself has done this week to
engage in those negotiations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can tell you that the President has been deeply engaged on
the phone with members, getting updates from his team and senior members
of his team on their conversations and discussions; eager to hear where
there’s agreement, where there’s still disagreement, and how to shake
things loose to move them forward.  
   
Q    And I have an FDA question, but not on what you might anticipate.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, I like the setup.  Okay.  
   
Q    There was a decision this week by the agency to approve specific
vapes, or vaping cigarettes, saying they’re appropriate protection of
public health.  What does the President make of that decision?  And does
he support taxing e-cigarettes along with other more traditional tobacco
products?  
   
I know this was an element of the Build Back Better payfor agenda
originally.  Does he still support doing that?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It wasn’t something that he had proposed originally, so I
would just note that.  Obviously, we would —  
   
Q    Sorry, yes.  Some Democrats —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Some Democrats.  
   
Q    — proposed it as —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  But I think it’s important context, right? —  
   
Q    Yes.  Totally.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — that he didn’t propose that.   
   
Look, the FDA, as you noted, did approve some e-cigarettes.  They spoke
to this, and I would certainly point you to their comments.  The
President supports the independent review and process of the FDA.   
   
Beyond that, I’m not aware of any proposal for taxing cigarettes coming
from here.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  The White House Chief of Staff, Ron Klain,
retweeted a message yesterday — not once, but twice — that inflation and
supply chain issues are “high class” issues.  But some of the sharpest
price increases over the last month included products that every
American buys: beef products; chicken; egg; regular, unleaded gasoline;
laundry equipment; furniture; clothing.  The list goes on.  Why you
would Ron Klain tweet that?  And would you agree that that’s a little
bit tone deaf?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Do you think two tweets means more?  I’m just curious.  
   
So, just for context, what the — what Ron Klain retweeted was a tweet
from the former Chairman of Economic Advisers, Jason Furman, where he
said — for full context, which I think is important — “Most of the
economic problems we’re facing (inflation, supply chains) are high class
problems.”  What he went on to say is, “We wouldn’t have had them if the
unemployment rate was still 10 percent.  We would instead have had a
much worse problem.”   
   
So I think the point here is: While there are some critics who are
saying — what some of these critics are saying is: I don’t — we don’t
know if they’re saying that what they thought was great was when the
unemployment rate was double what it is today, or when people were
locked in their homes and therefore gas prices were lower.  
   
We’re at this point because the unemployment rate has come down and been
cut in half, because people are buying more goods, because people are
traveling, and because demand is up, and because the economy is turning
back on.   
   
So, Jason Furman, of course, is more than capable of speaking or
tweeting for himself, obviously, and providing any additional
context.   
   
But what the point is here is that — is that we are at this point
because we’ve made progress in the economy, and what would be worse, in
our view, is if the unemployment rate was at 10 percent, people were out
of work, hundreds of thousands of people were still dying of COVID, and
people weren’t able to lose their homes.  So, that’s the full context.  
   
Q    And that’s a much more eloquent way of putting it than the “high
class” comment in that tweet.  It’s not the first time that Ron Klain’s
Twitter has drawn some sharp criticism.  Is that something that the
White House is addressing at all, given this pushback, this criticism?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Are we addressing the Chief of Staff’s Twitter habits?  
   
Q    Yes.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is not a top priority, I would tell you, at this point in
time.  The Chief of Staff is out there speaking on his own accord to
members of Congress, to the media, frequently, as any chief of staff
does.  And I think it’s important also for anyone here to be able to
tout points that they find interesting, and that’s the purpose of public
speech.  
   
Q    And then, on the supply chain remedies that we were going through
yesterday, there’s been obviously some action from the White House in
brokering these agreements, but the private sector is calling for more
federal action on things like expanding commercial driver licenses,
easing some restrictions.   
   
What is the hesitation?  Why hasn’t this happened yet?  And is there any
concern that if some of these actions aren’t taken right now, at a
certain point, it’ll become too late and this problem will just
bottleneck further?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  They actually have been happening.  So the Department of
Transportation has been supporting state DMVs for months and months as
they return to or even exceed pre-pandemic commercial driver’s license
issuance rates, which will allow more people to have commercial driver’s
licenses so that they can drive trucks and more trucks that can move
goods across the country.   
   
And so, in 2021, an average of 50,000 commercial driver’s license —
licenses and learner’s permits were issued each month, which is 14
percent higher than the 2019 monthly average and 60 percent higher than
the 2020 monthly average.   
   
The other thing that the Department of Transportation has been doing is
expanding hours of service exemptions for truck drivers during the
pandemic to support the flow of emergency goods and assistance from some
— for some supply chains.  So that’s another step.   
   
We also — and so the point is: We’ve been — we’ve been working on these
pieces where we — they’ve been in process.  And what we announced
yesterday was essentially an agreement between the labor unions, who are
going to fill the hours — right? — at these ports — an important
bottleneck piece — as well as the suppliers who will be using the
expanded hours, and the ports themselves which will help move this
forward quickly and help reduce some of the delays.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Has the President made a decision on the FDA commissioner?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Not yet.  
   
Q    With the time constraints for an acting commissioner to serve, is
the President committed to beat that time constraint to allow Dr.
Woodcock to remain if there’s a nominee?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the President is definitely eager to make a decision
about an FDA nominee and, of course, make that decision public once it’s
made.  We’re just not quite at that point yet.   
   
In terms of the timeline, I’m not aware of what exactly that timeline
is, but certainly —  
   
Q    For an acting commissioner.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I understand.  I just don’t know when it — I
don’t know when it ends, but we are certainly eager to do this in short
order.  
   
Q    On the Connecticut visit, you outlined some elements related to
childcare —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — that the President wants to talk about.  So can we then assume
those are red lines for the President — that those kinds of programs and
ideas must be included in the package?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say that certainly addressing the care economy
and easing the burden on families — often women, frankly — in the
workforce is a core priority, of course, for the President.  He wants to
see everything in the package, and he wants to lift up what’s in the
package so people understand the key components.   
   
I don’t have any new red lines to set for you today.  But, certainly,
addressing the care economy — childcare is a part of it — is something
that’s a priority and important to the President and important to many,
many — if not the vast majority or every single member of Congress.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Back to the issue of supply chain.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    In addition to announcing the deal yesterday between the
Longshoremen’s union and the Port of Los Angeles, the President also
called on the private sector and elements in it to essentially boost
their throughput.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    That requires — or it could require many workers who are already
stressed out and overworked to work longer hours.  How do you thread
that, where, you know — and we see it across the economy — workers are
increasingly resigning from their jobs; they’re burnt out?  This
President obviously believes that there are certain things that the
private sector has to do for the betterment of the country.  How do you
thread those two things?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, you thread them by having everyone at the table —
representatives of the labor unions ensuring that they can go back to
their workers and convey safety is a high priority, treatment is a high
priority, pay and overtime is a high priority.  It’s important to have
these companies at the table so they understand what the labor unions
are expecting.  And it’s important, of course, to have, whether it’s the
ports or other modes and means of transportation at the table so they
can also convey what their needs are.  
   
And what he was asking for — you know, if you look at moving goods, for
example — you know, UPS and FedEx are about 40 percent of the market of
how goods are transported.  He’s asking others who are moving goods to
also step up their game, other companies and suppliers to also step up
their game.  And this is a model for how that could be done.  
   
Q    The labor union IATSE is talking about striking the studios next
week.  Their primary complaint is that they’re not given enough time for
rest.  Is the President, without wanting to step into this dispute, is
he sympathetic?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first, that’s a different issue — for
clarity, right?  That is not about moving goods or the supply chain,
just for clarity, for people who are reading the transcript.   
   
Of cou- — the President is — of course I’m not going to have a comment
on any individual labor dispute, just to reiterate, but the President
believes in collective bargaining rights, believes in workers’ rights,
believes that’s the role that labor unions and why they are so important
to our country.  
   
So, that’s something that is, of course, between the labor unions and
the companies where these — and organizations where these workers are
serving, but he thinks that’s a healthy part of what happens in our
workforce and our economy.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks.  On the reconciliation bill and climate —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — back to that AP interview with John Kerry — he said that if
Congress doesn’t pass the reconciliation bill, it’ll be devastating, he
said, “like President Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement again.” 
So, does that mean that the administration doesn’t think it can reach
the carbon cuts that it’s already promised ahead of the climate summit —
that 50 to 52 percent reduction — without reconciliation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first of all, none of our objectives for the
President’s climate agenda begins or ends on November 1st and 2nd, or
the week after.  This is an incredibly important meeting.  It’s a
pivotal moment at the start of a decisive decade of action to tackle the
climate crisis.   
   
And this is obviously a pivotal period that former Secretary Kerry, our
Climate Envoy, is playing a central role in.  And we know that the
window for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is narrowing.  Many
countries, including the United States, have put forward ambitious
commitments in line with the Paris goal.  And, of course, we are going
to continue to press, until the very last moment, more countries to do
exactly the same.   
   
That work is ongoing, but I think it’s not a reflection of anything
other than this pivotal period.  We’re two weeks before the President
goes — two weeks, I think, if I’m doing my math correctly — before the
President goes to COP26.  It is always an important meeting and an
important gathering.  It’s an opportunity for global leaders to talk
about the climate crisis and the responsibility of countries like the
United States and other big global emitters.  
   
But, no, I don’t think it’s — I don’t think it’s — whether our agenda
has passed or not is not going to be the defining factor.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    There were two analyses that suggests that the 2020 census may have
undercounted some populations, specifically African Americans.  Is the
White House aware of this?  Are they investigating?  Are you looking at,
you know, analyzing whether that happened?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I have not looked into this myself, so let me talk to our
team and see if we have something more concrete to give to you.  
   
Q    Okay.  One more.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
Q    Hundreds of climate protesters — I think they’re gathered outside
the White House right now — they’re demanding Biden stop approving
fossil fuel projects and declare a climate emergency.  I wonder if those
are actions that the administration is considering or listening to their
demands.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Of course we’re listening to advocates and people who have
been elevating the issue of climate for decades. They have important
voices, and they’ve put climate on the front of the agenda when it
wasn’t 10 years and 20 years ago.  
   
I would encourage anyone out there, or not, to look at what the
President is proposing, what he’s trying to push across the finish line
at this point, which is an enormous investment and commitment to
addressing the climate crisis.  That’s in his legislative agenda that’s
currently working its way through Congress now.  It doesn’t mean his
climate commitment ends once he signs this into law; it just means
that’s what our focus is on now, and it will have a dramatic, important
impact.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Last month, the President signed an executive
order signaling that the United States was prepared to issue sanctions
against various entities in Ethiopia.   
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Given the meeting today, just — what is the administration waiting
for?  What’s the United States watching right now that’s preventing the
administration from issuing those sanctions?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update on “if” and “when,” and I know that’s
kind of what you’re asking.  We often sign an executive order — or the
President may sign executive orders to prepare for and have the ability
to sign into law sanctions quickly, because the executive order would
have already been signed.  
   
As we’ve talked about in the past, obviously what’s happening in
Ethiopia are — it’s an atrocity.  It’s horrific.  It’s something that,
frankly, I’m happy you’re asking about because there hasn’t been
probably enough attention here in the United States to what’s
happening.  But I don’t have an update.  It’s often an interagency
process, and I don’t have an update on what — when a determination will
be made.  
   
Q    Given Kenya currently has the leadership position in the U.N.
Security Council, were there any kind of tangible plans that came out of
today’s meeting to try and not only address the atrocities that you just
mentioned, but also the fact that U.N. aid workers are also now being
expelled from Ethiopia as well?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah — I have not had a chance to talk to our national
security team before coming out here about what happened in the
meeting.  Obviously, Ethiopia was on the agenda, as was
counterterrorism; as was Somalia, I’m sure; as was, of course, vaccines,
as we talked about.   
   
I’m sure we’ll have a readout of that, and we can see if there’s more to
lay down for you.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  President Biden talked earlier about how vaccine
requirements have been helpful.  I just wanted to ask if there’s any
more serious consideration of requiring vaccinations for domestic
flights ahead of holiday season.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have anything to preview on that at this point in
time.  
   
Q    On the Congress, just curious, when was the last time, if you can
share, that President Biden spoke with Senator Sinema?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’m just not going to give you a laydown of every call.  I
can assure you that we’ve been in close touch with her from a very
high-staff level.  
   
Q    Last couple of days?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t — I’m not going to give you an update of when he did
individual phone calls, but we are in close touch with her.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Yesterday, you mentioned that the Supreme Court
commission was going to release draft preliminary discussion materials
today.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
Q    I’m wondering if there was any update on a timeline, and is that a
draft report — or what did you mean by “draft preliminary discussion
materials”?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It is — it is an assessment; it is not a recommendation. 
That is how it was — has been outlined from the beginning.  
   
Given it’s four o’clock, they have to be posting it pretty soon, so I
would expect you’ll see it posted soon.  But since you gave me the
opportunity — we talked about this a little bit yesterday, but I know
there’s been a little bit of confusion.  What they are looking at and
examining are the Court’s role in the constitutional system, the length
of service and turnover of the justices on the Court, the membership and
the size of the Court, and the Court selection rules and practices.  
   
These are draft preliminary discussion materials because the next step
will be a public meeting of the commission, on Friday, and they won’t
issue a final report and submit it to the President until
mid-November.   
   
So that was just meant to convey that, as should be a part of the
process, it will be transparent, they will be publicly available, but
there’s a process that will proceed.  And the President won’t even get
the final report to review until mid-November.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    I’m curious if the White House sees the Virginia governor’s race as
a bellwether — we talked about it a lot in here — and if the outcome is
basically a (inaudible) support of the President’s agenda since
McAuliffe is running on it quite a bit.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, I have to be a little careful about how much political
analysis I do from here and not (inaudible) into that too much.   
   
Look, I think the President, of course, wants former Governor McAuliffe
to be the future governor of Virginia.  There is alignment on a lot of
their agenda, whether it is the need to invest in rebuilding our roads,
rails, and bridges, or making it easier for women to rejoin the
workforce.  
   
I will say as — I will leave it to other outside analysis to convey that
off-year elections are often — are often not a bellwether, but — and
there’s a lot of history here in Virginia.  But, again, we’re going to
do everything we can to help former Governor McAuliffe, and we believe
in the agenda he’s representing.  
   
Q    And on COVID, on travel, is there any update on the exact date when
the ban on travel from abroad is going to be lifted?  I think last time
we heard early November.  Is there an exact date that you can share
here?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an exact date for you today.  Early November
remains the case, and we main — remain on track for that.  
   
Q    Is “early November” the first two weeks in November, the first week
in November, the first few days in November?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will let you assess what “early November” means.  It means
early in November.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you, Jen.  Taliban’s Acting Deputy Minister of Information
and Culture, Zabihullah Mujahid, told VOA that China wants to invest
billions of dollars in Afghanistan.  Is the administration concerned
that Beijing may — that Afghanistan might be the next frontier for
Beijing to expand its influence through its investments?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our focus is on working with the vast majority of the
international community on delivering humanitarian assistance and
getting it to the right people in Afghanistan to make sure they have
what they need.  
   
 The United States is far and away the largest provider of that
assistance.  We’ve worked through international organizations to deliver
that.  So, that is what our focus primarily is on at this point in
time.   
   
 Q    Okay.  And then another one on Iran: You said, earlier this week,
that — in regards to Iran nuclear talks — diplomacy is the preferred
path.  What is the administration’s plan B should Iran continue to stall
in negotiations?   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Well, we’ve been sincere and steadfast in pursuing a path
of meaningful diplomacy to achieve a mutual return to compliance with
the JCPOA and to address our full range of concerns with Iran.   
   
 We’re seeking a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA.  If Iran
demands more or offers less, these negotiations will not succeed.  But,
ultimately, that’s what our focus is on, and I’m not going to get into
hypotheticals beyond that.  
   
 Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two questions.  The President mentioned today that
nationwide daily COVID cases and hospitalizations are down.  Does the
White House have a sense of when guidance will change for vaccinated
Americans to once again remove their masks indoors?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  We leave any guidance changes to the CDC, so I’d point you
to them.   
   
 Q    Are you hopeful that that’ll happen by the holidays?   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Again, we leave it to the CDC.  We don’t make predictions
like that.  
   
 Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Thanks, Jen.  I have a couple questions.  One to follow up on
Eugene’s about Virginia.   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Sure.   
   
 Q    Virginia’s Senator Mark Warner said today that “the President
ought to tell the House that we ought to deliver this infrastructure
bill.”  It echoes with Terry McAuliffe —  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Kaitlan asked — I can answer again.   
   
 Q    Yeah, yeah.  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  But Kaitlan asked about it earlier.  
   
 Q    I understand that, but I want to make sure I get a —  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
 Q    — maybe a clearer answer.  Just — I want to ask what you make of
that, what you make of the Virginia — these Virginia leaders saying that
the President and Democrats in D.C. just aren’t doing enough.   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  I don’t — I didn’t read it exactly that way.  I think it
was an assessment of what a legislative strategy and approach should
be.  
   
 What we’re working on, Yamiche, is working with leaders in the House
and Senate to get both of these packages moved forward, do it in short
order, and deliver for the American people.  
   
 I just don’t have a further comment on it than that.  
   
 Q    The other question I have is about COVID.  I’m wondering if you
could explain to the American people why there isn’t proof of
vaccination or testing required on domestic flights.  Is the President
getting briefed on that?  Is there any sort of assessment on whether
that will — that will change?   
   
 We’re hearing experts say that the U.S. should follow what Canada is
doing, which is doing — taking those policies to their domestic
flights.   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Again, we’re always looking at options for how we can keep
more people safe in this country.  I just don’t have a prediction of
additional options at this point in time.  
   
 Q    Could I ask you one last one?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  
   
 Q    I know you said that he hasn’t made a decision on the FDA
Commissioner, but I guess I’ll maybe try to — we already have Senator
Bernie Sanders, who is saying that he has some issues with Robert
Califf, who is someone who Politico is reporting the President is
eyeing.   
   
 Is the President at all concerned that there are these — already
senators who are worried about pharmaceutical ties and ties to drug
makers with this person that could possibly be the FDA Commissioner?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Well, given there hasn’t been a decision made at this point
in time, I’m not going to speak to a hypothetical maybe-nomination and
people’s hypothetical reactions to the hypothetical nomination.   
   
But I will tell you that the President’s, you know, views and his policy
positions are pretty clear as it relates to prescription drugs, the cost
of prescription drugs, the unacceptably high cost of prescription
drugs.   
   
That’s why he has continued to push for it in his Build Back Better
Agenda, and he will continue to do that, regardless of who is serving in
any particular role in his administration.  
   
 Q    Jen —  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Jen, on the issue of gerrymandering: Gerrymandering is closely
linked to voting rights, and you’re seeing Democrats in this nation
having their districts redrawn.  And they’re affected, and they cannot
fall upon or use the Voting Rights Act right now because it’s gutted —
the pre-clearance issue.  
   
 What is the White House doing, as it relates to this, in the leadup to
this vote at the Senate next week?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Leadup to the voting rights vote —  
   
 Q    Yes.  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  — next week?  I think somebody asked this before.  
   
 Q    They asked about voting rights, but I’m talking about the
gerrymandering piece that goes with voting rights.   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  What are we doing about gerrymandering —  
   
 Q    Yeah, are you —  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  — or what are we doing about the voting rights?  
   
 Q    Yeah, are you leaning in?  Is that part of the conversations that
the White House is having with senators, as it relates to voting
rights?  Because it all goes hand-in-hand.  I mean, it creates —  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  I just wanted to make sure I understood what your question
was, April.  
   
 Look, the President continues to believe that voting rights is
fundamental to people’s rights in this country.  He has given speeches
about it.  He has taken actions through executive action.  He has
supported the efforts of his Department of Justice to ensure they’re
putting in place protections across the country.   
   
 I think his actions absolutely speak for that.  I don’t have anything
more to preview for you in terms of —  
   
 Q    Is he watching this happening in Texas?   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  And of course we’re
extremely engaged through a range of senior officials in having
conversations with Congress, with activists, with advocates, with people
who are passionately — who share the passion of this White House in
addressing these issues and making sure we’re protecting people’s
fundamental rights.   
   
 Q    So how far is he willing to go?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Jen, last Friday when the President signed the HAVANA Act, he said
that he was determined to get to the bottom of who is responsible —  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.  
   
 Q    — for these incidents.  What is your message for those who are
responsible?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Well, our — well, first, just so people understand, there’s
an assessment that’s being done by our intelligence community,
understanding fully that everybody wants that assessment to be
completed.  We want it to be thorough and people — for people to have
confidence in it once it’s completed.   
   
 Our message to the — to the — I’m not sure what your question is. 
Sorry.  
   
 Q    Well, the administration has said that the victims of these
anomalous health incidents — AHIs — need to be believed.  And in the
statement that the President put out on Friday, he said he wanted to get
to the bottom of, quote, “who is responsible.”  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Absolutely, which is what we’ve been doing and working on
in the intelligence community.  
   
 Q    Right.  So, on the assumption there is a “who,” which is what this
President said, is there a determination for there to be consequences?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Why don’t we wait until there’s an assessment made and then
we can have a further discussion about what the consequences will be.  
   
 Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Oh, go ahead, Nadia.  Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Jen.  I have two questions.  On Lebanon,
first: Does the White House still support an independent investigation
into the explosion at the port?  There was some clashes today; Hezbollah
supporters were trying to block this investigation.   
   
 And I have another question on Iran.  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  Sure.  We, of course, support — and I would reiterate our
support and the inter- — and the support of the international community,
which we’ve voiced on multiple occasions and we — for the
investigation.   
   
 We urge Lebanese authorities to complete a swift and transparent
investigation to the horrific explosion at the Port of Beirut.  The
victims of the August 2020 port explosion deserve justice and those
responsible must be held accountable.   
   
 So, we continue to be strongly supportive of these efforts in the
investigation. 

 Q    And on Iran: The Israeli Foreign Minister articulated yesterday in
the press conference that he actually shared detailed a plan B with the
White House should diplomacy fail in Vienna.   Does the White House — is
the White House open to these suggestions from the Israelis of the “plan
B,” as he put it?

 MS. PSAKI:  Our focus is on diplomacy.  That’s where our efforts are at
this point in time.  I’m not going to entertain a hypothetical at this
point in time.  We’re eager to go back to Vienna and continue the
talks.  
   
 Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Jen, given the First Lady is going to Virginia tomorrow to
campaign, can we expect President Biden will be there in the next two
weeks before the foreign trip?  
   
 MS. PSAKI:  I expect he’ll do more to help his friend, former Governor
Terry McAuliffe, I just don’t have details at this point in time.  
   
 Q    Will that be true in New Jersey as well?  Will President Biden be
traveling there for that election?   
   
 MS. PSAKI:  I don’t — I don’t have anything to preview on either at
this point in time.  But, obviously, we know the elections are soon; the
foreign trip is soon.  And so, by — by asso- — by — we will certainly
have more to convey as soon as details are finalized.  
   
 Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Thank you.  When exactly will travel restrictions be lifted? 
We’ve heard it should be early November.  Is there a precise date, or
when can we expect to know more?

 MS. PSAKI:  It continues to be early November.  That is not a very
expansive period of time.  But, hopefully, we’ll have a date for you all
soon.  We continue to be on track for early November into meeting that
timeline.  
   
 Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Jen, the President has been trying to get OPEC to increase supply
of gas.  Oil prices have been north of $80 a barrel.  Are there any
steps that he’s looking at — new steps to try to deal with some of these
energy issues?

 MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, the President is very focused on this.  He has
asked his team about it.  There are a number of people — senior members
of the White House team from the NSC, from the NEC working on this issue
every single day.   
   
 I would say that part is a supply issue, which is why you asked me
about OPEC.  It’s something we continue to press them on.  But part is
also a logistics issue of being able to move supply around the country. 
And that’s something that we’re also looking into options on.   
   
 I know you didn’t ask me about this, but I’m just going to also convey
— because sometimes they’re combined: the gas issue, as well as the
natural gas issue — which is something that we’ve seen — you know,
people in the Northeast have understandable concerns about what that may
look like for them.   
   
 And I would just note — and we haven’t talked about this a lot, so I
want to raise it — that LIHEAP funding — coverage of LIHEAP funding is
in the American Rescue Plan.  And that is something that we have been
communicating with a number of states and leaders about, and their
ability to access that funding — which is the low-income heating program
I think many of you are familiar with — to help prepare for any increase
in costs.  
   
 But we’re working on both the supply issue and the logistics issue, and
looking at a range of options.   
   
 Go ahead.  
   
 Q    Jen, in Ghana, legislation is pending before lawmakers that would
essentially criminalize being LGBTQ, punishing (inaudible) being LGBTQ
with up to 5 years in prison, and advocacy for LGBTQ people with up to
10 years of prison.  Will the President reach out to his counterpart in
Ghana or partner nations on this legislation?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say that the President believes that
LGBTQI rights are not only human rights here in the United States, but
they are around the world, and they are part of human rights that we
should continue to raise and will continue to raise in our diplomatic
engagements.   
   
I would expect that the State Department would be the first point of
contact, so I would point you to them.  I can also check with them and
see what their conversations have been like.  
   
Go ahead, John.  It was John’s birthday yesterday, so you know I have a
special place for birthdays.    
   
Q    Aww —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  A special place in my heart for birthdays.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you very much, Jen.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He’s 29-plus.  In case anyone is not sure, he’s 29 and a
half.  Happy 29 and a half.  
   
Q    Well, thank you.  
   
Two questions, please.  First, so much has been in the news lately about
Taiwan and the flights from China and statements from President Xi,
essentially underscoring what his predecessors have said: that Taiwan
will be part of the motherland.  Will the U.S. live up to the commitment
of the Taiwan Relations Act of 1978 and send in U.S. forces if Taiwan is
ever attacked?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is rock solid and
contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait and within the region.  This is why we will continue to assist
Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.   
   
Our approach and our U.S. defense relationship, as you referenced, is
guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, and we will uphold our commitment
under the Act.  We will continue to support Taiwan’s self-defense, and
we will continue to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.  
   
Our support for, and defense relationship with, Taiwan remains aligned
against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China.   
   
I’m not in a position to comment on specific operations, engagements, or
training, but I would like to highlight that our support for, and
defense relationship, for Taiwan remains aligned.  
   
Q    Thank you.  My other question is strictly a political question. 
Going back to his days as Senator and Vice President, the President has
worked sedulously as a party leader and Democratic —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Sedulously.  
   
Q    Sedulously.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Ed O’Keefe is very impressed with that word, as am I.  
   
Q    Is he following the race for governor of Texas?  And has he called
Matthew McConaughey and urged him to run for governor?  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I can confirm there has been no calls to Matthew McConaughey
from this office that I am aware of or tracking.  
   
Of course, the President sees his role as governing the country, leading
the country, unifying the country.  He is also the leader of the
Democratic Party.  He’s been in politics — involved in politics for
quite some time.  
   
Some might say he’s a pretty good retail politician, so I can assure you
he is following everything happening out there quite closely.  
   
Q    All right, all right, all right.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. PSAKI:  All right.  Thanks, everyone.  
   
Q    Hey Jen, will he take a physical anytime soon and report it to the
American public?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He will.  
   
Q    How soon — do we know?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have an update for you, but will soon.  
   
Q    But before the end of the year?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I promise you.  Kelly asks about this all the time.  He’s
keeping us on our toes.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Thank you.  
   
4:26 P.M. EDT
