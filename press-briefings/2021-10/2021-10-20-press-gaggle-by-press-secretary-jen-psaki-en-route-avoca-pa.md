Aboard Air Force One  
En Route Avoca, Pennsylvania

3:57 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Good afternoon.  Thanks for joining our trip to Scranton. 
Just a few details about today:  
   
As you may have seen, Senator Bob Casey is joining us on the flight to
Scranton.  And throughout the day, the President will also spend time
with Governor Tom Wolf, Congressman Matt Cartwright, and Scranton Mayor
Paige Cognetti.  
   
In Scranton, the President will tour the Electric City Trolley Museum,
where he will see two trolley cars — a fully restored safety car and the
only surviving car of the first-generation cars that ran on the
Philadelphia and Western Railway — a little bit of history for all of
you today.  
   
As I mentioned yesterday, he will deliver remarks about growing up in
Scranton and the way his childhood influenced his belief that we need an
economy that works for working people, like those in Scranton, instead
of the wealthiest Americans on Wall Street.  
   
Just a few stats for all of you about Pennsylvania and the impacts of
the President’s proposals.  In Pennsylvania, there are 3,353 bridges and
over 7,540 miles of highway in poor condition.  Thanks to the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Deal, Pennsylvania will receive at least $11.3 billion
for federal-aid highways and $1.6 billion for bridges.  
   
The average annual cost of child care for a toddler in Pennsylvania is
$11,400, meaning a two-parent household needs to spend approximately 22
percent of their income to afford center-based care for two young
children.  
   
The plan — the President’s plan ensures that no middle-class family pays
more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care up to age
five, cutting in half spending on child care for most Pennsylvania
families.  
   
Those are just a couple of the benefits.  
   
Also wanted to note today Governor Gavin Newsom’s announcement, given a
lot of interest in supply chains and what we’re doing, signing an
executive order to help alleviate congestion at ports in California by
tackling the shortage of truck drivers and container shortages.  
   
Just for context, the two major ports in California, in Los Angeles and
Long Beach, move about 40 percent of all U.S. imports and 25 percent of
exports for the entire country.  
   
And the executive order will temporarily lift weight limits so that
trucks can carry more cargo.  It also directs the California Labor and
Workforce Development Agency to identify training partnerships to
increase education, career technical education, job training, and
workforce development — all opportunities to get more workers into the
supply chain.  
   
Also wanted to note — and we just sent an advisory, and I’m not sure
you’ve all seen this yet — but, on Monday, the President will travel to
Newark, New Jersey, to continue rallying public support for his
Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and Build Back Better Agenda.  
   
Any other political details would of course be announced by our
political counterparts at the DNC.  
   
With that, let’s take your questions.  
   
Q    Jen, a couple of quick questions on infrastructure.  We understand
that the President had a conversation with Senator Wyden and Congressman
Neal today.  Are there any details you can share with us on that?  
   
And then we are also told that the White House is hoping to reach an
agreement on the framework of the spending deal by Friday and then vote
on the Bipartisan Deal next week.  Is that still the plan?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, I would say I think there is — and I’ll check
on the President’s calls and what more specifics I can offer to all of
you — there are a number of calls that have been happening, including
with some of the members you mentioned, with high-level staff.  They
don’t all involve the President.  
   
But the President has been engaged and will continue to be engaged in
calls throughout the course of the day.  If I can provide specifics on
those, I will provide them to all of you.  
   
In terms of the timeline, as I noted and as we noted in the statement I
put out last night, we expect to make — continue to make progress over
the next several days.   
   
As I think you have seen from the statement we put out but also the
statements from members, leaders, and others who were in the meetings
yesterday, we all agree that there is a — that there has been
significant progress made and that we’re getting closer.  
   
We’re not yet at a final agreement, but we are further defining the
contours of what that will look like.  But I’m not going to set
additional deadlines or timelines on that.  
   
Q    And a quick question on voting rights, Jen.  As you’re aware, the
third Senate vote on voting rights has failed.  And the last time we
really heard from the President on this issue, using the bully pulpit,
was in Tulsa.  And I’m wondering if he plans to do that again, you know,
given the lack of progress on the issue.  
   
And, you know, he also expressed his support for filibuster reform when
it came to the debt ceiling showdown earlier this month.  And then — but
he hasn’t really —  
   
MS. PSAKI:  He didn’t actually issue a statement on that, just to be
clear for the record of the transcript —  
   
Q    No, he did not.  Correct.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  — or say anything publicly on it.  
   
Q    He did not issue a statement.  But he said that — you know, that
there is a high possibility.  And that — that is where he limited his
comments.  
   
And I’m wondering if he’s reconsidering his position at all on the
issue, given the — you know, the third vote on the issue has failed.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, one thing I would note is: The President did issue a
statement this morning about the Voting Rights bill and the vote that
was going to happen this afternoon.  I would expect he will continue to
be out there and be out there in the future, advocating for the
fundamental right to vote, for the need to get this done.  His view is
there is no alternative but to get this through Congress, to make sure
that people’s rights are made law and protected through legislation
passed federally.  That is something he’s going to continue to fight
for.

In terms of the mechanisms of that, we’ll continue to have discussions
with members.  But I would note that, today, what happened was
Republicans in Congress refused to even allow a vote — even allow a vote
to protect people’s votes across the country.  What are they so afraid
of?  Why are they so fearful of allowing more people to have access,
making it easier across the country?  That is an incredible frustration
to the President, to the Vice President, and to many members of the
administration.  I’m sure you will hear more about that in the weeks and
months ahead.

Q Back on infrastructure, can you talk a little bit about the
President?  He seems to have come down on the side of doing more
programs for a shorter period of time instead of going where Speaker
Pelosi is going, which is doing “fewer programs well.”  Shouldn’t he
want to do your programs for a longer period of time, given the
potential for Congress to not renew some of those programs that he’s
really interested in?

MS. PSAKI:  Well, let me be very clear here.  What the President is
focused on with his economic agenda is having an impact immediately on
people’s lives and making sure there is a long-term impact, including
components of these packages that will be permanent.

So, there’s a range of reporting out there, understandably, at this
moment in time.  But the President is absolutely committed to ensuring
there is a long-term impact, meaning components that are permanent, of
this package.  And that’s something that there is broad agreement among
many Democrats about doing.

And as we’re in these discussions and in the heat of these discussions,
working out the nitty-gritty details, what we absolutely know to be the
case is that this package will ensure families crushed by the cost of
care — whether child care, elder care, or pre-K — will get needed
breathing room, including major components, again, that will be
permanent and long term, and that it will also take historic steps in
addressing the climate crisis.

What those look like, that’s what is being discussed and litigated now. 
But for clarity, he’s absolutely committed to having both immediate and
long-term, lasting impacts.

Q And, Jen, on the trip today, what significance should people, the
public take away from the fact that he’s going home to Scranton to make
this speech from Scranton?  And is there a possibility that he will go
to the house?

MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any additional stops to preview for you at this
point.  But I will tell you that, just like anyone — just like many
people, you know, the President’s hometown, where he grew up — you know,
his belief is that growing up in Scranton instilled in him the values
that he has today: how he governs, what’s important, what his priorities
are.  Home is where his — your character is etched.  That is absolutely
the President’s belief, and you’ll hear him talk about that today.

So as people across the country, whether in Scranton or Pennsylvania or
other parts of the country, hear him talk about his fight for making
sure people have access to clean drinking water or broadband access, or
making sure families get a little extra breathing room and can afford
childcare, that is all based in his roots in Scranton, how he grew up,
the communities he grew up in, how he saw some people struggle, and what
he wanted to do when he joined public — when he ran for public life and
has been in public office.

Q I have a question about this report that Senator Manchin was thinking
about switching parties.  Senator Manchin obviously denied it, but is
this something the President is concerned about?  Has he spoken with
Senator Manchin about it?  Did it come up in negotiations?  Because the
report said the senator was upset about how negotiations were going, and
that might make him switch parties.

MS. PSAKI:  I’m not going to speak to an anonymous report about a
senator who can speak for himself.  I will say that the President
considers Senator Manchin a friend, someone that he is aligned with on a
range of values in terms of fighting for working people, making — giving
families extra breathing room.  And that’s something that’s been central
to their discussions and negotiations that the President feels have been
done entirely in good faith.

Q Jen, a couple of foreign policy questions.  Can you clarify the
administration’s position on these Chinese hypersonic missiles?  I mean,
under the wing, the President said that he was concerned about them. 
Earlier this week, the disarmament ambassador mentioned something or was
reported to say something that appears to say that the U.S. should
respond in kind to the militarization of this technology by Russia. 

So if you can clarify U.S. position on that, that would be great.  And
then I have another foreign policy question to follow up.

MS. PSAKI:  I think we’ve actually spoken to this extensively from the
White House, from the State Department.  We’ve issued a statement on it
— not from the White House, but from the administration.  
   
So, in terms of the ask for clarity, I just want to be — state that
clearly, I guess.  We’re not — we’re still not going to comment on any
specific reports.  Generally speaking, we have made clear our concerns,
and I think the President’s comments were reflective of this, about the
military capabilities that the PRC continues to pursue.  So that
continues to be our point of view.  And obviously, we raise that through
diplomatic channels.  
   
Q    Okay.  And another question on Iran.  There’s been a lot of
meetings and a lot of movements lately on Iran.  The — Ambassador Malley
is meeting with the Saudi Prime Minister, as well as Secretary Blinken
meeting with Richard Gossi \[sic\] — Grossi.  Can you give us a little
bit more, again, clarity on — you know, something — I mean, right now,
it seems to be on an impasse and the clock is ticking.  Some — the IAEA
director said that Iran may be capable of making nuclear weapons in a
few months.  So, is there anything that you can give, in terms of moving
the needle forward for the negotiations?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Our objective continues to be pursuing a diplomatic path
forward, and we remain prepared to return to Vienna to have
conversations about — based on compliance for compliance.  Obviously,
we’ve been doing these not directly to date, but that would be the next
step in the process, and our negotiating team is open to pursuing those
discussions.  
   
But I don’t have an update on the status of them at this point in time. 
There’s no question that not having the visibility that we had when the
JCPOA was in place, was law — was something the United States, I should
say, was a part of — is not our preference.  And it’s not in our
national interest, and that’s why we’re eager to get back to the
negotiating table.  
   
Q    And one more on Afghanistan.  Today, I believe, Moscow is convening
a meeting on Afghanistan with several parties.  Does the White House,
does the administration believe that these talks are helpful?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I’d have to get more detail on the exact nature of the
discussions.  Obviously, our focus remains working with like-minded
countries and parties around the world to ensure that we are sending a
clear message to the Taliban about the expectations that there is
freedom for people to depart Afghanistan, that we are allowed to have
flights in, get humanitarian assistance to the right people.  That’s
what we’ve been working through with the U.N. on and working through
with 100 countries around the world.  But I don’t — I can check on more
details about these specific talks.  
   
Q    Jen, then one last one: Has the President wished the Vice President
a happy birthday?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will — I will check with him.  I will check with him.  We
all wish her happy birthday, but I will check with him if they had a —
if he had a chance to do it in person today yet.  
   
Q    On the supply chain, it’s been about a week since the President’s
announcements on keeping the Ports of L.A. and Long Beach open 24
hours.  But now shipping terminal owners are saying that the cost to
unload a container to a trucker on an overnight shift can be five times
as much, that 30 percent of appointments are going unfilled because the
costs are so high.   
   
So, these associated costs — is this sort of undermining or defeating
the purpose of opening 24/7?  And is there anything the administration
is looking to do to help with these increased costs on the overnight
shifts?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, as you know, when we made the announcement last week
about additional steps we were taking to break through the logjam in the
supply chain, there were a couple of steps that we thought would have an
impact over the short term.  One of those is the 24/7 hours.  We’ve seen
some positive impacts — just to be clear about that.   
   
Earlier this week, the Port of Los Angeles executive director said that
we’ve already cut in half the amount of cargo that is sitting on the
docks for 13 days or longer.  That’s a huge step forward.   
   
We also know that this required labor unions, it required workers, it
required the private sector to all be at the table to have a discussion
about the path forward.  That’s what they’ve continued to work
through.   
   
It also requires that we have additional drivers on the — available.  It
requires that we have additional freight trains — freight capacity to
move goods and move supply.  We’ve had a series of announcements about
those as well.   
   
So, in our view, we’re continuing to make progress day by day.  We just
made this announcement last week.  We’re also encouraged by the
announcement by the Governor of California about steps they are taking. 
And all of our shared objective here is to address the bottleneck and
ensure that goods can be moving more quickly.  
   
But I would note that one of the challenges — and any of the people who
are running these ports will tell you this — is that the volume is so
far up from a year ago and even before that.  There’s record volumes of
goods.  And so, what we also need to address is increasing capacity and
ability to move these goods beyond what has happened in the past.  So
that’s why we’re working on it at every step in the process.  
   
Q    And just one on the foreign trip.  The Kremlin said today that it’s
realistic that President Biden and President Putin could meet again
before the end of 2021.  Is that something that could happen on the
margins of the G20?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t know what President Putin’s travel plans are, nor do
I have anything about the trip to announce from our end.  But, you know,
the President has engaged in face-to-face diplomacy with people he has
agreements with and people he has disagreements with.  But I don’t have
anything to preview at this point in time.  
   
Q    Can I ask about the — it’s been widely reported that community
college — the two free years of tuition — is coming out of the bill. 
Understanding that negotiations are still ongoing, can you — I mean,
this was something that was a big priority of the First Lady; the
President went and not only campaigned on it but has talked about it on
the stump.  If you lose that key kind of component of the bill, what
does that — what’s that mean for this overall package?  Is the President
upset that it sounds like it’s something that’s coming out of the bill
right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, first, let me say the President knows that he is not
going to get everything he wants in this package, nor will Speaker
Pelosi, nor will Leader Schumer, and nor will any member of Congress,
probably.  And that’s what compromise and negotiations is all about.   
   
I will say, without getting into any specific components of where it
stands — because the negotiations are ongoing as we speak, right now,
between members — what we are focused on is what we’re going to achieve
out of this.  Right?  
   
So, one of the objectives is certainly making community college more
accessible and affordable to people across the country.  That is
something that continues to be a central part of the discussion and,
yes, is a priority to the President and is a priority to Dr. Biden.  
   
If there are things, and there may be things that may not end up in a
final package, he will continue to fight for them.  But in terms of
where things stand, right now we’re — they’re continuing to discuss the
ways to make it more accessible and affordable.  
   
Q    You kind of talked about Scranton as a — and the President is going
to talk there about sort of his formational things.  You also mentioned
items in the infrastructure bill.   
   
I just wanted to ask kind of fundamentally: Is it tough to communicate
about the Build Back Better bill, the reconciliation bill, when the,
sort of, popular components are coming in, going out, that we’re — you
can’t really tell us what’s in the bill because all of it’s sort of up
for negotiations at this point?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Actually, it’s much easier than you think because most
people out there in the country, in Scranton and in Pennsylvania,
they’re not — they’re not as focused on the machinations of who’s up and
who’s down and the exact numbers.  They’re focused on how this is going
to help them and how it’s going to impact their lives.  
   
So, as I said earlier, I mean, what is very clear here is this package
is going to have a fundamental impact on the care economy and on issues
that impact working people every single day: the cost of childcare, lack
of access to universal pre-K, the cost of eldercare and worry about
caring for parents, people’s concern about the climate and what impact
that’s going to have on their children and grandchildren.  Those are all
impacts of these packages.   
   
So, yes, there are negotiations that are ongoing.  Once there’s a final
bill — I’m not — I don’t know where wood is on this plane, but I’m going
to knock on it — we will be very clear about exactly the components and
how it will exactly impact each community, and we’re looking forward to
that.   
   
But in terms of what we’re trying to accomplish and what we’re trying to
do, that’s what the President is going to be communicating about and
talking about.  
   
Q    Jen, going back to the G20 for a minute: Does the President plan to
announce ambassadors to the UK and Italy before his trip next week?   
   
MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any personnel previews to announce for you. 
I’m not sure what the status is at this point in time, but I don’t —
yeah, go ahead.   
   
Q    Oh, sorry.  And a quick logistical question: I noticed the travel
dates; he’ll be traveling on Halloween.  Does that mean no Halloween
event at the White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  I will — I will leave it to the East Wing to make any
announcements about that.  Obviously, there are steps and precautions
we’ve taken, given we are still in a COVID environment.  I’m not going
to rule out all of us dressing up.  I don’t know.  We’ll see.  Stay
tuned.  But, yes, he will be traveling on Halloween.  
   
Q    Senator Sinema said today — there are reports that Senator Sinema
is not going to budge on increasing corporate income taxes and any
income tax increase.  This has been something that’s been central to
Democrats selling this back home, is we’re going to — you know, it’s
going to create more parity and tax the rich.   
   
Where does the President stand on that?  Is that something that he will
budge on — not increasing corporate income taxes and so forth?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Well, you are familiar with what the President proposed,
which is raising the corporate rate back to what it was during a period
of even the George W. Bush administration.  And he thinks that is not
only fair, it is long overdue and that companies that should be paying
more — could be paying more, should be paying more.   
   
I’m not going to get into what’s in and out, as these are ongoing
negotiations.  But it’s clear where he stands, why he wanted this in the
package.  
   
I will, though, note for you that there are a range of components on tax
fairness that are in the package, including the global minimum tax —
something that we’ve led the world on; something that would ensure that,
of the 50 companies — top companies that paid no tax — they’d be
required to pay a global minimum tax.  And there are other components in
the tax fairness elements that the President is also excited about.  
   
But, yes, he proposed, himself, an increase in the corporate tax because
he thinks it’s fair, it’s right, and it’s long overdue.  
   
Q    Thanks, Jen.  Any timeline on the OSHA ETS, Jen?  I know it’s with
OIRA.  I know you spoke to it a couple of days ago during the briefing. 
But — and, you know, they’re doing these stakeholder meetings, but the
President said that it is — it can be expected soon.  And I’m wondering
if there was any timeline you can preview?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  It’s in the OIRA process.  Just as a matter of policy, we
just don’t preview the timeline on that or speak about their process as
it’s ongoing.  
   
Q    One more thing on North Korea, Jen.  A couple of hours after
yesterday that you said that you were open to negotiation, or the U.S.
is open to negotiation, they launched a ballistic missile.  Can you
comment on that, in terms of, you know, whether North Korea is testing
U.S. resolve?  And what is the U.S. prepared to do about it?  
   
MS. PSAKI:  That’s consistently been our view.  So, we’ve stated our
openness to having discussions with North Korea for months now.   
   
Q    Thank you.  
   
MS. PSAKI:  Thank you, everyone.
