James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

2:07 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone. Okay, a couple of items for all of you at the
top. As the country recovers from this once-in-a-century pandemic and
economic crisis, the private businesses that make up our supply chains
and get goods to businesses and the American people have struggled to
keep up. We’ve talked about this a fair amount in this briefing room.  
   
This is not just happening here at home, but all around the world as
COVID has led to shutdowns and disruptions at ports and factories around
the world.  
   
In June, the White House launched the Supply Chain Disruptions Task
Force to address short-term supply chain bottlenecks. And after working
closely with the leaders and companies at that port — on potential
solutions, we announced a new port envoy to the task force in August.  
   
Solving this issue is going to require cooperation between the private
sector, including rail and trucking, ports, and labor unions. And so,
tomorrow, the President will be meeting with the leadership of the Port
of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, and the International Longshore
and Warehouse Union to discuss the challenges at ports across the
country and actions each partner can take to address these delays.  
   
The administration will also hold a roundtable tomorrow with private
sector companies, including Walmart, UPS, Home Depot, to discuss how the
largest cargo owners and shipping companies can address congestion in
the transportation and logistics supply chain.  
   
We’ll also have a briefing later this evening with all of you, and
people who are not in this room right now, to give you more details on
any announcements for tomorrow.  
   
I also wanted to note — I had one more item. I may — maybe I’ll get back
to it at the end.  
   
It’s also Jenny Leonard’s birthday, so we’ll just note that. Happy
Birthday to Jenny.  
   
There’s going to be a bilateral meeting with the President of Kenya
later this week. I’ll get you more details after the briefing.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen.  
   
MS. PSAKI: And it’s a — it’s remote, obviously.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Is the administration going to sue Texas over the — opposing the
order for the vaccine mandates? And is there a risk that, kind of, the
OSHA efforts essentially get tied up in litigation rather than having
the immediate effect?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, Josh, these requirements are promulgated by federal
law. So, when the President announced his vaccine mandates for
businesses — that, of course, we’re waiting on OSHA regulations, as far
as a next step — that was pursuant to federal law and the implementation
of federal law because it’s an executive order.  
   
So, our intention is to implement and continue to work to implement
these requirements across the country, including in the states where
there are attempts to oppose them.  
   
I will say, since you gave me the opportunity, Governor Abbott’s
executive order banning mandates — and I would also note an announcement
by Governor DeSantis this morning, essentially banning the
implementation of mandates — fit a familiar pattern that we’ve seen of
putting politics ahead of public health. Over 700,000 American lives
have been lost due to COVID-19, including more than 56,000 in Florida
and over 68,000 in Texas. And every leader should be focused on
supporting efforts to save lives and end the pandemic.  
   
Why would you be taking steps that prevent the saving of lives, that
make it more difficult to save lives in — across the country or in any
state?  
   
And I would also note that vaccine requirements have been standard in
both the Lone Star State, Texas — in case you’re not familiar — and the
Sunshine State, Florida, in schools for decades. Whether polio, measles,
mumps, rubella, the chickenpox, there are vaccine requirements that have
been implemented for decades in these states.  
   
So, these decisions put these two leaders out of step with both longtime
requirements — a history of vaccine mandates — but also many business
leaders in their states. And many businesses that are based in their
states, including Disney and American Airlines, that are — these leaders
are taking steps to help boost vaccination rates, reduce deaths,
hospitalizations — reduce hospitalizations, and expand the country’s
labor pool.  
   
So, bottom line is: We’re going to continue to implement the law, which
the President of the United States has the ability, the authority — the
legal authority to do. And we are going to continue to work to get more
people vaccinated, to get out of this pandemic. The President will use
every lever at his disposal to do that.  
   
Q  And then, secondly, the JOLTS report today indicated that nearly 3
percent of U.S. workers quit their jobs in August. That’s 4.3 million
people. Does the administration believe that people quitting is a
positive, because those people will get new jobs that pay more, or a
negative, because of the gravity of the Delta variant?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say that there are different circumstances, as
you know, Josh, depe- — for different people’s lives. And there are
certainly — what we’ve seen through the pandemic, on the positive note,
is that people have made more — decided they have more choices that they
can make. They have taken the period of the pandemic to maybe seek
different forms of employment, different formats of that employment.
Maybe it’s — some of it’s remote working; maybe it’s all remote working;
maybe they’re changing industries and career paths. And some of that —
some of the numbers of people departing — leaving their jobs is
attributed to that.  
   
There are also conditions — so, I can’t give you the exact breakdown. I
guess I’m just conveying that our economists feel that all are true.
There are some conditions where women have left the workforce because of
childcare needs, of — ones they can’t afford, they don’t have the
ability to pay, and because of fears of going into companies or
industries or jobs where they fear that they — there are not the
conditions to be safe.  
   
So, it depends, really, Josh. I think it’s — some — some are positive
conditions and some are more because there haven’t been steps put in
place everywhere, in every industry, that can make people feel safe.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  First, on the G20 call that the President had this morning regarding
Afghanistan. The U.N. said, on Monday, that millions of dollars of aid
are needed to stave off a humanitarian crisis there. I saw the EU
responded by making a new commitment on that front. Did the President
make any new commitments as far as what humanitarian assistance?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we recently announced nearly $64 million in additional
humanitarian assistance — in advance of today, I should say — for the
people of Afghanistan. The United States is the single-largest
humanitarian donor in Afghanistan, providing nearly $330 million this
year alone. And we will continue to take steps to alleviate the
suffering of the Afghan people and call on other donors to step up their
contributions to help deliver critical assistance.  
   
So, the recent $64 million brought us up to 333 \[million\], and makes
us far and away the largest donor.  
   
Q  Okay. And any change to the policy about not unfreezing the central
bank assets that would be available in Afghanistan?  
   
MS. PSAKI: There hasn’t been any change to that policy. No.  
   
Q  Okay. And then, one other thing. I was wondering if you had an update
on Vienna talks and kind of where that stands. I know that there’s
conversations today with the Israeli government. Do you see that
restarting soon? And where is that now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we, of course, keep our partners abreast of our efforts
to pursue a diplomatic path forward as it relates to the P5+1 talks with
Iran. So, certainly, it was a topic of discussion. I don’t have a full
readout quite yet, as it was happening earlier today.  
   
But, in terms of where things stand, that continues to be our preferred
path, our preferred choice. We believe diplomacy is — should always be
the first option.  
   
And I think you may have all seen the Secretary of State convey this
weekend that time is not unlimited, and that remains the case. But we
continue to pursue those — pursue those negotiations. Our team remains
prepared to return for another round of discussions, but I don’t have an
update on when those might occur.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  In the President’s view, where do the talks on the reconciliation
package stand right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, as I think you heard Speaker Pelosi convey this morning
as well — I mean, the President’s view is that we’re continuing to make
progress. We’re having important discussions about what a package that
is smaller than $3.5 trillion would look like.  
   
Those conversations have to happen with a range of members. Those are
happening both at a senior-staff level and also with the President over
the course of the last several days and weeks. Those will continue.  
   
Obviously, we want to get to a point — we are at a point, I should say,
where there are choices that need to be made. That’s the point we’re at
now, given there will be fewer dollars that will be spent.  
   
So — but a lot of those conversations are happening behind the scenes at
the staff level.  
   
Q  And in his view, do Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema need to make a
counteroffer of what they want this to look like?  
   
MS. PSAKI: It’s more of an ongoing conversation than it is a passing
back of dramatic paper every couple of days. So, there’s an ongoing
discussion with Senator Sinema, Senator Manchin. There’s an ongoing
discussion with a range of members of Congress, maj- — range of
Democrats, I should say — about what this looks like.  
   
And again, as Speaker Pelosi alluded to this morning — or said this
morning, this is really the point where decisions need to be made,
choices need to be made.  
   
The President’s preference is the same as the Speaker’s preference. We —
he proposed a $3.5 trillion package. He proposed a broad range of
initiatives that will lower costs for the American people, whether it’s
childcare, eldercare, college, invest in the climate. And no matter how
you cut it though, his view is we can still do something historic and
that will fundamentally change — change the economy for the American
people.  
   
Q  And there are several challenges facing the White House right now:
not just getting Democrats united on the President’s domestic agenda,
but also skyrocketing gas prices, a bad jobs report last week. You’ve
seen several issues, including the President’s poll numbers seem to be
reflecting that. So, how is he viewing all of these challenges that are
facing the White House right now?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, he, one, has an incredible team that’s working on all
these issues at one time. And his view is his responsibility is to
continue to forge ahead every day and to work to address the challenges
the American people are facing.  
   
You didn’t mention COVID, but that continues to be front and center on
the minds of the American people. People want to return back to a
version of normal. They want to go back to knowing that their kids are
safe at school, that they can go to their workplaces, that they don’t
have to fear for their safety in communities. He understands that.
That’s what he’s working on every single day.  
   
I would say that he also recognizes that, right now, getting something
done for the American people; working with members to — members of
Congress to do exactly that; to forge a path forward to unite the
Democratic Party is what people have elected him to do to address the
challenges we’re facing over the long term.  
   
So, I promise you: We don’t get too glum around here. Even if things
look challenging, our view and his view is that he was elected to
continue to press forward and address the challenges the American people
are facing.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. Speaker Pelosi said in a letter last night to House
colleagues that the overwhelming guidance she is getting is that members
of Congress want to “do fewer things well” when it comes to the
reconciliation package — the price tag and what gets included. Does the
President support that approach: doing “fewer things well”?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, she also gave a full press conference this morning
where she addressed this, so I would point you to that. And what she
said in that press conference was: If there are fewer dollars to be
spent, there are choices that need to be made. And the President
agrees.  
   
And that’s fundamentally true, of course. If it’s smaller than $3.5
trillion, which we know it will be, then there are choices that need to
be made. But the President’s view is that a bill that doesn’t pass means
nothing changes, and the challenges we’re facing are too urgent to do
nothing.  
   
So, that’s why, at this point, what we have to do is work with a range
of members who have a range of views about what should be included in
the package; what — what, you know — what is a priority to them so that
we can make some fundamental changes. We are — we are focused on the
impact, and that’s what we’re keeping our eye on.  
   
Q  Is the White House concerned that with the House and Senate on recess
right now, that talks will stall without having lawmakers in
Washington?  
   
MS. PSAKI: The good news is there are phones, and we are quite used to
Zoom conference calls this day and age. And those have continued through
the course of weekends, through the course of nights, even as members
have been away. And we anticipate those will continue at full speed over
the coming days.  
   
Q  And just one more, if I can, on — going back to Texas. What is the
President’s message to businesses in Texas? You’ve mentioned several of
them who are based there.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  When it comes to what the federal guidance is now, and now with the
state executive order, what would the President say to those companies
as they’re determining what they should be doing right now for their
vaccine mandates?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we know that federal law overrides state law. I would
note that earlier, when we put out our guidance on the President’s
announcement about mandates several weeks ago, he made clear — it made
clear that, again, as I said earlier, requirements are promulgated
pursuant to federal law and supersede any contrary state or local law or
ordinance.  
   
Additionally, nothing in this guidance excuses noncompliance with any
applicable state law or municipal ordinance. We put out guidance several
weeks ago conveying that clearly.  
   
But fundamentally, beyond the legal aspect — which is unquestionable, in
our view — the question for any business leader is: What do you want to
do to save more lives in your companies? How are you going to create a
workforce where people feel safe to go into their workplaces? What is
fundamentally in the interest of your businesses over the long term?  
   
And we’ve seen from economist after economist — and, frankly, many
business leaders who have already worked to implement mandates — that
implementing these mandates creates certainty; it reduces the number of
people who are out of work sick, and worse.  
   
And that is good, ultimately, for businesses. It’s good for the economy.
But also, saving lives is something, fundamentally, business leaders can
do by continuing to work to implement these mandates.  
   
But I would note that a lot of these businesses are doing them on their
own to date. We’re still, at the OSHA — in terms of the federal level,
the OSHA requirements are the next step, which we expect to have soon.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. Clearly, Governor Abbott knows that federal rules
supersede state rules, so why do you think he did this?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Politics.  
   
Q  Can you elaborate?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think it’s pretty clear when you make a choice that’s
against all public health information and data out there that it’s not
based on what is in the interest of the people you are governing. It’s
perhaps in the interest of your own politics.  
   
Q  And then, I know you said that there’s going to be a background
briefing later, but is there anything you can tell us about the
stakeholders that the President is meeting with tomorrow and what the
administration can do, is doing about some of these supply
bottlenecks?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, we’re taking a number of steps, which I’m happy
to outline, but let me — let me focus on the ports because that’s
clearly what a focus will be tomorrow.  
   
One of the challenges we’re having is — as you’ve all seen and shown on
many of your networks, and others have reported on — is the delay of
goods getting through to our ports, enabling them to get to people in
the country. We know that’s one of the bottlenecks in the supply
chain.  
   
Now, the supply chain bottlenecks range industry to industry, but we
certainly know addressing that — those bottlenecks at ports could help
address what we see in many industries across the country and, frankly,
are leading people who are preparing for holidays, for Christmas,
whatever they may celebrate — birthdays — to order goods and get them to
people’s homes.  
   
So that’s what he’ll focus on tomorrow, is to talk about what we’re
going to do on ports — something that has been a focus of his for months
now. And he’s, you know, hired people to help address it.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question. You
referenced Speaker Pelosi’s press conference this morning.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  It seemed like she somewhat backtracked from her message yesterday
about what, you know, sort of path Democrats need to take if there are
fewer dollars. It seemed like she was indicating that programs — fewer
programs done well would be the preference, but then this morning said
that the first thing to go would be the timeline.  
   
So has the President given any sort of a push in either direction on
this?  
   
MS. PSAKI: This is all part of the discussion, and I will let you convey
— or ask questions of Speaker Pelosi herself. She’s, as we see — saw
this morning, more than capable of speaking on her own behalf.  
   
But what she was conveying is that while it was the preference — her
preference, the President’s preference — to have the initial package
proposed, what our focus now is on is building a real, tangible package
that can become law and is going to make a transformational difference
in people’s lives.  
   
So, I understand and we all know why we’re talking here about the size
and the cuts, et cetera. But a cut — it’s not a cut just because someone
once proposed something bigger on paper. It’s not a pa- — it’s not a
bill or a policy that’s going to change lives if nothing is passed. And
that’s what we’re working through. There’s a lot of ways to do that, and
that’s the discussion she’s having with her caucus and the President is,
of course, playing a prominent role in.  
   
Q  So, the President doesn’t prefer, then, one avenue or the other?  
   
MS. PSAKI: The President wants to make fundamental change in our
economy, and he feels coming out of the pandemic is exactly the time to
do that. And if we don’t do it now, if we don’t address the cost of
childcare — to go back to Josh’s question earlier — if we don’t address
the climate crisis; if we don’t ensure that universal pre-K is a reality
now, we’re not going to have the same opportunity to do it for some
time.  
   
Q  And I want to get to the supply chain issues. Is there any
consideration of potentially lifting Trump-era tariffs to give some sort
of an immediate relief to this problem? I know that the task force been
talking about long-term solutions, but that’s something that some trade
representatives and business leaders have suggested could have a real
impact right now.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, the task force has actually been talking about a range
of steps that need to be taken. And I think, as you saw by our
announcement or our ambassador — Ambassador Tai’s speech last week, we
are open to considering policies or continuing limited — some policies
if they are in the interest of the American people, in the interest of
our economy.  
   
But, ultimately, what we’re seeing is that — and what he’ll be talking
about tomorrow — is that the ports and the ability to move goods through
ports is certainly one of the big bottlenecks. That’s what he’ll be
addressing.  
   
Now, there are other issues in the supply chain, including manufacturing
and international manufacturing hubs where the issue there is the number
of people who aren’t showing up for work or factories that are shut down
because of COVID. We are still the world’s largest supplier of vaccines,
know-how, manufacturing capacity to help address that.  
   
We’ve seen different types of supply-chain issues as it relates to
lumber, as it relates to chips. There are different solutions for
different industries, and we’re working to address all of them at the
same time.  
   
Q  There are some people who say that the President should be pressuring
unions to loosen work restrictions that are keeping, for instance, truck
drivers limited on their hours behind the wheel or these ports operating
at a less-than-full capacity. What’s the White House answer to that?

MS. PSAKI: I would say we have taken steps at times, when warranted, to
loosen restrictions, as you saw in reaction to some natural disasters
we’ve had over the course of the year.  
   
Ultimately, the President’s focus is addressing the needs, the
challenges, and the threats to the American people of — to their
wellbeing, to their economic wellbeing. And he’ll consider a range of
options. But, again, the Supply Chain Task Force has been working for
months to address these issues.  
   
Q  And one last one: What’s his answer — what’s the White House response
to people who say vaccine mandates have reduced the workforce and
contributed to this problem?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I know world-renowned business, travel, and health
expert Senator Ted Cruz has made that point. But I wouldn’t say that
that is widely acknowledged or echoed by business leaders who have
implemented these mandates, by health experts who have conveyed the way
to get out of the pandemic is to ensure that we’re doing exactly the
steps the President has announced and we are working to implement.  
   
It doesn’t mean this isn’t hard and challenging — of course it is; we’re
in the middle of a global pandemic. But, ultimately, the job of the
President of the United States is to lead, is to follow the advice of
health experts, is to ensure that he is protecting the lives of people
across the country.  
   
So, I know there was a little hubbub over the course of the last few
days about Southwest Airlines. We now know that some of those claims
were absolutely false and, actually, the issues were completely
unrelated to vaccine mandates.  
   
But again, what we’ve seen, business to business, across the country, is
this is the way to save lives, create more certainty; it’s good for the
economy; and it’s something we’re looking forward to implementing.  
   
Q  Given how important the vaccine mandate policy is for the
administration, why is it taking so long to get that rulemaking in
place?  
   
And it seems like a fairly discrete set of issues that — and I know
there’s an interagency process —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.  
   
Q  But hasn’t there been a vacuum left that gets filled by actions by
governors or by dissent among union workers or whatever by not having
the clarity of that rulemaking that we were told was coming weeks ago?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, at the time, just last month, we said it was
coming in “weeks.” That remains the case. And when it’s out, that will
be accurate. But also, there isn’t a big historic precedent for this and
we want to get it right. And the team at OSHA, the team at the
Department of Labor wants to get it right, wants to be able to create
some clarity for businesses around the country.  
   
I would say that requiring and mandating — for businesses of 100 people
or over — vaccines is not a small task; that is a big, bold proposal,
idea, and something that we want to implement with as much clarity as we
can.  
   
We know there will be questions even after these rules are put out. We
understand that. But that’s — that’s why we wanted to take a little bit
of time — not too much time — to get it done.  
   
Q  Can you describe what’s happening behind the scenes? Are there a
group of people who are — this is the only thing they’re working on each
day, or where does this fall on the priority of getting those answers?  
   
MS. PSAKI: It’s — well, it’s a good question because I think it’s
important for people to understand that OSHA, under the Department of
Labor, is working on these regulations. This is not something that is
being done out of the White House. They are the ones working through
this, as they should.  
   
And I can’t give you any expectation of when that will be finalized.
There’ll be a public rulemaking. The — they’ll be made public so
everybody can see them. There’ll be a comment period, as there always
are for regulations.  
   
Q  The President has a long relationship with labor unions of various
types. And in that community, whether they’re professional athletes in a
labor union or law enforcement, there are some people who are speaking
out against the vaccine mandates. And one of the things they’re saying
is it should be a part of collective bargaining. How does the President
view that, when it comes to these requirements?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Look, as you know, the President is a huge supporter,
throughout his lifetime in public office, for labor unions, the roles
they play for collective bargaining, for the role they play in standing
up for workers and workers’ rights.  
   
I would note, though, we’re in the middle of a pandemic here. And what
we’re trying to do is we’re trying to save more lives without delay,
understanding there is a process for rulemaking, as there should be.  
   
But we’re working to implement these as quickly as we can so that
businesses can have certainty, so that workers can have certainty, so
that people can return to the workplace who are fearful, so that we can
work to return to closer — to a period of closer-to-normal.  
   
So, he always welcomes the input, the views of labor unions, and
certainly has heard their — their concerns in this regard. But — but I
think it’s also important to remember we’re in the middle of a
pandemic.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Two questions on diplomacy: On the G20 call this morning, it was
reported that neither Vladimir Putin nor Xi Jinping were on the call.
Was the President disappointed by that? And does he feel it was a
fruitful meeting without them?  
   
MS. PSAKI: It was a meeting organized by the Italians, so I would
certainly point you to them for confirmation of who may or may not have
attended.  
   
But I would note that it is still fruitful, of course, to have an
opportunity — or this is how the President views it — to discuss the
efforts to work together on counterterrorism, work to — including
against the — including against threats from ISIS-K, to ensure safe
passage for those foreign nationals and Afghan partners with
documentation seeking to depart Afghanistan.  
   
And during this call, the leaders who did attend reaffirmed their
collective commitment to provide humanitarian assistance directly to the
Afghan people, something that was noted earlier through independent
international organizations. And we are committed to working with our
partners to do exactly that.  
   
So, again, I would — it was a — it was a call or was a meeting organized
by the Italians. They can confirm the list of attendees. But the
President did see it as an opportunity and a constructive opportunity to
discuss counterterrorism efforts and efforts to provide international
humanitarian assistance.  
   
Q  Victoria Nuland is now in Moscow for meetings with the Russians.
What’s the White House’s assessment of how those talks are proceeding?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I’d really point you to the State Department on that, Steve.
I — I would — I would guess that she’s having quite constructive,
productive meetings on the ground while she’s there. I know she’s
meeting with a range of leaders on the ground, but I don’t have more
details from here. I’d point you to the State Department for that.  
   
Q  Jen, Joe Donnelly has been picked by the President to be the next
ambassador to the Holy See, the Vatican. Why Mr. Donnelly?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Mr. Donnelly is someone who has a long record in public
service. He’s somebody who has — the President feels will represent the
United States and our interests quite well as Vat- — as Ambassador to
the Holy See. And he’s looking forward to his confirmation.  
   
Q  And when the President meets with the Pope later this month, what
does he hope to discuss with the Pope?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any more details on the trip. I’m sure we’ll
have some soon.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thank you, Jen. I have a climate question. What is the minimum that
the President wants Congress to do or give him before he goes to these
important international climate meetings?  
   
And if they can’t pass Build Back Better by the time he has to go, does
going to these meetings empty handed undermine U.S. leadership on
climate?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say, first, I don’t have a new deadline to
convey from here. What is clear — but what you’re asking about, I think,
is how will the international community will react to what’s happening
domestically — just to kind of breakdown the question.  
   
What I think is very clear to the international community — and they can
all speak for themselves, too — is that President Biden came into office
absolutely committed to regaining America’s seat at the table in
international diplomacy, including in climate.  
   
One of the first steps he took was to rejoin the Paris Climate
Agreement. He has taken steps that he could take of his own accord here
— working with car companies and auto manufacturers to ensure we are
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even without Congressional action.
And he has proposed a bold, ambitious, climate agenda here in the United
States that he’s working to move through Congress.  
   
So, his commitment to these issues, his dedication to taking action here
domestically so that the United States can be a leader internationally
should be unquestionable on the international stage. And I think that’s
the message he’ll convey, regardless of where the package stands.  
   
Q  Even if he doesn’t get it done?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We — we want — we intend to get it, but I’m not going to set
a new timeline.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Sure. The White House announced that Jill Biden is headed to Virginia
to campaign for Terry McAuliffe. Can you give a sense of what Joe Biden
will be doing over the next couple of weeks in Virginia or to campaign
for McAuliffe? Has he been asked to come?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any updates on travel. I would expect we will
have more to convey soon about his plans to support the election of
former Governor McAuliffe.  
   
Q  And one more, just on the G20 this morning: I wonder if there was any
sense of frustration on the part of our allies or a sense that the U.S.
has an obligation to do more because of our withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Can you give any more on that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: More than being far and away the largest provider of
humanitarian assistance?  
   
Q  That’s what I’m asking you.  
   
MS. PSAKI: I would point you to our allies; I haven’t heard them have
that complaint.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Thanks, Jen. As the price tag comes down on the reconciliation
package, are you all — are there certain payfors that you are also
becoming more amenable to negotiating on then — for instance, staying at
the corporate tax rate now, for instance? Are there policies like that
that you all are coming down on?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say that because the package will not be $3.5
trillion — as you all know, it will be smaller, as everyone has
acknowledged — you won’t need the same number of payfors, obviously. It
doesn’t require a mathematician. I think that’s why you’re asking the
question.  
   
But, in terms of what those look like, there have been a range of
proposals the President has conveyed he supports, as it — as it relates
to payfors.  
   
Ultimately, he wants to make the tax system more fair. Raising the
corporate rate, asking the highest-income Americans to pay more is
certainly part of — a part of what he has proposed. But that’s all a
part of the discussion as we speak.  
   
Q  And earlier — you just said that if you all don’t act on some of this
social spending, you’re not going to have the opportunity to do it for
some time. Was that a speculation on the midterms or what — what did you
mean by that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: No, no it was not. It was conveying that this is a moment,
coming out of a pandemic, to change fundamentally how we invest in our
workforce, how we invest in American families, how we think about what
our priorities are in the United States.  
   
Is our priority making sure that people can afford childcare so that
they can join the workforce? Is it or is it not? Is our priority doing
more to address the climate crisis? Is it or is it not? And coming out
of a pandemic is exactly a moment to do that.  
   
It was not a political — it was not a political assessment. It was more
about the moment we’re coming out of now.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Hi. So, it’s been six weeks since the drone strike in Kabul, and the
administration said that they would consider giving compensation to the
family who lost people. The L.A. Times reported today that no one has
reached out to them. Can you say why?  
   
MS. PSAKI: It’s really under the purview of the Department of Defense. I
would point you to them. I’m happy to check with them too and see if
there’s an update.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s case is before the Supreme
Court this week, and the Justice Department is seeking to reinstate the
death penalty in his case. Does the President support that approach? And
if so, how does that square with the current federal death penalty
moratorium and his campaign promise to try to outright eliminate the
death penalty at the federal level?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have anything more on this case. I’m happy to talk to
the President and see if there’s more we can convey. I’d really point
you to the Department of Justice.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Is the White House considering any out — options outside of Congress
before December to deal with the debt limit, such as invoking the 14th
Amendment?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We had — as had been reported, there had been a look at a
range of options that had been — and the — the decision or evaluation
been made that there was not a viable option beyond working through
Congress. That has not changed. So that will continue to be our focus.  
   
We will work, of course, with Leader Schumer, with Speaker Pelosi about
what the path forward looks like.  
   
The good news is that, last week, we saw that we could pass — raising —
raise the debt limit through regular order. That could happen in a
bipartisan manner — something that’s happened 80 times prior to last
week. But that is what we plan on pursuing.  
   
Q  And just a quick follow-up because Pelosi said today that she thinks
a bill that would change the debt ceiling process by giving power to
Treasury to lift it has — you know, quote, “has merit.” So, does the
administration think that Congress should pursue a bill like that?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, we have about — we have just a couple of weeks left
before we need to raise the debt limit. So, that’s what our focus is on
now. There’s plenty of time after that to have a discussion about what
it looks like moving forward.  
   
There’s no question that we don’t want it to be a political football any
more in the future. But, right now, we’re focused on working with
Congress to raise the debt limit.  
   
Go ahead, Jenny.  
   
Q  Thanks. On inflation and the supply chain disruptions that you just
mentioned: Federal Reserve official Raphael Bostic said today that
inflation may not be transitory and that, “It’s becoming increasingly
clear” — this is a quote — “that the feature of this episode that has
animated price pressures… will not be brief.” And, “by this definition…
the forces are not transitory.”  
   
Does the White House still believe that inflation is a transitory
problem?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I know the Federal Reserve comes — I understand he’s a
representative of the Federal Reserve, though —  
   
Q  Yes. (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. PSAKI: — and it is under their purview, but they do have regular
updates on predictions of inflation and what it looks like in the coming
year. I don’t think they have revised that — unless you tell me
otherwise — officially. The OECD has also predict — predicted that it
would come down in the next year.  
   
But bottom line is: Our focus is on preventing inflationary pressures
from being an issue in the future. And that’s why the President is
committed to moving forward with his Build Back Better agenda, with his
Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan, investments on proposals that outside
economists have said would help address this over the long term.  
   
Q  And then one more. Do you have any update for us on President Biden’s
meeting with President Xi of China?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any update at this point. It’s just something
that we’re working through and in discussions about at a staff level.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Jen, the Foreign Minister of Israel showed concern about the — to
Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, that Iran is getting
closer and closer to obtain a nuclear weapon. Do you think that
President Biden will discuss (inaudible) on the table if Iran doesn’t —
did not follow through with a negotiation with your diplomatic that is
taking place in Geneva?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, our objective continues to be moving forward on a
diplomatic path. And there’s no question that we’re in the position
we’re in now because the prior administration pulled out of the Iran
Nuclear Deal, taking away that visibility into what their capacity, what
their capabilities were.  
   
But our focus is on working to see if we can return to another round of
talks in Vienna. Beyond that, I’m not going to get into a
hypothetical.  
   
Q  What does it take — what does it take — sorry, quick question: What
does it take for the White House — on the Iraqi election, there’s a lot
of changes. Some Iran — pro-Iran groups are saying this is not a fair
election. So, what is the take of the White House?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  Thank you.    
   
MS. PSAKI: So, we congratulate the Iraqi government on having fulfilled
its promise to hold earlier elections. We are pleased that the election
days were largely conducted peacefully. We’ve seen the preliminary
results announced by the Iraqi Independent High Electoral Commission
yesterday and are waiting for the final certified results.  
   
These elections included hundreds of international monitors and
observers from the U.N. and EU, in addition to thousands of domestic
observers. We look forward to reviewing their reports.  
   
Once the final results are certified, we hope that the new Council of
Representative members will form a government that reflects the will of
the Iraqi people and which can work to address Iraq’s governance,
security, and economic challenges.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q  Hi, Jen. Can you confirm that U.S. personnel in Colombia have
reported anomalous health incidents that’s being investigated as Havana
Syndrome?  
   
MS. PSAKI: We don’t confirm individual reports. What we do do is take
every report that comes through our interagency quite seriously, as
we’ve talked about in here prior.  
   
This administration has made addressing Havana Syndrome, or anomalous
health incidents — whatever you want to call them — we have — we have
refocused the efforts on it after they had not been focused on for some
time. That includes ensuring that — the President signed a law last
week, ensuring that health — that assistance — medical assistance,
funding for medical assistance was provided to anyone who needed it;
that we have a process within key agencies to ensure we’re addressing
it, and making sure people get the assistance they need.  
   
But we are still in the attribution phase. That is still being
considered. And we don’t confirm individual incidents.  
   
Q  And then a follow-up on Texas. Unrelated issue.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure.  
   
Q  You talked about continuing on with implementation. Should we expect
the administration to make legal filings in Texas challenging Governor
Abbott’s order as the administration moves forward with implementation
of the OSHA rule and of the federal — the mandate for federal
employees?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, the next step is the regulations coming from OSHA.  
   
In terms of legal action, I’d point you the Department of Justice. I
don’t have anything to predict on that front.  
   
Q  And on the — oh, thank you, Jen. It’s been a bit, so I hope to ask
you quickly about three different subject areas if that’s all right.   
   
The first subject area is: We, at the New York Post, reported on Friday
that the First Son had sold five prints of his artworks for $75,000
each, and that a team of lawyers is reviewing the prospective buyers who
are booked to be allowed into an upcoming New York show. That seems to
suggest a departure from the White-House-brokered agreement where the
purchasers would be anonymous. I was hoping you could say if the White
House knows who purchased the five prints and whether there is indeed a
departure to the arrangement that there would be an anonymity here?  
   
MS. PSAKI: I know this is your favorite topic, but it, again — it still
is the purview of the gallerist. We still do not know and will not know
who purchases any paintings. And the President remains proud of his
son.  
   
Q  So, White House — or —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Did you have another question on something else? Otherwise,
we’re going to move on —  
   
Q  Yes. Yes, I do.  
   
MS. PSAKI: — to some other topics.  
   
Q  I do.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Lots going on in the world.  
   
Q  Yes, so, I — about Build Back Better and tax policy. I’d like to ask
you about proposed tax increases and proposed tighter tax enforcement.
President Biden often describes raising taxes on higher incomes as a
matter of fairness and enforcing current tax policy as a matter of
people paying their fair share.  
   
But Republicans in Congress, led by Representative Jim Banks, are
pointing to a recent Congressional Research Service report which they
say underscores that President Biden allegedly owes $500,000 in Medicare
taxes that he didn’t pay by, allegedly, improperly categorizing $13
million in income routed through S corporations in 2017 to 2018.  
   
So, tax law expert Robert Willens, who teaches at Columbia University,
said, quote, in my case — “in my view, the case can easily be made,” end
quote, by the IRS that President Biden owes back taxes under current
law. So, as he campaigns for —  
   
MS. PSAKI: This is a very long question. I think I know where you’re
getting at.  This has been debunked, as you probably know. Also, he’s
released many, many years of his tax returns so people can check them
out.  
   
Q  No, it hasn’t been debunked. Though, I did cite an expert —  
   
MS. PSAKI: Okay. Go ahead, George. Go ahead. Go ahead.  
   
Q  But, will President Biden be paying —  
   
MS. PSAKI: I think we’re going to move on —  
   
Q  — the back taxes?  
   
MS. PSAKI: — to some more topics.  
   
Go ahead, George.  
   
Q  Yeah, I wanted to follow on your answer about the challenges —
specifically, the calendar. There are 50 days between now and
December.  
   
MS. PSAKI: \[Looks over shoulder.\] I was like, “Is there a calendar up
here?” (Laughter.) Okay. I was surprise — I was like thrilled to hear
it.  
   
But go ahead.  
   
Q  In your head. There 50 days between now and December 3rd. You lose a
week to foreign travel.  
   
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.  
   
Q  You lose a week to Thanksgiving. That’s not a lot of time for, you
know, funding government, raising the debt limit, and your two bills.
Can you talk for a second about the time pressure and the calendar
challenge of getting this done?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, George, I think it’s going to be quite a busy
week after Thanksgiving, so everybody get ready — get your rest during
that period of time.  
   
Look, I think Congress can get things done quickly and rapidly — often
they do it under time pressure. We certainly understand that.  
   
You are right that time is not unlimited, and we want to move not just,
of course, keeping the government open and funding the government, as we
should, but also raising the debt limit and also getting the President’s
agenda moved forward and across the finish line. And so that is going to
require a lot between now and the end of the year.  
   
But, you know, we recognize the challenge of timing. That’s why there’s
so much work happening behind the scenes, even when peo- — even when
Congress isn’t in session, there’s calls, there’s video conferences, and
we’re constantly working here to move all of these parts of the agenda
forward.  
   
There are some things that could happen quickly. Congress could just
vote to raise the debt limit — an up-or-down vote — (snaps fingers) —
would just be really quick. That’s possible. Same on funding the
government.  
   
All of that can happen. And then we can move forward on key components
of the President’s agenda that will fundamentally change the economy and
make the lives of so many people in this country better.  
   
Yamiche, go ahead.  
   
Q  Hi. Thanks, Jen. My first question is: What role does President Biden
see for himself in helping Democrats figure out what to take out of the
bill? If — I understand that you don’t want to say whether or not he
agrees with Nancy Pelosi — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying “fewer
things” should be done “well.” But I wonder, what does he want this — is
he actively giving people, “Here’s what I want to see in this bill”?
Does he see that as his role?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, he sees his role as doing what the American people sent
him to the White House to do, which is to find common ground so that we
can move forward with an agenda that the American people demand we
pass.  
   
And, you know, his view is also that building a real, tangible package
is what our focus is on right now. It is not about dismantling a
hypothetical package. It is about how we build the best package, based
on the ideas he’s proposed, that can fundamentally change people’s lives
and make them better. So, he’s going to be, of course, actively involved
in the discussions as he’s been — has been at every point in this
discussion.  
   
But again, you know, his view is that an alternative to a deal isn’t a
hypothetical bigger plan; it’s nothing. And we can’t afford to do
nothing. So what he’s trying to do is move everybody forward toward a
unified path so that we can make some big changes for the American
people.  
   
Q  So does he see it as inappropriate then to say, “I want climate
change and childcare definitely and other things might need to be cut,”
in the way that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi essentially said today? Or
does he think that it has to be the lawmakers that decide what comes out
of this bill?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Well, I — that’s not what I heard her say today. But again,
she — she can, of course — more than capable of speaking for herself.  
   
But what I heard her say today is that a bill that doesn’t pass means
nothing; it’s nothing. So, what you need to do if you want to get all
those things done — make a historic investment in climate change, if you
want to address some fundamental inequalities in this country, if you
want to cut costs for the American people — you need to find common
ground.  
   
It doesn’t mean you’re going to get everything you want. The President
knows that. The Speaker knows that. That can be — you can have a moment
of disappointment on that as well.  
   
But ultimately, his role is to work to bring people together, to find a
unified path forward so that we can get something historic done.  
   
Q  And one — and a quick follow-up or a quick other question, which is:
This weekend, we saw former President Trump go to a rally in Iowa, make
all sorts of claims that are clearly not true. But we saw high-profile
GOP officials there, including Chuck Grassley, who is the
longest-serving senator in Congress.  
   
What does the President make of what — of not only what President —
former President Trump is saying, but the fact that there are GOP
lawmakers, elected officials who are willing to still stand by him and
go up in front of these crowds with — with these claims that are clearly
false?  
   
MS. PSAKI: The President’s focus is on working to deliver for the
American people. He didn’t watch the rally, I can assure you of that.
I’m not sure he’s even seen clips of the rally.  
   
Q  Is he worried about the threat? Is he worried about this?  
   
MS. PSAKI: Of course he’s worried about the threat. I think he’s talked
about what we saw on January 6th — the threat of one of the darkest days
in our democracy, what we’ve seen in the blind — people blindly
following what we know are debunked, sometimes conspiracy theories, the
spreading of misinformation, whether it’s about democracy or COVID. Of
course he’s concerned about that.  
   
But the best role he can play — the most important thing he can do is to
work to lead the country, to bring people together in areas where we
agree, to get things done, to deliver, to show the American people that
government can work for them. And that’s what he’s going to spend his
time and energy focused on.

Go ahead.

Q  Hey, Jen. Thank you. So, you said June — the Supply Chain Disruption
Task Force was assembled. I’m just curious why it took so long for the
President to get together with two port heads, as well as all the
shipping companies, to figure out what’s wrong with the supply chain
since it’s been an issue for most of the year.

MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say that the President has — the Supply Chain
Task Force has been working around the clock for months and months now
to address a range of different issues that we see in the supply chain.

And as you know because you cover this pretty closely, there are issues
at the ports and addressing the bottlenecks at the ports. Those have
been on the rise recently, but it’s something that he’s been working on
and his team has been working on.

There are also a range of different issues in the supply chain. It’s not
just domestically; it’s globally as well. It’s one of the reasons we’ve
been — of course, it’s morally right, too — but such a huge contributor
to the global effort to get the pandemic under control, to ensure we’re
making sure manufacturing facilities are staying open.

It’s why he’s pressed so hard for the CHIPS legislation, to ensure that
the semiconductor shortage is something that doesn’t halt production for
the auto industry.

So, it’s not just one issue in the supply chain, as you well know; it’s
multiple issues. That’s why the team has been working for several months
to address it. And tomorrow is another opportunity. We’ve done several
supply chain events to lift this up and tell the American people what
we’re doing to help address the bottlenecks.

Q  But are they — are we behind the curve? Is the President behind the
curve rather than trying to get in front of this issue?

MS. PSAKI: He’s been working on these issues for months. I mean, I know
it’s been up in front in the news in the last few weeks, but these are
issues the President has been focused on since he took office. And
that’s why he has a dedicated team both in the NEC, in Department of
Treasury, across the interagency to help address these issues. It’s a
fundamental challenge, as the economy is turning back on, and one he has
been focused on from the first day.

Go ahead.

Q  Jen, I just had a couple of quick timing —

MS. PSAKI: Sure.

Q  — questions. On the FDA Commissioner — I know we keep asking you
about this.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q  One, do you have any update? And can you address concerns about
morale and stability at the agency since this is taking so long to get a
nominee?

MS. PSAKI: Have you heard there’s morale and stability issues?

Q  Yeah. There has been reporting that, you know, just the lack of a
permanent commissioner, people feel there is not stability there.
Obviously, we saw concerns come to surface about morale when it came to
the decision over the boosters in — with two of the vaccine officials
resigning. So, yeah, there has been reporting for a few months around
concerns there.

MS. PSAKI: Well, I would, just to quote Nancy Pelosi — Speaker Nancy
Pelosi — again: “An anecdote is not the basis of data.”

So, I would say, one, we are very focused on ensuring there’s an FDA
commissioner in place, nominating exactly the right person. I don’t have
an update on the timing. I understand why you all are asking about that,
but I’m not going to get ahead of the President.

I will also note that the FDA and any of our agencies are full of career
employees, talented officials, who’ve — many of them — who’ve worked at
these agencies for years, if not decades, who have moved forward on the
approval of vaccines, the approval of boosters, the approval of, you
know, a range of treatments that can help save lives in the public.

So, they also deserve credit for what they’ve done. But I would say the
overemphasis on a nominee takes away, in some ways — unintentionally —
from the fact that there are people who are doing their jobs every day,
and we have an acting FDA commissioner doing that as well.

Q  And another thing we keep asking you about: the President’s physical.
Last month, you said it would be soon. We’re now in October. Do you have
any update? And why is it taking so long? Is the President just very
busy? Does he, you know, not want to (inaudible) to the doctor?

MS. PSAKI: He is very busy, but it — but it is standard for every
President to get a physical. He will get a physical too. When he gets a
physical, we will make all of that information available to all of you.

Q  Thanks, Jen.

MS. PSAKI: Okay. Thanks, everybody.

Q  Do you still plan on it being this year — for the physical — this
year?

MS. PSAKI: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, everyone.

2:56 P.M. EDT
