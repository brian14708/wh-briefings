11:04 A.M. EDT  
   
MODERATOR:  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining the call.  This
call will be on background, attributable to a “senior administration
official.”  For your awareness, not for reporting, on the line is
\[senior administration official\].  The contents of this call will be
embargoed until the end of the call.   
   
And, with that, I’ll hand it over to \[senior administration
official\].   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thanks, \[moderator\].  And,
thanks, everyone for joining us.   
   
On April 15th, fighting erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces and
the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.  The outbreak scuttled more than
a year of negotiations to resume civilian rule and extinguished the hope
and promise of the Sudanese revolution.   
   
President Biden said on May 4th this violence is “a betrayal of the
Sudanese people’s clear demand for civilian government and a transition
to democracy.”   
   
In the intervening weeks, in addition to assisting with the evacuation
of U.S. citizens and third-country nationals, the U.S. government has
been involved in negotiating a series of ceasefires between the warring
parties.  These agreements have been repeatedly violated, and the people
of Sudan have suffered because of it.  There have been regular reports
of airstrikes, intense fighting, rape of young women and girls, the
pillaging of humanitarian goods and hospital supplies.  There are
currently 1 million people internally displaced, and 375,000 people have
fled to neighboring countries.   
   
The Sudanese people deserve better.  Today, the United States has taken
a series of actions to hold the parties accountable and to deny them the
resources, funds, and weapons that have enabled them to perpetuate this
horrific conflict.   
   
Specifically, the Department of Treasury has sanctioned four companies —
two affiliated with the SAF and two affiliated with the RSF.   
   
The Defense Industries System is Sudan’s largest defense enterprise.  It
manufactures a range of small arms, conventional weapons, ammunition,
and military vehicles for the SAF.   
   
Sudan Master Technology is an arms company that has been involved in the
production of weapons and vehicles for the SAF.  Al Junaid Multi
Activities is controlled by RSF Commander Hemedti and his brother, Abdul
Rahim.   
   
This company operates 11 subsidiaries across multiple economic sectors,
including the gold industry, which is a vital source of revenue for the
Dagalo family and the RSF.   
   
And finally, Tradive General Trading is a front company controlled by
another Dagalo brother, Major Algoney.  It has produced vehicles for the
RSF.  Some of these have been retrofitted with machine guns for the RSF
to patrol the streets of Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan.   
   
In addition, the Department of State has imposed visa restrictions on
specific individuals in Sudan, including officials from the SAF, RSF,
and leaders from the former Omar al-Bashir regime that have been
responsible for or complicit in undermining Sudan’s democratic
transition.  
   
Finally, the Department of State, Treasury, Commerce, Labor, and the
U.S. Agency for International Development — USAID — have issued an
update to the business advisory originally in May 2022 to highlight the
growing risks associated with the conflict to U.S. businesses and
individuals.   
   
The United States is resolute in our belief that only a diplomatic
solution will resolve the conflict.  There is no military solution.  We
know that.  The international community knows that.  It’s up to the
parties to recognize that and take actions towards peace in good faith
for the sake of the people.   
   
We will continue to support the people of Sudan in their aspirations for
civilian rule and marshal humanitarian assistance — over $245 million so
far — to help Sudanese in country and those who have fled across
borders.   
   
These actions flows directly from President Biden’s commitment to end of
the fighting.  We will not hesitate to take additional steps if the
parties continue to destroy their country and thwart the resumption of a
civilian transition.   
   
With that, I can take questions.   
   
Q    Thank you.  Thanks so much for doing the call.  I have a couple of
questions.  One, if the talks in Jeddah had not collapsed, would these
sanctions still have been imposed today?  Can you give us a little more
detail on the timing here?  
   
Then, I know that visa sanctions are confidential, but are these people
who this will actually matter to them?  Were they traveling to the
United States?  Like, what impact will these visa sanctions have on
these officials?  
   
Thank you.   
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, as I said, Jennifer, from the
beginning, President Biden has — gave himself the authority to impose
sanctions to address the violence, to end impunity, to hold people
accountable, and to push the parties towards a negotiation so that we
can resume the civilian transition.   
   
These sanctions were already being considered long before there was a
formal announcement by the staff that they were going to pull out of
negotiations.   
   
It’s important, in our view, to hold people accountable and to recognize
that until the calculus on both parties change, they will continue to
fight each other and destroy this country.  
   
I’m going to refer you to State on any questions around visa and those
sorts of consular processes.  
   
Q    Thank you so much.  Thanks, \[senior administration officials\].  I
have a question.  What is your ultimate goal of imposing these
sanctions?  And at what level do you think these sanctions will be
waived?  Let’s say both parties keep engaging in this conflict; these
sanctions will stay.  But what if they decided to go into a truce that
lasted, let’s say, for a month or so?  Does that mean these sanctions
will be waived?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  (Inaudible.)  In the first instance, we
need to hold people accountable for the violence and the destruction of
Sudan.  
   
Two, we’re focused on behavior change.  They are — the two parties have
not abided by the various ceasefires that they have signed.  They have
not adhered to the principles of international and humanitarian law. 
And so by focusing on the way in which they conduct this war, how they
access funds, how they access weapons, it is our goal to change their
calculus and to create a scenario in which the guns will finally be
silenced and we can get on with the important task of meeting the
aspirations of the Sudanese people for a democratic transition.  
   
I’m not going to speculate on a hypothetical situation at this point. 
We’re focused on the current travesty and tragedy in Sudan and trying to
stop it.  
   
Q    Hi, thanks for doing this.  Given how the talks in Jeddah failed,
what’s next?  Are your plans just announcing sanctions and waiting, or
is there another proactive strategy here to try to hash out a ceasefire
or humanitarian corridors?  
   
And then, you talked about the need to hold people accountable, so why
not sanction Burhan and Hemedti themselves, given that they are the
principal drivers of this conflict?  Thanks.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Robbie.  So, first, just a
little background on where we understand the negotiations in Jeddah
are.   
   
As you know, the SAF announced — formally announced their suspension in
the talks.  So the reality is that neither parties have left Jeddah at
this point.  They continue to talk, and they are looking for
confidence-building measures.  So that is where the current status of
Jeddah is.  
   
But I think it’s important to zoom out and talk about the fact that this
was emergency diplomacy focused narrowly on silencing the guns and
getting in humanitarian assistance.  Far too little got in during the
ceasefire, although we believe that we were able to support almost 2
million people in Sudan when the fighting — the intensity of the
fighting lowered.  
   
The focus and ultimate goal, of course, is that we need to have
civilians in the lead, (inaudible) the transition, focused on the most
important issues that affect their lives.  
   
And so while there has been this narrow conversation about silencing the
guns, it is equally important for us to work with the Sudanese people,
as well as the broader international community, including the African
Union, the Arab League, the U.N., IGAD, to move forward on civilian
transition.  
   
Q    I want to understand: Is Hemedti (inaudible) and Burhan included in
this visa restriction decision?  And why not? Everybody is saying it’s
kind of personal between these two generals in Sudan.  And if measures
aren’t taking against them, nothing would change.  Can you elaborate a
little bit?  And what’s next?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you so much for that question. 
So, first, our visa sanctions are private, and I would refer you to the
State Department if you have additional questions on that.  
   
Second, the most important thing that we can do to stop the fighting is
to stop their access to weapons, resources, and funding.  So we think
the most important thing that we can do here is to tighten the screws on
these two groups, make it more difficult for them to perpetuate this
conflict.  That doesn’t mean that there aren’t future opportunities to
pursue more sanctions, and we’re prepared to do so.   
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you so much for doing this.  I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit about enforcement of the sanctions and if you
expect that there will be any difficulties with that.  Have you had
conversations with the UAE, for example, about the enforcement?  
   
And I know you can’t speak to the individuals that were hit with visa
restrictions, but could you talk a little bit about the role that you
evaluate Bashir or individuals are playing in the current situation? 
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  Daphne, can you repeat just the
last part of your question?  
   
Q    Yes.  Sorry.  I know you can’t speak to, like, what individuals
were hit with visa restrictions, but could you talk a little bit about
the role that you evaluate Bashir or individuals are playing in the
current situation?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  Thank you so much for that
question.  
   
When we impose sanctions that — where the authorities are from the
executive order, we work with Treasury and our diplomats to make sure
that there is compliance.   
   
So, if these companies are operating, or have financial flows to — in
other countries, then we will engage with those countries to ensure
compliance with the sanctions.   
   
With respect to the elements of the former Bashir regime, you may know
that many of them are — remain as part of the Sudanese Armed Forces. 
They have violated our laws multiple times.  We have sanctioned
different elements of his government in the past, for the genocide in
Darfur and in other crimes.  
   
And, you know, our concern remains they have been freed during the
violence and that they pose a negative influence on resolving this
conflict.  So, that is why we included them in the visa sanctions.   
   
Q    Hello, can you hear me?  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, please go ahead.  
   
Q    Perfect.  Thank you so much for doing this.  I have a few
questions.   
   
First, are there any concerns about the amount of uncoordinated
initiatives when it comes to Sudan?  And do you feel that this could
potentially undermine the connected effort to reach a resolution?  
   
And my second question is, are there any concerns about the potential
economic or humanitarian consequences of the sanctions imposed lately? 
And thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you for that question.  It is our
view that the urgency of the crisis is what is generating multiple
regional partners from seeking a solution.  It does pose a challenge to
coordinate.  But the goal is shared by all of us to resolve the
conflict.  We have had very productive conversations with the African
Union and with IGAD and the Arab — the Arab League.  
   
So, we are already doing the coordination with — we welcome the
continued ideation and proposals that different partners are coming to
the table with.  And I expect that we will continue to work very closely
to make sure that what the international community is proposing
separately and collectively meets what the Sudanese people are asking
for, to end the conflict and resume the civilian — the civilian
transition.  
   
With respect to the effects on humanitarian assistance, again, as I said
earlier, we have already provided $245 million worth of assistance for
Sudan and its neighbors.  I will defer you to Treasury, but there are
often — we provide carveouts and different methods and measures and so
that we — the sanctions will not affect the flow of humanitarian
assistance and medical (inaudible).  We generally issue general licenses
to enable that.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you.  If you could — I guess just two small things you
can hit on.  One, the level of coordination with the Saudis.  And are
they going to follow a similar trajectory here to put pressures on both
sides?   
   
And then, to what end is — are these sanctions meaningful and not — you
know, they can go to other countries to get arms and supplies.  How much
of this is symbolic versus meaningful to having an actual impact on both
sides?  Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, okay.  Thank you so much for that
question.  
   
Let me reiterate what I said at the top: that we’re working closely with
our international partners to resolve and end this conflict.  That
includes the Saudis, who have hosted these talks for multiple weeks and
have worked closely with us to forge a ceasefire that has unfortunately
been violated and not adhered to, but who are as committed as we are to
end this conflict.  
   
I will defer to you to talk to the Saudis about their own measures.   
   
These are authorities that we have, that the President gave us on May
4th, that we decided to use.  The targeting of the companies is far from
symbolic.  It is choking these governments’ — these parties’ — excuse me
— access to weapons and resources that allow them to perpetuate the
conflict.  And they ideally will have a chilling effect on other
countries who would engage with these four companies.  
   
Q    Thank you so much for doing this, \[senior administration
official\].  On these sanctions, what’s your timeline for assessing
whether they’re actually going to work?  And what would that look
like?  
   
And then, secondly, just looking forward, what sort of action might the
administration want to see from either the U.S. Congress or from the
African Union in further dealing with this conflict?  Because it seems
like sanctions alone will not bring about an end to this.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, the assessment on how effective the
sanctions will be will in part reflect on whether the parties seem more
willing, able, and compliant with ceasefire agreements that have been
negotiated and end this conflict.   
   
It will — there’s not a date certain when would we review how the
sanctions are going.  It’s supposed to be cumulative in effect, and it’s
supposed to complement the diplomacy, which is the most important sort
of element of what we are doing here.  
   
In terms of our partners, let me just flag the close cooperation that
we’ve had with the African Union, who has issued their own plan to
address the conflict and who we are in close coordination with
throughout this progress.   
   
As I said in an earlier question, we believe it’s really important to
join hands with elements of our government and the legislative branch as
well as our international partners to resolve this urgent, devastating
conflict.  And we continue to have robust conversations with all
stakeholders who care about Sudan and who are devastated by what has
happened to this country following the hope of the 2019 revolution.  
   
Q    Yeah.  Thank you for taking my question.  Yesterday, I spent time
with the U.S. — the Sudanese Ambassador to the U.S.  And he said that
the reason that they are leaving the ceasefire is because RSF are not
doing their job and the U.S. sends mixed messages, saying that the
ceasefire has been — has collapsed but not actually naming the people
who are responsible for that.  
   
So, I’m wondering: Are you intending — are you having any conversation
with the RSF (inaudible) to be, you know, boycotting the ceasefire?  
   
Thank you.  
   
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you, Simon.  As I said earlier,
there have been serious violations on both sides: pillaging of
humanitarian warehouses, hospitals; the rape of women and girls;
airstrikes that have destroyed the city; intense fighting in Darfur.   
   
So, both parties are responsible for this conflict, which is why we
imposed sanctions on companies affiliated with both parties.   
   
Also, we’ll just underscore that while the SAF has officially withdrawn
from the Jeddah process, they remain in Saudi Arabia, talking to the
RSF, contemplating confidence-building measures.  
   
So, there is — diplomacy is always our main line of defense.  We will
continue to work with the parties to address the very narrow objective
of silencing the guns, at getting humanitarian assistance in.  The more
— the most important thing, ultimately, of course, is to work with the
Sudanese to center the effort around Sudanese people and our
international partners to restore the transition to civilian rule.   
   
Thank you.  
   
MODERATOR:  Thank you, everyone.  Just as a reminder, this call was on
background, attributable to a “senior administration official,” and the
embargo is now lifted.  
   
Have a great day.
