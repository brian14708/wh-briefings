En Route West Hartford, Connecticut

12:46 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. DALTON:  And, hey, everybody, they’re telling us that there’s going
to be some turbulence in about 15 minutes, so we’re going to try to keep
this concise here. 

Good morning, everyone.  We’re en route to West Hartford, Connecticut,
my hometown, where the President will celebrate the anniversary of the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, legislation he signed last year with
the help of decades of work by gun safety advocates and survivors. 

Earlier this week, the First Lady joined Gabby Giffords at an event for
the Giffords Law Center in San Francisco to highlight the President’s
action and leadership on addressing gun violence. 

This morning, the White House announced new actions that HHS and the
Education Department are taking to help schools access mental health
resources and training for students to better prevent and respond to gun
violence in schools. 

And today, the President will also highlight progress at the state level
and call for state legislatures across the country and Congress to take
additional action. 

Connecticut has been a leader on gun safety legislation, particularly in
the decade following the tragedy at Sandy Hook.  Just over a week ago,
Governor Lamont signed a gun violence prevention bill, which contains
more than a dozen measures to improve gun safety, including
strengthening the state’s ban on assault weapons and secure storage
requirements. 

Other states are taking action too.  This year, Illinois and Washington
made historic pro- — progress by passing assault weapons bans.  And now
10 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting
assault weapons.  Michigan and Minnesota passed legislation to establish
extreme risk protection orders, and existing laws were strengthened in
Colorado and Vermont.  In total, 21 states and the District of Columbia
now have these laws on the books. 

And Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, and Washington have all enacted measures
to hold gun manufacturers account- — and dealers accountable. 

Since 2021, seven states have passed laws to increase accountability for
the guns industry.  This is the kind of progress the President will
continue to press on lawmakers at every level to accelerate. 

In some other news today, the President announced his intent to appoint
Dr. Mandy Cohen as the Director of the CDC.  Dr. Cohen is one of the
nation’s top physicians and health leaders with experience leading large
and complex organizations and a proven track record protecting
Americans’ health and safety. 

As Secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human
Services, Dr. Cohen developed innovative and nationally recognized
programs that improve the health and lives of families across the
state. 

Her leadership through the COVID-19 crisis drew bipartisan praise, as
did her successful transformation of North Carolina’s Medicaid program
and pivotal role in the bipartisan passage of Medicaid expansion.  
   
Dr. Cohen has been recognized by leaders from both parties for her
ability to find common ground and put complex policy into action. 

The President looks forward to working with her as she leads our
nation’s finest scientists and public health experts with integrity and
transparency.

And turning to an I-95 bridge collapse update: Tomorrow, Saturday, June
17th, President Biden will receive an aerial tour of the site of the
I-95 highway collapse and receive a briefing on emergency repair and
reconstruction efforts.

The President will be joined on the tour by Pennsylvania Governor Josh
Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey, Congressman Brendan Boyle, and Philadelphia
Mayor Jim Kenney. 

President Biden has instructed his team to move heaven and earth and
work around the clock to ensure the fastest possible reconstruction of
the highway. 

U.S. Department of Transportation officials were on the ground within
hours, and the Federal Highway Administration has already advanced the
first $3 million dollars in federal emergency relief funding. 

While in Philadelphia, the President will provide an update on his
administration’s work to aid state and local reconstruction efforts. 

I also want to note that neither the President’s aerial tour nor his
travel in the city tomorrow will interfere with the traffic around the
highway, the detour routes, or the reconstruction efforts. 

And finally, I just want to give you all a look at — look very quickly
at the week ahead. 

Tomorrow, the President will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as I
just said, and receive an aerial tour of the I-95 highway collapse. 
Later, the President and the First Lady will deliver remarks at a
political rally hosted by union members.  And in the evening, the
President and First Lady will travel to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where
they will stay through the remai- — remainder of the weekend.  
   
On Monday, the President will travel to the San Francisco Bay area,
where he will remain until Wednesday, and then return to the White House
from California. 

On Thursday, the President and First Lady will host Prime Minister
Narendra — Narendra Modi of the Republic of India for an official state
visit, which will include a state dinner.  The Vice President and the
Second Gentleman will attend. 

And on Friday, the President will travel to Camp David where he will
remain over the weekend. 

Colleen, do you want to kick us off?

Q    Yes.  Does the administration have a comment on the Justice
Department’s decision related to the Minneapolis Police Department and
the, sort of, discrimination against minorities, long before George
Floyd?

MS. DALTON:  We just saw the — the release come across from the
Department of Justice.  We’re reviewing that report now.  And we refer
you to the DOJ for any specific details contained therein.   
   
But more broadly speaking, I would just say that the President has — has
long talked about his work to make our communities safer, including
through advancing effective and accountable policing — community
policing.  And he has talked about the need to pass the George Floyd
Justice in Policing Act.   
   
And so those efforts will continue.  But certainly with respect to any
details of this report, right now I’d refer you to the DOJ.   
   
Q    Do you want to react to anything that Vladimir Putin said today,
including that they — Russia has stationed a nuclear weapon in
Belarus?  
   
MS. DALTON:  So we are aware of those comments.  As we’ve said before,
we believe this kind of nuclear rhetoric is highly irresponsible. 
There’s just no room for it.  It is highly irresponsible.  And I would
just reiterate, as we’ve also said in recent days, we’ve seen no
indication nor reason to adjust our nuclear posture at this moment in
time.   
   
But we are also reaffirming — taking this opportunity to reaffirm our
commitment to the NATO Alliance’s collective defense.  
   
Q    Olivia, there were reports out of Europe today that the President
urged Secretary General Stoltenberg to stay on at NATO.  Can you confirm
that he asked him to extend his term further?  And do you have any
comment on those?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I have no updates to share with you today.  But I would
just say that, as the President has said himself in recent days, NATO
has never been stronger, more unified than it is today as a result of
the United States leadership and others in the Alliance coming together
and working tightly across the — on Ukraine and across — on other issues
across the globe.   
   
The President has complete confidence in Secretary General Stoltenberg. 
You saw they just met at the White House last — this — earlier this
week.   
   
But with respect to any upcoming changes, that is something that
certainly the United States will stay in close touch with its partners
and Allies about and reach a consensus decision.   
   
I — but I don’t have any news to share with you today on that.  
   
Q    Does the White House have any more details on who was behind the
cyberattack yesterday and what federal agencies or how many were
impacted by it?  
   
MS. DALTON:  So with respect to the cyberattack, the — about two weeks
ago, the company involved released a patch.  The CISA and FBI have
worked with government agencies as well as those outside the government
that were impacted in order to make sure that their software is updated
and that they are taking the — the most secure action that they can to
protect themselves.   
   
Right now, I can tell you the FBI is investigating.  I don’t have
additional details to share at the moment.   
   
Q    Can you give us a sense of what the President is going to do next
week in California?  Will he meet with anyone?  Will he meet with
Governor Newsom?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Stay tuned for more in California.  We’ll probably have
more to share this weekend on his travels next week.  
   
Q    There has been a longstanding logjam on any of the sort of gun
control measures that the President wants.  Obviously, the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act was something of a breakthrough but not the sort
of ban that he wants.  Is there realistically anything that would change
if Republicans remain in control of the House and Democrats don’t have a
bulletproof Senate majority?  Like, really, what could the President do
to break through this?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Well, as you know, the President signed the bipartisan
Safer Communities Act into law last year.  That was legislation that was
30 years in the making.  People didn’t think that that could get done on
day one of this administration, and this President signed it into
law.   
   
He’s also signed now two dozen executive actions that we’re continuing
to implement and take action to strengthen gun safety across this
country.   
   
The President doesn’t believe that inaction is acceptable at a time
where guns are the number one killer of kids in our country.  
   
At a time where every day you open the newspaper and see reports of
communities across the country wracked by gun violence, the President
believes that it’s our responsibility to continue to do everything that
we can to fight the scourge of gun violence.   
   
Certainly, the President is doing everything within his power.  He will
continue to call on Congress to take action to ban assault weapons, like
he successfully was able to lead Congress to do in 1994, to end this
immunity from liability from gun man- — for gun manufacturers, to
require national sta- — safe storage law, to take additional actions to
hold gun manufacturers accountable.   
   
And so, you know, part of what today is about is to find where there are
opportunities for us to press forward at the state level as well.   
   
You know, I just highlighted some of the actions that Connecticut, other
states across the country are taking in the absence of meaningful action
by Republicans in Congress.  
   
So, the President is going to continue to focus on this, do everything
in his power, do everything to use the — seize the bully pulpit, and
make whatever progress we can, because as we see every day, Americans
are paying with their lives for the inaction we’re seeing.  
   
Q    NBC reported today that President Biden had to be talked out of his
call with President Xi after the balloon was shot down.  Where — and he
thought he — his relationship with Xi could tamp down the situation. 
So, I’m wondering: Where does the President believe that his
relationship with Xi stands right now?  And does a call seem likely
after the Blinken visit?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I think that the President did not have to be talked out of
a call with President Xi.  We’ve been very clear and consistent about
the need to maintain multiple lines of communication with China.  And
that’s part of why Secretary Blinken is headed to the region very
shortly.  
   
Look, stepping back here, China is seeing that, right now, the United
States is in a place where we are better positioned than ever before to
outcompete them in the decade ahead.   
   
We’ve added 13 million jobs.  Twelve million new businesses have been
created.  Under this President’s leadership, we’ve attracted nearly $500
billion in private investment.  We are reshoring hundreds of thousands
of manufacturing jobs.   
   
Over the next decade, we’re positioned to build a billion solar panels
in the United States, a million electric vehicles, 100,000 wind
turbines, billions — literally billions, with a “B” —
semiconductor-power- — -powered pieces of technology in our country.  
   
And so that’s the context through which, you know, in this moment of
increased competition that we’re seeing, we believe it’s incredibly
important to also maintain robust diplomacy and ensure that that
competition does not veer into a place of conflict.  
   
Q    Do you have a reaction to —  
   
Q    What — sorry, just to follow-up.  What does the President hope that
Secretary Blinken will accomplish on the trip?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Well, I just sort of talked about this idea that right in
this era, where we are better positioned than ever to outcompete China,
that we want to make sure that there are open lines of communication and
that we are engaged in a robust level of diplomacy that helps us avoid
conflict, avoid misperceptions, avoid miscalculation, and really
responsibly manage any tension.  That is the larger goal.  
   
And with respect to any particular deliverables, I would just refer you
to the State Department on that.  
   
Q    Do you have a reaction to the synagogue — Pittsburgh synagogue
guilty verdict today?  And that’s a verdict that could bring the death
penalty with it.  But first, just a reaction.  
   
MS. DALTON:  Sure.  Well, with respect to the sentencing, I want to be
careful to leave that to the DOJ.  They make those independent
decisions.  And so, it would be inappropriate for us to speak to that.  
   
But broadly speaking, I — I do want to communicate that the President’s
thoughts, his prayers, the First Lady’s thoughts and prayers, are with
all of the victims, the survivors, their families of this horrific
shooting in Pittsburgh in 2018.  
   
Certainly, I think it’s important to remember, when you look back at the
reason why the President ran for office in the first place, he talked
about, you know, watching antisemitic bile being spewed on the streets
of Charlottesville that were reminiscent of what we saw on the streets
of Europe in the 1930s.  And it inspired him to run for office, to fight
for the soul of our nation, to root out hate wherever it rears up.  
   
And he, just in the last couple of weeks, released historic
administration policy on combating antisemitism, which contained over a
hundred actions that we’re going to be taking across the federal
government to combat antisemitism, as well as a hundred actions that
external stakeholders we hope will take to help root out this evil in
our society.  
   
And so, you know, I just would leave it there and — and just underscore
that today, first and foremost, the President, the First Lady, their
thoughts, their prayers are with everybody impacted by this horrible,
heinous attack.  
   
Q    What have you seen on the — whether you guys will do a two-and-two
with the India Prime Minister later this week?  
   
MS. DALTON:  We’ll have some more on — of the tick-tock of the state
visit to share early next week.  I just don’t have that for you right
now.   
   
Q    There’s some bipartisan legislation on the Hill — the Senate,
actually — that would claw back executive pay from banks like Silicon
Valley Bank that — that failed and needed the government inter- — to
intervene.  Does the White House have an opinion on that legislation? 
Are you supportive of it?  
   
MS. DALTON:  So this is actually the second piece of bipartisan
legislation that has been introduced to do just that.  And without
commenting on a particular piece of legislation — of course, back in
March, the President talked about his support for implementing — or
legislating new policies to be able to give regulators the tool to claw
back compensation from senior executives of failed banks and to have
more accountability.   
   
And so, certainly we are, broadly speaking, support- –supportive of
bipartisan efforts in Congress to address the things that the President
has proposed.  And we’re taking a look at these pieces of legislation,
without weighing on them, but just say, broadly, you know, these are
reflective of the kinds of accountability measures the President has
been seeking.   
   
Q    Do you have a response to the — the ship that capsized off of
Greece?  Hundreds of migrants coming in from Libya probably died.   
   
MS. DALTON:  Sorry, can you say the last part?  
   
Q    Hun- — I believe that hundreds of migrants were killed when this
ship capsized that were coming over from Libya to Greece.   
   
MS. DALTON:  Certainly saw those reports this morning; were
devastating.  I don’t have any, you know, readouts of conversations with
counterparts in — in those countries to read out quite yet.  But I’ll
follow up with more detail as we have them.  
   
Q    Olivia, next weekend, we know the Vice President is giving a major
speech to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court overturin- —
overturning Roe v. Wade.  Can you tell us what the President is going to
do to mark the anniversary?  
   
MS. DALTON:  Right now, I can tell you: You can expect the President to
mark this anniversary.  As we’ve seen over the last — just this past few
months, we’ve seen more than 300 pieces of legislation introduced across
this country attempting to restrict women’s access to reproductive care,
in some cases imperiling their health and their safety and their
lives.   
   
More than 23 million women now live in states where there are severe
restrictions on reproductive healthcare.  And that’s simply unacceptable
to this President.  It’s an unacceptable risk to this President and this
Vice President.  
   
As you just mentioned, the Vice President will be speaking in North
Carolina, which is home to a draconian abortion ban that was — that went
into law over the veto of the state’s governor, just in the last couple
of weeks — excuse me.  And she’ll talk about how that impacts negatively
— how that’s going to harm women across the state of North Carolina and
across the South.   
   
And so, certainly you can expect the President to mark this date as well
next week.  I don’t have details to share quite yet.  But certainly this
is something we feel is important, and the President will continue to
fight.   
   
Q    Was the President briefed on the severe weather in Texas or in the
—  
   
MS. DALTON:  Yes.  
   
Q    — South last night?   
   
MS. DALTON:  So, the President has been briefed.  Our team — the White
House team has reached out to Governor Abbott’s office and also been in
touch with Governor Stitt’s office and — and Governor Stitt himself in
Oklahoma.  We’ve also been in touch with local officials in these areas
to offer whatever federal support we can, in order to make sure that
they have what they need as they recover.   
   
I would just say, you know, also on a, you know, personal level, the
President and the First Lady, they’ve seen these devastating images out
of the region, and certainly their — their hearts, their thoughts go out
to the families who are hurting today, to the people who have been
killed and injured, to the people who are still learning the fate of
their loved ones.   
   
And so, you know, we’re prepared to offer whatever federal assistance we
can in the days ahead.   
   
Q    Can you tell us anything about the — the campaign event in
Greenwich?  What’s he doing there?  
   
MS. DALTON:  I can’t speak to that.  I’d have to refer you to the DNC
since it’s a political event.  But I’ll, on that note, leave it there. 
See you guys later.   
   
1:05 P.M. EDT
