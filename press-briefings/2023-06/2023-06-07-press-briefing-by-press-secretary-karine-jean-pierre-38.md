James S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:40 P.M. EDT  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Good afternoon, everybody.  
   
Q    Good afternoon.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, so I wanted to provide an update on the wildfire
smoke impacting millions of Americans across the country right now.  
   
The President was briefed on the wildfires in Canada last week and has
been regularly updated since.  He directed his team to provide impacted
communities whatever support they need.  
   
Our team here at the White House is in touch with the government of
Canada.  We have already deployed over 600 U.S. firefighters and
personnel, as well as equipment like water bombers to help Canada battle
the fires.  
   
We also have been in close touch with state and local leaders, including
— including in Michigan, Illinois, and New York.  And multiple agencies,
including the Environmental Protection Agency, CDC, and FEMA, are
coordinating with state, local, and Tribal governments to get timely and
accurate information out to communities about local air quality
conditions and what steps they can take to protect themselves.  
   
We encourage everyone in the impacted areas to listen — to listen to
their state and local officials.   
   
Check in on your neighbors, check in on your — your friends and your
family.  
   
Take precautions, especially if you are — if you have health
conditions.  
   
You can also go to AirNow.gov.  That’s A- — A-I-R-N-O-W-dot-gov.  Again,
that’s AirNow.gov to get real-time information about air quality and
precautions you can take.  Or download the app, the AirNow app, from the
App Store as well.  And you are able to do that.  
   
Now, I know for many communities out West, this is nothing new.  They
experience this every year, but it is certainly getting worse.  It is
yet another alarming example of the ways in which the climate crisis is
disturbing our lives and our communities.  That’s why, from day one,
President Biden rightfully recognized the climate crisis — climate
change as one of — one of the four crisis facing our nation as he was
coming into the Oval Office after being inaugurated, and why he — why he
made tackling climate change one of his top priorities and has done
historic investments in doing just that: taken — taken — moved forward
with historic — historic policies.  
   
And so, with that, I’ll go to the — we’ll continue to keep — keep up and
continue to get updated on what’s happening.   
   
So the next thing I have here is I also wanted to take a moment to
highlight important progress states are making with President Biden’s
full support to make our community safer from gun violence.  
   
Over the past week, Connecticut, Vermont, Colorado, Hawaii have all
enacted commonsense gun safety bills that will save lives.   
   
And here are a few examples that’s what’s happening in those particular
states.  
   
In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont signed a gun violence prevention
bill that will strengthen safe storage requirements, close loopholes in
the state’s ban on assault weapons, expand accountability for gun
dealer, and more.  
   
And in Colorado, Governor Jared Polis signed a law cracking down on
unserialized firearms known as ghost guns.   
   
This progress comes as 10 states and including D.C. have now passed
statewide assault weapons ban.   
   
With every tragic shooting we see across America, we see the urgency of
action at every level of our government.  The President thanks and
applauds the advocates and state leaders who worked tirelessly to enact
these latest gun safety measures and continue to urge others to follow
their lead on Congress to act at the federal level.  
   
Today, the Council of Economic Advisers released a blog showing grocery
inflation is indeed slowing, with prices of eggs and produce, such as
vegetables and fruit, falling in recent months.   
   
As you know, grocery prices rose because of the global supply chain
bottleneck and unforeseen supply shocks like avian flu and war in
Ukraine and also poor weather.  
   
As we’ve worked to address those bottlenecks and supply shocks,
inflation for groceries is indeed cooling.  Of course, we still have a
lot more work to do, as you hear from us, from this administration,
which is why the President’s team is responding quickly to avian flu
outbreaks among bird populations, increasing competition in meat
industry, and strengthening supply chains that were weakened by COVID
and Putin’s war in Ukraine.  
   
And finally, I’d like to make an announcement that the President will
welcome Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, also known as NATO, to the White House on Monday, June
12th, to discuss the upcoming NATO Summit that’s going to be occurring
in Lithuania.  
   
President Biden and Secretary General Stoltenberg will review
preparations for the summit, including the work to further strengthen
Allied — Allied deterrence and defense, build on the 2014 Wales Summit
Defense Investment Pledge, and deepen NATO’s partnership.  They will
also discuss Ally support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal war
of aggression.  
   
With that, good to see you.  Go ahead.  
   
Q    Good to see you.  First on — ask on Ukraine.  Does the
administration have any better insight on who or what caused the
collapse of the dam?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’re still assessing what happened.  We’re
— we are indeed in touch with the Ukrainians.  It is — the damage,
obviously, and the devastation that we’re seeing is heartbreaking.  We
will do everything that we can to help the people of Ukraine,
certainly.  
   
But I’ll say this — and you’ve heard us say this before, just yesterday:
Russia has no business to be there in the first place.  And, you know,
Russia — this was — this dam was under Russia’s control, and they bear
responsibility for the destruction caused by this war.  And we will do
everything that we can to support the people of Ukraine at this
difficult time.  
   
Q    And if I could just ask on the smoke.  Is the White House, and
particularly the President, taking any sort of further precautions, just
for your own personal safety?  And is this going to change at all — I
know earlier today, at least, it sounded like tomorrow might be worse in
the Washington area.  And there’s supposed to be a big event on the
South Lawn.  Is anything being changed up at the White House as a
result?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So in regards to the Pride event, as you just
mentioned, Aamer, which is going to be on the South Lawn tomorrow, I
don’t have any logistical updates to share at the moment.  But, of
course, we’re going to continue to monitor the situation.  Just don’t
have anything to share at this time. 

As far as if we’re going to be changing our approach here at the White
House, we just don’t have any changes and updates to — to report at this
time.

Go ahead.

Q    Just, I guess, to follow up on that: Has been — the President been
advised to wear a mask if he’s outside, given that the D.C. air quality
is Code Red today?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I’m aware that the D.C. qa- — quality is Code
Red.  And I would — and for folks who are watching at home or at work,
you can go to the EPA — certainly, the EPA website, and there’s a map of
what your area — what code — color your area is.

I just don’t have anything to share on what the President is going to be
— any changes to how the President is going to be approaching this.  So
just don’t have anything at this time. 

Q    And two questions, if I can, to follow up from yesterday.  Does the
White House now have any reaction to the merger of the PGA and LIV
Golf?  And did this issue come up during Secretary Blinken’s meeting
yesterday with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I can say this: The State Department — my colleague
at the State Department, they put out a readout of the meeting that
Secretary Blinken had with the Saudi Arabia government.  So I would
refer you to their readout.  I’m sure it’s available online at the State
Department. 

So, again, we’re just not going to comment on this deal.  We are — the —
we’re going to let the two parties speak for themselves. 

What we’re going to focus on from here is — is we’re going to continue
to meet our commitment to the American people at home and abroad.  And
certainly — certainly that includes the Middle East as well. 

We’re just not going to comment at this time. 

Q    Just one more try at this.  Some Senate Democrats are not really
happy with the announcement of this merger.  The Senate Finance
Chairman, Ron Wyden, said they’re going to launch a comprehensive
investigation into this.  He said it looks like a cash grab, pla- —
plain and simple, and it raises troubling questions. 

Does the White House support Senate Democrats doing —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re just —

Q    — that investigation?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   We’re just not going to comment.  The House, the
Congress is going to move forward the way that they are going to move
forward.  This is co-equal government, as you all know.  I just don’t
have an assessment on this.  I don’t have a comment on this.  This is a
private entity.  And we are being consistent here on not commenting on
the actions of or mergers of private entities.

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  Does the White House have a position on whether
Florida sending migrants to California, or any other state for that
matter, is — amounts to false imprisonment and kidnapping of those
migrants?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, one of the things — and you’ve heard me say this
multiple times from here — is about what these political stunts and what
they mean: They’re dangerous, and they’re unacceptable.  I said this
yesterday, and I’ll say this again.   
   
And we’ve seen them happen over the last couple of months, and all they
do is cause confusion.  And why is it they want to cause chaos and
confusion?  It doesn’t make sense to me. 

And so all unlawful border crossing, as I mentioned yesterday, are
down.  They’re down by 70 percent since the President enacted his plan
after Title 42 was lifted early — or mid-May. 

And so we’re addressing the challenges, as we have done.  We’ve — we’ve
done that through deterrence.  We’ve done that through diplomacy.  And
we’ve done that through enforcement. 

And so, again, the plan that he’s doing is working.  And so I just don’t
understand what are these governors doing.  Why are they causing chaos? 
Why are they causing confusion?  What does that actually do for their
constituency or for the people who are being put on these planes or on
the buses?  And it just doesn’t make sense. 

They’re playing games, and political stunts just are not going to
actually deal with the issue at hand.  And they can come — they can come
meet us at the middle.  They can come and do a bipartisan piece of
legislation or look at the legislation that the President put forward on
day one — a comprehensive immigration policy that he put forward,
legislation. 

Why not look at that and come to the table and have that discussion with
us, instead of, again, doing these political stunts?  And it hurts.  It
only hurts local governments.  It only hurts other states.  And they’re
doing this without reaching out to those local government or sta- — and
states.  And it is putting people at risk.  And it’s dangerous and,
again, unacceptable.

Q    Beyond — or in addition, perhaps — to being a political stunt, do
you think or does the White House think that it’s breaking the law?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m going to be careful here.  I cannot
speak to the law.  I know that — I know comments have been made about a
particular governor, who’s now a candidate, who have been accused of
sending these migrants, so I want to be really careful because he’s a
candidate, so I want to follow the Hatch Act.  So those are the two —

Q    But he did that in his action as a governor, not as a candidate.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I just want to be — I still have to say this and
be very, very careful.  And what I will say more —

Q    Yeah, but just to clear, it’s about his action as a governor.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  All right.  I’m just also being clear that he’s
also a candidate, and so I want to be careful and also just put that out
there for the American people. 

But I will say, more broadly speaking, if folks are eager to see
firsthand the significant drop in unlawful border — border crossings
since the President put in his plan and that went into full effect, you
know — so, I mean, that’s what they need to look at.  They need to look
at the numbers and the data that we have seen.  Seventy percent. 
Seventy percent that it’s come down. 

And so, you know, it is — you know, it is — what they’re doing is
completely — completely dangerous.  And so I cannot speak to the legal
action.  I cannot speak to if it’s legal or not. 

What I can say: It causes confusion, it’s dangerous, and it is
unacceptable.  And it doesn’t solve the actual problem that we have at
hand.

Go ahead.

Q    Karine, thanks.  Questions on two topics.  But first, I just want
to quickly follow up on the question about LIV Golf and the PGA Tour. 
President Biden has been very direct in the past about expressing his
concerns about human rights violations in Saudi Arabia, about the Crown
Prince’s role in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Do you
really mean to say that you have no comments on this massive investment
by Saudi Arabia taking a huge foothold in one of the U.S.’s biggest
sports?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, we’ve been very clear, when it comes to mergers,
when it comes to a private entity, we do not comment.  I mean, that is
not — that is not unnatural, that is not uncommon from us here at the
White House.  
   
Look when it comes to human —  
   
Q    This is involving a foreign government that —   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait.  Wait, let me finish.  
   
Q    — the U.S. has massive equities with.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let — let me — let me finish.  When it comes to human
rights, we have been very clear: This President has not shied away on
calling that out, and he’s done that with Saudi Arabia, he’s done that
with other countries.  We’ve been very clear about that.  We will speak
out.  We do not shy away from that and been, again, very, very clear:
When it comes to a merger with these two entities, that is something
that we are just not going to comment on.   
   
But when it comes to human rights, we’ve been very clear.  We’re going
to call that out.  We are going to call that out with countries just
across the globe.  And the President has done that in these last two
years.   
   
Q    Okay.  And then in terms of the first topic, dockworkers are
disrupting operations at major West Coast international ports over a
labor dispute.  The National Retail Administration is calling on the
administration to intervene in negotiations to solve that labor
dispute.  We also have UPS workers that are currently voting on whether
or not to strike if they don’t have a new contract by August 1st. 

Does the administration plan to intervene in any of those labor
disputes?   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So when it comes to the West ports, I can say that the
President respects the collective bargaining process as the best way for
workers and employers to reach mutually beneficial solutions, which he —
we have said before.  And Acting Secretary Su and others in the
administration are regularly engaging with the parties, encouraging them
to stay at the negotiating table and finish their work.   
   
But the path forward is for the port workers and their employers to
resolve the negotiations so that workers get the wages, benefits, and
quality of life that they so deserve.  And so that’s what we’re going to
continue to call for: asking both parties to come to the table so this
can be — so this can be dealt with.  
   
As it relates to the UPS, you know, we’re, of course, aware of the
strike authorization vote that — that occurred, which is not a vote to
go on strike.  But, again, to be clear, strike authorizations votes
sometimes occur during collective bargaining to demonstrate the — the
solidarity of the union members in support of their negotiation team. 
So we’re hopeful the parties can reach an agreement and satisfy both
sides.   
   
And so, again, the President respects collective bargaining process, and
he believes that the best way for workers and employers to reach an
agreement that ensures workers get their fair — fair benefits and
quality of life and wages that they deserve.  So I’ll leave it there.  
   
Q    Can the administration play an effective role with an acting
secretary at the helm of the Labor Department?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Absolutely.  Remember, this is an acting secretary
that was a deputy secretary under — under Secretary Walsh for the first
almost two years, and so we have complete confidence in — in Acting
Secretary Su.  And she has, as you know, strong relationships with these
different labor organizations.  And we — we believe that with her
leadership, certainly, she’ll — she’ll engage in a way with the parties
that will be effective.  
   
Q    And then real quick, this is not a question about — to weigh in on
these presidential candidates.  I understand you’re going to respect the
Hatch Act.  But in terms of the President’s schedule and how he’s been
monitoring this — you know, we have three new candidates for president
in the Republican race — Mike Pence, Chris Christie, Governor Doug
Burgum — is the President monitoring these announcements?  Is he carving
out any time in his schedule to watch these announcements?  Any — any
thoughts on — on (inaudible)?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All I can tell you is the President is focused on the
American people.  That’s his job.  That’s his job day in, day out.  And
you see that as he talks about investing in America, as he talks about
his economic policy for American people, as he — as you saw him do —
negotiate a fiscally responsible bipartisan budget.  And that is going
to be his focus.  
   
As it relates to the campaign and schedule or what he’s going to be
doing next, certainly, I would refer you to his campaign or the DNC. 
But I know for sure the President is — is zeroed in and focused on the
American people, and that’s what he’s going to continue to do.   
   
Go ahead, Tyler.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  When the President walked from the Residence to
the Oval Office today — he walks along the Colonnade outside — do you
know if he wore a mask?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nobody is wearing a mask walking from – on the
Colonnade.  
   
Q    I’m just saying, outside given the —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — I’m just telling you —  
   
Q    — the smoke.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — I don’t have any changes to — as I mentioned
earlier, I don’t have any changes to what he’ll be doing.  But we’ve
been walking back and forth on the Colonnade, and no one is wearing a
mask.  It’s a short walk.   
   
Q    And then a question on the Prime Minister’s visit tomorrow.  Can
you give us a little bit of a readout of what we should expect from the
two leaders, whether there are certain things the President is hoping to
accomplish?  Obviously, this is Prime Minister Sunak’s first visit the
White House.  The two have met at other locations, but —

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — just wanted to hear a little bit more about the visit tomorrow.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  They certainly have met a couple times, as you just
laid out, Tyler. 

A couple of things I will lay out: The President is looking forward,
obviously, to welcoming Prime Minister Sunak to the White House to
further deepen the close economic relationship between United States and
United Kingdom, and to discuss key challenges and opportunities.   
   
This will be the fourth consecutive month the President has met the
Prime Minister.  Already this year, they’ve met in Hiroshima at the G7,
in Belfast in April, and in San Diego in March at the AUKUS trilateral
event about our long-term defense and security partnerships in the
Indo-Pacific.   
   
So during this visit tomorrow, the two leaders will review a range of
global issues, including our economic partnership, our shared support
for Ukraine, and it- — and its defen- — as it defends itself against
Russia’s brutal war of aggression, as well as further action to
accelerate the clean energy transition.   
   
The President and the Prime Minister will also discuss the joint U.S.-UK
leadership on critical and emerging technologies — technologies, as well
as our work to strengthen our economic security.   
   
They will also review developments in Northern Ireland as part of their
shared commitment to preserving the gains of the Belfast/Good Friday
Agreement.  And certainly, we will have more to share in a readout once
their meeting occurs and ends tomorrow.   
   
Go ahead, Joey.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I like your tie.  
   
Q    Sticking with the British Prime Minister’s visit, one of the things
that he supposedly is going to bring up during the meeting is this idea
of a creation of a global watchdog agency over AI.  Is that something
the President thinks is needed?  Is that something that he would
support?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, you’ve — you’ve heard from the President and
from us on how we see this growing technology, AI, and we believe that
how it moves forward should be done in a responsible way.   
   
The Vice President had a meeting with four CEOs recently.  The President
has held other — other meetings with his staff to discuss AI.   
   
I’m not going to get ahead of what conversation is going to be had
during this bilat that they’re going to — that’s going — that they’re
going to have tomorrow with the Prime Minister.  I’ll let them have
their conversation.  We certainly will have a readout.   
   
But we’ve been very clear about how we see moving forward with AI and
how it needs to be done in a responsible way.  We need to make sure that
we’re protecting the privacy of Americans, and so we’ll definitely
continue to speak to that.   
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I’m hoping you can clarify as it relates to the
LIV-PGA merger.  Yesterday, the President was asked about this merger
during the Cabinet meeting, and he said, “I’m going to be in the
PGA.”   
   
Can you clarify: Had he been briefed about the merger before?  Was he
aware of what he was being —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Absolutely —  
   
Q    Okay.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — he had been.  Yes. 

Q    And what did he mean, then, by it?  Was he just laughing off the
question?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just think that he was basically saying, “I’m not
going to comment.” 

Q    Okay.  On — Pope Francis today underwent successful surgery, we’re
told.  I’m wondering, given the close relationship the President has
built with him, has there been any outreach to the Vatican or between
the two men themselves?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, obviously, I don’t — I don’t have any call to
read out, but obviously, our thoughts are with — with the Pope.  And
certainly, we are hoping that he has a full and quick recovery. 

Q    And then, on your announcement about the Secretary General’s visit
in a couple of weeks, has the President ruled out asking Mr. Stoltenberg
to extend his tenure again with NATO?  And is this a subject that he
might raise with the Prime Minister tomorrow?  Pres- — Prime Minister
Sunak has been advocating for his defense minister as a potential
successor.

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I’m not going to get ahead of the conversation that
they’re going to have. 

I can say, and we’ve said it here yesterday, that the President believes
that the Secretary has been — has done an outstand- — outstanding job, a
superb job as Secretary General, especially in this critical moment in
history, leading the Alliance that we have responded to — in response to
Russia’s war in Ukraine. 

And so we’re very, very grateful for his leadership.  I’m not going to
get into speculation from here.  I’m not going to get into what the
process or how the President is thinking about the next steps here. 

But certainly we are incredibly — incredibly grateful to the — to the
Secretary General. 

I’m just going to go — go ahead.

Q    Thanks, Karine.  So you noted in your topper that climate change is
making wildfires worse.  Just to put a finer point on it: Should the
public expect this kind of thing to be happening more often, where large
parts of the East Coast are covered with smoke?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I — I’m not an expert.  I can’t predict how
this is going to move forward or how this is going to look in the
future. 

But certainly we’ve seen — I mentioned the West Coast has dealt with
this for some time.  So this is not uncommon, sadly.  It’s only getting
worse. 

But this is why the President has made climate change a priority.  This
is why he’s taken the aggressive actions that he’s taken, historic
actions.  And he’s certainly going to continue to — to stay focused on
how we move forward in dealing with climate change. 

But, again, I’m not an expert.  But, clearly, as we have seen over the
last couple of decades, climate change has been a real problem.  It is
the science that shows us that.

Q    And if and when Secretary Blinken goes to China, is it the
President’s goal or hope that he meets directly with President Xi?  And
is that sort of what the conversations that are happening behind the
scenes are leading up to?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m not going to — certainly not going to
get ahead of what — what a conversation or what — what that will look
like.  The President has said he wants to talk to President Xi. 
Certainly don’t have a call to preview for all of you at this time. 

And as it relates to Secretary Blinken, I would refer you to the State
Department.  But we have said, you know, we’re hoping that — that he
will be able to travel to China when — when the time is right.  Just
don’t have anything at this time. 

Go ahead.

Q    Thanks.  One follow-up on the Ukraine dam situation.  You said that
you’re still assessing who’s responsible.  But can you say in your
conversations with the Ukrainians what they’re telling you in terms of
what additional aid they might need to respond to this situation?  And
will the President be discussing it with Prime Minister Sunak
tomorrow?  
And then separately, is there any plan at all for the President to talk
to President Zelenskyy?  And if not, why not?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, of course, Ukraine is going to be at the top
discussion tomorrow.  It is NATO.  And, as you know, NATO — the NATO
Alliance has been a strengthened because of the President’s — because of
the President’s leadership.   
And so, of course, Ukraine and Russia will be top of mind and
discussed.  I’m not going to — I’m not going to go into details of what
they’re going to be talking about.  Certainly we’ll have a readout that
will lay — lay more of the conversation. 

I don’t have any specifics to share on what the conversations that were
had with Ukraine in regards to the dam.  I just — I could just tell you
we’ve been in touch, and we’re ready to help in any way that we can. 
Just don’t have — don’t have a list of what they’re asking for and what
was discussed. 

Q    Okay.  And then, on a separate topic, a couple of months ago, we
were all talking about TikTok, and there was legislation put forward on
the Hill that three months ago Jake Sullivan came out in support of, and
then we haven’t really heard much since.   
Can you say whether you’re working at all with the Hill on making this
become law?  Are you working with the Senate, the House?  Or have you
sort of given up on any authority to restrict TikTok and other apps that
you think are harmful?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, it — certainly this is important to the
President, to the administration, this type of legislation that Jake
talked about a couple of months ago. 

I don’t have an update for you.  We are always in constant contact on
different pieces of legislation with the House and the Senate.  I just
don’t have an update on where we are currently with this particular
legislation.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  So Walgreens unveiled a new look for their stores;
they unveiled that in Chicago.  And it has basically everything locked
up, in part because of the theft that they have seen.  A recent study
shows that 50 percent of retail workers have seen some sort of retail
theft, and another nearly 50 percent are afraid to go to work.  So is
the President aware of retail theft?  And how come the problem has
become so persa- — per- — pervasive under his tenure?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, what I can tell you is: Unlike congressional
Republicans, the President has taken action.  He has taken action to
deal with — with the crime, hiring police officers.  We’ve — you’ve seen
that from his actions that he’s taken to cut crime.  
   
And he — and it started with the American Rescue Plan.  The American
Rescue Plan had billions of dollars that went into communities to hire
police officers, to make sure that we held — we had accountability, as
well, on the ground.  And let’s not forget his Safer American \[sic\]
Plan to fund the police and invest in crime prevention.  
   
So we have taken actions.  We have made sure that we do everything that
we can to try and protect communities and to make sure that police
officers are hired.  
   
And so, look, instead of Congress, you know, passing legislation or
wanting to cut or defund the police, we’re doing the opposite.  And so
we would love to work with Congress and see how else we can be helpful
to communities.   
   
But the President has taken action — again, the American Rescue Plan,
the Safer communities — Safer community — America Plan — and he’s going
to continue to do what he can to make sure that we keep communities
safe.   
   
Q    I want to ask you quickly about the visit tomorrow.  The United
Kingdom left the EU in 2020.  The UK remains our closest ally — or one
of our closest allies, as you said.  How come we’re not negotiating a
trade deal with them?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I think in that conversation that they’ll
have tomorrow, for sure, the economy will be part of that conversation. 
Look, they have the largest bilateral investment relationship in the
world, when you think about the UK and United States.  And that’s a
source of strength and has been an important foundation of economic
growth over the years in both of our countries.  And so I’m sure when
the two leaders meet, they will take — they will continue to take steps
to deepen that economic partnership.   
   
And so I’m not going to get ahead of what the President and the Prime
Minister are going to speak to.  But, again, they have one of the
strongest — largest bilateral investment relationship in the world, and
I think that matters.   
   
Q    Is the com- — the President comfortable with the UK leading on
artificial intelligence?  Because that’s one of the things the Prime
Minister is (inaudible).  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not going to get ahead of — again, of what
they’re going to discuss.  I’ve laid out when we — what we have done
here and how we see moving forward on artificial intelligence.   
   
But, again, I’m just not going to get ahead of it.  We’ll have a readout
tomorrow.  
   
Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  You mentioned the governments — U.S. and Canada —
working together, talking about the wildfires.  Have — but has President
Biden spoken with Prime Minister Trudeau about this?  Any — any offers
of anything different that has not already been offered or long-term
plans they’ve been discussing?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I can tell you this: Our Deputy National Security
Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall, has been in touch with her counterparts,
and she has been for the — since last week, in offering and — listening
to them and offer — making sure we’re offering any assistance that they
might need.  We mentioned the 600-plus firefighters and personnel that
we have provided to Canada to help them deal with this wildfire.   
   
I don’t have a call to read out between the Prime Minister and the
President.   
   
We’ve also, as I mentioned, been in touch with governors and — and local
government as well to make sure that we are offering any assistance that
they might need.   
   
Q    And can I also just ask: Is the — is the President washing —
watching some of the pushback from kind of more conservative Republicans
in the House regarding the debt ceiling vote?  There are concerns.  Does
he have any thoughts about that effort and also how it might impact
future dealing with the House?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look — and I mentioned this last week — I — I — even
earlier this week.  The President has done — has signed more than 350
bipartisan pieces of legislation — signed them into law.  And I think
that shows how the President has been able to work — work with Congress
in a bipartisan way.  And I think that’s important.   
   
And we hope that continues, because there’s so much more that needs to
be done as far as lowering costs, making sure the wealthy pay their fair
share.  There’s a list of things that we would love to work in a
bipartisan way with Congress.   
   
And so the President — certainly, he’s an optimist; he believes that we
can continue to do that work, and certainly we’re going to try.  
   
As it relates to what Congress is saying or congressio- — congressional
Republicans are saying: Look, this was a bipartisan, fiscally
responsible piece of legislation.  It was important to the American
people.  We believe they — they are the ones that won because we were
able to protect some of the programs that they truly need just to make
ends meet.  We were able to protect some of the — all of the historic
pieces of legislation that the President put forward to deal with an
economy that doesn’t leave anybody behind.   
   
So the President is very proud of what he was able to do with Speaker
McCarthy and the other leaders, and we hope that type of bipartisanship
continues.  
   
Certainly I’m not going to get into hypotheticals of how that’s going to
look down the road.  But we have a record.  We have a record in the last
two years to show that we have been able to get that done.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thank you.  I wanted to ask you about — we are two weeks away from
the state visit.  Secretary Austin was in Delhi this week.  And I guess
there’s some other high-profile visits happening between then — now and
then.  Would defense be an important part of the discussions with
President — Prime Minister Modi and President Biden?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say that last part.  
   
Q    Would defense be an important part of discussions between the two
leaders?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, defense.   
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I don’t have anything more to say at this
time about the visit.  As we get closer, certainly we will have more to
share.   
   
What I’ve said is the upcoming visit, we believe, will affirm the deep
and close partnership between the United States and India, and the warm
bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians
together.  So that is incredibly important. 

The Prime Minister and the President will discuss ways to strengthen our
two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure
Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology
partnership, including defense — so that certainly will be talked about
— and clean energy and space. 

But I’m just not going to get into details on what the particulars will
be.  And as we get closer to June 22nd, we’ll certainly have more to
share.

Q    And also, have the guest list gone out for the state dinner and the
welcome ceremony?  And how big?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, we’ve done about — this will be our
third state dinner.  We usually don’t release those guestlists until
closer to the date.  And so I suspect that we will do — we will do the
same process with this.

Q    Can you give us a sense of number of people?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a number to share.

Q    And has the First Lady decided on the menu and the entertainment?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have anything to share.  What — what is
today?  It’s, like, so early.  It’s —

Q    Just two weeks (inaudible).

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  We still have about two weeks left, and we
— that’s plenty of time.  That’s like multiple years in this — in these
types of amini- — administration — in presidential administrations. 

So as soon as we have more to share, we certainly will.  But I wouldn’t
— I wouldn’t expect that it will happen before the week of the actual —
actual event. 

Go ahead, Jon.

Q    Thanks a lot, Karine.  Yesterday, the World Bank issued a report in
which they indicated that the global economy is slowing down
dramatically.  They’re forecasting an annualized rate of growth of just
2.1 percent for this coming year.  Is that something that you agree
with?  Do you see the U.S. economy similarly slowing down at a
substantial rate?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I haven’t seen the report.  Certainly have to talk
to the — our economists about the report that you’re speaking to.

What I can share with you is what we’re doing here and how we think it
is going to be important to strengthening the global economy — right? —
in making sure that the debt limit was dealt with.  I think that was an
important way to dealing with the global economy.  Having a bipartisan,
important budget negotiation that was, clearly, signed into law — that
is incredibly important.  Making sure we’re protecting jobs, protecting
retirement accounts for Americans, which is what the President was — was
able to do.  Making sure people stay on their healthcare, and protecting
other incredibly important programs, like veteran programs, for example;
Social Security; Medicare. 

So because of the work that this President has done the last two years
and just most recently, we are in a better place with our economy, with
the American economy.

I would have — again, would have to speak to the economists about this
particular piece of data that you’re sharing.

Q    The U.S. economy has been incredibly resilient.  Do you expect that
can — to continue over the course of the remainder of this year?  And
what is it that this White House can do to prevent the slowdown in the
economy, given the fact that there is a divided Congress?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — and you’re right, the U.S. economy has been
very resilient.  And that is a lot because of the actions that this
President has taken in making sure that we turned the economy around
from when he walked in.  As you know, it was a crisis.

And so we’ve been saying this.  We’ve been saying that we believe that
we’re — we’re transitioning to a more steady — a steady growth, stable
growth.  And that’s what we’re seeing when you look at the job numbers
that come out every month.  And that’s what we believe we’re headed to. 

And so the cre- — the President is certainly going to continue to do —
he’s going to now implement those historic pieces of legislation where
it’s going to create more jobs, and it’s going to help continue to make
sure that the economy stays resilient.

Go ahead.

Q    The Minority Leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, has said that
the budget caps for defense spending in the budget agreement are
insufficient to meet the challenges as it relates to Russia, Iran,
China.  Does the President share those concerns?  And does the President
intend to submit any sort of supplemental spending package as it relates
to either pumping up defense spending or specifically providing
additional military assistance for Ukraine?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as the President said last week, and I’ll quote
him — he said, “If there’s any existential need for additional funding,
I have no doubt we’ll be able to get it.”  That’s what the President
said when — when the budget agreement was done.

We have been grateful for the widespread bipartisan support for Ukraine
and expect that to continue.  And — and so it doesn’t rule out — the
budget agreement does not rule out additional emergency funding, whether
it is for Ukraine or extreme weather.  And so, the President is very
confident on that. 

As you know, there’s now an appropriations process, as — as Director
Young spoke to.  Certainly not — we are now in — back in regular order —
right? — which is why it was important about getting this budget
agreement done.  So I’m going to let the appropriation process move
forward.  Not going to get ahead of that. 

But the President, as he stated himself, he is — he’s confident.

Q    But — so more generally speaking, he is okay with where the budget
caps are for defe- — defense spending?

MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not — I’m — look, there’s an appropriations
process that’s going to get going.  That is regular order.  That is
where we’re supposed to be.  We’re going to let that process go.

As you’re asking me about more defense funding, as the Minority Leader,
as you just stated, feels like there’s not enough in defense, the
President has said he — if there is — if there is need — existential
need to additional funding, he believes that we will get there.

So that’s what I can share with you on that part. 

Let me see.  Go ahead, Alex.  I haven’t called on you in a while.

Q    Hi, Karine.  The United States, as you know, has far higher
incidence of car fatalities, both of drivers and pedestrians and
cyclists, than almost all — I think all other wealthy nations.  And
we’re about to enter the most dangerous time of the year for car
accidents, the summer months.  Has this administration done enough on
that front?  Or has maybe the — I don’t know, the automotive — the
highway lobby sort of had its way, as it has had with many other
administrations?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — and you’re right, we face a crisis here in
America when it comes to — when it comes to driving passengers —
drivers, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists.  Each year, more than 40,000
people have to — or die in these types of crashes.  And so — and this is
comparable to gun deaths, and it should not be this way.  
   
So the Department of Transportation launched a National Roadway Safety
Strategy in early of 2022 that — to tackle this type of crisis at every
level.  And so while it’s encouraging to see the deaths level has kind
of — the death leveling off somewhat in the last two quarters, because
we have seen that occur, it is no time to let up.  And so we’re going to
— DOT is going to continue to take major steps to keep people safe.  And
I think that’s important.  
   
Again, they’ve put a plan together to try to tackle this incredibly
unfortunate situation.  
   
Go ahead.  
   
Q    Thanks, Karine.  I know you won’t comment on the case involving the
President’s son, but the President previously criticized the Supreme
Court ruling that his legal team is preparing to use, should he be
charged, as an affront to common sense and the Constitution.  I just
want to know if that statement from June of last year still holds or if
he is viewing that ruling in a new light.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to comment on this.  
   
Q    Okay.  And on the merger.  The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board
said this is more than just a private deal.  It’s really about MBS sort
of thumbing his nose at the President.  They point out that the Saudis
entered a China-brokered deal with Iran; they’re cozying up to Maduro;
cut oil production ahead of Blinken’s visit, helping Russia, driving up
prices, hurting Biden.  And they write, “Is Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman trolling President Biden?”  Call it “the revenge of
the ‘pariah.’”  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I can’t comment to or lay out what the thinking of —
of the Saudi Arabia official or government are.  
   
As it relates to this merger, we’re just not going to comment on this
deal.  It is two private entities, and we’re just not going to
comment.   
   
Q    Doesn’t that risk making the President look weak if there’s no
comment?  When you have Democratic senators saying that the President’s
Justice Department should be looking at this with respect to antitrust
questions, foreign registration questions, doesn’t “no comment” fall
short?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s — first of all, the President does not look
weak.  This is a President — because of his leadership, has brought
together our allies and partners again, which certainly was our — our
foreign policy relationship with heads of states was gutted and
destroyed by the last administration.   
   
And this is a President that has been able to strengthen the NATO
Alliance again because of his leadership, has been able to bring more
than 50 countries together to help support Ukraine as they’re battling
the aggression from Russia, and that is occurring because of this
President’s leadership.  And so I think that is important.   
   
And because we’re saying that we’re not going to speak to a private
merger — a company’s merger, a private entity — does not make the
President weak.   
   
Q    You said he was briefed on it though, right?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That does not make the President — of course he’s
going to be briefed on it.  He’s the President of the United States. 
But it does not —  
   
Q    So why can’t you comment on — on it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But that — but we’re not going to comment on it
because it is a private entity.  We’ve been consistent —  
   
Q    Then why would he be briefed on it?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ve been consistent —

He’s the President of the United States.  He kno- — he — he gets to know
everything that’s going on in the — in the world and in the country —
right? — that is important for him to know.  He is — he is one of the
leaders of the free world.  
   
Q    Is it typical to get briefed on private —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, this is —  
   
Q    (Laughs.)  I mean —  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ve — I’ve answered your question.  We’re going to
move on.   
   
Co- — go ahead, Courtney.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Will the President withdraw his nomination of Dale Ho
for a judgeship in the Southern District of New York?  Today’s cloture
vote in the Senate was canceled.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So the President is proud to have put him forward, and
we’re going to continue to support his nomination.   
   
Q    Do you have an expectation of when another vote will be
scheduled?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a — I don’t have a timeline on when that
vote will happen.  I can tell you that the President continues to
support.  
   
Q    Thanks.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.   
   
Q    Thank you so much.  I have two questions about events at the White
House tomorrow.  Firstly, on the Sunak visit.  The Prime Minister has
echoed some of President Biden’s strong words on Taiwan.  So I’m
wondering if the two leaders are going to discuss related China issues
like investments, semiconductors, supply chains.  And is it a priority
for the administration to get U.S.-UK alignment on these issues?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to get ahead of their conversation
tomorrow.  I just laid out what they’re looking forward to particularly
— particularly discussing.  This is the fourth time that they’ve met in
four months, and it is a — it is a — our closest relationship, an
important relationship, especially as we talk about Ukraine and — and
the war in Ukraine that was clearly an aggression by Russia.   
   
I’m just not going to get into specifics of what — what they’re going to
speak about.   
   
I talked about the economy.  I talked about Ukraine.  And certainly —
and clean energy, which is going to be incredibly important, but just
not going to go into spec- — any more specifics.  And we’ll certainly
have a readout.  
   
Q    Cool.  Then moving on to the Pride event tomorrow.  This is likely
to provoke some political or politicized pushback, especially from, you
know, some of the states that have passed legislation targeting sexual
minorities or from countries that have done the same.  So could I just
hear from you why does the White House feel that this event is
important, especially in this context?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So we’ve had multiple events celebrating the LGBTQ+
community.  Multiple.  And this is a President that has been a strong
ally; a Vice President that has been a strong ally; a Second Gentleman,
a First Lady that has been a strong ally of the — of the community.  And
it is important — he feels it is important, they feel it’s important to
lift up a community, to lift up their accomplishments and what they’ve
been able to do for the community.  And so we think it’s an important
moment.   
   
And let’s not forget what we’re seeing across the country from
statehouses: more than 600 pieces of legislation, anti-LGBTQ+
legislation.  A few hundred of those are against transgender youth.  And
so we have not seen that type of “anti” sentiment, anti — against this
community in decades.   
   
And so we believe that not only does this community need to be
celebrated and continue to be celebrated, as he’s done many times before
in this — in this past two years, but we also need to make sure that we
let the community know that the President has their back and we’re going
to continue to fight for them.  And so that is important.   
   
And I think that is important to be able to bring a couple of thousand
Americans here to the White House to let them know that this President
is going to continue to fight for them.  And that’s the message that we
want to make sure that gets out there.   
   
Okay.  I haven’t — go ahead.  
   
Q    Oh, on the issue of asylum seekers arriving in New York.  Recently,
Governor Hochul and New York City Mayor Adams, you know, pressed —
called upon the federal government, the Biden administration, to somehow
work on relaxing some of the work permitting requirements, easing
restrictions so that some of these asylum seekers can get their work
permits before this six-month waiting period.  I’m wondering if the
White House has any update on that, any, you know, just, stance on — on
those discussions?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So I don’t have any updates on the work requirements. 
I know that’s been in the news for some time now.   
   
What I will say is that we have — have had direct communications and
conversations with these interior cities and states who are dealing with
the — with an influx of immigrants in their city and in their state. 
And we’ve had very — multiple conversations not just with New York, but
also Chicago and other — again, other interior cities and states.   
   
And what I will say is that we have — we have offered assistance and
resources.  I have announced and I’ve — and it’s been announced not just
by me, but by DHS — the more than 200 million — I believe more than 300
million of resources to those — to those particular inter- — interior
states.   
   
And also, I have said — I even said this yesterday — that a large com- —
piece of that has been provided to New York.  And so we’re going to
continue to have those conversations.  We’re going to continue to assist
the best way that we can, as we have been doing for the past several
months.   
   
Go ahead, Owen, in the back.  
   
Q    Good afternoon, Karine.  In Chicago, over Memorial Day weekend,
over 50 people were shot; several killed in separate incidents.  And I
know that you discussed the action this administration has taken to try
to reduce gun violence, but I want to know what the President has to say
to individual Chicago residents living in neighborhoods where bullets
are flying and can’t wait for laws to take effect — what the President
would tell that person.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We will say that we are doing everything that we can
to make sure their communities are safe.  And the President — and it’s
not just our words.  Our actions show that.   
   
The President signed into — two — two dozen — almost two — more than two
dozen executive actions to deal with gun violence.  And the President
has also continued to call on Congress to take additional action.  
   
We are very proud of the bipartisan piece of legislation on gun violen-
— to fight gun violence that was signed just about a year ago.  And that
was something that we had not seen in 30 years.  And because of the
President’s leadership, we were able to get that done.  
   
The President also has made clear that Congress needs to do more.  And
so, he’s taken action.  
   
And certainly, our hearts go out to families or individuals who have
lost loved ones.  It is — it is devastating to see.  When you hear a
statistic where guns is — is — is the — is — guns are — are — is — are
what is taking the lives of our children, the number one killer of our
children, that’s devastating to hear.  That is something that the
President wants to prevent and wants to deal with, which is why he took
those actions.  
   
So, we’re going to continue to call on Congress to take action.  And —
and I will say — and we’ll be very loud about that and very clear about
that.  And I will also say again: Our hearts go out to folks who have
lost loved ones to gun violence.  
   
Go ahead, Brian.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  I wanted to ask about Ukraine and NATO.  The
British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, last week said that Ukraine’s
rightful place is in NATO.  Will this be something that the two discuss
when they meet tomorrow?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I — I’m not going to get into specifics of
what’s going to happen.  Again, I know you guys have asked me a couple
of questions, but our commitment to NATO’s open-door policy stands.  And
so, just not going to get ahead of that.  
   
Q    And given the meeting tomorrow and that the NATO Secretary General
is going to be here on Monday, is President Biden thinking about a
renewed push toward Ukraine’s admission into NATO?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, we’ve been — I mean, nothing has changed on
how we’ve answered this question before.   
   
You know, an Alliance decision is between the 31 Allies and — and
aspirant country.  That’s how it’s dealt with.  You have to — there’s a
process, and there’s an open-door policy.  That’s what we support. 
We’ve been — we’ve supported that for some time now.  
   
But, right now, we are focused on making sure that Ukraine has
everything that it needs to fight Russia’s aggression.  And you heard
us, just about last week, announce another PDA of $300 million.  We’re
going to continue to do that every other week or so and continue to show
our support for Ukraine, whether it is aid or (inaudible) systems.  And
— and, you know, we’ve done that the last 15 months.   
   
And so, we’re going to — you know, we’re going to do everything that we
can to support the Ukrainian people as they fight in a — in a incredibly
impressive and brave — brave fight.  
   
All right, everyone.  
   
Q    Could I just clarify one thing, Karine?  You said repeatedly here
that the White House didn’t want to comment on a private entity.  A
quick search back through briefings in recent months finds that you
commented on JPMorgan’s merger or purchase of First Republic.  And then
you were asked last November about Elon Musk buying Twitter, saying:
“We’re going to keep an eye on that decision.”  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And I —  
   
Q    Does the decision to not comment today have anything to do with the
fact that the Secretary of State is in Saudi Arabia right now?  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, not at all.  Not at all.  We’re just not going to
comment on this.  And — and, look, I also said with the mer- — the — the
Elon Musk — I also said the same thing that I said today: is that we’re
not going to comment on a private entity.  I actually said those words,
as we talked about Elon Musk and Twitter.  
   
And so that’s going to continue.  We’re not going to comment on this. 
We’re going to focus on the American people.  We’re going to focus on —
on what their needs are as it relates to, you know, American families
and as it relates to abroad and also the Middle East as well.  And so
that’s the President’s focus right now.   
   
But I’ve always been very clear: We just are not — not going to comment
on — on any types of mergers.  And I know you pulled out those — those
specific things, but I also continued and said I’m just not going to
comment on mergers or private entities.  
   
Q    Thank you, Karine.  
   
2:30 P.M. EDT
