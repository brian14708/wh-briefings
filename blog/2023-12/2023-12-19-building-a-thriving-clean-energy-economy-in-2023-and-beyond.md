------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2021 and 2022, President Biden signed into law his [Investing in
America](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
agenda, a series of strategic public investments in industries critical
for the long-run economic growth of the United States. This included the
largest investment in reducing carbon emissions in American history. The
clean energy investments in the agenda—primarily in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act—include incentives
for manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, investments in
demonstration projects, loans and loan guarantees for a variety of
technologies, and production and investment tax credits for clean energy
generation. This suite of public sector tools provides unprecedented
investment certainty to the private sector, with several provisions of
the Inflation Reduction Act extending over a decade.

The most recent available data indicate that the President’s agenda has
supported robust investment in the
[construction](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/unpacking-the-boom-in-us-construction-of-manufacturing-facilities)
of manufacturing facilities and strong performance in key targeted
industries including solar and wind energy, grid energy storage, and
electric vehicles.

This brief highlights progress-to-date towards deploying these clean
energy technologies. It describes how the President’s Investing in
America agenda is translating into tangible outcomes and progress
towards the President’s climate goals, and it outlines how the
deployment of clean energy technologies will lower greenhouse gas
emissions, improve energy security, and spur economic growth.

## **Investment in the construction of clean energy manufacturing facilities is exceeding expectations**

As explained in a recent [issue
brief](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/08/16/the-economics-of-public-investment-crowding-in-private-investment/),
the Investing in America agenda is intended to catalyze strategic
private sector investments, and initial signs indicate that private
companies are already responding. Since January 2021, private companies
have announced over half a trillion dollars in new investment, including
nearly [$360
billion](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) in
clean energy manufacturing, EVs and batteries, and power generation.

One of the first ways these private clean energy investments will be
visible in the economic data is through the construction of
manufacturing facilities. Indeed, since President Biden took office,
inflation-adjusted spending on the construction of manufacturing
facilities has nearly doubled. This increase has exceeded forecasters’
expectations, suggesting that the Investing in America agenda is
catalyzing more private sector funding than initially expected (Figure
1).

width="1933" height="1143" />
</figure>

This growth in the construction of manufacturing facilities is strong
relative to growth in other forms of construction. For example,
inflation-adjusted manufacturing construction spending increased by 27
percent in the first ten months of 2023. Meanwhile, other types of
non-residential construction grew 7 percent over the same period (Figure
2).

## **The Investing in America agenda is driving clean energy deployment**

Other data sources indicate that the public clean energy investments in
the President’s Investing in America agenda will translate into
unprecedented private sector clean energy deployment in the coming
years. In many cases, the acceleration is much faster than forecasters
had previously anticipated.

### Clean energy deployment

A central goal of the Investing in America agenda is to increase the
amount of energy generated from clean sources like solar and wind, which
will lower energy costs, improve energy resilience, and cut greenhouse
gas emissions. Near-term investments in manufacturing, coupled with
incentives like tax credits, are intended to reduce the costs of
deploying clean energy at scale.

There has already been notable progress towards expanding U.S. solar and
wind manufacturing capacity. Since the Inflation Reduction Act was
signed into law in August 2022, over 100 gigawatts of planned
manufacturing capacity have been announced for solar module
assembly—which would produce enough solar panels per year to power more
than 10 percent of U.S. homes. These announcements represent 79 new
facilities and/or expansions and more than $13 billion in investment.

As the manufacturing base expands, solar and wind deployment are
projected to grow rapidly—considerably faster than projections before
the Investing in America agenda was signed into law. According to the
latest Annual Energy Outlook (AEO)
forecast<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, the United States is on track to have 338
gigawatts of solar capacity in 2030—nearly twice the capacity forecasted
in the beginning of 2021 (Figure
3).<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Likewise, for wind energy
capacity, the latest AEO forecast estimates that the United States will
have 300 gigawatts of wind turbine capacity in 2030, a 43 percent
increase from their 2021 projection (Figure 4). For context, this
estimated capacity from solar and wind in 2030 would be roughly double
the total existing renewable capacity on the grid at the end of 2022.

### Grid-scale energy storage deployment

Energy storage is another essential component of a clean electricity
grid. Battery storage—either via grid-scale battery systems or an
aggregation of smaller batteries in a [virtual power
plant](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/virtual-power-plants#:~:text=Virtual%20power%20plants%2C%20generally%20considered,cleaner%20and%20more%20affordable%20power.)—enables
companies to store excess electricity from wind and solar energy and put
that energy back on the grid when it is needed the most, helping to
reduce total energy costs.

To grow the amount of energy storage on the grid, incentives from the
President’s Investing in America agenda are spurring historic private
deployment of large-scale energy storage capacity. Thanks to cost
declines in battery energy storage, in just one year, grid-connected
battery energy storage is on track to more than double. It is expected
to nearly double again in 2024 (Figure 5). The latest forecasts,
following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
Inflation Reduction Act, show a dramatic expansion in capacity for
grid-scale battery storage, far outpacing previous estimates (Figure 6).
As of August 2023, grid-storage battery capacity is ahead of even this
2023 estimate.

### Electric vehicle sales

The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) can lower energy
costs, improve air quality, cut emissions pollution, and reduce noise
pollution. Throughout the United States, it is
[cheaper](https://energyinnovation.org/2023/07/27/ev-fill-up-savings/)
to charge a vehicle using electricity than to fill it with gasoline. The
average EV in the United States produces [fewer
emissions](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/driving-cleaner) than the
average new gasoline-powered vehicle, even when accounting for the
current electricity mix of the U.S. grid. The Inflation Reduction Act is
[projected](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/DOE%20OP%20Economy%20Wide%20Report_0.pdf)
to double the share of clean electricity generation by 2030, further
lowering the total carbon footprint of current and future electric
vehicles as the grid becomes cleaner.

To reap the benefits of this technological innovation, the Investing in
America agenda includes a range of incentives designed to support the EV
industry. This includes investments to support EVs and EV battery
manufacturing, funding to build a national network of EV chargers, and
consumer tax credits to lower the cost of purchasing an EV. Private
sector companies have begun to respond to these incentives. Since the
beginning of 2021, firms have announced over [$150
billion](https://www.energy.gov/invest) in investments to manufacture
EVs and EV batteries. New EV models are also offering consumers more
options. Between 2021 and the second quarter of 2023, the number of EV
[models](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60321)
increased from 34 to 55, with
[14](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2023-ev-sales/) new
EV models in the last year alone.

EV sales have risen rapidly during this period from roughly 20,000 sales
per month in 2020 and 2019 to over 90,000 per month in 2023 (Figure 7).
At the start of 2023, forecasters estimated that beginning in 2026, more
than one million EVs would be sold each year, and by 2030, nearly 1.8
million EVs would be sold—more than five times the forecast in 2021
(Figure 8). Actual sales have surpassed these forecasts. More than one
million EVs have already been sold in 2023—three years ahead of the
projections made earlier this year and 18 years ahead of the projections
made in the beginning of 2021.

## **Clean energy deployment builds a better economy for Americans**

Manufacturing and deploying clean energy technologies enables the United
States to move faster towards the Biden-Harris Administration’s climate
goals. Meeting these goals means reducing the [impacts of climate
change](https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/) by cutting emissions,
improving energy security and reliability, and spurring equitable
economic growth. Some of these investments are
[spread](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/08/16/the-economics-of-public-investment-crowding-in-private-investment/)
out over a decade, meaning many of the associated
[benefits](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/14/the-economics-of-investing-in-america/)
will accrue over time. Forecasters’ estimates preview some of these
benefits to come.

First, more rapid deployment means more rapid progress towards
preventing and mitigating the impacts of climate change. According to
the most recent U.S. government
[forecast](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/US_BR_Voluntary_Suplement_2023.pdf#page=33),
U.S. emissions could fall nearly twice as much by 2030 compared to
before the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
were in place. To the extent that deployment is indeed faster than
originally anticipated, these emissions projections would improve even
more.

Second, deploying clean energy can improve U.S. energy security and
reliability while lowering
[energy](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3781)
[prices](https://escholarship.org/content/qt4d01m8vt/qt4d01m8vt.pdf).
According to the [U.S. Department of
Energy](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/DOE%20OP%20Economy%20Wide%20Report_0.pdf),
the share of electricity from clean sources in 2030 could grow to 80
percent—nearly twice the expected amount before the Inflation Reduction
Act passed. Strong growth in domestic clean energy industries supports
energy security, reliability, and supply chain resiliency while creating
good jobs. Deploying more clean electricity sources will provide
opportunities to increase energy system
[reliability](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79224.pdf) and
[security](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/74617.pdf) by reducing
overreliance on traditional fuel sources alone. Increased long-duration
energy storage capacity can also reduce outages and
[improve](https://rmi.org/the-solution-to-grid-reliability-go-bigger-and-bolder-on-renewables-and-energy-storage/)
[energy
reliability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435120303251).
Meanwhile, new technologies like [virtual power
plants](https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/LIFTOFF_DOE_VVP_10062023_v4.pdf)
and other distributed energy resources can improve overall grid
reliability. Similarly, the transition to electric vehicles can reduce
[U.S. consumers’
exposure](https://economics.ucsd.edu/events/economics-roundtable/UCSD-Buckberg-EV-Transition-and-Macroeconomic-Implications-09-14-2022.pdf)
to macroeconomic shocks from oil price volatility.

Third, investments in clean energy can contribute to long-term
broad-based economic growth. In the aggregate, strong investments in
manufacturing construction are contributing to GDP growth (Figure 9). In
the latest data, private manufacturing facility construction contributed
0.3 percentage points to the total 3.0 percent real four-quarter growth.
This means manufacturing construction accounted for roughly 10 percent
of all GDP growth over the year, the largest annual contribution to GDP
growth since the U.S. government began collecting these data in 1959.

In the long-run, these investments in clean energy are likely to pay for
themselves in terms of the benefits accrued. According to a [recent
analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800921003645),
a dollar of spending on clean energy generates roughly twice as much in
output as a dollar in spending on fossil fuel energy. A more recent
[working
paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31615/w31615.pdf)
estimates that the production tax credit in the IRA will boost U.S. GDP
by lowering the cost of electricity, meaning it generates more benefits
than it is expected to cost—without even counting the benefits from
reduced carbon emissions and air pollution.

## Conclusion

In order to meet the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious climate
goals, the United States needs to deploy clean energy at an
unprecedented scale. To lower emissions across sectors like power
generation and transportation, there is a need for generational
investments in not only clean power generation but also related
technologies like grid-scale energy storage and electric vehicles.

President Biden’s Investing in America agenda responds to this need with
carefully designed incentives to mobilize [private sector
investments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/08/16/the-economics-of-public-investment-crowding-in-private-investment/),
including in clean energy technologies. At the macroeconomic level,
there is already strong evidence that private sector commitments are
translating into tangible construction projects to build new
manufacturing facilities.

In critical clean energy industries, the latest available data indicate
that the Investing in America agenda is enabling the United States to
outpace previous projections of the rate at which the country would move
towards its clean energy goals. Current data suggest the United States
is moving rapidly towards a clean energy economy, even faster than many
forecasts—both forecasts prior to the enactment of the President’s
agenda and, for some technologies, forecasts immediately after the
enactment of the agenda—had anticipated.

Ultimately, these investments will improve the economic and social
wellbeing of Americans. Greater manufacturing capacity and deployment of
clean energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles translate into lower
greenhouse gas emissions, improved energy security and reliability,
lower costs, and stronger economic growth in the long run.

Together, these latest data show that the President’s Investing in
America agenda is already generating benefits—economic and otherwise—to
the American people. Looking ahead, the latest forecasts suggest these
investments are mobilizing more activity than previously anticipated,
putting the United States even closer towards its goals of addressing
climate change, promoting energy security, and generating steady, stable
economic growth.
