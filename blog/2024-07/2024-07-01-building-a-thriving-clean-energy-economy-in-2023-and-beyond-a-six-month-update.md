[*here*](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/12/19/building-a-thriving-clean-energy-economy-in-2023-and-beyond/)*.*

In 2021 and 2022, President Biden signed into law his [Investing in
America](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov)
agenda, a series of strategic public investments in industries critical
for the long-run economic growth of the United States. These included
the largest investment in reducing carbon emissions in American history.
The clean energy investments in the agenda—primarily in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act—include incentives
for manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, investments in
demonstration projects, loans and loan guarantees for a variety of clean
energy technologies, and production and investment tax credits for clean
energy generation. This suite of public sector tools provides
unprecedented investment certainty to the private sector, with several
provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act extending over a decade.

The most recent available data indicate the President’s agenda has
supported robust investment in the
[construction](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/unpacking-the-boom-in-us-construction-of-manufacturing-facilities)
of manufacturing facilities and strong performance in key targeted
industries including solar and wind energy, grid-scale energy storage,
and electric vehicles.

This brief highlights progress-to-date towards deploying these clean
energy technologies and documents continued achievements in the six
months since its [original December 2023
publication](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/12/19/building-a-thriving-clean-energy-economy-in-2023-and-beyond/).
It describes how the President’s Investing in America agenda is
translating into tangible outcomes and progress towards the President’s
climate goals, and it outlines how the deployment of clean energy
technologies will lower greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy
security, and spur economic growth across the country.

## **Investment in the construction of clean energy manufacturing facilities is exceeding expectations.**

As explained in a 2023 [issue
brief](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/08/16/the-economics-of-public-investment-crowding-in-private-investment/),
the Investing in America agenda is intended to catalyze strategic
private sector investments, and initial signs indicate private companies
are already responding. Since January 2021, private companies have
announced [nearly $880
billion](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) in
new investment, including over $410 billion in clean energy
manufacturing, EVs and batteries, and clean power generation.

One of the first ways these private clean energy investments will be
visible in the economic data is through the construction of
manufacturing facilities. Indeed, since President Biden took office,
inflation-adjusted spending on the construction of manufacturing
facilities has more than doubled. This increase has exceeded
forecasters’ expectations, suggesting that the Investing in America
agenda is catalyzing more private-sector funding than initially expected
(Figure 1).

width="1050" height="675" />
</figure>

This growth in the construction of manufacturing facilities is strong
relative to growth in other forms of construction. For example,
inflation-adjusted manufacturing construction spending increased by
nearly 40 percent since January 2023. Meanwhile, other types of
non-residential construction grew 7.6 percent over the same period
(Figure 2).

## **The Investing in America agenda is driving clean energy deployment.**

Other data sources indicate that the public clean energy investments in
the President’s Investing in America agenda will translate into
unprecedented private sector clean energy deployment in the coming
years. In many cases, the acceleration is much faster than forecasters
had previously anticipated.

***Solar and wind power deployment***

A central goal of the Investing in America agenda is to increase the
amount of electricity generated from clean sources like solar and wind,
which will lower energy costs, improve energy resilience, and cut
greenhouse gas emissions. Near-term investments in manufacturing,
coupled with incentives like tax credits, are intended to reduce the
costs of deploying clean energy at scale.

There has already been notable progress towards expanding U.S. solar and
wind manufacturing capacity. For example, since the Inflation Reduction
Act was signed into law in August 2022, there have been nearly [$17
billion](https://www.energy.gov/invest) in planned U.S. solar
manufacturing investments (a 31 percent increase since [December
2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/12/19/building-a-thriving-clean-energy-economy-in-2023-and-beyond/)),
representing [126](https://www.energy.gov/invest) new facilities and/or
expansions.

As the manufacturing base expands, solar and wind deployment are
projected to grow rapidly—considerably faster than projections before
the Investing in America agenda was signed into law. According to the
latest Annual Energy Outlook (AEO)
forecast<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, the United States is on track to have about
340 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2030—nearly twice the capacity
forecasted in the beginning of 2021 (Figure
3).<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Already, from the beginning of
the Administration through May 2024, installed solar capacity on the
grid has more than doubled. In 2023, the United States added more
utility-scale solar to the grid than ever before in history—and in 2024,
planned projects are expected to more than double last year’s record
(Figure 4).

Likewise, for wind energy capacity, the latest AEO forecast estimates
that the United States will have about 300 gigawatts of wind capacity by
2030, a 43 percent increase from the 2021 projection (Figure 5). For
context, this estimated capacity from solar and wind in 2030 would be
roughly double the total existing renewable capacity on the grid at the
end of 2022.

***Grid-scale energy storage deployment***

Energy storage is another essential component of a clean electricity
grid. Battery storage—either via grid-scale battery systems or an
aggregation of smaller batteries in a [virtual power
plant](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/virtual-power-plants#:~:text=Virtual%20power%20plants%2C%20generally%20considered,cleaner%20and%20more%20affordable%20power.)—enables
the storage of excess electricity from wind and solar power that can be
put back on the grid when it is needed the most, helping to reduce total
energy costs and accelerate decarbonization.

Incentives from the President’s Investing in America agenda are spurring
historic deployment of large-scale energy storage capacity. Following
the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
Reduction Act, forecasts show a dramatic expansion in expected storage
capacity, far outpacing previous estimates (Figure 6). Further,
deployment is already ahead of even the latest forecasts. Storage
capacity had increased nearly twelve-fold since the beginning of the
Administration, and, at the end of 2023, capacity was over 40 percent
higher than the 2023 forecast. Deployment is expected to advance even
further ahead of the forecast in 2024—about double the expected
deployment—if all planned projects come online. This would also
represent a near doubling of the *total* storage capacity on the grid
(Figure 7).

***Electric vehicle sales***

The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) can lower energy
costs, improve air quality, cut climate pollution, and reduce noise
pollution. Throughout the United States, it is
[cheaper](https://energyinnovation.org/2023/07/27/ev-fill-up-savings/)
to charge a vehicle using electricity than to fill it with gasoline. The
average EV in the United States produces [fewer
emissions](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/driving-cleaner) than the
average new gasoline-powered vehicle, even when accounting for the
current electricity mix of the U.S. grid. The Inflation Reduction Act is
[projected](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/DOE%20OP%20Economy%20Wide%20Report_0.pdf)
to double the share of clean electricity generation by 2030, further
lowering the total carbon footprint of current and future electric
vehicles as the grid becomes cleaner.

To reap the benefits of this technological innovation, the Investing in
America agenda includes a range of incentives designed to support the EV
industry. This includes investments to support EV and battery
manufacturing, funding to bolster and support a national network of EV
chargers, and consumer tax credits to lower the cost of purchasing an
EV. Private sector actors are responding to these incentives. Since the
beginning of 2021, firms have announced nearly [$180
billion](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov) in
investment to manufacture EVs and EV batteries—an 18 percent increase
since [December
2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/12/19/building-a-thriving-clean-energy-economy-in-2023-and-beyond/).

New EV models are offering consumers more options while bringing down
prices. Between 2021 and 2023, the number of EV
[models](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60321)
increased from 34 to 55, with
[14](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2023-ev-sales/) new
EV models in the last year alone. Further, since the beginning of the
Administration, the number of public EV charging ports has nearly
[doubled](https://driveelectric.gov/stations-growth?level_2=true&dc_fast=true&available=true&temporarily_unavailable=true&start_month=2021-01&end_month=2024-05)—with
about 1,000 new charging ports coming online each week.

[EV
sales](https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates)
have risen rapidly during this period, from roughly 20,000 sales per
month in 2019 and 2020, to over 95,000 per month in 2023 (Figure 8)—a
nearly five-fold increase. At the start of 2023, forecasters estimated
that beginning in 2026, more than one million EVs would be sold each
year, and by 2030, nearly 1.8 million EVs would be sold—more than five
times the forecast in 2021 (Figure 9). Actual sales have surpassed these
forecasts. More than one million EVs were sold in 2023—three years ahead
of the projections made earlier this year and 18 years ahead of the
projections made in the beginning of 2021.

## **Clean energy deployment builds a better economy for Americans.**

Manufacturing and deploying clean energy technologies enables the United
States to accelerate towards meeting the Biden-Harris Administration’s
climate goals. Doing so means reducing the [impacts of climate
change](https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/) by cutting emissions, while
also improving energy security and reliability and spurring equitable
economic growth. Some of these investments are
[spread](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/08/16/the-economics-of-public-investment-crowding-in-private-investment/)
out over a decade, meaning many of the associated
[benefits](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/14/the-economics-of-investing-in-america/)
will accrue over time. Forecasters’ estimates preview some of these
benefits to come.

First, more rapid deployment means more rapid progress towards
preventing and mitigating the impacts of climate change. According to
the most recent U.S. government
[forecast](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/US_BR_Voluntary_Suplement_2023.pdf#page=33),
U.S. emissions could fall nearly twice as much by 2030 compared to
before the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
were in place. To the extent that deployment is indeed faster than
originally anticipated, these emissions projections would improve even
more.

Second, deploying clean energy can improve U.S. energy security and
reliability while lowering
[energy](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3781)
[prices](https://escholarship.org/content/qt4d01m8vt/qt4d01m8vt.pdf).
According to the [U.S. Department of
Energy](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/DOE%20OP%20Economy%20Wide%20Report_0.pdf),
by 2030, the share of electricity from clean sources could grow to 80
percent—nearly twice the expected amount before the Inflation Reduction
Act passed. Strong growth in domestic clean energy industries supports
energy security, reliability, and supply chain resiliency while creating
good jobs. Deploying more clean electricity sources will provide
opportunities to increase energy system
[reliability](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79224.pdf) and
[security](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/74617.pdf) by reducing
overreliance on traditional fuel sources alone. Increased long-duration
energy storage capacity can also reduce outages and

[energy
reliability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435120303251).
Meanwhile, new technologies like [virtual power
plants](https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/LIFTOFF_DOE_VVP_10062023_v4.pdf)
and other distributed energy resources can improve overall grid
reliability. Similarly, the transition to electric vehicles can reduce
[U.S. consumers’
exposure](https://economics.ucsd.edu/events/economics-roundtable/UCSD-Buckberg-EV-Transition-and-Macroeconomic-Implications-09-14-2022.pdf)
to macroeconomic shocks from oil price volatility.

Third, investments in clean energy can contribute to long-term,
broad-based economic growth. In the aggregate, strong investments in
manufacturing construction are contributing to gross domestic product
(GDP) growth (Figure 10). In the latest data, private manufacturing
facility construction contributed 0.2 percentage points to the total 1.4
percent real 2024:Q1 growth. This is after three quarters of record
annual contribution to GDP growth since the U.S. government began
collecting these data in 1959.

A recent analysis by the [Clean Investment
Monitor](https://assets-global.website-files.com/64e31ae6c5fd44b10ff405a7/65dfcaebd76fc56445fd7375_Clean%20Investment%20Monitor%20-%20Q4%202023%20Update.pdf)
estimates that for fiscal year 2023, each dollar of public investment
from federal tax credits, grants, loans and loan guarantees may have
spurred at least $6 of private investment. In the long-run, these public
and private investments in clean energy are likely to pay for themselves
in terms of the benefits accrued. A [working
paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31615/w31615.pdf)
estimates that the production tax credit in the IRA will boost U.S. GDP
by lowering the cost of electricity, meaning it generates more benefits
than it is expected to cost—without even counting the benefits from
reduced carbon emissions and air pollution.

## Conclusion

In order to meet the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious climate
goals, the United States needs to deploy clean energy at an
unprecedented scale. To lower emissions across sectors like industry,
power generation, and transportation, there is a need for generational
investments in not only clean power generation but also related
technologies like grid-scale energy storage and electric vehicles.

President Biden’s Investing in America agenda responds to this need with
carefully designed incentives to mobilize [private sector
investments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/blog/2023/08/16/the-economics-of-public-investment-crowding-in-private-investment/),
including in clean energy technologies. At the macroeconomic level,
there is already strong evidence that private sector commitments are
translating into tangible construction projects to build new
manufacturing facilities.

In critical clean energy industries, the latest available data indicate
that the Investing in America agenda is enabling the United States to
outpace previous projections of the rate at which the country would move
towards its clean energy goals. Current data suggest the United States
is moving rapidly towards a clean energy economy, even faster than many
forecasts—both forecasts prior to the enactment of the President’s
agenda and, for some technologies, forecasts immediately after the
enactment of the agenda—had anticipated.

These investments will ultimately improve the economic and social
wellbeing of Americans. Together, these latest data show that roughly a
year since the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
Inflation Reduction Act, the President’s Investing in America agenda is
already generating benefits—economic and otherwise—to the American
people. Looking ahead, the latest forecasts suggest these investments
are mobilizing more activity than previously anticipated. Greater
manufacturing capacity and deployment of clean energy, energy storage,
and electric vehicles translate into lower greenhouse gas emissions,
improved energy security and reliability, and stronger economic growth.
