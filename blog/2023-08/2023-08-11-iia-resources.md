title: "Understanding the Economics of Investing in America: A Collection of\_Resources"
---
 
*Heather Boushey*, *Chief Economist, Investing in America Cabinet*

President Biden’s economic vision—Bidenomics—is about building the
economy from the middle out and the bottom up. It starts with
recognizing that in recent decades, the U.S. economy has seen rising
inequality, mounting costs from climate change, and economic shocks like
the pandemic and Great Recession. The pace of growth has been too slow
and has delivered uneven benefits across our society. Economic policies
have underestimated the importance of public investment for economic
growth, equity, and wellbeing.

The three pillars of Bidenomics—making smart investments in America,
empowering workers, and promoting competition to lower costs and help
small businesses—were born from mounting evidence of the magnitude of
these challenges. They are informed by a body of research that has shown
that growing the economy equitably requires rethinking certain core
economic assumptions, and instead expanding the productive capacity of
the American economy through evidence-backed government investments.
Taken together, these pillars will support strong, sustainable, and
shared economic growth.

This post provides resources on the first pillar—investing in
America—which is grounded in economic research about *what* investments
need to be made and *how* those investments should be implemented in
order to ensure sustained, equitable growth. The pillar includes
investments in building the clean energy economy, manufacturing
semiconductors domestically, and updating our infrastructure—all
designed to support the middle class and re-establish a strong economic
foundation in America, as opposed to benefitting those at the top and
hoping those benefits trickle down.

Working with Congress, the President has signed into law three historic
pieces of legislation to make this vision a reality—the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation
Reduction Act. Each aims to make the U.S. competitive in critical
industries and a leader in innovation and infrastructure.

Tracking the latest economic research and improving analytic data and
measurement tools are paramount to successfully implementing these
Bidenomics policies. In the coming weeks and months, we will share
additional resources to help track the research that informs our
policies, and the evidence for what has happened since they passed. This
post will be a living compilation of those resources—we invite you to
follow along and help us build a stronger, fairer economy for the
long-haul.

## I. An introduction to Investing in America

The Investing in America agenda is a series of investments in areas of
the economy that are critical for national and economic security but
underfunded by the private market, including infrastructure, clean
energy, and research and development.

-   [The Biden-Harris Economic
    Blueprint](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Biden-Economic-Blueprint-Report-720PM-MASTER-DOC.pdf)
    (September 2022) lays out the President’s economic plan to rebuild
    the economy from the bottom up and middle out in a way that (1)
    empowers workers, (2) makes it and builds it in America, (3) gives
    families breathing room, (4) makes American industry more
    competitive, less concentrated, and more resilient, and (5) rewards
    work, not wealth.
-   There are resources that lay out the core Investing in America
    legislation:
    -   The [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
        guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/guidebook/) is a
        roadmap to the infrastructure funding available, with
        program-by-program information.

    <!-- -->

    -   The [Inflation Reduction Act
        guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/)
        is an overview of the clean energy, climate mitigation and
        resilience, agriculture, and conservation-related tax incentives
        and investment programs.

    <!-- -->

    -   The [CHIPS Vision for
        Success](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/06/23/Vision%20for%20Success-Facilities%20for%20Semiconductor%20Materials%20and%20Mfr%20Equipment.pdf)
        provides detailed information about the program objectives
        across three categories: strengthening semiconductor supply
        chain resilience, advancing U.S. technology leadership, and
        supporting vibrant U.S. semiconductor manufacturing ecosystems.

## II. The economic rationale for Investing in America

The Investing in America agenda is grounded in economic evidence that
explains why we are investing in these specific areas of the economy and
why we are prioritizing people and places, fair markets, and strong
supply chains.

-   [The Economics of Investing in
    America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/14/the-economics-of-investing-in-america/)
    (July 2023) articulates the economic rationale for why the Investing
    in America agenda will spur stable, shared economic growth by
    investing in critical industries and infrastructure from the middle
    out and the bottom up.
-   President Joseph R. Biden made the case for Investing in America in
    his remarks on
    [Bidenomics](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/28/remarks-by-president-biden-on-bidenomics-chicago-il/)

Finally, central to our mission is tracking the progress of the
Investing in America agenda through the latest data and research. That
includes progress on ***empowering workers***, ***making and building it
in America***, ***giving families breathing room***, and ***making
America more competitive, less concentrated, and more resilient***.
[Invest.gov](https://invest.gov/) is a resource that maps the latest
private and public investments, and provides relevant economic data at
the national and state level.
