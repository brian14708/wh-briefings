title: "How the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration is Continuing to Promote Voting\_\
  Access"

*By Domestic Policy Advisor Susan E. Rice*

Today is National Voter Registration Day, when eligible Americans are
encouraged to register to vote, as well as confirm that they are
registered at the right address. The right to vote, and to have one’s
vote counted, are bedrock principles of our democracy. Since their first
days in office, President Biden and Vice President Harris they have
mobilized the entire federal government to strengthen our democracy and
protect voters from suppression and subversion. 

Unconscionably, state legislatures across the country have passed laws
that make it harder to vote. Recent Supreme Court rulings have made it
even harder to counter discrimination. To fight back against these
deeply disturbing attacks on voting rights, President Biden and Vice
President Harris have repeatedly urged the Senate to pass the Freedom to
Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act — including
calling for changing Senate rules to prevent a minority of Senators from
blocking action to protect this fundamental right.

In the meantime, the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to
using every tool at its disposal to protect the sacred right to vote. On
March 7, 2021, the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” President Biden
signed an executive order directing an all-of-government effort to
promote access to voting. Agencies are working to implement this order
and have recently taken the following steps:

-   The National Voter Registration Act, also known as the “motor-voter”
    law, requires entities like state motor vehicles offices to serve as
    **one-stop voter registration hubs**, ensuring that Americans are
    smoothly, conveniently, and accurately registered to vote in the
    right place when they are already filling out other government
    paperwork. President Biden’s Executive Order directed federal
    agencies, whenever practicable, to seek state designation as NVRA
    voter registration agencies. Now, for the first time ever, federal
    programs have been designated by states as voter registration
    agencies.
    -   Today, the **Department of Veterans Affairs** is announcing a
        pending partnership with three states to provide voter
        registration assistance and information to veterans and their
        families and caregivers while they access services at VA
        healthcare facilities. The Department is poised to accept
        designation as an NVRA Voter Registration Agency requested by
        Kentucky and Michigan, and will serve as a [Voter Registration
        Distribution
        Agency](https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220907-EO-2022-03-Final-Executed.pdf)
        in Pennsylvania to provide voter registration materials and
        information to veterans, their families, and caregivers.

    -   In May, Kansas designated the Haskell Indian Nations University,
        operated by the **Department of the Interior,** as an NVRA voter
        registration agency—the first federal program ever designated
        this way by a state. In July, followed by a formal proclamation
        in September, New Mexico designated Southwestern Indian
        Polytechnic Institute, also operated by Interior as a Bureau of
        Indian Education post-secondary institution, as an NVRA voter
        registration agency, making it the second federal program ever
        designated in this fashion. These designations will ensure that
        students at each institution of higher education are also able
        to register to vote — smoothly, accurately, and securely — at
        the same time as they enroll in school.
-   [**Vote.gov**](https://www.vote.gov) is launching an array of new
    language offerings, expanding information about voter registration
    and increasing accessibility to that information. Vote.gov now
    provides information in 10 languages other than English: Bengali,
    Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Hindi, Khmer, Korean, Spanish,
    Tagalog, Vietnamese, and — as the first of several forthcoming
    Native American and Alaska Native languages — Yup’ik. You can find
    more information about plans for making
    [vote.gov](https://www.vote.gov) more robust and user-friendly
    [here](https://vote.gov/promoting-access-to-voting/).
-   The **Department of Justice** has produced an [accessible,
    plain-language
    guide](https://www.justice.gov/voting/file/1507306/download) for 50
    states and the District of Columbia, which also describes each
    state’s voting rules for individuals with criminal convictions. The
    guide walks readers through a series of questions to help them
    understand how each state’s laws work and gives information about
    how to reach officials in a particular state to register to vote and
    to ask questions. The Department has also produced a [plain-language
    guide](https://www.justice.gov/file/1517936/download) to federal
    voting rights laws.  This guide provides basic information about the
    voter registration process, describes some rights available to
    voters under federal law, and identifies additional resources for
    voters seeking more information about how federal law protects the
    right to vote.
-   The **General Services Administration** has issued [guidance to
    managers of federally owned public
    buildings](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/real-property-policy/federal-meeting-facilities#vote),
    explaining the conditions under which federal space may be made
    available for nonpartisan voter registration drives by 501(c)(3)
    nonprofit organizations.
-   The **Department of** **Labor **recently reminded state workforce
    development agencies about its
    [guidance](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/advisories/training-and-employment-guidance-letter-no-08-21)
    and [technical
    assistance](https://www.workforcegps.org/events/2022/03/31/17/56/Overview-Providing-Access-to-Voting-Through-the-American-Job-Center-Network)
    to states seeking NVRA designation for American Job Centers and the
    other ways in which programs funded by the Department may assist
    with voter registration. The reminder further highlighted Indiana —
    which designated American Job Centers as voter registration agencies
    years ago — as an example to help others follow suit.

Agencies across the government will continue to implement President
Biden’s Executive Order using their own authorities, rolling out new
initiatives as they are ready, to promote information about the
electoral process and encourage electoral participation. Today and every
day, the Biden-Harris Administration is dedicated to making the voting
process smoother and more accessible for every eligible American.
