Women have been on the front lines of the response to the COVID-19
pandemic and economic crisis. Their labor — in hospitals and
laboratories, on farms and in factories, in stores and in homes — has
long been critical to keeping our nation running, and the past year has
made these contributions all the more visible. Women represent half of
all workers, yet they are [over 60
percent](https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf)
of our essential workers. Women of color are disproportionately
represented in frontline jobs and comprise [more than half of the
workers](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/04/23/483846/frontlines-work-home/)
in critical service fields such as housekeeping, personal care services,
and nursing assistance.

Our country’s caregiving crisis has compounded the effects of the
economic downturn; women have borne the brunt of increased caregiving
demands, contending with closed schools and child care centers and
caring for sick family members. And these challenges have been
particularly acute for essential workers and low-wage workers. The
impact is striking; over 2 million women have dropped out of the labor
force since February 2020. Nearly one year after the pandemic began, the
women’s labor force participation rate [reached its lowest point in more
than 30 years](https://nwlc.org/resources/january-jobs-day-2021/).

The American Rescue Plan (ARP) meets the moment – and provides immediate
relief for many Americans, including women of color, who so often are
the first fired and the last hired when a crisis hits. Just as women of
color were [finally starting to see wage
gains](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/business/economy/minority-women-hispanics-jobs.html)
from the 2009 recession, a new crisis threatened to erase that progress.
This is why President Biden made passing the American Rescue Plan his
top priority.

Thanks to the hard work of advocates, Congress, and the Biden-Harris
Administration, the American Rescue Plan is now law, delivering
much-needed support to women, families, and communities.

Several aspects of this relief are particularly critical to support
women of color as we build a more equitable economy. Here are a few to
highlight:

1.  More than 1 in 3 households, including half of Black and Latino
    households, are struggling to pay for basic expenses, like rent and
    groceries; **the American Rescue Plan provides immediate relief for
    working people**, helping hard-hit households recover from the
    economic impacts of the pandemic. The $1,400 direct payments to
    individuals, alongside the ARP’s increased tax credits, which help
    cover the cost of childcare and support low-wage workers, are
    critical to providing economic security for working women.
2.  **The expansion of the Child Tax Credit** allows more families to
    benefit, increases the size of the benefit, and distributes benefits
    monthly. Altogether, the American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty
    by more than half; poverty levels for Black children are expected to
    fall by 52%, by 45% for Hispanic children, and by 61% for Indigenous
    children.
3.  **An investment of $39 billion in child care will help thousands of
    child care providers**—who are disproportionately women of
    color—avoid potential closure, as well as ensure that they can
    operate safely and increase benefits for care workers.
4.  State and local aid to women’s economic security, particularly for
    women of color, is also a key part of this bill. **The relief that
    the ARP provides to state and local governments means fewer cuts in
    critical services** and it also means fewer layoffs for state and
    local workers. This particularly impacts women and people of color;
    women represent almost 60 percent of state and local public-sector
    workers, and the share of Black workers employed in the public
    sector [is higher than the
    share](https://www.epi.org/blog/cuts-to-the-state-and-local-public-sector-will-disproportionately-harm-women-and-black-workers/)
    in the private sector and the share in overall employment.
5.  Finally, we know that for a full and equitable economic recovery,
    our schools need to re-open, so that our children can return to the
    classroom and parents can get back to work. **The American Rescue
    Plan provides $130 billion to elementary, middle, and high schools,
    supplemented by a nationwide vaccination program that will allow our
    schools to reopen safely for families and educators.** These
    critical investments are the backbone of building back better for
    everyone.

This pandemic has exacerbated and shone a light on many issues—among
them the enormous economic barriers facing so many women, particularly
women of color, and the consequences of those barriers for them and for
our economy. The passage of the American Rescue Plan will bring relief
to so many women who have borne the brunt of the pandemic – and it will
be the first step in creating an economic recovery that removes barriers
for women of color, and gives every American a fair shot.
