#### HOW WORKING AMERICANS WILL RECEIVE THEIR DIRECT PAYMENTS

The House and Senate have passed the American Rescue Plan and President
Biden looks forward to signing it into law this week.

The Treasury and IRS are working to ensure that we will be able to start
getting payments out this month. And the IRS and Bureau of the Fiscal
Service are building on lessons learned from previous rounds of payments
to increase the number of households that will get electronic payments,
which are substantially faster than checks.

Here’s an overview of what the American people need to know about the
direct payments in the American Rescue Plan:

-   For households who have already filed their income tax return for
    2020, the IRS will use that information to determine eligibility and
    size of payments.
-   For households that haven’t yet filed for 2020, the IRS will review
    records from 2019 to determine eligibility and size of payment. That
    includes those who used the “non-filer portal” for previous rounds
    of payments.
-   For tax returns with direct deposit or bank account information, the
    IRS will be able to send money electronically. For those households
    for which Treasury cannot determine a bank account, paper checks or
    debit cards will be sent.

Here’s an example of what direct payments passed in the American Rescue
Plan mean for a typical family of four – with parents making $75,000 a
year combined, and with kids in school aged 8 and 5:

-   Because of the President’s American Rescue Plan, that family of four
    will soon be getting $5,600 in direct payments, $1,400 for each
    parent and child.
-   Because of the expanded Child Tax Credit, they will also get $2,600
    more in tax credits than before.

That’s $8,200 more in the pockets of this family as they try to weather
this storm – on top of additional money in this bill to reopen schools
safely, get shots in arms faster, and help those who have lost their
jobs through no fault of their own.
