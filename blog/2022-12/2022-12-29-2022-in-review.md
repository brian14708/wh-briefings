title: 2022 in Review
---
 
*By Ambassador Susan E. Rice*

I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling ‘22.

The past year undoubtedly brought its share of daunting challenges—from
Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine, to devastating hurricanes along the
Atlantic Coast and fires in the West, to stubbornly high inflation
around the globe.

Yet, 2022 also yielded remarkable progress for the American people.
Under President Biden’s leadership, the economy continued its historic
run, creating more than 10.5 million jobs since President Biden took
office. Inflation has shown signs of moderating. Thanks to the landmark
American Rescue Plan, we’ve continued to deploy $122 billion in funding
to enable schools to hire teachers, combat pandemic-related learning
loss, and support students’ mental health. We expanded and strengthened
the Affordable Care Act, making it possible for four out five people who
sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act to find
health care coverage for $10 a month or less and helping to drive the
uninsured rate to 8 percent—the lowest ever.

It was a year of historic accomplishments. President Biden signed the
landmark Inflation Reduction Act, making unprecedented investments in
clean energy, finally allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices,
setting a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket pharmacy costs, capping insulin in
Medicare at $35 per prescription per month, and requiring rebates when
drug prices increase faster than inflation. The President brought
together Democrats and Republicans to pass the most significant gun
safety legislation in nearly 30 years, securing hundreds of millions in
funding to prevent, interrupt, and reduce gun crime, including
unprecedented investments in community-led crime prevention and
intervention. President Biden also signed into law the PACT Act,
expanding access to health care and benefits related to toxic exposures
for veterans and their survivors, as well as the CHIPS and Science Act
to boost American manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, and create
jobs.

There was the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The
announcement of up to $20,000 in debt relief for Pell Grant recipients
and $10,000 for other borrowers whose incomes were under $125,000, a
move that could help more than 40 million borrowers. The Electoral Count
Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act to better protect our
democracy. Capping off the year, thousands of Americans gathered on the
White House South Lawn to celebrate as President Biden signed the
Respect for Marriage Act into law—a vital step forward for an
Administration that has done more to advance LGBTQI+ equality than any
before it.

It’s an impressive list by any measure. But, that’s only the tip of the
iceberg. For every high-profile bill signing on the South Lawn, there
have been dozens of other highly impactful executive actions, agency
regulations, and notable initiatives centered on delivering opportunity
for the American people. As we close out a remarkably productive year,
here are 12 Biden-Harris Administration achievements you might have
missed over the past 12 months:

1.  **Continued implementing a historic Day 1 Executive Order advancing
    equity and racial justice** across the entire federal government.
    This included releasing 90 agency equity action plans, containing
    over 300 commitments on issues ranging from maternal mortality to
    language access to environmental justice.
2.  **Signed a historic executive order to advance safe, effective, and
    accountable community policing to build public trust and strengthen
    public safety** by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to ban
    chokeholds, adopt stricter use-of-force policies, greatly restrict
    no-knock warrants, implement body-worn cameras, provide
    de-escalation and anti-racial profiling training, establish a
    national database of officer misconduct records, restrict military
    equipment transfers, and more. The order also directed federal
    agencies to provide training, technical assistance, and funding to
    support state and local law enforcement agencies in adopting the
    same measures.
3.  **Made progress on the President’s goal of increasing the share of
    federal contracting dollars awarded to small disadvantaged business
    (SDBs) by 50 percent by 2025.** In 2021, the Administration awarded
    a record level of contracting dollars to SDBs, with 2022 expected to
    set a new record.
4.  **Hosted the first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and
    Health in more than 50 years** and released a National Strategy to
    end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030. Over $8 billion
    in new private- and public-sector commitments were announced at the
    White House Conference.
5.  **Launched the Rural Partners Network** in 36 communities in 11
    states and territories, advancing a whole-of-government
    initiative—led by the Department of Agriculture and supported by
    more than 20 federal agencies and regional commissions—that places
    full-time federal staff on the ground to help local leaders navigate
    and access federal resources.
6.  **Made historic investments in Tribal Nations**, including more than
    $32 billion in the American Rescue Plan, $13 billion in the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and over $700 million in the
    Inflation Reduction Act specifically for Tribal Nations and Native
    communities. In addition, the Administration secured—for the first
    time in history— advance appropriations for the Indian Health
    Service, which will ensure a more predictable funding stream and
    improve health outcomes across Indian Country.
7.  **Hosted a historic United We Stand Summit to combat hate-fueled
    violence**, and announced a host of new federal and nonfederal
    deliverables, including the launch of the White House Initiative on
    Hate-Motivated Violence, the creation of an online clearinghouse of
    prevention resources, and over $1 billion in philanthropic
    commitments for unity-building activities.
8.  **Addressed our failed approach to marijuana by pardoning all
    federal and D.C. simple marijuana possession offenses**, urging
    governors to pardon state and local offenses, and starting the
    administrative process of the Departments of Justice and Health and
    Human Services reviewing how marijuana is scheduled.
9.  **Launched a whole-of-government mental health strategy** to address
    our nation’s mental health crisis and transform how we understand,
    access, and treat mental health in America, including the transition
    to the nationwide 988 suicide and crisis Lifeline. This includes
    increasing funding to community mental health organizations, school
    districts, and institutions of higher education to increase the
    number of school-based and community mental health professionals.
10. **Strengthened Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)** by
    defending DACA in court against ongoing attacks, issuing a
    Presidential Memorandum to preserve and fortify DACA, and releasing
    a final rule codifying the 2012 DACA policy.
11. **Reunified and provided support services to more than 570 families
    who were separated under the previous administration’s
    “zero-tolerance” policy**. Of the children who remained separated
    when President Biden took office, more than 70 percent of their
    families have been contacted and offered the opportunity to reunify.
12. **Proposed rules to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars**,
    which is projected to save as many as 654,000 lives, including up to
    238,000 Black Americans.

Across the board, the Biden-Harris Year Two record is a record of
results for the American people. It’s a record of taking on some of our
nation’s toughest challenges and delivering. That’s the spirit that
drove our Administration to success during 2022, and it’s the spirit
we’re carrying with us into 2023. Stay tuned.
