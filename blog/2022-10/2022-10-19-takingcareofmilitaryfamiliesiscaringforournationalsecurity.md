title: "Taking Care of Military Families is Critical for Our National\_Security"

Joining Forces

“Hardest worker in the room.” This expression shows up on t-shirts in
gyms on most military bases across our country. This past week, the
First Lady Dr. Jill Biden was able to spend some time connecting with
the Army’s 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) (1st SFC (A)), whom are
among some of the hardest workers in the Army, though admittedly I am
biased. 1st SFC (A) is made up of 11 units representing the Green
Berets, Psychological Operations, Civil Affairs, and Sustainment
Operations working in 70 different countries on any given day. These
units have shouldered a lion’s share of our national defense over the
past several decades; from the first Green Berets to enter Afghanistan
after 9/11, to the more than 3,000 men and women they have deployed
around the globe right now. Perhaps the most potent artifact of the work
they have put in over the last 20 years is the number of deployments
represented by those Dr. Biden met with last week at the 1st SFC (A)
Commanders Conference ….. 316.

Even more exceptional than the hundreds of deployments was the focus of
the conference and the foresight to invite the 20 spouses of the command
teams to attend as well. These spouses were valued participants and
thought partners, instrumental in helping 1st SFC (A) figure out how to
take care of their greatest asset- their people. Workshops, panels, and
roundtables on resiliency, family programming, manning, and talent
management highlighted the importance of military families as a national
security imperative. This ability to recognize that care of families is
directly linked to national security confirms that our SOF units are on
the cutting edge in more areas than just tactics.

Dr. Biden [shared her gratitude and
appreciation](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/14/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-first-lady-jill-biden-at-u-s-army-fort-benning/)
, specifically to the family members in the room. Afterwards, she went
table to table to speak with each command team to hear directly from
military spouses and soldiers about the challenges they are facing in
their formations.

If you will allow me a moment to reminisce– my E-6 self that just showed
up to my first Special Forces team 15 years ago, would have been proud
to call them my leaders. They went straight to the good stuff, sharing
about the struggles the families they lead are facing. They candidly
shared with Dr. Biden the issues they face around lack of childcare and
access to mental health providers, spouse employment, exceptional family
member benefits, and compensation concerns.

In my 20-plus years of serving in the military, I have been a part of
many a ‘dog and pony’ show, where we put on display all the great
stories or capabilities we have as a unit. I would always wonder, “do
these visits really matter? What will this visit change? The truth is, I
helped coordinate this visit for the First Lady, and I still wondered
“what would come of this visit? what will it change?” It was the next
day when the authenticity of the visit sunk in for me. I realized that
the statement, “I care about military families” was a very real
sentiment for Dr. Biden.

The indicators were already there, in my first month serving as a White
House Fellow with the Office of the First Lady, I have seen firsthand
the impact Joining Forces is having and the work the team puts in. But
it is a different story when the First Lady calls for an immediate
after-action meeting- citing her desire to make sure we didn’t waste the
time or valuable insights of the soldiers and spouses to whom she spoke.

After a full day of teaching at the community college, Dr. Biden
assembled her senior advisors and the Joining Forces team to ensure we
had a strategy to address the concerns that were raised. Many issues
raised aligned directly with the focus areas of the [Joining
Forces](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/joiningforces/) initiative . I walked
away from that AAR encouraged that we were not shying away from hard
problems, but instead facing them head on and working to support
military families, in big and small ways.
