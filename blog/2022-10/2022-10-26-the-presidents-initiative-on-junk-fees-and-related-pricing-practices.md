*The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action on junk fees that hurt
Americans’ pocketbooks and the economy.*

By: Brian Deese, Neale Mahoney, Tim Wu

Last month, at a meeting of the White House Competition Council,
President Biden [called
on](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/26/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-third-meeting-of-the-white-house-competition-council/)
all agencies to reduce or eliminate hidden fees, charges, and add-ons
for everything from banking services to cable and internet bills to
airline and concert tickets.  
   
These so called “junk fees” are not just an irritant – they can weaken
market competition, raise costs for consumers and businesses, and hit
the most vulnerable Americans the hardest.  
   
Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) [took new
actions](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-to-help-banks-avoid-charging-illegal-junk-fees-on-deposit-accounts/)
to effectively eliminate billions in banking fees – building on other
Biden-Harris Administration actions that are already saving consumers
billions more.  
   
On the occasion of today’s announcement, this blog provides context on
what junk fees are, why they are a concern, and what the Biden-Harris
Administration is doing to address them.  
   
**<u>Defining “junk” fees</u>**  
   
There is nothing wrong with a firm charging reasonable add-on fees for
additional products or services. In the interests of customization,
firms should be free to charge more to add mushrooms to your pizza or to
upgrade you to a hotel room with an ocean view. However, in recent years
we’ve seen a proliferation of “junk fees” – a category of fees that
serve a different purpose. They can be defined as fees designed either
to confuse or deceive consumers or to take advantage of lock-in or other
forms of situational market power.\[1\]   
   
Academic research and agency experience suggest the following fees and
fee practices fall within this category:

-   **Mandatory fees that often hide the full price.** Some sellers
    publish a low price and then add mandatory fees later, at the
    “back-end” of the buying process or when a consumer tries to
    terminate the service. [As the research
    shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268120301189),
    by hiding the full price, this practice can lead consumers to pay
    more than they would otherwise, and it also makes it hard for
    consumers to comparison shop. An example is the “service fees” added
    to the cost of a ticket to a concert or sporting event.
-   **Surprise fees that consumers learn about after purchase.**
    Surprise fees that consumers do not expect – and which may not be
    mandatory – similarly make it hard to comparison shop and can burden
    household finances. [Surprise hospital
    bills](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/708819?mobileUi=0)
    from out-of-network doctors at in-network hospitals and airline 
    [“family seating
    fees”](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/family-seating)
    are prominent examples.
-   **Exploitative or predatory fees.** Excessive fees that target
    consumers who have limited alternative options – because they are
    locked into a product or service, or are otherwise economically
    vulnerable – can likewise impose a financial burden. As the CFPB
    [explains](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/02/2022-02071/request-for-information-regarding-fees-imposed-by-providers-of-consumer-financial-products-or),
    a sign of exploitative fees is that they “far exceed the marginal
    cost of the service they purport to cover.” Bank overdraft fees,
    which greatly exceed the bank’s cost of credit, and surprise
    “[termination
    fees](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/07/ftc-takes-action-stop-payment-processor-first-american-trapping-small-businesses-surprise-exit-fees)”
    are leading examples.
-   **Fraudulent fees.** Some fees involve outright fraud or
    misrepresentations on the part of the seller. An example is
    advertising a “no fee” bank account that in practice carries
    [significant
    fees](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/07/ftc-takes-action-stop-payment-processor-first-american-trapping-small-businesses-surprise-exit-fees).
     

**<u>The economic issues with “junk fees”</u>**  
  
Markets work when firms compete on an even playing field – displaying
prices to consumers in a fair and transparent manner. Mandatory hidden
fees risk obscuring the full price, making it harder for consumers to
comparison shop – to choose their preferred product and the best deal.
These fees can also create an uneven playing field for businesses,
making firms that price in a fair and transparent manner seem more
expensive than their rivals.  
  
Surprise termination and cancellation fees can harm free and fair
competition by increasing [switching
costs](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2555402) – locking consumers into
sub-standard products. Larger switching costs also make it harder for
new entrants and more innovative firms to win over market share –
reducing market dynamism.

Actions that limit or disallow junk fees have the potential to create
more efficient markets by requiring firms to compete on the merits by
offering a lower (actual) price or a better product or service. In cases
where the junk fee is unjustified, banning the practice outright can
reduce firms’ incentives to engage in “[exploitative
innovation](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20140138)” –
developing new junk fees rather than improving the actual quality of the
product.  
  
*Junk Fees Hit Consumers* – *and Businesses* – *in the Pocketbook*  
  
Fees account for [tens of billions of dollars in
revenue](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-launches-initiative-to-save-americans-billions-in-junk-fees/)
– a substantial source of revenue in many industries, including
transportation, banking, internet, and hospitality. A sampling of some
fee categories where junk fees appear to make up significant fee revenue
include:

Studies also show that these fees can artificially inflate total prices.
In highly competitive markets where firms earn razor-thin margins, junk
fees may not raise the total amount consumers pay. The reason is that
firms will face competitive pressure to offset junk fee revenue with a
lower upfront price. However, many markets are *not* highly competitive,
and in these settings, junk fees can cause American consumers to pay
more.  
  
A large body of evidence shows that mandatory fees charged at the
back-end of the buying process – sometimes referred to as “drip” prices
– along with other types of junk fees make it harder to comparison shop.
This causes consumers to underestimate the total price of what they’re
buying, often increasing total payments. Among other findings:

-   An experimental study by [Rasch et al.
    (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268120301189)
    found that drip pricing raised firm profits and resulted in
    consumers paying more than they would if firms were required to
    charge a single all-inclusive price up front. A series of
    experimental studies by [Santana et al.
    (2020)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2019.1207)
    similarly found that drip prices caused consumers to pick products
    with higher total costs.
-   An empirical study by [Ellison and Ellison
    (2009)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA5708) of
    online sales of computer parts found that sellers used hidden fees
    to obfuscate actual prices and avoid price competition.
-   A study by [Agarwal et al.
    (2014)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/677856)
    found that fee regulation can lower total costs if the fee is
    unclear – as is the case with drip pricing and other hidden fees –
    and the market is not perfectly competitive. 
-   An empirical paper by [Agarwal et al.
    (2015)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19484) found that regulation of
    credit card fees saved consumers $11.9 billion per year in borrowing
    costs, with the largest impact on the lowest credit score
    borrowers. 

Confusing or coercive fee practices risk harming not only consumers, but
also [small and medium-sized
businesses](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/07/ftc-takes-action-stop-payment-processor-first-american-trapping-small-businesses-surprise-exit-fees),
which can be targeted by the same kind of fee schemes – including
[surprise fees and unexpected cancellation
charges](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/07/ftc-takes-action-stop-payment-processor-first-american-trapping-small-businesses-surprise-exit-fees).
For example, common carrier industries – industries that provide
essential services to dependent businesses – like ocean carriers
sometimes use hidden and confusing fee practices to muddy the prices
paid. Some shippers that rely on ocean carriers to ship their goods to
market
[report](https://www2.fmc.gov/readingroom/docs/22-04/22-04_Comments_MICA_NAMI_USMEF.pdf/)
that unpredictable fees added to a base price more than doubled the
total price they paid for ocean shipping, and these costs are often
ultimately passed along to consumers.  
  
*Junk Fees Hit Low-Income Households and People of Color the Hardest*  
  
While *the extra costs of* junk fees affect everyone, they
disproportionately impact lower income households and people of color.
For example:   

-   A [CFPB
    study](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_credit-card-late-fees_report_2022-03.pdf)
    found that consumers in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods
    paid disproportionately more in credit card late fees.  
-   A [survey by the Financial Health
    Network](https://finhealthnetwork.org/amid-resurgence-of-interest-in-overdraft-new-data-reveal-how-inequitable-it-can-be/)
    found low- to moderate-income households incurred overdraft fees at
    nearly twice the rate of high-income households and that Black and
    Hispanic households were charged overdraft fees at substantially
    higher rates than white households.  
-   A [2017
    report](https://www.nclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/auto_add_on_rpt.pdf)
    by the National Consumer Law Center found that Hispanic car buyers
    paid more in costly add-ons – such as service contracts, insurance,
    and window etching – than non-Hispanic car buyers. 

**<u>The Biden-Harris Administration is Taking Action on Junk
Fees</u>**  
  
In response to President Biden’s call to action, all Competition Council
federal agencies are looking for ways to reduce or lower junk fees.
While in some cases more work is needed to identify and understand
unjustified practices, federal agencies are acting now in places where
there is a compelling case to reduce or eliminate fees – and taking
comment and engaging stakeholders where greater transparency and data
will help to improve regulatory approaches going forward. To date, the
Administration has already taken a number of actions that will save
consumers and businesses billions of dollars:

-   **Eliminating unfair banking fees**. Today, the [CFPB issued
    guidance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-to-help-banks-avoid-charging-illegal-junk-fees-on-deposit-accounts/)
    explaining that two junk fee practices are unfair and unlawful –
    effectively banning both. First, the CFPB is making clear that
    surprise overdraft fees are unlawful. These are fees charged for
    overdrawing a checking account even though at the time the account
    owner made a purchase, the bank’s website or ATM terminal showed the
    customer that they had sufficient available funds for the purchase.
    Second, the CFPB is making clear that surprise depositor fees are
    unlawful. These are fees charged to customers who deposit someone
    else’s bounced check, penalizing the victim. Together, these actions
    will save consumers more than $1 billion annually.
-   **Additional CFPB actions on bank and credit card fees**. The CFPB
    is developing rules and guidance on other fees charged by banks and
    credit card companies. These fees cost consumers more than $24
    billion a year combined, with the biggest impacts on low-income
    Americans. This builds on work CFPB began last year that
    successfully encouraged [15 of the nation’s twenty largest banks to
    drop the use of NSF
    charges](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-chart_2022-07.pdf),
    and
    [Citi](https://online.citi.com/US/JRS/portal/template.do?ID=Citi-Overdraft-Fees-Change)
    and [Capital
    One](https://www.capitalone.com/about/newsroom/eliminating-overdraft-fees/)
    ended the use overdraft fees altogether. As a result, the overall
    level of overdraft fees is already on track to be down [20% in 2022
    from 2019
    levels](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/banks-overdraft-nsf-fee-revenues-evolve-along-with-their-policies/)
    – $3 billion less compared to pre-pandemic.
-   **Taking aim at bad junk fee practices that span industries**. [Last
    week](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/unfair-or-deceptive-fees-trade-regulation-rule-advance-notice-proposed-rulemaking-16-cfr-part-464),
    the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
    [voted](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/10/federal-trade-commission-explores-rule-cracking-down-junk-fees)
    to launch a rulemaking process that would broadly reduce junk fee
    practices across the economy, including for event ticketing, hotels,
    funeral homes, and any other industry that uses mandatory fees. The
    rulemaking would address practices such as charging consumers fees
    they never consented to or charging mandatory fees with little or no
    added value, like hotel resort fees or event ticket processing fees.
    This action is an important step towards a future rule that would
    give the FTC additional information and enforcement tools to take
    action and seek penalties against companies adopting unfair and
    deceptive junk fees. This action builds upon the FTC’s work bringing
    multiple enforcement actions challenging junk fees across a variety
    of industries and returning money to injured consumers. In the auto
    industry, the FTC charged dealerships like [Passport
    Auto](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2018/10/washington-dc-area-car-dealerships-marketing-firm-settle-deceptive-advertising-charges)
    and
    [Napleton](https://ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/04/ftc-takes-action-against-multistate-auto-dealer-napleton-sneaking-illegal-junk-fees-bills)
    for tacking on junk fees for unwanted add-ons and other items. FTC
    took action against [Benefytt
    Technologies](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/08/ftc-action-against-benefytt-results-100-million-refunds-consumers-tricked-sham-health-plans-charged)
    to halt its practice of charging people separate fees for add-on
    health products that people didn’t know about or want. In [First
    American Payment
    Systems](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/07/ftc-takes-action-stop-payment-processor-first-american-trapping-small-businesses-surprise-exit-fees),
    the FTC charged that the payment processing company trapped small
    businesses with surprise early termination fees.
-   **Restricting Junk Fees Charged by Auto Dealers**. This June, the
    Federal Trade Commission (FTC) [issued a proposed rule
    that](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/06/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-junk-fees-bait-switch-tactics-plaguing-car-buyers)
    would restrict junk fee practices by car dealers that are costly and
    frustrating for consumers. The rule, if finalized, would (1) ban
    bait-and-switch claims by prohibiting dealers from making deceptive
    advertising claims to lure in prospective car buyers; (2) prohibit
    fraudulent add-on products (such as “nitrogen filled” tires that
    contain no more nitrogen than normal air); (3) prevent dealers from
    charging consumers surprise fees for an add-on without their clear,
    written consent; and (4) mandate upfront disclosure of costs and
    conditions by requiring dealers to make disclosures to consumers
    like proving a “true offering price” for a vehicle. 
-   **Requiring Airlines and Airline Search Sites to Disclose Fees Up
    Front**. In September, the Department of Transportation (DOT)
    [proposed a
    rule](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AirlineAncillaryFeeNPRM)
    that would protect travelers by ensuring they know the full price of
    airline tickets before they buy. The rule, if finalized as proposed,
    will require airlines and online search sites to disclose up front –
    while you are comparison shopping – any fees to sit next to your
    child, for baggage, and for changes or cancellations. The proposal
    seeks to provide customers the information they need to choose the
    actual best deal, preventing surprise fees that add up quickly and
    prevent competition on the basis of price. This builds on previous
    actions the DOT has recently taken, including issuing proposed rules
    that would [require
    airlines](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/notice-proposed-rulemaking-nprm-refunding-fees-delayed)
    to refund fees for checked bags that are significantly delayed and
    for services not actually provided (like broken WiFi), and [to
    require
    refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2022-08/Airline%20Ticket%20Refund%20NPRM%20-%202022-08-03.pdf)
    for delayed and cancelled flights.
-   **Requiring Broadband Nutrition Labels**. The Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) has [issued proposed
    rules](https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandlabels) that would, if finalized
    as proposed, require internet companies to display a standardized
    “Broadband Nutrition Label” that discloses their monthly prices,
    fees, and internet speeds – so customers can see which company is
    cheapest and companies will have to compete for business. The FCC
    anticipates completing this rulemaking by the end of this year.
-   **Reducing the Cost of Shipping Goods**. Congress responded to
    President Biden’s call to crack down on excessive fees in ocean
    shipping by passing the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act. The
    Federal Maritime Commission, which is responsible for implementing
    the law, recently released [a proposed
    rule](https://www.regulations.gov/document/FMC-2022-0066-0090) that
    proposes to bring more clarity, structure, and punctuality to ocean
    shipping fee billing practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[1\] In its recent [Advance Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/R207011UnfairDeceptiveFeesANPR.pdf),
the Federal Trade Commission defines “junk fees” as “unfair or deceptive
fees that are charged for goods or services that have little or no added
value to the consumer, including goods or services that consumers would
reasonably assume to be included within the overall advertised price;
the term also encompasses ‘hidden fees,’ which are fees for goods or
services that are deceptive or unfair, including because they are
disclosed only at a later stage in the consumer’s purchasing process or
not at all, whether or not the fees are described as corresponding to
goods or services that have independent value to the consumer.”
