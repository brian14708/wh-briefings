Retailers have spent the past few months moving a record number of goods
into the country with the help of longshore workers, truck drivers,
railroad and warehouse workers. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach—which handle 40 percent of the country’s containerized
imports—have moved 17 percent more containers between January and
mid-October than they did in 2018, which held the previous record.
Simply put, the transportation supply chain is going to move more goods
this year than ever before, which has helped store shelves [essentially
recover to or even
exceed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/11/03/improving-and-tracking-supply-chains-link-by-link/)
their pre-pandemic states.

This historic throughput has led to challenges for importers and
exporters including retailers as they work through their busiest season
ever and farmers trying to get products to foreign markets. Which is why
we’ve been on the case.

Last month, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and International
Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) workers joined together to commit
to shift towards 24/7 operations, aimed at boosting both throughput and
efficiency at our nation’s ports. [Some of the countries’ largest
companies](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/576463-white-house-says-walmart-fedex-ups-will-move-to-24-7-model-to-address) joined
in as well, committing to move more containers during off-peak hours.
Both major railroads responsible for moving goods out of the ports,
[BNSF](https://www.bnsf.com/news-media/customer-notifications/notification.page?notId=bnsf-continues-ocean-container-incentive-program-at-los-angeles-hubs-initiative-to-support-on-going-supply-chain-recovery)
and [Union
Pacific](https://www.up.com/media/releases/211025-supply-chain-congestion.htm),
announced discounts to customers on each container moved by rail during
the weekend and Union Pacific also decided to operate its station near
the ports 24/7. Port Envoy Porcari has also been leading thrice weekly
meetings with terminal operators, shipping lines, and other key
stakeholders to identify operational problems and immediate solutions at
the two ports.

Our actions to facilitate practical problem solving and collaboration
between each link in the goods movement chain is starting to show some
early returns:

-   **Driving Down “Dwell Times”:**
    -   One of the key challenges to restoring velocity and fluidity to
        the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach has been the shrinking
        amount of space on the ports themselves. While the ports have
        handled 17 percent more imported containers so far this year
        compared to the previous record, the amount of space available
        to store containers is fixed – it has not expanded 17 percent
        nor has the amount of land in the Southern California warehouse
        system. This has led to containers piling up at the ports, which
        slows the entire system down –  less space to move containers
        between docks and ships, less space for trucks to maneuver, and
        fewer chassis available because containers are sitting on them.
    -   The [average number of
        days](https://www.pmsaship.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/September-2021-Container-Dwell-Time-Press-Release.pdf)
        a container spends on the docks has crept up this year, to an
        average of around six days in September 2021 from under three
        days pre-pandemic.
    -   Successfully reducing this “dwell time” figure is key to
        restoring velocity to the ports. The first step to reducing
        dwell time was taken by the ports two weeks ago when they
        announced that they would begin assessing congestion fees on the
        ocean carriers for containers that dwell on the docks for too
        long.
    -   We are now seeing the payoff of that  initiative: ***<u>in just
        one week, the number of containers that have been dwelling on
        the docks for at least nine days has fallen over twenty percent
        according to data provided by the ports</u>***. This is an
        early, but promising sign that each link in the chain is working
        together to help more goods leave the ports, and to free up more
        space on the ports.

-   **Waiving Fees for Night & Weekends**: 
    -   Currently, truck drivers pay a fee to enter the ports to pick up
        cargo. This system, known as Pier Pass, was originally designed
        to incentivize off peak hours and reduce emissions. However, in
        recent years the terminal operators who run Pier Pass had
        converted it to a flat fee.
    -   The terminal operators have been considering changing the system
        to create a financial incentive for trucks to use night and
        weekend hours. If they move forward, their proposal would waive
        the current fee during nights and weekends for the remainder of
        the shipping high season.
    -   By getting more containers picked up during the lower-traffic
        nights and weekends, trucks would move containers off the docks
        more efficiently and produce less emissions in the surrounding
        communities. To be most impactful, terminal operators would need
        to also fully staff the nighttime and weekend shifts so truck
        drivers can make effective use of the no-fee period.

-   **New Retailers join the effort:**
    -   We are also seeing additional retailers join the move towards
        off-peak operations. Toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker has
        committed to moving 33 percent of its Los Angeles and Long Beach
        cargo during the off-peak while clothing retailer Gap Inc. has
        committed to a 15 percent increase. They join our other
        partners—Walmart, Target, FedEx, UPS, Home Depot, and Samsung—in
        supporting a shift towards a 24/7 system. Commitments like this
        help send a critical demand signal to the rest of the chain to
        increase hours and efficiency.

-   **Reducing congestion at the Port of Savannah**:
    -   Ports in both the East and West Coast are experiencing record
        setting levels of volume. The Port of Savannah, the fourth
        largest container port in the U.S., has also seen a surge in the
        number of ships at sea and containers to process. The Georgia
        Port Authority, with support from the Department of
        Transportation, will have over $8 million available to establish
        five pop-up container yards in Georgia and North Carolina. These
        five yards, accessible by rail and truck, can accommodate more
        than 500,000 containers over the course of a year or the
        equivalent of 27 “mega container ships. The Department of
        Transportation will support the Port of Savannah, and other
        ports seeking to solve current supply chain disruptions, by
        providing new flexibility in existing grants.

The progress over the last couple weeks means that a goods movement
system that has been working in overtime is also starting to function
more efficiently, making it easier to get goods from ship to shelf to
your front door, as well as help exporters get their goods to market.
But we cannot lose sight of the fact that we have underinvested in this
system for decades. That is why the recent passage of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Deal is so important. Not only does it include $17
billion for our ports, but it also will help improve efficiency, reduce
costs, and decrease emissions in the movement of goods from dock to rail
and rail to truck. And this comes *on top* of a $5 billion agreement
between the U.S. Department of Transportation and the state of
California to support port and inland improvements in this critical
freight node. Altogether these investments will create good paying jobs
and help strengthen U.S. competitiveness for decades to come, making our
supply chains more resilient against future shocks.
