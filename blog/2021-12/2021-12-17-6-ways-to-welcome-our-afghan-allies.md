As we count our blessings while gathered with family this holiday
season, among them will be the many Americans – from all walks of life
and corners of the country – who have come together to provide a warm
and dignified welcome to our Afghan allies arriving in the United
States.  

Since August, Operation Allies Welcome, the whole-of-America effort to
evacuate and resettle Afghans in the United States, has helped welcome
nearly 43,000 Afghans to 46 states across America. Those who remain on
U.S. military “safe havens” are eagerly looking forward to joining them
soon and creating futures for their families with safety, freedom, and
opportunity.

We’ve had the privilege of hearing their stories. They are translators,
Afghan veterans, humanitarian workers, journalists, women’s rights
activists and others who put themselves in harm’s way to support peace,
security and justice in Afghanistan alongside the U.S. mission there.
Their courage is awe-inspiring, and each of their journeys here have not
been easy. 

It’s been equally inspiring to see the outpouring of support that has
come from every corner of our country. Veterans, servicemembers,
faith-based organizations, state and local officials, businesses,
resettlement agencies, Afghan-Americans, community-based organizations
and the refugee community across America have led the way to volunteer,
marshal resources, and give our new neighbors the safe and dignified
welcome they deserve. 

In the spirit of the season, we’d like to offer a few ways to join in
supporting our Afghan allies and ensuring they will always remember
Americans’ generous and warm welcome. Through the [Welcome.US
website](https://welcome.us/), you can:

1.  **Donate to your local resettlement organization or sign up to
    volunteer. **Welcome.US hosts a [one-stop
    shop](https://welcome.us/opportunities) where you can search by zip
    code and find organizations in your community supporting Afghans to
    rebuild their lives, or give to the [Welcome
    Fund](https://welcome.us/welcomefund), which collects, coordinates,
    and directs resources from donors to community groups supporting our
    new Afghan neighbors. 
2.  **Donate your unused airline miles to cover the cost of an Afghan
    family’s flight to their new home.** Nothing says welcome like
    paying for the flight home. We are [working with airlines and
    non-profit partners to raise 1 billion
    miles](https://welcome.us/miles) to ensure that every single one of
    our new neighbors has a free flight home. 
3.  **Sign up to donate temporary housing. **Our new neighbors are
    arriving in the midst of a tight housing market. Visit the
    Welcome.US website to find out how you can offer temporary housing
    to Afghan families arriving in your community.  
4.  **Help meet needs on the Welcome Exchange.** If you own a business,
    find out how you can help meet needs for household supplies and baby
    products. [The Welcome Exchange](https://welcome.us/exchange) hosts
    needs community organizations have posted for furniture, household
    and personal hygiene products, diapers, baby formula, and more.
    Let’s make sure no need goes unmet.
5.  **Offer a job.** All Afghans who have resettled in the U.S. receive
    employment authorization which enables them to immediately go to
    work. Refugees have an incredible history of achieving
    self-sufficiency and giving back to their communities, most within
    180 days. Employers can [go to Welcome.US to post job
    openings](https://manpowergroup.avature.net/welcomeuspostjobs) of
    all types.
6.  **Form a Sponsor Circle to host an Afghan family in your
    community. **Groups of five or more community members can directly
    sponsor refugees through the [Sponsor Circles
    initiative](https://www.sponsorcircles.org/). Sponsor Circles
    receive guidance and advice on what Afghans arrivals will need, and
    take on tasks like finding initial housing, stocking the pantry,
    connecting children to school, providing initial financial support
    and helping adults to find employment. 

Across the United States, Americans are already embracing the
opportunity to welcome our new Afghan neighbors with a generous spirit
and open arms, giving thanks to our Afghan Allies through their
countless acts of welcome. Their actions are deeply inspiring, and
revealing to our Afghan friends the best of America. We give thanks to
them and to our new Afghan neighbors, and hope you will join them in
offering our warmest welcome to the United States.
