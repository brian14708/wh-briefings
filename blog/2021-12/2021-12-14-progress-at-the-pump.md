title: "Progress at the\_Pump"
---
 
The President understands that gasoline prices squeeze families’
budgets. That’s why he has taken a series of bold actions to save
Americans money at the pump.  The President announced a historic release
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in parallel with other countries to
help address the imbalance between the supply and demand of oil and to
spur greater competition in the gasoline market. And, the President
asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether illegal conduct
is costing families at the pump.  

Industry costs have declined as crude oil and wholesale gasoline prices
have receded. Instead of oil and gas companies padding their profits,
Americans should see falling prices. We are starting to see results at
the pump: 

**The average price at the pump is down nearly 10 cents per gallon since
the peak last month, and prices are continuing to fall.  **

And, the price of gasoline on the wholesale market has fallen even more
than that over recent weeks, dropping over 30 cents per gallon since its
peak.  The President expects those savings to be passed on to Americans
as quickly as possible. To date, it hasn’t been happening fast enough.
That’s why the President asked the Federal Trade Commission to examine
mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies
that keeps prices elevated.

The average price at the pump is now $3.32. **This price is in line with
the real price of gasoline over the previous ten years from
2011-2020**.  While current price levels aren’t unprecedented, the
President believes that they are too high especially given that we are
emerging from a once-in-a-century pandemic.

Finally, while the national average price of gasoline is $3.32, in many
states it is significantly less than that. The national average
incorporates states where, for geographic and state-specific reasons,
gasoline prices have historically been high. Americans in other states
are paying much less at the pump.  Right now, twenty states have
state-level averages below $3.15.  That puts those states below both the
10-year real average of $3.30 per gallon and also below the 20-year real
average of $3.18 per gallon. That number is increasing week by week,
with only 12 states below that threshold a month ago.
